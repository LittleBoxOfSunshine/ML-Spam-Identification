DNC Statement on Nevada Democratic Party Letter

WASHINGTON =96 DNC [Chair or spokesperson] today issued the following state=
ment on a letter from the Nevada Democratic Party regarding threatening and=
 violent behavior among some participants around their state party conventi=
on this weekend:



=93We are deeply concerned about the troubling details laid out in the lett=
er from the Nevada Democratic Party. We are immediately reaching out to the=
 leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democrat=
ic Party in denouncing the type of behavior on display over the weekend in =
Las Vegas. Our democracy is undermined any time threats, intimidation, phys=
ical violence or damage to property are present. If there are legitimate co=
ncerns, they must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner.



=93We are also asking both campaigns to be forthright in their characteriza=
tion of the primary process. In Nevada on Saturday, the state party=92s cre=
dentials committee was made up of an equal number of members representing b=
oth campaigns. The proceedings were appropriately managed, open to the publ=
ic, transparent, and inclusive. The process for nominating a Democratic Pre=
sidential candidate is not something taken lightly, it is a four-year endea=
vor that is closely scrutinized and determined in public forums just as it =
has been in past election cycles. There is no excuse for what happened in N=
evada, and it is incumbent upon all of us in positions of leadership to spe=
ak out.=94
