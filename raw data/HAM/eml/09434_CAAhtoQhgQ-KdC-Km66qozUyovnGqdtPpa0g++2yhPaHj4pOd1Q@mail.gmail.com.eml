Trump Rebukes Top Ally Amid Ongoing Push For Warmer Relations With Putin,
Russia

Nobody is better at proving that Donald Trump's foreign policy would be
disastrous than Donald Trump himself.

With one short interview <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVMrkYmOnMdg> on
ITV's Good Morning Britain, Trump set off a media firestorm in the UK,
stoking fears about the potential fraying of our decades-long special
relationship, and what that would mean for the UK's national security and
standing in the world:

On Prime Minister David Cameron: "It looks like we are not going to have a
very good relationship. Who knows."

On London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who called his Muslim ban ignorant: "Let's take
an I.Q. test.... I don't care about him... I think they're very rude
statements, and frankly, tell him, I will remember those statements."

On the European Union: "In terms of Britain, I would say, what do you need
it for?"

Trump continues to demonstrate that his reckless, shoot-from-the-hip
approach to foreign policy would make the country and the world far less
safe. He casts aside our most important allies when their leaders criticize
his dangerous proposals, and heaps praise on our adversaries if they say a
kind word about him.


Most notably, Trump continues to express his admiration for Vladimir Putin,
pushing for warmer relations with Russia:

Donald Trump, 5/7/16
<https://twitter.com/ericbradner/status/729036730402279426>: "When people
like me, I like them =E2=80=94 even Putin. ... And by the way, wouldn't it =
be nice
if we actually got along with Russia?"

Brookings Institution's Thomas Wright
<https://twitter.com/thomaswright08/status/732214353273851905>: "So Trump
is now on the record saying he expects to have a good relationship with
Russia and a bad relationship with the UK."

Simply put, this is not a man who has the temperament or the steady hand to
be our commander-in-chief. Check out the reaction in the UK to Trump's
alarming comments about our ally, as well as the latest updates on his love
affair with Putin below.


Reaction to Trump=E2=80=99s UK comments:

Tony Blair's Director of Political Operations, John McTernan
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/16/donald-trump-might-kill-the-spe=
cial-relationship-thats-no-laughi/>:
Donald Trump might kill the 'special relationship'. That's no laughing
matter for Britain

"So, the first casualty of a Trump presidency would be the specialness of
the special relationship.... at a very deep level, ours is a defence
relationship with the United States. The shared language, history and
values are important, but the nuts and bolts are the inter-operability of
equipment and the joint deployment of forces. And at the very heart lies
the Mutual Defence Agreement (MDA) - over 50 years of co-operation on
nuclear weapons.... there is no doubt that Trump is not just a threat to
the special relationship =E2=80=93 he would be the end of it. It would not =
just be
the fractious personal relationship =E2=80=93 there is no conceivable Briti=
sh prime
minister who would be able to fake respect for Trump's intellect and
strategic insight. It is, fundamentally, what a Trump victory would mean: a
triumph for nativism and isolationism.... President Trump would change
everything. It is no laughing matter for us."

Trump warns of poor relationship with Cameron over PM's refusal to withdraw
'divisive, stupid and wrong' comment

"Donald Trump has issued a warning to David Cameron that the two may not
have a good relationship if Mr Trump becomes the next US president. The US
Republican presidential hopeful was responding to comments Mr Cameron made
last year over Mr Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US. The
prime minister called the idea 'divisive, stupid and wrong' and his since
refused to withdraw those comments."

Financial Times
<https://next.ft.com/content/11a22b72-1b51-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122>: What
would Donald Trump mean for the US-UK special relationship?

"Donald Trump has done it again. Just as it appeared that he was toning
down some of his extreme views and becoming a more conventional Republican
presidential candidate, he has lobbed a missile at David Cameron.... All
told, it is hard to find a mainstream British politician who has anything
but a negative view of Mr Trump... This is not, of course, merely a UK
issue. South Korea and Japan are among those Asian countries concerned
about what Mr Trump would mean for their foreign policies. European leaders
are worried that he will continue to stoke populist, anti-Muslim
sentiments. If Mr Trump visits these shores in a political capacity, it
seems certain that he will not be welcomed with open arms."

BBC <http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36299929>: Donald Trump challenges Sadiq
Khan to IQ test

"Donald Trump has challenged the new London mayor to an IQ test after Sadiq
Khan said he was ignorant. Mr Khan was responding to Mr Trump's stance on
Muslims that they should banned from entering America. Speaking in an
interview with Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain, he also warned he may
not have a 'very good relationship' with UK Prime Minister David Cameron if
he wins the US presidency."

"Donald Trump has warned that he may not have a 'very good relationship'

Trump says unlikely to have good relationship with UK's Cameron

"Donald Trump said he was unlikely to have a good relationship with David
Cameron because the British prime minister cast the U.S. presidential
candidate as 'divisive, stupid and wrong' for proposing a temporary ban on
Muslims entering the United States.... Cameron's spokesman said the prime
minister stood by his original comments. The United States is Britain's
closest ally. U.S. companies are the biggest foreign direct investors in
Britain and the so- called 'special relationship' with Washington has been
the cornerstone of British diplomacy since World War Two. Trump's often
controversial comments on everything from Muslims and women to the future
of NATO and relations with Russia have drawn criticism from Berlin, Paris
and other European capitals."

"When asked whether Mr Cameron was concerned about Mr Trump's suggestion, a
Downing Street spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister has made his views on
Donald Trump's comments very clear. He disagrees with them, and I haven't
got anything further to add. He continues to believe that preventing
Muslims from entering the US is divisive, stupid and wrong.' The spokesman
added that the PM was 'committed to maintaining the special relationship'
whoever wins the presidential election in November."

great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected
