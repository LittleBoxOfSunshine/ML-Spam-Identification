THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 13, 2016

**

*FACT SHEET ON U.S.-NORDIC COLLABORATION ON ***

*CLIMATE CHANGE, THE ARCTIC, AND CLEAN ENERGY*



Today, the leaders of the United States, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norwa=
y, and Sweden marked another major milestone in their leadership in the f=
ight against climate change with the release of a U.S.- Nordic Leader Sum=
mit Joint Statement. The Statement builds on a history of collaboration a=
nd reinforces commitments made on climate change and the Arctic in 2013 [=
 https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/09/04/joint-statement-k=
ingdom-denmark-republic-finland-republic-iceland-kingdo ]. In the Joint S=
tatement released today, leaders recognize that climate change is one of =
the foremost challenges the world is facing. In particular, the leaders r=
einforce that no effort should be spared in making concrete progress dome=
stically and abroad over the coming decades by shifting to low carbon eco=
nomies and creating more resilient communities. The statement reflects co=
operation across a number of areas including showing leadership in the Ar=
ctic, implementing the Paris Agreement, promoting clean energy cooperatio=
n, advancing climate action globally, and promoting energy access. Todays=
 statement is another indication of the United States commitment to Paris=
 and to do everything we can within our borders and beyond to take ambiti=
ous actions to address climate change.



*"The Arctic: "*The science of climate change in the Arctic is increasing=
ly clear. Temperatures are rising about twice as fast as the global avera=
ge; thawing permafrost destabilizes the earth on which 100,000 Alaskans l=
ive; warmer, more acidic oceans and rivers, and the migration of entire s=
pecies, threatens the livelihoods of indigenous peoples; and Alaskas glac=
iers alone are losing about 75 gigatons of ice each year.=20



With todays Joint Statement, the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland,=
 Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have in the last two months alone committed =
to working towards conditioning commercial activity in the Arctic in part=
 on world-class environmental standards and international and national cl=
imate change goals. These seven states account for about half of the Arct=
ic waters where a state has primary rights to explore and use marine reso=
urces.=20



President Obama and the six other leaders, including Prime Minister Trude=
au and today the five Nordic leaders, have also committed to advance scie=
ntifically-based protection and conservation of ecologically important ma=
rine areas, in close consultation with subsistence communities, based on =
the best available science and traditional and local knowledge. In the ca=
se of the United States and Canada, we have committed to set a new long-t=
erm conservation goal later this year. Furthering these goals and more wi=
ll be a key topic at the first-ever Arctic Science Ministerial, [ https:/=
/www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/05/13/white-house-arctic-science-ministeria=
l-september-28-2016 ] which will be held on September 28, 2016just after =
the one-year anniversary of President Obamas historic trip to Alaska [ ht=
tps://www.whitehouse.gov/2015-alaska-trip ]. Also today, the White House =
is issuing a call to action* *for individuals, organizations, and institu=
tions from all sectors to take new, specific, and measurable steps to hel=
p all people better understand and cope with the changing conditions in t=
he Arctic.=20



*"Implementing the Paris Agreement"*: Last month, more than 170 nations s=
igned the Paris Agreement, including the United States, Denmark, Finland,=
 Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. To reinforce their commitment, today, Icela=
nd pledged to join the Paris agreement this year and the United States an=
d Norway are reaffirming their commitment to join this year, alongside mo=
re than 30 countries that have already joined or have committed to do so =
this year. In addition, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark are committing to jo=
in the Paris Agreement as soon as possible. The leaders also called on co=
untries to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emissio=
n development strategies, as they implement their respective climate targ=
ets=20



To scale up support to developing countries to implement their respective=
 Nationally Determined Contributions, the United States and the Nordic le=
aders are also committing to provide leadership on climate finance, inclu=
ding by using public resources to mobilize robust increases in private ca=
pital, and to support developing countries in strengthening their adaptat=
ion and mitigation efforts.=20



The joint collaboration announced today builds on a strong U.S. commitmen=
t to implement the Paris Agreement at home, including:

 *Mid-Century Strategy:* The United States reaffirms its commitment to, i=
n 2016, complete a midcentury, long-term low greenhouse gas emission deve=
lopment strategy.

 *Support for Transparency*: The United States reiterates its pledge of $=
15 million dollars to the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (=
CBIT) that will support developing countries efforts to meet the enhanced=
 transparency requirements under the Paris Agreement.

 *Support for Adaptation: *The United States reaffirms its pledge to doub=
le its grant-based, public climate finance for adaptation by 2020.



*"Cooperation on Clean Energy:"* The leaders are committing to scale up t=
he deployment of clean energy. In particular, the leaders are calling for=
 the mobilization of private capital to finance clean energy. To reinforc=
e that commitment, five countries announced they intend to provide fundin=
g to institutionalize the Clean Energy Ministerial, a high-level effort b=
y 23 of the worlds major economies and the European Union to accelerate t=
he deployment of clean energy technologies. The United States and Denmark=
 are also announcing a new memorandum [ http://www.boem.gov/BOEM-Denmark-=
MOU ] to work together in developing offshore wind as a clean and sustain=
able energy source. This memorandum is a testimony to the strong Transatl=
antic ties between Denmark and the United States. Todays statement builds=
 on a series of actions that the United States has taken to drive clean e=
nergy research and deployment through Mission Innovation, securing long-t=
erm extensions of the production tax credit (PTC) for wind and other rene=
wables and the investment tax credit (ITC) for solar, and issuing eleven =
commercial wind leases along the Atlantic coast, which when the leases ar=
e fully developed, would generate enough energy to power over 4 million h=
omes.

*""*

*"Phasing Down HFCs: "*The leaders affirmed their commitment to adopt a M=
ontreal Protocol HFC phasedown amendment in 2016 and provide additional s=
upport through the Protocols Multilateral Fund following adoption of an a=
mendment. Todays statement is reinforced by actions that the United State=
s is taking to reduce the use and emissions of HFCs. The United States ha=
s been working to negotiate a Montreal Protocol HFC phasedown amendment, =
including putting forth a proposed amendment with Canada and Mexico. Stro=
ng international action on HFCs could avoid up to 0.5C of warming by the =
end of the century. In terms of domestic actions, in 2014 and 2015, the W=
hite House announced a suite of private-sector commitments and other exec=
utive actions that will reduce cumulative global consumption of HFCs by t=
he equivalent of more than 1 billion metric tons of CO2 through 2025.

*""*

*"Tackling Carbon Emissions from Aviation:"* Today, the leaders committed=
 to work together through the International Civil Aviation Organization (=
ICAO) to reduce international aviations climate impact by furthering the =
development and deployment of sustainable alternative jet fuels, and adop=
ting a strong market-based measure to enable carbon neutral growth from 2=
020 at ICAOs fall assembly. Earlier this year, the United States and 22 o=
ther countries reached consensus [ http://www.icao.int/Newsroom/Pages/New=
-ICAO-Aircraft-CO2-Standard-One-Step-Closer-To-Final-Adoption.aspx ] on t=
he first-ever global carbon standards for commercial aircraft. When fully=
 implemented, the standards are expected to reduce carbon emissions more =
than 650 million tons between 2020 and 2040, equivalent to removing over =
140 million cars from the road for a year.



*"Reducing Methane Emissions: "*In the Joint Statement, the United States=
 and Nordic countries committed to ensure each country has developed a na=
tional methane reduction plan or otherwise identified and implemented enh=
anced actions to significantly reduce our overall methane emissions, and =
to expand technical cooperation, where appropriate.=20

 The leaders pledged to continue to drive down our oil and gas methane em=
issions, where applicable, through sound regulation, climate targets, and=
 voluntary initiatives. In particular, to strongly encourage companies wo=
rking within their countries to develop company-wide methane reduction go=
als, and to join the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) Oil & Gas Met=
hane Partnership.=20

 The Nordic countries welcome the announcement of new U.S.-Canadian metha=
ne reduction goal to reduce methane emission from the oil and gas sector =
40  45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025.=20

 The Nordic countries pledged their support for the development of a glob=
al methane emission goal for the oil and gas sector.=20



The United States took two domestic actions yesterday to reduce methane e=
missions from the oil and gas sector. In particular, the Environmental Pr=
otection Agency finalized the first ever standards to reduce methane emis=
sions from new, modified, and reconstructed oil and gas sector sources. T=
he final New Source Performance Standards for new and modified sources ar=
e expected to reduce the equivalent of 11 million metric tons carbon diox=
ide and have substantial health benefits. Fulfilling one of the commitmen=
ts made during the visit of Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau, the United S=
tates also took the first step on the path to regulating existing oil and=
 gas operations by issuing for public comment the first draft of an Infor=
mation Collection Request (ICR) that, once finalized, will require compan=
ies operating existing oil and gas sources to provide information to acce=
ss different regulatory approaches to reduce emissions from these sources=
.

*"Collaboration on the Important Role of Forests"*: The United States and=
 the Nordic countries are determined to cooperate on the important role o=
f forests in addressing climate change by supporting and incentivizing de=
veloping country forest partners to conserve, restore and sustainably man=
age forests, as well as strengthen their respective efforts to combat ill=
egal logging and associated trade. The leaders also committed to facilita=
te private sector efforts to eliminate deforestation from the production =
of commodities such as palm oil, pulp and paper, cattle and soy. To reinf=
orce these commitments:

 The United States and Norway are announcing that they will sign a joint =
statement to reinforce their intention to enhance cooperation on Reducing=
 Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) and sustaina=
ble landscapes.=20

 Yesterday, the United States announced the first results of a detailed a=
ction plan to reduce emissions and increase carbon storage in soils and f=
orests through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Building Blocks =
for Climate Smart Agriculture and Forestry. Through this initiative, USDA=
 committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon stored =
in forests and soils by over 120 million metric tons of carbon dioxide eq=
uivalent per year by 2025 and announced yesterday that they are providing=
 more than $70 million in funding for conservation practices that advance=
 this commitment, including for forestry management.

*""*

*"Promoting Energy for All:"*" "The Nordic countries and the United State=
s commit to further strengthen efforts to achieve global access to sustai=
nable, reliable, affordable and modern energy for all, consistent with th=
e 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, m=
ore than two-thirds of the population is without access to power. To supp=
ort a doubling of electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa the United Sta=
tes and Nordic countries have expressed our support for the Power Africa =
initiative and commit to work together to provide technical assistance, f=
inancing, and other support to enable additional investment in energy pro=
jects throughout the region. In 2014, Sweden became the first bilateral p=
artner to join Power Africa, committing to catalyze investments of $1 bil=
lion dollars in support of our shared goals under Power Africa. In 2015, =
Power Africa announced a new partnership with Norway, through which Norwa=
y is committing to bringing 1,500 megawatts (MW) online over a five-year =
period, contributing to Power Africa's 30,000 MW electricity generation g=
oal by 2030.=20
