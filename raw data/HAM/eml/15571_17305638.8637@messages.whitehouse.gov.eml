THE WHITE HOUSE



Office of the First Lady

_________________________________________________________________

 For Immediate Release May 17, 2016





REMARKS BY THE FIRST LADY

IN A CONVERSATION WITH

CRAIG ROBINSON AND MICHAEL WILBON

ON LETS MOVE! AT ASPEN INSTITUTES PROJECT PLAY



The Newseum

Washington, D.C.





11:46 A.M. EDT





 MR. WILBON: Good morning. I think its still morning. We snuck in.



 MRS. OBAMA: -ish.



 MR. WILBON: Morning-ish. And thanks, everybody, for being here. Welcome =
to the feature panel of the Project Play Summit, where for the next were =
told about 30 minutes, give or take, three kids from, generally speaking,=
 the same patch of land on the South Side of Chicago will do more than re=
minisce. We will talk about the experience of growing up there and partic=
ipating in all manners of play -- parenting at a time when participation =
has become so complex -- and all three of us are that -- and also the nec=
essity of increasing as much as we can participation, regardless of statu=
re or income or bearing.



 And so much of this is important to all three of us for every different =
reasons. And, first of all, were going to go back to 2010 and the Lets Mo=
ve! initiative, and this being an outgrowth of that, quite literally and =
figuratively.=20



So were going to start in the place that I said we would, going back a li=
ttle bit. And Craig and I have discovered, even in the last week, that if=
 there were giant -- if there were surveillance back then, we would have =
been in the same playgrounds and pools and other places like that.



MR. ROBINSON: Absolutely, absolutely.



MR. WILBON: Okay, so I can -- and Ive known Craig long enough, I can put =
him on the spot right away and ask you what kind of athlete your little s=
ister was. (Laughter.)=20



MRS. OBAMA: Youre putting him on the spot? Okay, all right. (Laughter.)=20=




MR. ROBINSON: First of all, let me just tell you, Mike brought his notes,=
 and I had a packet of notes on my sister and she told me to put it back,=
 put it down when we left the house. (Laughter.)=20



But you folks should know that how I got to be as good of an athlete as I=
 was had to do with my little sister. Because growing up, we played every=
thing together, and I mean everything. And somebody over there coughed an=
d laughed, but shes actually -- might be the second-best athlete in the f=
amily behind my daughter. (Laughter.)=20



MRS. OBAMA: Hes number three. Well, you might be four.



MR. ROBINSON: I might be four now.



MRS. OBAMA: Well now youve got two little ones, so you might be seventh. =
(Laughter.)=20



MR. ROBINSON: But we used to play everything. And it started in the house=
, playing catch -- yes, we played catch in the house.



MRS. OBAMA: And it was a little house.=20



MR. ROBINSON: Have you seen Tiny House Nation? (Laughter.) That was our h=
ouse.



MRS. OBAMA: We were the originators. We were like, whats the big deal? Th=
at was our house. (Laughter.)=20



MR. ROBINSON: It was a one-bedroom house where we used the dining room as=
 the living room, and the living room was our bedroom. And it had a small=
 hall that had to go from the end of the stage to right here, and we play=
ed catch, we played running bases, we played hockey, we played football, =
and we played basketball. And just yesterday, my sister said, I should be=
 better at basketball than I am, and I had to remind her that we used to =
play Nerf basketball in the living room with the lamp shade and a Nerf ba=
sketball. This was before they had Nerf hoops. (Laughter.)=20



And my moms here -- remember we almost burned the house down because we l=
eft the ball in the lamp, and somebody turned the lamp on, and my mother =
was like, whats that I smell, is something burning? And we looked at each=
 other like, ooh.=20



MRS. OBAMA: Its the Nerf ball.



MR. ROBINSON: Its the Nerf ball. (Laughter.) And it had a big burn hole i=
n it.=20



But to get back to your question, Mike, my sister is very athletic. I mea=
n, she was fast. She was coordinated, very good hand-eye. And we literall=
y played every sport together until we got to the point where it got orga=
nized and I kept going and she couldnt because they didnt have organized =
girls --=20



MR. WILBON: Found other great things to do. (Laughter.) We need to acknow=
ledge your mom, Mrs. Robinson, who had to referee all those battles and o=
versee everything. (Applause.) Welcome, and thank you so much for -- and =
just jump right in any time you want to --=20



MRS. OBAMA: And shes an athlete, too, actually.



MR. ROBINSON: Oh, right. Thats right.



MRS. OBAMA: But thats a story for another day.



MR. WILBON: What was it like, Mrs. Obama, for you growing up when you kne=
w you had a big brother who was going to go on to, as it turns out, to bi=
g athletic things? Was there pressure to keep up? Was it automatically a =
spirit within you? Take us through those years.



MRS. OBAMA: Well, most of you know, my father, our father had MS, and he =
was an athlete. And before he contracted MS, he was a top-notch swimmer. =
He boxed. And then he went from being that man to being a man who couldnt=
 walk without the assistance of a cane. And we really only knew him after=
 MS. We saw pictures of him as an athlete, but sports were very important=
 to my father. He was an avid fan, but it was important for him that we p=
layed.



And he didnt distinguish because I was a girl. I remember we both got our=
 first pair of boxing gloves together. Craig got his pair, and I had a li=
ttle-bitty pair of boxing gloves. And I would beat the heck out of him. (=
Laughter.) Because the rule was I could go in on him, he had to kind of g=
o light on me.=20



But our father got us engaged in this. And one of the things -- Craig and=
 I, we dont take for granted activity, physical movement, because we know=
 that when you have the blessing of being able to walk and run, you dont =
take it for granted. So I was in the middle of everything. So it really w=
asnt like he was the preferred athlete; I was in the middle of everything=
.=20



And it was really, as Craig said, it wasnt until organized sports came in=
to being, and there just werent opportunities for girls. There were no ba=
sketball -- there werent co-ed basketball leagues in our neighborhood. Th=
ere werent girls leagues. I played softball, loved to play softball, but =
there were really no girls teams. So I spent a lot of time as a spectator=
 because the opportunities werent there. So thats something that we have =
to really think of.



Now, Title 9 has changed this so dramatically, and were fortunate. And if=
 you live in the right neighborhood, like our girls, you have access to a=
 whole range of sports. But that wasnt the case. And if you dont have the=
 money in this society, you cant afford it. Craig and I talk about the co=
st of keeping our kids in activities -- whether its rec leagues or dance =
classes or whatever -- when the kids were little and they were doing ever=
ything, we were paying $8,000, $10,000 a year for fees, and uniforms, and=
 new shoes because their feet keep growing. And what family can afford th=
at?



So were really limiting -- were not developing our next level of fans and=
 competitors. We are missing out on a whole generation of kids who were l=
ike me who could have been like me, who could have been like Craig, but t=
hey dont even have the opportunity. And we fell into that a little bit, b=
ut it was more because of gender rather than resources.



MR. WILBON: Its been a passion of yours, too, for that gap to close compl=
etely; obviously, we start incrementally. But we should go back a little =
bit to Lets Move! and the sort of transition into this area now. Because =
that truly has become a passion of yours, hasnt it?



MRS. OBAMA: Oh, absolutely. We started with Lets Move, and a lot of it wa=
s about nutrition, because as a mom, I struggled with what many parents s=
truggle with -- when youre busy and youve got two parents working, how ar=
e you feeding your kids? Youre going through the drive-thru a little bit =
too much, youre incorporating processed foods a little bit too much. Your=
e doing too much takeout. And nowadays, kids have a hundred million chann=
els to choose from, theyve got their iPhones and their iPads. So the whol=
e range of physical activity has changed, and as a result were seeing obe=
sity rates increase.



And you can see as a parent, being in it, and how that can happen. And I =
saw that as a parent. And I thought, well, here I am, a Princeton-Harvard=
-educated mom who thought she was doing everything right. And at a point =
when my kids were little, the pediatrician was like, well, youve got to w=
atch these numbers, just tracking their weight and height on a regular ba=
sis. He was like, youve got to change what youre doing.



And with some minor changes -- cooking a little bit more, putting in more=
 fruits and vegetables, cutting out the sugary drinks -- we changed our k=
ids health outcomes in less than six months. And our pediatrician was lik=
e, what did you do, because whatever you did, I need to carry it through =
my whole pediatric practice.



And thats when we started talking about how he was seeing just high rates=
 of obesity because kids were having fast food for breakfast, lunch and d=
inner. They werent getting recess anymore. Sports were being taken away f=
rom the schools. So I thought, well, when we get here to the White House =
-- assuming that my husband wins -- we need to start informing parents ab=
out this. We need to start an education process. Because everybody wants =
to do the best thing for their kids, but if they dont have the informatio=
n and they think that what theyre doing is the right thing when its absol=
utely the opposite of the right thing, how will we fix it.



So Lets Move! was the beginning of that, where we talked about nutrition.=
 But you cant just talk about nutrition and not talk about physical activ=
ity, because its all part of the same arm. So we eventually built on nutr=
ition and started talking about physical activity, and on and on and on. =
And here we are today.



MR. WILBON: And I mean schools -- this has to be a cooperative effort lik=
e we rarely see. And I want to ask you whether -- about that. Obviously, =
Craig, you have been involved at all levels of this, and at the highest l=
evel in terms of schools being involved. Take us through a little bit of =
what you saw and what youve seen recently, not just as a coach but also a=
s a parent.



MR. ROBINSON: Well, what I see, especially as a coach, but particularly a=
s a parent, is you have the gamut of parenting. You have, on one end, the=
 over-parenting, where parents are trying to sort of force their kids int=
o sports. And on the other end, Ive got -- my wife and I, Kelly, have a s=
ix-year-old and a four-year-old, and we have the parents who bring their =
kids to the soccer field and are on their phones and sort of not paying a=
ttention. And then you have kids who dont have the -- they dont have the =
benefit of either, who are inside playing video games somewhere because t=
heyre priced completely out of the sport market and the play market.



And I think it really -- I mean, first and foremost, it starts with being=
 able to play as a little kid. I mean, its not safe to go outside and pla=
y. We talk about this all the time, that back in Chatham and in South Sho=
re and the places that we grew up, there were rough neighborhoods, but no=
t like now. You could go outside and run around and play on your block. S=
o even if you werent in organized sports, you could run and do stuff.



MRS. OBAMA: And we would play all day, all day long. I mean, you would be=
 rushing down your breakfast to go out, and kids would organize themselve=
s. I mean, whether it was playing Piggy, which was a softball game -- we =
played this game with the kids in the neighborhood just called Chase. (La=
ughter.) I dont even know if there was a point to it, but you were just b=
eing chased for a good chunk of the morning.=20



MR. WILBON: For hours.=20



MRS. OBAMA: For hours, being chased. (Laughter.)=20



MR. WILBON: I remember that.



MR. ROBINSON: Oh, yeah, I remember that. And all you had to do was report=
 back to the house every couple of hours. We had to -- hey, mom, Im back,=
 and then you went back out and you played. And this was from 9:30 in the=
 morning until right before it got dark.



MR. WILBON: One of the things that scares me -- this happened Sunday. I h=
ave an eight-year-old. And he is a play fanatic, everything, which makes =
me proud and happy. But we live in Bethesda, allegedly about as safe as i=
ts going to get in metropolitan Washington, right? So I see my wife walki=
ng out of the house with a lawn chair around 2:00 on Sunday, and I say, w=
hat are you doing with this lawn chair? And she said, Im going to go and =
sit and watch Matthew shoot. And I said, youre going to sit and watch him=
 shoot? (Laughter.) First of all, he can shoot for hours because he think=
s hes the next Steph Curry. And she literally was going to take a lawn ch=
air just out near our garage space and watch him shoot on the next-door n=
eighbors basket.



And I just thought, this is a different world in which we live. I mean, I=
 would have gotten on a bike and come over to South Shore, gone to Tuley =
Park -- I mean, at not much older than he is, at 10 and 11 years old -- a=
nd played all day on the South Side and never thought for a second about =
being harmed. And Im sure -- just like you, Id check in -- youd check in =
at some point so your parents knew you were well. But that is something t=
hat -- how do we address, how do we get our arms around that phenomenon?



MR. ROBINSON: Well, its going to be hard. And I think the days of going o=
utside to play are over. So you have to kind of, as a parent, decide what=
s important. I mean, you have this leisure time -- and for us and for our=
 parents, our dad and -- Miche talked about how he was handicapped -- it =
never precluded him from coming home from work and going outside with us.=
 And it think you need more of that at a very early age so that you get t=
rained in the mode of physical activity on a daily basis. And thats just =
the start.



MRS. OBAMA: I mean, I hope the days of playing outside arent over and don=
e with. I mean, there are communities that are more challenged because th=
e streets have been overrun with crime and so on and so forth, but there =
are still communities out there where people do live this life, where it =
is safe enough for kids to go out to play.



But now, youve got to make sure you have enough of them, because if every=
body is in an organized sport, if everybodys time is structured and youre=
 the parent whos trying to put play back in, well you send your kids out =
to play and theres nobody to play with, because everybody is booked. They=
re scheduled.



And thats where the dilemma comes in -- either you cant play outside beca=
use its unsafe, or youre the only kid playing outside because everybody e=
lse is over-specialized, right? Because the thing about when we were grow=
ing up and Craig was into sports, you did every sport. He played Little L=
eague, he played Bitty Basketball, he did the version of AAU basketball. =
But you werent playing basketball for an entire year. You didnt have a sh=
ooting coach and a dribbling coach, and then you got your nutrition exper=
ts and your -- thats what Im seeing now, is that kids now have to pick on=
e sport at the age of 10, and then become, like, Tiger Woods, right? That=
s our version.=20



So youre taking them out of the mix of even just having a regular play li=
fe. And thats particularly true if your kid is athletic, because you feel=
 like in order for them to compete, they have to be hyper focused on that=
 sport. So youve got parents now who have a great athlete, and theyll be =
like, you can only play basketball because I dont want you to get injured=
 playing touch football. They become a commodity, and then they dont even=
 have the concept of play.



Right now, I think if you put a bunch of kids out in a field today, I don=
t think they would know what to do. (Laughter.) We learned all these game=
s -- Steal the Bacon and Duck, Duck, Goose -- all of these things you lea=
rned at recess and in P.E., which in -- lets remember, in a lot of urban =
settings, those opportunities, recess and gym, dont exist anymore for kid=
s. So where are they even learning how to organize themselves socially so=
 that when you put them in a field, they actually arent looking at the gr=
ass, but they start to, like, organize themselves? Kids these days dont e=
ven know how to do that as well, because weve taken all those opportuniti=
es away from them.=20

So I hope its not dead. Theres a lot of things we can do to put it back i=
n -- number one, making sure kids have recess at school. Thats where they=
re spending most of their time. (Applause.) That is just as important as =
math and science to kids. If youre a teacher and youre working with boys =
in particular, they cant sit still for an entire school day. They cant ph=
ysically do it.



Now, I have girls, and watching his two little boys come over -- I mean, =
they wear me out when they walk in the door. Im just like, fellas, sit do=
wn. Theyre always a little damp and sweaty and moist because theyre movin=
g all the time. (Laughter.) You touch them and its like, why are you wet,=
 little boy, get off of me! (Laughter.) My girls were dry for most of the=
 time. (Laughter.)



So I feel for people with boys in todays school systems where you dont le=
t them move. So how are we expecting them to be successful academically i=
f the other part of their brain, that part that is movement and music and=
 creativity, is not being exercised?



MR. WILBON: That leads me to a point -- a question. I know you recently m=
ade an announcement in Times Square with the U.S. Olympic Team regarding =
access to sports for all kids. And Lets Move! obviously has been at the f=
orefront of that. Why is it so important -- and I dont even -- its diffic=
ult to ask you what can be done -- but for organizations in the private s=
ector to value exactly what youre talking about and sort of get behind --=
 if there can be momentum built?



MRS. OBAMA: Its absolutely necessary. I mean, if were at the place now in=
 our societies where we dont want to be taxed to make sure that schools h=
ave it, if thats what were saying -- were cutting it out because we dont =
want to pay for the P.E. teacher, we dont want to pay for the gym class, =
we dont want that to be a governmental responsibility -- well, then, its =
up to all of you all corporate people. Youve got to trickle it down if th=
ats the theory.=20



So it becomes even more critical for the big sports companies to be those=
 facilitators of those activities. Because if you look at it from a busin=
ess standpoint, where is your fan base going to come from? If youve got g=
irls who never see sports, if youve got kids whove never touched a basket=
ball, who are you recruiting? And whos going to watch the Olympics if kid=
s dont know what half these sports are?



I mean, kids watch this stuff because they want to play it. Theyre not sp=
ectators. So if we want the Olympics to continue to thrive, then we need =
to facilitate some fans and some excitement. Those are those kids in the =
street who dont have recess anymore.=20



So if weve taken it out of the schools and we dont value it, then it is g=
oing to be absolutely imperative for corporate America to go into these s=
chools and put some gym and some sports back in. In the schools we grew u=
p in -- and its different from the schools my kids go to -- private schoo=
ls where they have a sport -- almost every sport, every team for boys and=
 girls -- because the tuition is so high. You go to a public school in th=
e inner city and maybe they have a basketball team, in middle school. May=
be. But you dont even get to really play sports until you go to high scho=
ol, and thats if your high school can afford a sport. But they wont have =
field hockey. Theyll either have basketball or football, maybe a girls te=
am. If you dont have a pool, youre not going to have a swim team.=20



I mean, lets just sort of think about what weve structured here for this =
generation. These are our kids. So if were not going to do it through the=
 school systems, and weve decided that as a people as a society that that=
s too expensive, or we dont trust that system to do it, then who else is =
going to do it? Were just going to let sports just fritter away in our cu=
lture?=20

So whos going to watch the next Olympics? Because these kids wont be inte=
rested in it if they dont know anything about it.



MR. WILBON: Well, Craig, it seems like coaches are going to have to be at=
 the forefront of any cooperative with the private sector, because the pr=
ivate sector, even if -- obviously, financing this, not going to have the=
 knowledge, the know-how to apply it. How do coaches fit in? Are you seei=
ng coaches being hired in these capacities to sort of help this movement?=




MR. ROBINSON: Well, in a word, no. What were missing is were missing that=
 guy -- my old AU coach, Johnny Gage (ph) was a -- at the time, I thought=
 he was much older than I was, but he coached us at the age of 19. Hes co=
aching 13-year-olds. And he wanted to be a coach. And youre not seeing a =
lot of those folks anymore. Everybody is moving away to do something diff=
erent.=20



Thats one. So you dont see as many young coaches. Theyre gravitating to s=
ort of trying to get into the high-priced college and pro game. So you do=
nt have grassroots guys, which then puts it back on the parents.=20



And our first coach was our father. I mean, he coached us every day. We w=
ere out there playing, get down on the ground, baseball position, get you=
r elbow in when you shoot; this is how you swim. And if were not going to=
 get professional coaches to help us do this, weve got to, as a society, =
take responsibility as parents to do it, no matter how busy we are.



MR. WILBON: What sort of things -- I know you were involved in -- I dont =
know how you keep in the balls in the air. But to that end, Craig, tell u=
s about some of the things youre involved in now in addition to working a=
nd parenting.



MR. ROBINSON: Well, in addition to, lets see, working at ESPN, and Ive go=
t four kids -- one is working, one is in college and then two younger kid=
s -- as much as I can, I love going around and telling our story of how i=
mportant athletics, sports, activity was in our lives.=20



And it was not as if our parents used it as a motivator, either -- oh, if=
 you dont get good grades, you cant play sports. It was just part of the =
fabric of growing up, just like you get up in the morning, you eat, you g=
o outside and play on days when you didnt have school. And when you were =
at school, you did your schoolwork, and then you went outside and played.=




So what Im spending time doing is working and going around and talking ab=
out that in hopes that we as parents sort of embrace the fact that we hav=
e these children. We have to keep them active. Nobody is going to keep th=
em active for us.



MR. WILBON: Mrs. Obama, I wanted to ask you about Project Play -- a repor=
t recently recognizing that sports participation rates among youth living=
 in households with the lowest incomes are about half that of youth from =
wealthier homes. And we talked about this early. Are there other ways tha=
t we should be looking at to close that gap and make people understand wh=
y its important?



MRS. OBAMA: Well, at some point, its going to require an investment. So t=
he question is, where do you make that investment? In the past, we made t=
he investment in school, because everybody went to school or goes to scho=
ol. So that was the easiest place -- recess, gym, sports in school. That =
costs money. We hit a wall, so we stopped investing.



So then the next level of investment comes in youth centers, sports clubs=
. But again, thats an investment because youve got to have places with gy=
ms, and youve got hire staff, youve got to have equipment, you have to --=
 so if you look to the Boys and Girls Clubs, or youth leagues, that still=
 requires and investment.=20



So at some level, we have to kind of ask ourselves how much are we willin=
g to invest in the kids in our society? Because at some point, weve got t=
o make that investment, even if its an investment in better parks in ever=
y community, creating safe spaces where kids can go out to play. On the S=
outh Side, now, we had parks, and some of those parks just arent -- they =
havent been maintained. The sports fields dont work, the swings are broke=
n.



In so many communities you have a place for a park, but its going to take=
 an investment to make it a place that kids will actually use. So where d=
oes that investment come from? Thats the city. So we dont want to do that=
 anymore, so its just -- slowly its becoming a desert, a play desert. So =
many communities are becoming play deserts.



But in wealthy communities, there is a wealth of resources. You can be in=
 field hockey, or you can learn how to swim. There are aquatic centers an=
d -- Ive seen the difference. The disparities are amazing to me. So are w=
e saying that some kids are worthy of that investment and physical activi=
ty, and then there are millions of others who arent? And whats the role t=
hat we as a society have for making sure that kids have equal access?



But thats also true for music and art, and all of these wonderful things.=
 That why Lets Move! is so important to me, because my view is, as a pare=
nt, is if I think this is important for my kids, its important for every =
kid. So it cant be good enough that my kid has it if the vast majority of=
 kids in this country dont have it. Because who are my kids going to play=
 with? Who are they going to compete against?



And I just hope that we get out of that mentality of I got mine over here=
, and as long as mine are good, good luck. Its that eat or be eaten kind =
of -- but thats basically what were doing when it comes to sports. Becaus=
e were okay going into some neighborhoods where there isnt even a field, =
but in other communities, there is every field -- there are more fields t=
han there are kids. There are more opportunities than there are kids.=20



But we have to kind of look at ourselves and say, how did we get here, an=
d why is that okay? Because right now its okay. Were okay with that. And =
thats sad.



MR. WILBON: The most dramatic instance of that Ive ever seen was when I w=
as working as a reporter at the Washington Post. And literally, the 24 ho=
urs in the aftermath of the riots in L.A. in 1990 -- what, 1991, or 1992.=
 My sports editor had a brilliant idea. He said, look, why dont you go ou=
t to Los Angeles, find out if theres any connection between the people wh=
o are -- we are seeing on Nightline every night, the Crips and Bloods, an=
d lack of opportunity to play the way they used to.



And my initial reaction was, what? This is a stretch. So I got on a plane=
 and went to L.A. And I got lucky in that I ran into Crips and Bloods who=
 were literally at the forefront of trying to negotiate a peace settlemen=
t. And a couple of guys recognized me from television, and they said, hey=
, what are you doing out here? And I said, I want to know if theres any s=
ort of connection. What did you guys used to do? What did you do at 10, 1=
1 and 12 years old, and do you still play? Do you still -- and all these =
guys are between 18 and 25 at this point. And they say, you know what, wh=
at are you doing tomorrow morning? And I said, Ill do whatever you tell m=
e. And they said, were going to pick you up and take you and show you.



And literally, they drove me through South Central and other parts of L.A=
. where fields were overgrown, where field houses and youth activity cent=
ers were closed. And they talked about -- and they had photos of the time=
s they used to play with and against each other, and instead of Dodgers a=
nd Angels and Cubs and Yankees, they became Crips and Bloods.



And it was a startling revelation -- perhaps it shouldnt have been -- bec=
ause the problems in South Central could have been -- we could have named=
 a city, right? What urban area is that different -- that was playing out=
 because of the riots and the days after Rodney King. But it was a stunni=
ng thing.



And I wound up writing stories on A1 about it for the Washington Post, an=
d I hope people didnt feel it was 3,000 miles removed. Because it could h=
ave been Southeast or Northeast or the South Side. And were lucky -- I dr=
ive out to those parks, by the way. I drive out to West Chatham and Tuley=
 just to see whats going on, and if theyre still viable, the places that =
we played.



MRS. OBAMA: And are they?



MR. WILBON: And some are, but not nearly as many as we had access to.



MRS. OBAMA: When we were growing up. Well, we cant be surprised with what=
 kids do with idle time. And thats sort of one of the things -- when we l=
ook at crime rates and all that sort of stuff, its like, these are a bunc=
h of bored kids that are unsupervised who dont know how to play. If we st=
art there -- and then we give them a gun. And then youve got such a letha=
l combination.



Why cant we put those things together? Why are we confused about why crim=
e rates are going up? Its not a complicated set of scenarios, unless peop=
le dont really understand just what a wasteland so many kids are living i=
n in terms of activity. Maybe thats the case. Maybe people look at their =
lives and think, well, if my kids have it, then it couldnt be that bad. I=
t is that bad.=20



We are raising kids and whole communities where there is no place for the=
m to play. Theres nothing for them to play with, nobody to play with, no =
supervision. And we wonder why they just go off on society.



So this is essential, not to mention the whole socialization piece. I mea=
n, look at all the things we learned just by playing. We learned problem-=
solving. We learned how to communicate. We learned how to resolve differe=
nces without an adult being there. We learned how to organize our time wh=
en we were bored. We learned --=20



MR. ROBINSON: Team work. We learned leadership. We were talking the other=
 day -- my four-year-old is learning math because hes trying to keep scor=
e when hes playing against his brother. And theres just so many things th=
at people who have decided to remove athletics and sports and recreation =
from the system -- sort of like unintended consequences that they didnt t=
hink about.



MR. WILBON: Yes, I dont know that mine would be able to count, except he =
can get basketball scores -- hed probably be able to get earned run avera=
ge. Thatll be the advanced math.



I guess we should probably close here soon. Theres some fascinating thing=
s in all sort of areas we could go into, but obviously, wed be remiss wit=
hout talking about some possible solutions and whether or not we think we=
 can get to the place that we all would like to arrive with being able to=
 reinstate, for starters, some of the things -- I mean, weve gone backwar=
d, clearly, in this area.=20



I mean, looking at the places that were available, the opportunities that=
 were available to us when money wasnt at the forefront of it. Now you gu=
ys are scaring me, talking about these fees. Because with an eight-year-o=
ld, Im just coming into that.



MRS. OBAMA: Get ready. Youve got to save up for play these days. Youve go=
t to have a play scholarship fund. (Laughter.) Youve got college scholars=
hip, and then youve got just play. Its going to cost you.



MR. WILBON: The fees Im starting to recognize. What sorts of areas would =
you like to see initiated? What sort of recommendations? Craig, lets star=
t with you.



MR. ROBINSON: Well, clearly, my sister is right on point with corporate A=
merica, but not just corporate America is going to see this. I think its =
places that you and I work for, like ESPN, who have such a broad reach an=
d are reliant upon future sports fans. They have to be a stakeholder, whi=
ch they are, but has to continue.



The shoe companies who make a ton of money off of these same young kids, =
but not because theyre wearing their shoes out playing, theyre wearing th=
em out as --=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER: Fashion --



MR. ROBINSON: -- I heard somebody over there, as a fashion statement. Tha=
t is exactly right. You need to have places like Nike and Adidas and Unde=
r Armor be your stakeholders.



I would be remiss if -- youve got to have your professional athletes, the=
 guys who have made it, have to -- as hard as it is, they have to be a st=
andard-bearer for this. It is really a team effort. And thats just to sta=
rt, from my perspective.



And then, as I keep harping on, it has to be the family. I mean, its toug=
h for families who dont have a lot, and a single-parent family where the =
mom or the dad is doing everything on their own. They come home from work=
, theyre too tired to play -- well, I had both my parents, but I dont get=
 it because my dad had MS and he was out there every day working a swing =
shift, and hes taking us up to the park and pitching to her, and Im catch=
ing out in the field, and were playing a three-person baseball game.



So thats just to start. And I think we can do it.



MRS. OBAMA: We have to. This isnt something thats an option. Its the thin=
g that keeps our society healthy and whole. Its the investment we make in=
 that next generation.=20



But I would say -- there are so many great programs already out there. Th=
is is the thing -- this is where the investment comes in. Just like with =
schools, we know what great schools look like. Its not like its a mystery=
. There are thousands of really great school -- public schools and charte=
r schools, and you name them. The question is how do we replicate the goo=
d stuff? Its an investment.



And the same thing is true with a whole range of programs. We have Lets M=
ove! in schools, where Nike is working to help teachers think of creative=
 ways to put movement back into the school day. Youve got a lot of corpor=
ations that are already sponsoring some really good initiatives. Youve go=
t -- in some cities, where theyve found how important sports can be in co=
mmunity policing in South Central L.A. Youve got police officers who are =
setting up football leagues, and theyre redeveloping whole relationships =
between law enforcement and kids in those communities.



If we wanted to just line up all the programs that are working and find o=
ut which ones are really working and why and which ones work in urban set=
tings and rural settings, we probably already have the answers. Now we ha=
ve to scale it. And that goes back to priority, intent, and investment. B=
ecause none of it is free. Weve just shifted the burden back on families =
to say, its up to you: So if you have resources, youre going to be good. =
But if you dont, well, your kids are going to be hanging out in the stree=
t, and then well be mad at you because you dont your kids under control.=20=




But this has to become a priority in our society. We cant just sort of th=
ink that, well, kids in play, I mean, we can figure this out, this isnt m=
y problem. This is all of our problems. From the government to the milita=
ry -- this is where Mark was talking about -- kids who arent playing spor=
ts show up at training unprepared to serve because you put a backpack on =
a kid who doesnt run or hasnt run and tell them to run 10 miles, they fra=
cture something, and then whos got to pay for that? Or if theyre not eati=
ng well -- because theyve had soda most of their live, now they have dent=
al issues that the military is covering.



This affects all of us. Play and nutrition and overall investment in our =
kids -- whether they can read and think and engage -- its just not enough=
 for us to be okay with so many kids not having that at an excellent leve=
l.



So whatever the dollar figure is, as a society, as taxpayers and as corpo=
rate America and who -- we should figure out how much that costs, and the=
n pay for it. Period. (Applause.)=20



MR. WILBON: Yes, because wed pay a lot less on the front end than wed do =
on the back.=20



Just as a way of closing, it starts with all of us, those of us who, whet=
her were entrepreneurial and have our own things going on, or whether wer=
e working for entities that need to be invested locally -- and by locally=
, I mean the most local way, right there, right at home. When you see the=
 neglect that has to be reversed and proactively, children who need to be=
 introduced to this if theyre not already. And obviously, Lets Move! and =
Project Play have been at the forefront of this for a while now, and I th=
ink we should thank Craig and thank the First Lady again for coming to di=
scuss something thats so vital and important and compelling to any commun=
ity -- thank them for being here, both of you, and taking your time to di=
scuss this. Its fascinating.



MRS. OBAMA: Well then, Mike, let me also thank the people in this room wh=
o have prioritized it. This is a room full of people who are putting thes=
e issues front and center. And Im grateful to all of you all. I can start=
 Lets Move! and get some attention around it, but, as I say to many of yo=
u when I meet you, you all are the ones doing the hard work on the ground=
 every day.



And I know it has been a lonely fight. Its been a lonely mission. But I f=
or one, as First Lady of the United States, Im grateful to all of you for=
 the passion and commitment you show to our next generation. And we just =
need more of you, thats all. You have to go replicate yourselves and recr=
uit more people.



But were in a room full of folks right here who are prioritizing it, maki=
ng it front and center, putting the investment in, putting in the elbow g=
rease, the love. All of you are stars in this show, and Im just grateful.=
 (Applause.)=20

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. WILBON:&nbsp; Morning-i=
sh.&nbsp; And thanks, everybody, for being here.&nbsp; Welcome to the featu=
re panel of the Project Play Summit, where for the next we=92re told about =
30 minutes, give or take, three kids from, generally speaking, the same
 patch of land on the South Side of Chicago will do more than reminisce.&nb=
sp; We will talk about the experience of growing up there and participating=
 in all manners of play -- parenting at a time when participation has becom=
e so complex -- and all three of us are
 that -- and also the necessity of increasing as much as we can participati=
on, regardless of stature or income or bearing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so much of this is impo=
rtant to all three of us for every different reasons.&nbsp; And, first of a=
ll, we=92re going to go back to 2010 and the Let=92s Move! initiative, and =
this being an outgrowth of that, quite literally and figuratively.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we=92re going to start=
 in the place that I said we would, going back a little bit.&nbsp; And Crai=

 if there were surveillance back then, we would
 have been in the same playgrounds and pools and other places like that.<o:=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. ROBINSON:&nbsp; First=
 of all, let me just tell you, Mike brought his notes, and I had a packet o=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But you folks should know=
 that how I got to be as good of an athlete as I was had to do with my litt=

 coughed and laughed, but she=92s actually -- might be the second-best athl=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; And it =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. ROBINSON:&nbsp; Have =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; We were=

 our house.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. ROBINSON:&nbsp; It wa=
s a one-bedroom house where we used the dining room as the living room, and=
 the living room was our bedroom.&nbsp; And it had a small hall that had to=
 go from the end of the stage to right here, and
 we played catch, we played running bases, we played hockey, we played foot=
ball, and we played basketball.&nbsp; And just yesterday, my sister said, I=
 should be better at basketball than I am, and I had to remind her that we =
used to play Nerf basketball in the living
 room with the lamp shade and a Nerf basketball.&nbsp; This was before they=
 had Nerf hoops.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And my mom=92s here -- re=
member we almost burned the house down because we left the ball in the lamp=

smell, is something burning?&nbsp; And we looked
 at each other like, ooh.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; It=92s =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But to get back to your q=
uestion, Mike, my sister is very athletic.&nbsp; I mean, she was fast.&nbsp=

 it got organized and I kept going and she couldn=92t because they didn=92t=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; But tha=
t=92s a story for another day.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. WILBON:&nbsp; What wa=
s it like, Mrs. Obama, for you growing up when you knew you had a big broth=
er who was going to go on to, as it turns out, to big athletic things?&nbsp=
; Was there pressure to keep up?&nbsp; Was it automatically
 a spirit within you?&nbsp; Take us through those years.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, m=
ost of you know, my father, our father had MS, and he was an athlete.&nbsp;=
 And before he contracted MS, he was a top-notch swimmer.&nbsp; He boxed.&n=
bsp; And then he went from being that man to being a man
 who couldn=92t walk without the assistance of a cane.&nbsp; And we really =
only knew him after MS.&nbsp; We saw pictures of him as an athlete, but spo=
rts were very important to my father.&nbsp; He was an avid fan, but it was =
important for him that we played.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And he didn=92t distingui=
sh because I was a girl.&nbsp; I remember we both got our first pair of box=
ing gloves together.&nbsp; Craig got his pair, and I had a little-bitty pai=
r of boxing gloves.&nbsp; And I would beat the heck out
 of him.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Because the rule was I could go in on him,=
 he had to kind of go light on me.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But our father got us eng=
aged in this.&nbsp; And one of the things -- Craig and I, we don=92t take f=
or granted activity, physical movement, because we know that when you have =
the blessing of being able to walk and run,
 you don=92t take it for granted.&nbsp; So I was in the middle of everythin=
g.&nbsp; So it really wasn=92t like he was the preferred athlete; I was in =
the middle of everything.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And it was really, as Cra=
ig said, it wasn=92t until organized sports came into being, and there just=
 weren=92t opportunities for girls.&nbsp; There were no basketball -- there=
 weren=92t co-ed basketball leagues in our neighborhood.&nbsp;
 There weren=92t girls=92 leagues.&nbsp; I played softball, loved to play s=
oftball, but there were really no girls=92 teams.&nbsp; So I spent a lot of=
 time as a spectator because the opportunities weren=92t there.&nbsp; So th=
at=92s something that we have to really think of.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, Title 9 has changed =
this so dramatically, and we=92re fortunate.&nbsp; And if you live in the r=
ight neighborhood, like our girls, you have access to a whole range of spor=
ts.&nbsp; But that wasn=92t the case.&nbsp; And if you
 don=92t have the money in this society, you can=92t afford it.&nbsp; Craig=
 and I talk about the cost of keeping our kids in activities -- whether it=
=92s rec leagues or dance classes or whatever -- when the kids were little =
and they were doing everything, we were paying
 $8,000, $10,000 a year for fees, and uniforms, and new shoes because their=
 feet keep growing.&nbsp; And what family can afford that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we=92re really limitin=
g -- we=92re not developing our next level of fans and competitors.&nbsp; W=
e are missing out on a whole generation of kids who were like me who could =
have been like me, who could have been like Craig,
 but they don=92t even have the opportunity.&nbsp; And we fell into that a =
little bit, but it was more because of gender rather than resources.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. WILBON:&nbsp; It=92s =
been a passion of yours, too, for that gap to close completely; obviously, =
we start incrementally.&nbsp; But we should go back a little bit to Let=92s=
 Move! and the sort of transition into this area now.&nbsp;
 Because that truly has become a passion of yours, hasn=92t it?<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Oh, abs=
olutely.&nbsp; We started with Let=92s Move, and a lot of it was about nutr=
ition, because as a mom, I struggled with what many parents struggle with -=
- when you=92re busy and you=92ve got two parents working,
 how are you feeding your kids?&nbsp; You=92re going through the drive-thru=
 a little bit too much, you=92re incorporating processed foods a little bit=
 too much.&nbsp; You=92re doing too much takeout.&nbsp; And nowadays, kids =
have a hundred million channels to choose from, they=92ve
 got their iPhones and their iPads.&nbsp; So the whole range of physical ac=
tivity has changed, and as a result we=92re seeing obesity rates increase.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And you can see as a pare=
nt, being in it, and how that can happen.&nbsp; And I saw that as a parent.=
&nbsp; And I thought, well, here I am, a Princeton-Harvard-educated mom who=
 thought she was doing everything right.&nbsp; And
 at a point when my kids were little, the pediatrician was like, well, you=
=92ve got to watch these numbers, just tracking their weight and height on =
a regular basis.&nbsp; He was like, you=92ve got to change what you=92re do=
ing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And with some minor chang=
es -- cooking a little bit more, putting in more fruits and vegetables, cut=
ting out the sugary drinks -- we changed our kids=92 health outcomes in les=
s than six months.&nbsp; And our pediatrician
 was like, what did you do, because whatever you did, I need to carry it th=
rough my whole pediatric practice.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that=92s when we star=
ted talking about how he was seeing just high rates of obesity because kids=
 were having fast food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.&nbsp; They weren=92=
t getting recess anymore.&nbsp; Sports were being
 taken away from the schools.&nbsp; So I thought, well, when we get here to=
 the White House -- assuming that my husband wins -- we need to start infor=
ming parents about this.&nbsp; We need to start an education process.&nbsp;=
 Because everybody wants to do the best thing for
 their kids, but if they don=92t have the information and they think that w=
hat they=92re doing is the right thing when it=92s absolutely the opposite =
of the right thing, how will we fix it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So Let=92s Move! was the =
beginning of that, where we talked about nutrition.&nbsp; But you can=92t j=
ust talk about nutrition and not talk about physical activity, because it=
=92s all part of the same arm.&nbsp; So we eventually
 built on nutrition and started talking about physical activity, and on and=
 on and on.&nbsp; And here we are today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. WILBON:&nbsp; And I m=
ean schools -- this has to be a cooperative effort like we rarely see.&nbsp=
; And I want to ask you whether -- about that.&nbsp; Obviously, Craig, you =
have been involved at all levels of this, and at the
 highest level in terms of schools being involved.&nbsp; Take us through a =
little bit of what you saw and what you=92ve seen recently, not just as a c=
oach but also as a parent.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. ROBINSON:&nbsp; Well,=
 what I see, especially as a coach, but particularly as a parent, is you ha=
ve the gamut of parenting.&nbsp; You have, on one end, the over-parenting, =
where parents are trying to sort of force their
 kids into sports.&nbsp; And on the other end, I=92ve got -- my wife and I,=
 Kelly, have a six-year-old and a four-year-old, and we have the parents wh=
o bring their kids to the soccer field and are on their phones and sort of =
not paying attention.&nbsp; And then you have
 kids who don=92t have the -- they don=92t have the benefit of either, who =
are inside playing video games somewhere because they=92re priced completel=
y out of the sport market and the play market.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I think it really -- =
I mean, first and foremost, it starts with being able to play as a little k=
id.&nbsp; I mean, it=92s not safe to go outside and play.&nbsp; We talk abo=
ut this all the time, that back in Chatham and in
 South Shore and the places that we grew up, there were rough neighborhoods=
, but not like now.&nbsp; You could go outside and run around and play on y=
our block.&nbsp; So even if you weren=92t in organized sports, you could ru=
n and do stuff.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; And we =
would play all day, all day long.&nbsp; I mean, you would be rushing down y=
our breakfast to go out, and kids would organize themselves.&nbsp; I mean, =
whether it was playing Piggy, which was a softball
 game -- we played this game with the kids in the neighborhood just called =
Chase.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I don=92t even know if there was a point to =
it, but you were just being chased for a good chunk of the morning.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>

eah, I remember that.&nbsp; And all you had to do was report back to the ho=

the things that scares me -- this happened Sunday.&nbsp; I have an eight-ye=

 as safe as it=92s going to get in metropolitan Washington, right?&nbsp; So=
 I see my wife walking out of the house with a lawn chair around 2:00 on Su=

=92s the next Steph Curry.&nbsp; And she literally was going to take a lawn=
 chair just out near our garage space and watch him shoot
 on the next-door neighbor=92s basket.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I just thought, this =
is a different world in which we live.&nbsp; I mean, I would have gotten on=
 a bike and come over to South Shore, gone to Tuley Park -- I mean, at not =
much older than he is, at 10 and 11 years
 old -- and played all day on the South Side and never thought for a second=
 about being harmed.&nbsp; And I=92m sure -- just like you, I=92d check in =
-- you=92d check in at some point so your parents knew you were well.&nbsp;=
 But that is something that -- how do we address,
 how do we get our arms around that phenomenon?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. ROBINSON:&nbsp; Well,=
 it=92s going to be hard.&nbsp; And I think the days of going outside to pl=
ay are over.&nbsp; So you have to kind of, as a parent, decide what=92s imp=
ortant.&nbsp; I mean, you have this leisure time -- and for
 us and for our parents, our dad and -- Miche talked about how he was handi=
capped -- it never precluded him from coming home from work and going outsi=
de with us.&nbsp; And it think you need more of that at a very early age so=
 that you get trained in the mode of
 physical activity on a daily basis.&nbsp; And that=92s just the start.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; I mean,=
 I hope the days of playing outside aren=92t over and done with.&nbsp; I me=
an, there are communities that are more challenged because the streets have=
 been overrun with crime and so on and so forth,
 but there are still communities out there where people do live this life, =
where it is safe enough for kids to go out to play.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But now, you=92ve got to =
make sure you have enough of them, because if everybody is in an organized =
sport, if everybody=92s time is structured and you=92re the parent who=92s =
trying to put play back in, well you send your
 kids out to play and there=92s nobody to play with, because everybody is b=
ooked.&nbsp; They=92re scheduled.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that=92s where the di=
lemma comes in -- either you can=92t play outside because it=92s unsafe, or=
 you=92re the only kid playing outside because everybody else is over-speci=
alized, right?&nbsp; Because the thing about when
 we were growing up and Craig was into sports, you did every sport.&nbsp; H=
e played Little League, he played Bitty Basketball, he did the version of A=
AU basketball.&nbsp; But you weren=92t playing basketball for an entire yea=
r.&nbsp; You didn=92t have a shooting coach and a dribbling
 coach, and then you got your nutrition experts and your -- that=92s what I=
=92m seeing now, is that kids now have to pick one sport at the age of 10, =
and then become, like, Tiger Woods, right?&nbsp; That=92s our version.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So you=92re taking them o=
ut of the mix of even just having a regular play life.&nbsp; And that=92s p=
articularly true if your kid is athletic, because you feel like in order fo=
r them to compete, they have to be hyper focused
 on that sport.&nbsp; So you=92ve got parents now who have a great athlete,=
 and they=92ll be like, you can only play basketball because I don=92t want=
 you to get injured playing touch football.&nbsp; They become a commodity, =
and then they don=92t even have the concept of play.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Right now, I think if you=
 put a bunch of kids out in a field today, I don=92t think they would know =
what to do.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; We learned all these games -- Steal the=
 Bacon and Duck, Duck, Goose -- all of these things
 you learned at recess and in P.E., which in -- let=92s remember, in a lot =
of urban settings, those opportunities, recess and gym, don=92t exist anymo=
re for kids.&nbsp; So where are they even learning how to organize themselv=
es socially so that when you put them in
 a field, they actually aren=92t looking at the grass, but they start to, l=
ike, organize themselves?&nbsp; Kids these days don=92t even know how to do=
 that as well, because we=92ve taken all those opportunities away from them=
.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I hope it=92s not dead=
.&nbsp; There=92s a lot of things we can do to put it back in -- number one=
, making sure kids have recess at school.&nbsp; That=92s where they=92re sp=
ending most of their time.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That is just
 as important as math and science to kids.&nbsp; If you=92re a teacher and =
you=92re working with boys in particular, they can=92t sit still for an ent=
ire school day.&nbsp; They can=92t physically do it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, I have girls, and wa=
tching his two little boys come over -- I mean, they wear me out when they =
walk in the door.&nbsp; I=92m just like, fellas, sit down.&nbsp; They=92re =
always a little damp and sweaty and moist because
 they=92re moving all the time.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You touch them and =
it=92s like, why are you wet, little boy, get off of me!&nbsp; (Laughter.)&=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I feel for people with=
 boys in today=92s school systems where you don=92t let them move.&nbsp; So=
 how are we expecting them to be successful academically if the other part =
of their brain, that part that is movement and
 music and creativity, is not being exercised?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. WILBON:&nbsp; That le=
ads me to a point -- a question.&nbsp; I know you recently made an announce=
ment in Times Square with the U.S. Olympic Team regarding access to sports =
for all kids.&nbsp; And Let=92s Move! obviously has been
 at the forefront of that.&nbsp; Why is it so important -- and I don=92t ev=
en -- it=92s difficult to ask you what can be done -- but for organizations=
 in the private sector to value exactly what you=92re talking about and sor=
t of get behind -- if there can be momentum
 built?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; It=92s =
absolutely necessary.&nbsp; I mean, if we=92re at the place now in our soci=
eties where we don=92t want to be taxed to make sure that schools have it, =
if that=92s what we=92re saying -- we=92re cutting it out
 because we don=92t want to pay for the P.E. teacher, we don=92t want to pa=
y for the gym class, we don=92t want that to be a governmental responsibili=
ty -- well, then, it=92s up to all of you all corporate people.&nbsp; You=
=92ve got to trickle it down if that=92s the theory.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So it becomes even more c=
ritical for the big sports companies to be those facilitators of those acti=
vities.&nbsp; Because if you look at it from a business standpoint, where i=
s your fan base going to come from?&nbsp; If you=92ve
 got girls who never see sports, if you=92ve got kids who=92ve never touche=
d a basketball, who are you recruiting?&nbsp; And who=92s going to watch th=
e Olympics if kids don=92t know what half these sports are?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I mean, kids watch this s=
tuff because they want to play it.&nbsp; They=92re not spectators.&nbsp; So=
 if we want the Olympics to continue to thrive, then we need to facilitate =
some fans and some excitement.&nbsp; Those are those
 kids in the street who don=92t have recess anymore.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So if we=92ve taken it ou=
t of the schools and we don=92t value it, then it is going to be absolutely=
 imperative for corporate America to go into these schools and put some gym=
 and some sports back in.&nbsp; In the schools
 we grew up in -- and it=92s different from the schools my kids go to -- pr=
ivate schools where they have a sport -- almost every sport, every team for=
 boys and girls -- because the tuition is so high.&nbsp; You go to a public=
 school in the inner city and maybe they
 have a basketball team, in middle school.&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But you don=
=92t even get to really play sports until you go to high school, and that=
=92s if your high school can afford a sport.&nbsp; But they won=92t have fi=
eld hockey.&nbsp; They=92ll either have basketball or football,
 maybe a girls=92 team.&nbsp; If you don=92t have a pool, you=92re not goin=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I mean, let=92s just sort=
 of think about what we=92ve structured here for this generation.&nbsp; The=
se are our kids.&nbsp; So if we=92re not going to do it through the school =
systems, and we=92ve decided that as a people as a society
 that that=92s too expensive, or we don=92t trust that system to do it, the=
n who else is going to do it?&nbsp; We=92re just going to let sports just f=
ritter away in our culture?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So who=92s going to watch=
 the next Olympics?&nbsp; Because these kids won=92t be interested in it if=
 they don=92t know anything about it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. WILBON:&nbsp; Well, C=
raig, it seems like coaches are going to have to be at the forefront of any=
 cooperative with the private sector, because the private sector, even if -=
- obviously, financing this, not going to
 have the knowledge, the know-how to apply it.&nbsp; How do coaches fit in?=
&nbsp; Are you seeing coaches being hired in these capacities to sort of he=
lp this movement?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. ROBINSON:&nbsp; Well,=
 in a word, no.&nbsp; What we=92re missing is we=92re missing that guy -- m=
y old AU coach, Johnny Gage (ph) was a -- at the time, I thought he was muc=
h older than I was, but he coached us at the age of
 19.&nbsp; He=92s coaching 13-year-olds.&nbsp; And he wanted to be a coach.=
&nbsp; And you=92re not seeing a lot of those folks anymore.&nbsp; Everybod=
y is moving away to do something different.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That=92s one.&nbsp; So yo=
u don=92t see as many young coaches.&nbsp; They=92re gravitating to sort of=
 trying to get into the high-priced college and pro game.&nbsp; So you don=
=92t have grassroots guys, which then puts it back on the parents.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And our first coach was o=
ur father.&nbsp; I mean, he coached us every day.&nbsp; We were out there p=
laying, get down on the ground, baseball position, get your elbow in when y=
ou shoot; this is how you swim.&nbsp; And if we=92re
 not going to get professional coaches to help us do this, we=92ve got to, =
as a society, take responsibility as parents to do it, no matter how busy w=
e are.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. WILBON:&nbsp; What so=
rt of things -- I know you were involved in -- I don=92t know how you keep =
in the balls in the air.&nbsp; But to that end, Craig, tell us about some o=
f the things you=92re involved in now in addition
 to working and parenting.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. ROBINSON:&nbsp; Well,=
 in addition to, let=92s see, working at ESPN, and I=92ve got four kids -- =
one is working, one is in college and then two younger kids -- as much as I=
 can, I love going around and telling our story
 of how important athletics, sports, activity was in our lives.&nbsp; <o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And it was not as if our =
parents used it as a motivator, either -- oh, if you don=92t get good grade=
s, you can=92t play sports.&nbsp; It was just part of the fabric of growing=
 up, just like you get up in the morning, you
 eat, you go outside and play on days when you didn=92t have school.&nbsp; =
And when you were at school, you did your schoolwork, and then you went out=
side and played.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So what I=92m spending ti=
me doing is working and going around and talking about that in hopes that w=
e as parents sort of embrace the fact that we have these children.&nbsp; We=
 have to keep them active.&nbsp; Nobody is going
 to keep them active for us.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. WILBON:&nbsp; Mrs. Ob=
ama, I wanted to ask you about Project Play -- a report recently recognizin=
g that sports participation rates among youth living in households with the=
 lowest incomes are about half that of youth
 from wealthier homes.&nbsp; And we talked about this early.&nbsp; Are ther=
e other ways that we should be looking at to close that gap and make people=
 understand why it=92s important?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, a=
t some point, it=92s going to require an investment.&nbsp; So the question =
is, where do you make that investment?&nbsp; In the past, we made the inves=
tment in school, because everybody went to school or
 goes to school.&nbsp; So that was the easiest place -- recess, gym, sports=
 in school.&nbsp; That costs money.&nbsp; We hit a wall, so we stopped inve=
sting.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So then the next level of=
 investment comes in youth centers, sports clubs.&nbsp; But again, that=92s=
 an investment because you=92ve got to have places with gyms, and you=92ve =
got hire staff, you=92ve got to have equipment, you
 have to -- so if you look to the Boys and Girls Clubs, or youth leagues, t=
hat still requires and investment.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So at some level, we have=
 to kind of ask ourselves how much are we willing to invest in the kids in =
our society?&nbsp; Because at some point, we=92ve got to make that investme=
nt, even if it=92s an investment in better parks
 in every community, creating safe spaces where kids can go out to play.&nb=
sp; On the South Side, now, we had parks, and some of those parks just aren=
=92t -- they haven=92t been maintained.&nbsp; The sports fields don=92t wor=
k, the swings are broken.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In so many communities yo=
u have a place for a park, but it=92s going to take an investment to make i=
t a place that kids will actually use.&nbsp; So where does that investment =
come from?&nbsp; That=92s the city.&nbsp; So we don=92t want
 to do that anymore, so it=92s just -- slowly it=92s becoming a desert, a p=
lay desert.&nbsp; So many communities are becoming play deserts.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But in wealthy communitie=
s, there is a wealth of resources.&nbsp; You can be in field hockey, or you=
 can learn how to swim.&nbsp; There are aquatic centers and -- I=92ve seen =
the difference.&nbsp; The disparities are amazing to
 me.&nbsp; So are we saying that some kids are worthy of that investment an=
d physical activity, and then there are millions of others who aren=92t?&nb=
sp; And what=92s the role that we as a society have for making sure that ki=
ds have equal access?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But that=92s also true fo=
r music and art, and all of these wonderful things.&nbsp; That why Let=92s =
Move! is so important to me, because my view is, as a parent, is if I think=
 this is important for my kids, it=92s important
 for every kid.&nbsp; So it can=92t be good enough that my kid has it if th=
e vast majority of kids in this country don=92t have it.&nbsp; Because who =
are my kids going to play with?&nbsp; Who are they going to compete against=
?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I just hope that we g=
et out of that mentality of =93I got mine over here, and as long as mine ar=
e good, good luck.=94&nbsp; It=92s that =93eat or be eaten=94 kind of -- bu=
t that=92s basically what we=92re doing when it comes to
 sports.&nbsp; Because we=92re okay going into some neighborhoods where the=
re isn=92t even a field, but in other communities, there is every field -- =
there are more fields than there are kids.&nbsp; There are more opportuniti=
es than there are kids.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But we have to kind of lo=

 or 1992.&nbsp; My sports editor had a brilliant idea.&nbsp; He said, look,=
 why don=92t you go out to Los Angeles, find out if there=92s any connectio=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And my initial reaction w=

 settlement.&nbsp; And a couple of guys recognized me from television, and =
they said, hey, what are you doing out here?&nbsp; And I said, I want to kn=
ow if there=92s any sort of connection.&nbsp; What did you guys used to do?=
&nbsp; What did you do at 10, 11 and 12 years old, and
 do you still play?&nbsp; Do you still -- and all these guys are between 18=
 and 25 at this point.&nbsp; And they say, you know what, what are you doin=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And literally, they drove=
 me through South Central and other parts of L.A. where fields were overgro=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. WILBON:&nbsp; And som=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; When we=
 were growing up.&nbsp; Well, we can=92t be surprised with what kids do wit=
h idle time.&nbsp; And that=92s sort of one of the things -- when we look a=
t crime rates and all that sort of stuff, it=92s like, these
 are a bunch of bored kids that are unsupervised who don=92t know how to pl=
ay.&nbsp; If we start there -- and then we give them a gun.&nbsp; And then =
you=92ve got such a lethal combination.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Why can=92t we put those =
things together?&nbsp; Why are we confused about why crime rates are going =
up?&nbsp; It=92s not a complicated set of scenarios, unless people don=92t =
really understand just what a wasteland so many kids
 are living in in terms of activity.&nbsp; Maybe that=92s the case.&nbsp; M=
aybe people look at their lives and think, well, if my kids have it, then i=
t couldn=92t be that bad.&nbsp; It is that bad.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We are raising kids and w=
hole communities where there is no place for them to play.&nbsp; There=92s =
nothing for them to play with, nobody to play with, no supervision.&nbsp; A=
nd we wonder why they just go off on society.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this is essential, not=
 to mention the whole socialization piece.&nbsp; I mean, look at all the th=
ings we learned just by playing.&nbsp; We learned problem-solving.&nbsp; We=
 learned how to communicate.&nbsp; We learned how to resolve
 differences without an adult being there.&nbsp; We learned how to organize=
 our time when we were bored.&nbsp; We learned --

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. ROBINSON:&nbsp; Team =
work.&nbsp; We learned leadership.&nbsp; We were talking the other day -- m=
y four-year-old is learning math because he=92s trying to keep score when h=
e=92s playing against his brother.&nbsp; And there=92s just so
 many things that people who have decided to remove athletics and sports an=
d recreation from the system -- sort of like unintended consequences that t=
hey didn=92t think about.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. WILBON:&nbsp; Yes, I =
don=92t know that mine would be able to count, except he can get basketball=
 scores -- he=92d probably be able to get earned run average.&nbsp; That=92=
ll be the advanced math.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I guess we should probabl=
y close here soon.&nbsp; There=92s some fascinating things in all sort of a=
reas we could go into, but obviously, we=92d be remiss without talking abou=
t some possible solutions and whether or not
 we think we can get to the place that we all would like to arrive with bei=
ng able to reinstate, for starters, some of the things -- I mean, we=92ve g=
one backward, clearly, in this area.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I mean, looking at the pl=
aces that were available, the opportunities that were available to us when =
money wasn=92t at the forefront of it.&nbsp; Now you guys are scaring me, t=
alking about these fees.&nbsp; Because with an eight-year-old,
 I=92m just coming into that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Get rea=
dy.&nbsp; You=92ve got to save up for play these days.&nbsp; You=92ve got t=
o have a play scholarship fund.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You=92ve got colleg=
e scholarship, and then you=92ve got just play.&nbsp; It=92s going to cost =
you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. WILBON:&nbsp; The fee=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. ROBINSON:&nbsp; Well,=
 clearly, my sister is right on point with corporate America, but not just =
corporate America is going to see this.&nbsp; I think it=92s places that yo=
u and I work for, like ESPN, who have such a broad
 reach and are reliant upon future sports fans.&nbsp; They have to be a sta=
keholder, which they are, but has to continue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The shoe companies who ma=
ke a ton of money off of these same young kids, but not because they=92re w=
earing their shoes out playing, they=92re wearing them out as --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Fa=
shion --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. ROBINSON:&nbsp; -- I =
heard somebody over there, as a fashion statement.&nbsp; That is exactly ri=
ght.&nbsp; You need to have places like Nike and Adidas and Under Armor be =
your stakeholders.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I would be remiss if -- y=
ou=92ve got to have your professional athletes, the guys who have made it, =
have to -- as hard as it is, they have to be a standard-bearer for this.&nb=
sp; It is really a team effort.&nbsp; And that=92s
 just to start, from my perspective.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And then, as I keep harpi=
ng on, it has to be the family.&nbsp; I mean, it=92s tough for families who=
 don=92t have a lot, and a single-parent family where the mom or the dad is=
 doing everything on their own.&nbsp; They come home
 from work, they=92re too tired to play -- well, I had both my parents, but=
 I don=92t get it because my dad had MS and he was out there every day work=
ing a swing shift, and he=92s taking us up to the park and pitching to her,=
 and I=92m catching out in the field, and
 we=92re playing a three-person baseball game.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that=92s just to start=
.&nbsp; And I think we can do it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; We have=
 to.&nbsp; This isn=92t something that=92s an option.&nbsp; It=92s the thin=
g that keeps our society healthy and whole.&nbsp; It=92s the investment we =
make in that next generation.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But I would say -- there =
are so many great programs already out there.&nbsp; This is the thing -- th=
is is where the investment comes in.&nbsp; Just like with schools, we know =
what great schools look like.&nbsp; It=92s not like it=92s
 a mystery.&nbsp; There are thousands of really great school -- public scho=
ols and charter schools, and you name them.&nbsp; The question is how do we=
 replicate the good stuff?&nbsp; It=92s an investment.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the same thing is tru=
e with a whole range of programs.&nbsp; We have Let=92s Move! in schools, w=
here Nike is working to help teachers think of creative ways to put movemen=
t back into the school day.&nbsp; You=92ve got a lot
 of corporations that are already sponsoring some really good initiatives.&=
nbsp; You=92ve got -- in some cities, where they=92ve found how important s=
ports can be in community policing in South Central L.A.&nbsp; You=92ve got=
 police officers who are setting up football leagues,
 and they=92re redeveloping whole relationships between law enforcement and=
 kids in those communities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">If we wanted to just line=
 up all the programs that are working and find out which ones are really wo=
rking and why and which ones work in urban settings and rural settings, we =
probably already have the answers.&nbsp;
 Now we have to scale it.&nbsp; And that goes back to priority, intent, and=
 investment.&nbsp; Because none of it is free.&nbsp; We=92ve just shifted t=
he burden back on families to say, it=92s up to you:&nbsp; So if you have r=
esources, you=92re going to be good.&nbsp; But if you don=92t, well,
 your kids are going to be hanging out in the street, and then we=92ll be m=
ad at you because you don=92t your kids under control.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But this has to become a =
priority in our society.&nbsp; We can=92t just sort of think that, well, ki=
ds in play, I mean, we can figure this out, this isn=92t my problem.&nbsp; =
This is all of our problems.&nbsp; From the government
 to the military -- this is where Mark was talking about -- kids who aren=
=92t playing sports show up at training unprepared to serve because you put=
 a backpack on a kid who doesn=92t run or hasn=92t run and tell them to run=
 10 miles, they fracture something, and
 then who=92s got to pay for that?&nbsp; Or if they=92re not eating well --=
 because they=92ve had soda most of their live, now they have dental issues=
 that the military is covering.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This affects all of us.&n=
bsp; Play and nutrition and overall investment in our kids -- whether they =
can read and think and engage -- it=92s just not enough for us to be okay w=
ith so many kids not having that at an excellent
 level.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So whatever the dollar fi=
gure is, as a society, as taxpayers and as corporate America and who -- we =
should figure out how much that costs, and then pay for it.&nbsp; Period.&n=
bsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. WILBON:&nbsp; Yes, be=
cause we=92d pay a lot less on the front end than we=92d do on the back.&nb=
sp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Just as a way of closing,=
 it starts with all of us, those of us who, whether we=92re entrepreneurial=
 and have our own things going on, or whether we=92re working for entities =
that need to be invested locally -- and
 by locally, I mean the most local way, right there, right at home.&nbsp; W=
hen you see the neglect that has to be reversed and proactively, children w=
ho need to be introduced to this if they=92re not already.&nbsp; And obviou=
sly, Let=92s Move! and Project Play have been
 at the forefront of this for a while now, and I think we should thank Crai=
g and thank the First Lady again for coming to discuss something that=92s s=
o vital and important and compelling to any community -- thank them for bei=
ng here, both of you, and taking your
 time to discuss this.&nbsp; It=92s fascinating.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Well th=

.&nbsp; This is a room full of people who are putting these issues front an=

 I can start Let=92s Move! and get some attention around it, but, as I say =
to many of you when I meet you, you all are the ones doing the hard work on=
 the ground every day.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I know it has been a =

 And we just need more of you, that=92s all.&nbsp; You have to go replicate=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But we=92re in a room ful=
