Trump=92s Super Secret Policy Ghostwriter<http://www.thedailybeast.com/arti=
cles/2016/04/27/inside-donald-trump-s-secret-policy-shop.html>
Daily Beast =96 Tim Mak

In the fall of 2015, Donald Trump had an early attempt at reinvention, rele=
asing a series of tax and veterans administration proposals with the intent=
ion of adding some policy substance to the businessman=92s rhetoric.
It was one Trump=92s first attempts to transition from entertainer to candi=
date=97a common narrative that has failed to last more than a day or two. I=
n fact, there have been so many reinventions=97on so many topics=97that it=
=92s hard to know what version of Trump we=92re on.
But he has established a pattern: as much as he derides the Washington esta=
blishment, if he sees that a reinvention is needed, he=92ll find an insider=
 to help him do it. This was the case with the recent hires of longtime D.C=
. lobbyist Paul Manafort and former Republican National Committee political=
 director Rick Wiley.
The veterans and tax plan were no different.
Initially, it was a mystery who wrote the plans that Trump had put out=97th=
e only hint was a $82,000 charge for in policy consulting work listed in Tr=
ump=92s campaign filings with the Federal Election Commission under the nam=
e =91JBC Research, LLC,=92=97payments which started in the fall and ended i=
n December 2015.
The author, it turns out, is one of the best-known policy and opposition re=
searchers in D.C.
The company has not been associated with any other federal campaigns, and t=
here is nothing specific about it online. The only indication of who JBC Re=
search might be affiliated with was the address

If you go to the front desk and asks for JBC Research, you=92ll be directed=
 to the offices for Delve, a recently-formed opposition research firm found=
ed by GOP operative Jeff Berkowitz, a veteran of the Republican National Co=
mmittee, the State Department and the George W. Bush White House=97not exac=
tly the first person you=92d expect to be involved in the Trump campaign.

Berkowitz, according to his LinkedIn page, specializes in =93competitive in=
telligence and opposition research for companies, campaigns and causes.=94 =
He worked on a presidential campaign for Rudy Giuliani, who is supporting T=
rump. He is a longtime activist for conservative and Republican causes stre=
tching back to the 1990s.
But nowhere online or in his LinkedIn page is =91JBC Research=92 listed.
JBC Research is an entity separate from Delve that focuses only on policy w=
ork, Berkowitz told The Daily Beast, and JBC Research did not do any opposi=
tion research for the Trump campaign.
=93Last summer, a mutual associate familiar with our policy analysis capabi=
lities asked us to assist in developing policy papers connecting the campai=
gn=92s vision with tried and true conservative policy proposals on tax refo=
rm, economic growth, and support for our veterans,=94 Berkowitz said. =93We=
=92re happy to have assisted in developing these specific proposals, as we =
have done for any number of center-right campaigns and clients.=94
Their work for the Trump campaign finished in October, with payments throug=
h December 2015=97and no further work was done or requested, Berkowitz said=
.
This week Trump is trying yet another reinvention, with a series of speeche=
s intended to demonstrate his intellectual fitness for office, starting wit=
h a foreign policy talk Wednesday. That=92s an attempt to reboot after he a=
nnounced a roster of foreign policy advisers in March who were mostly unkno=
wn in national security circles=97including one who listed the questionable=
 credential of participating in a model United National conference on his L=
inkedIn page.
Odds are that he=92ll have paid for, and will do his best Wednesday to soun=
d like, the Beltway experts he so often likes to bash=97at least when he=92=
s not paying to tap their ideas.
