[Bernie Sanders for President]

Sisters and Brothers -

The political revolution is not just about electing a president. We need a =
Congress with members who believe, like Bernie, that we cannot change a cor=
rupt system by taking its money.

So let me introduce you to Tim Canova, a progressive challenger who is runn=
ing against Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a Democratic primary in Florid=
a this year.

Tim endorsed Bernie=92s presidential campaign, and was inspired to run beca=
use of Wasserman Schultz=92 support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. His c=
ampaign is funded like ours, by lots of people giving small amounts of mone=
y.

And on issues like taking on Wall Street, making tuition free at public col=
leges, and reforming our broken campaign finance system, he is someone you =
can be proud to support. That's why Bernie is endorsing Tim's campaign, and=
 why we=92re proud to ask:

Splitting a $2.70 contribution between Bernie 2016 and Tim Canova for Congr=
ess will help elect progressives up and down the ballot while sending an UN=
MISTAKABLE message about our political revolution=92s commitment to electin=
g candidates who share our values.<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/pa=
ge/canova-for-congress?refcode=3Dem160522-s1-full>

A few weeks ago, we raised a tremendous amount of money for three progressi=
ve candidates for Congress. Your support changed their races overnight. In =
the days ahead, we=92re going to add a dozen or more additional candidates =
to that list.

We=92re doing this because it is too late for establishment politics and es=
tablishment economics. We need real change. We need U.S. Senators, members =
of Congress and state legislators who have the guts to take on the big mone=
y interests whose greed is destroying the American middle class.

Tim Canova is one of those candidates, and I hope you=92ll join Bernie in s=
upport of his campaign:

Split a $2.70 contribution between Bernie 2016 and Tim Canova for Congress =
today. This is important.<https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/canova=
-for-congress?refcode=3Dem160522-s1-full>

Thank you for powering this political revolution.

All my best,

Jeff Weaver
