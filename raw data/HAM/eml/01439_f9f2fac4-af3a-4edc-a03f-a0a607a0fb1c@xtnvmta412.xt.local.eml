POLITICO MAGAZINE's annual Media Issue is out this morning, showing a Trump's-eye-view of a horde of cameras and mikes: "What Have We Done?" Susan Glasser's Editor's Note, "Introducing the Media (Trump) Issue http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=023a79d5a21acafa49cc7e7fb0cee79c16cf0386e646453c3e4f0d4f0dfa32cd ...

--MICHAEL GRUNWALD, "The Selling of Obama: The inside story of how a great communicator lost the narrative": "Obama veterans ... cite the challenges of driving a complex message through the horrific crisis he inherited. They blame the intensifying polarization of the public judging him ... They recognize the contrast between his pristine campaign vision of change and the change he's been grinding out in the real world ... Most of all, they cite the dizzying changes in modern media, where Americans get their news where they choose, where conflict is the click of the realm, where lies travel at the speed of tweet while the truth is still annotating its Medium post.

"They blame short-attention-span journalism for creating a distorted narrative of a flailing presidency, by freaking out over crises-double-digit unemployment, the Gulf oil spill, the healthcare.gov malfunction, Ebola-and virtually ignoring their resolutions. They think the bully pulpit has lost much of its power in an era of 24-hour cable and social media, though they admit they were slow to adjust to the new realities." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=023a79d5a21acafa057ddb48506e565c3ff991dce97a63c7756b41c6fe890b72

--FIRST PERSON - BEN SCHRECKINGER, "Inside Trump's Press Pen: A reporter's first campaign job blows up into the biggest story in America": "I was strolling with my parents through the National Postal Museum in Washington last October-a rare day off the Donald Trump trapeze-when I peered at Twitter and saw that I, like so many other reporters before and since, had suddenly drawn Trump's ire. Six hundred miles to the south ... the Republican presidential front-runner was railing against me over a story I hadn't even written yet. ... 'So we have this guy. I don't know his name,' Trump said ... 'B-e-nnnnnn Schreckinger! Every single article is a horror show. I'm winning in the polls-he said I
 should've done better!' ...

"[H]is aides had yelled at me on the phone and berated me in person; I figured this was standard for covering a high-stakes campaign and didn't take it too personally. But this was suddenly pretty personal. ... It was disturbing and also, oddly, a bit thrilling to be name-checked by a celebrity who can elevate anyone from obscurity. ... A candidate who puts reporters in pens, who talked as much about me as about the Islamic State at a big rally, who thinks it's a good idea to revisit the First Amendment, isn't really winning-or he wouldn't be doing those things." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=023a79d5a21acafaf8ec501d46c6b169b4f92aedbbea65767f95a3664d6deeb1

CAMPBELL BROWN, "Why I Blame TV for Trump: A former cable host says the industry utterly caved to the candidate": "A 'beaming' Jeff Zucker, president of CNN Worldwide, told New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg, 'These numbers are crazy-crazy.' But if their bosses are frank about the great ratings, some of my friends left at the cable networks are in various degrees of denial. ... [T]he most universal comment I hear: 'At least this shows how much we still matter.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=023a79d5a21acafa72474c734d86cec9fb954fb394f543b84717e9c2d93d7227

SUSAN GLASSER AND MICHAEL KRUSE, "Trumpology: A Master Class -- There are five people who've gone deeper on The Donald than anyone else alive. We brought them together for the definitive conversation about who he really is": "Want to know where Trump inherited his entrepreneurial bent? Gwenda Blair traces it to his grandfather, who ran a series of restaurants in the Klondike that featured some of the best food in town ... Who was really doing the deals that made Trump famous? Wayne Barrett will tell you the only signature that really mattered on a contract belonged to Trump's father, Fred. What broke up Trump's first marriage? Harry Hurt III writes that Ivana 'confided to female friends
 that Donald had difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection.'

"How did a man who came perilously close to personal financial ruin sell himself as a master dealmaker? By exaggerating everything, including his net worth, which Timothy O'Brien revealed was far less than advertised. And if you wonder what now drives Trump's pursuit of the White House, Michael D'Antonio has argued it's the same deep neediness he felt as a child and that has fueled every business deal and attention-chasing stunt since then."  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=023a79d5a21acafa346e0d98370380521cccfa1db2d197bf4228f7fcf14dcb84

 

SNEAK PEEK - POTUS on the upcoming cover of N.Y. Times Magazine's "The Money Issue": "Eight Years After The Crash: Unemployment is at 5 percent, deficits are down and the Obama economy is growing. Why do so many voters feel left behind?" President Obama to Andrew Ross Sorkin: "I actually compare our economic performance to how, historically, countries that have wrenching financial crises perform. By that measure, we probably managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history. ... If you look at the platforms, the economic platforms of the current Republican candidates for president, they don't simply defy logic and any known economic theories, they are fantasy."

CAUGHT ON CAMERA -- "NRCC launches probe on hidden camera in '60 Minutes' piece," by Jake Sherman and Hadas Gold: "The '60 Minutes' piece, which aired Sunday, had hidden-camera footage of the NRCC's private headquarters, including shots of rooms from which members make fundraising calls. ... The organization's leadership has narrowed down when the footage was shot this spring ... Officials are confident they will be able to figure out who brought the hidden camera in. CBS did ask for official permission to shoot video in the NRCC headquarters, but the House campaign committee turned them down." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=023a79d5a21acafab31741cb052561625cec581fd7710b74a0785ad6faacd3f8

THE TRUMP DOCTRINE: @MarkHalperin: "If Bush 43 or @MittRomney had given this Trump speech as prez candidates, it would be hailed as good politics & interesting worldview" ... @newtgingrich:"Washington elites mock Trump for mispronouncing Tanzania. They don't get it. He said the most important word correctly: America. He gets it. ... This was a serious foreign policy speech by Trump. It is worth reading and thinking about. It will be ridiculed by Washington elites."

 

JOE SCARBOROUGH, on "Morning Joe," said Trump positioned him to Hillary Clinton's left: "She is going to be the neocon and he is going to be the one preaching restraint in foreign entanglements ... almost isolationist, anti-interventionist. ... He's once again ... tapped into the angst of a lot of Americans."

 

--RICHARD HAASS, CFR president, on "Morning Joe": "A Clinton is about to be outflanked to the left."

 

--MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Capitol Hill reactions to Trump - as epitomized by Speaker Ryan on "Morning Joe" yesterday, and reaction to the speech by Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker - is dialing down from "Whoa! That's frightening" to "I can work with that."

 

--WILLIE GEIST: "They probably think they can SHAPE him."

 

--@LindseyGrahamSC: "Are we sure the guy running the teleprompter has the pages in the right order? #notmakinganysense ... Did teleprompter guy actually write the speech? ... Trump speech is pathetic in terms of understanding the role America plays in the world, how to win War on Terror, and threats we face ... Ronald Reagan must be rolling over in his grave."

 

BACKSTORY on Trump's declaration that "'America first' will be the major and overriding theme of my administration": Back in 1941, aviator Charles Lindbergh was a major promoter of a group called the America First Committee, which didn't want America to intervene in World War II.

--Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer started using the term last fall in reference to Trump -- in updates to clients, speeches, on TV, even on Bill Maher's show, Bremmer told Daniel. In late March, David Sanger asked Trump whether that phrase described him. Trump replied: "I'm not isolationist, but I am America first. I like the expression." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=023a79d5a21acafa9c6de8e90b0640b2f04aa9333fba48ba6a0219b3f325d8ce

 

--@ianbremmer tweeted yesterday: "It's official: Trump embraces my 'America First' label for US foreign policy. I hadn't meant it as a compliment."

His r&eacute;sum&eacute; is perfect for 2016 and beyond ... 3. His geographic and personal story has party-base and general appeal ... 4.

INSIDE THE CAMPAIGNS -- "Sanders campaign begins laying off staff," by Gabe Debenedetti in Terre Haute, Ind.: "Bernie Sanders' campaign started letting field staffers go on Wednesday, hours after five states in the Northeast voted and the Vermont senator fell further behind Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination ... The extent of the cuts are unclear, but staffers who were working in states that voted Tuesday were told to look elsewhere for work rather than continue onto the next voting states." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=023a79d5a21acafabefdf0e677eeab291ce257f211391d64feb5f091d988f116

Visitors to cruzfiorina.com are now redirected to a page that Mackowiak set up to raise money for leukemia and lymphoma research. ...
