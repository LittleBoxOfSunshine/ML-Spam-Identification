DNC Chair Statement on Latest Developments in Planned Parenthood Shooting
WASHINGTON - Following the latest revelations into the motive behind Friday=
's shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, CO, DNC Cha=
ir Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement:


"The details that have emerged on Friday's shootings in Colorado Springs ma=
ke it clear that the attack on civilians and law enforcement there was an a=
ct of terrorism. Tragically, this horrific attack against Planned Parenthoo=
d is not isolated to this instance. Since 1993, at least eight people<http:=
//www.prochoiceamerica.org/media/fact-sheets/abortion-anti-choice-violence.=
pdf>- four doctors, two clinic employees, a security guard, and a clinic es=
cort - have been murdered in the United States in incidents of anti-choice =
violence, including a doctor shot to death in 2009 while serving as an ushe=
r at a church. Since the politically-motivated campaign to defund Planned P=
arenthood began this summer with the release of a series of misleading and =
debunked videos, there have been four attacks on Planned Parenthood centers=
 in the U.S. according to the Southern Poverty Law <https://www.splcenter.o=
rg/hatewatch/2015/10/02/four-arsons-74-days-planned-parenthood-clinics> Cen=
ter.
"Those running for president and those of us in leadership roles in our cou=
ntry's major political parties have an obligation to denounce these attacks=
 and clearly say that violence and intimidation in the pursuit of ideology =
are not acceptable in America. Politicians who peddle lies, whether about P=
lanned Parenthood or immigrants, and those who encourage roughing up Americ=
ans who have different opinions have a particular obligation and responsibi=
lity to denounce these acts of terror. In addition to the attacks on Planne=
d Parenthood we've seen assaults on Hispanics, the shooting of Black Lives =
Matter protesters, and ugly shouts at campaign rallies that have gone uncha=
llenged. No political gain is worth what this reckless, dangerous rhetoric =
is doing to our country, and it must come to an end.
"In the Planned Parenthood case it's especially troubling that there has be=
en no meaningful reaction from Republican candidates and political leaders.=
 This shameful silence is becoming a theme for Republicans, who are all too=
 ready to denounce a three year old refugee but not acts committed by a dom=
estic terrorist like what we saw Friday.
"We must recommit as a nation to safeguarding the freedoms of every America=
n, regardless of whether we agree with them or not. No person should ever h=
ave to fear for their life when seeking medical care, including women who h=
ave a constitutional right to a safe and legal abortion, and no person shou=
ld be intimidated or assaulted because of their ethnicity, or because they =
are peacefully assembling in protest. Women have the right to make their ow=
n choices about their own health care without politicians, their bosses, or=
 a violent criminal with a gun standing in their way. If they want to take =
the oath of office, politicians have to be willing to protect the rights, f=
reedoms, and democratic principles that already made America great."
