TALKING POINTS


Topline Message

  *   This week Donald Trump is essentially becoming the presumptive nomine=
e for the Republican Party, and despite what his new handler Paul Manafort =
says, it=92s not just a =93part=94 Dangerous Donald has =93been playing.=94=
 Trump is campaigning on the same ugly and divisive politics that Republica=
n leaders have embraced for years, and any of their candidates would be dan=
gerous and damaging to our nation.
  *   We=92re confident we=92ll have a much stronger candidate, not only be=
cause voters agree that our primary is energizing the Party, but because ou=
r candidates are serious, substantive, and their values are in line with wh=
ere the American people are today, well into the 21st century.
  *   The choice is clear. We can move America forward with Democrats, buil=
d on 7 years of progress that took us from the Republican Recession to the =
economy we have today and its over 14 million new jobs. We can continue to =
move toward becoming a more inclusive, dynamic, and competitive country. Or=
 we can get dragged backwards by Republicans who would undo every bit of pr=
ogress our country has made.
  *   We like our odds, but we=92re not going to take anything for granted,=
 we=92re going to work hard, we=92re going to ask the American people for t=
heir vote, and a Democrat is going to win in November.


Key Message:


  *   Our primary and caucus contests have undoubtedly strengthened our par=
ty. In New York on Tuesday, exit polls showed that nearly 7 out of every 10=
 Democrats believe that this campaign has energized the Party.


  *   That=92s consistent with what we saw in Wisconsin where 7 out of 10 D=
emocrats in those exit polls said they were excited or optimistic about bot=
h of our candidates.


  *   That=92s something we=92re not seeing on the Republican side where se=
rious questions have been raised about their understanding of the issues, n=
ot to mention their temperament given how ugly, divisive and insulting they=
=92ve been.


  *   Their own voters know it. Just 39% of Republicans in New York think t=
hat their campaign has energized their party. In Wisconsin 4 out of 10 Repu=
blican primary voters=85let me say that again=85Republican primary voters s=
aid they fear what a Trump presidency would do to our country. And roughly =
a third would rather stay home, vote for a third party, or vote for a Democ=
rat than support either Trump or Cruz.


  *   That=92s stunning, but it tells you that Democrats are heading into N=
ovember in a far stronger position than Republicans.


  *   Whichever side you=92re on, it=92s clear that our two candidates have=
 consistently offered strong, well thought-out visions for our country that=
 would move America forward.


  *   We just marked 100 days until our conventions, and I=92m more confide=
nt than ever we=92ll be united and strong heading out of ours, while Republ=
icans continue to struggle to defend a bankrupt ideology and divisive campa=
igns that aren=92t worthy of the American people.


  *   Down the stretch, in any campaign, you expect the candidates and thei=
r supporters to step it up, to lay it all on the line, and we=92re certainl=
y seeing that on the Democratic side.


  *   But Democrats can be proud of our candidates, who even through fierce=
 campaigning have had an incredibly substantive debate about the future of =
our country. Our candidates are well prepared, and they=92re not afraid to =
take tough questions.


  *   Voters want to see that the men and women running to serve as their p=
resident have the energy, the enthusiasm, the fire in the belly. Both of ou=
r Democratic candidates proved they=92ve got that fire, and that they are r=
eady to fight on behalf of the American people.


  *   Even Republicans are abandoning the Republican Party. You=92ve alread=
y seen Republican candidates in tight races, like Senator Kirk in Illinois =
and John McCain =96 the GOP nominee eight years ago =96 say they will not a=
ttend their own convention in Cleveland. But don=92t let them fool you, the=
y=92re not any better than the top of their ticket.

GOP Frontrunner Trump Does Not Have the Temperament to Be Commander-in-Chie=
f


  *   Donald Trump=92s new chief advisor, Paul Manafort, said that Trump=92=
s outrageous behavior on the campaign trail is simply a =93part he=92s been=
 playing=94 and that Trump is =93evolving=94 to become more presidential. R=
eally?


  *   The candidate we have been watching on the campaign trail over the pa=
st year is the same Donald Trump that will occupy the Oval Office if we don=
=92t stand up now. . He will govern with the same inappropriate, xenophobic=
 and divisive behavior, because that is who Donald Trump is.


  *   But there=92s a bigger issue here, Donald Trump IS the Republican Par=
ty. He may have been more direct and outrageous in how he campaigned over t=
he past few months, but make no mistake that the ugly and dangerous rhetori=
c and policies he=92s pitching are what the Republican Party has been drivi=
ng for years.


  *   He called for punishing women who have abortions in the same week Ted=
 Cruz and John Kasich reiterated they he opposes the right of a woman to a =
safe and legal abortion EVEN in the cases of rape and incest. And Trump rei=
terated this week he wouldn=92t make an exception for the health of a woman=
.
  *   They all deny climate change.
  *   They all have economic plans focused on tax cuts for the wealthy that=
 would drag our economy backwards.
  *   And they all embrace the same divisive and offensive positions on imm=
igrants and wanting to deport DREAMers.


  *   Words matter. Republicans know their primary has been divisive, and i=
n fact it has already done a great deal of damage to our country and our st=
anding in the world. We=92ve already seen a spike in bullying<http://www.hu=
ffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-effect-southern-poverty-law-center_us_570e8619=
e4b03d8b7b9f2836> and racial tensions in our schools, as students try to mi=
mic Trump. And, he=92s inflamed tensions around the world with his irrespon=
sible comments.


But this week Trump came out in support of the LGBT community on the North =
Carolina bathroom bill, speaking out against HB2 and saying it should be le=
ft to the states. Will Trump be able to win over moderates with what Manafo=
rt is promising will be a new tone in the general election?


  *   There=92s a bigger issue here. Trump may have been more direct and ou=
trageous in how he campaigned over the past few months, but make no mistake=
 that the ugly and dangerous rhetoric and is what the Republican Party has =
been driving for years.
  *   Republicans can=92t separate themselves from Trump, and he won=92t be=
 able to separate himself from the ugly things he, his fellow candidates, a=
nd the leadership of the Republican Party have said for years.
  *   If Donald Trump becomes President, if Republicans take over the White=
 House, they will drag America backwards on everything from LGBT rights, to=
 the economic progress we=92ve made under President Obama.
  *   Taking a new tone for the general election can=92t erase the damage T=
rump himself has done with his ugly rhetoric, and it won=92t make up for wh=
at Republicans have done when in office and what they=92re promising to do =
if they win.


Dangerous Donald Lacks the Temperament and Judgment to be President


  *   The Economy: Trump=92s unfounded predictions<http://www.cnbc.com/2016=
/04/03/trump-predicts-very-massive-recession-in-us.html> of recession and w=
arnings against investing in the stock market are reckless, and economists =
have already predicted his policies could start an international trade war =
and cause a global recession.
  *   Foreign Policy: Trump=92s threat to pull back from our most important=
 military alliances<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-an=
d-the-end-of-nato/2016/03/04/e8c4b9ca-e146-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.htm=
l> in NATO sends a dangerous message, which is particularly troubling in li=
ght of his past praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
  *   Nuclear Proliferation: Last week, Trump refused to say he wouldn=92t =
use nuclear weapons on European territory, then suggested South Korea<http:=
//www.salon.com/2016/04/04/his_most_terrifying_interview_yet_why_trumps_sit=
_down_with_bob_woodward_should_have_america_petrified/> and Japan should ei=
ther develop nuclear weapons or pay the United States for protection agains=
t North Korea.
  *   On abortion: Last week Trump took multiple positions on abortion - fr=
om a dangerous and offensive call to punish women who get an abortion, to s=
aying he would allow states to restrict women=92s rights, to saying abortio=
n laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial appointments.

Joint Fundraising Committees

  *   We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the D=
NC and state parties.
  *   Similar agreements were set up with both the Clinton campaign and the=
 Sanders campaign early in the cycle, precisely because of the urgency to b=
uild a strong national infrastructure now that will help elect Democrats up=
 and down the ballot in November. The Sanders campaign has not used theirs.


  *   It=92s important to note, the funds that the DNC and state parties ge=
t through the joint victory funds help strengthen, for example, our nationa=
l voter file and communications, research and digital support for state par=
ties and down ballot candidates. That includes training across a variety of=
 areas, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid response supp=
ort. This is helping us build infrastructure for the general election.


  *   These arrangements are not new or unusual. Similar joint fundraising =
committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 2008 and =
2012. And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using=
 joint victory funds.


  *   And let=92s be clear, neither the DNC nor state parties are subsidizi=
ng fundraising through these committees for either campaign. For whatever e=
ach campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign, t=
hat campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundr=
aising.


Contested Convention / Arizona Lawsuit


  *   It is way too early to discuss the questions of a contested conventio=
n. There are nearly twenty contests still to play out, including tonight=92=
s primary in New York.


  *   Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders are drawing sharp differences w=
ith one another, but their differences remain focused on how to best move A=
merica forward.


  *   They=92re focused on how to make sure our government reflects the val=
ues of the American people, that we have an economy and a democracy that ar=
e inclusive, and that we respect everyone in America.


  *   And last Thursday we our ninth debate saw showed that they both see t=
he bigger picture.


  *   The Democratic National Committee and our Senatorial Campaign Committ=
ee are suing officials in Arizona whose decisions led to voters having to w=
ait for hours to vote during their March primaries, and many to be disenfra=
nchised as a result.


  *   If you want to talk about rigging elections, that=92s the real exampl=
e, and it=92s a serious problem and we=92re glad both our candidates are in=
terested in supporting that. In Maricopa County, officials reduced the numb=
er of polling locations to just 1 for every 21,000 people. That=92s seven e=
ight times what it was in other parts of the state, and it shows you the ma=
gnitude of the efforts to make it harder to vote that Republicans are champ=
ioning all across the country.


  *   And it=92s not just Arizona, you had a member of Congress from Wiscon=
sin, Glenn Grothman, who flat out said that they expected they could now wi=
n Wisconsin because of the Voter ID law. It was his Kevin McCarthy moment, =
and the type of rigging of the system we=92re not going to put up with.


  *   When voters go to the polls in November, they can be certain that the=
 Democratic nominee will have the temperament and judgment to serve as comm=
ander in chief, and that's not something you can say about the Republican c=
andidates.


Clinton=92s Speeches and Sanders=92 Taxes


  *   Our job at the Party isn=92t to handicap our own primary, we=92re not=
 going to referee.


  *   There are real differences, but they=92re with the Republicans, and w=
hile you have to expect that the candidates are going to draw sharp differe=
nces, they=92re also highlighting what a much better option voters have wit=
h Democrats.


  *   Just look at the issue of taxes as millions of Americans filed last w=
eek yesterday, but most of them didn=92t get to take advantage of special l=
oopholes or get special breaks. Yet every single Republican plan for the ec=
onomy is based on tax cuts for those at the very top of the income scale. I=
t=92s exactly the economic policy that the Bush Administration had as they =
drove us toward the great recession.


  *   So ultimately those are the differences that will matter most in Nove=
mber.


Cruz

  *   The vast majority of his Republican colleagues can barely muster a st=
raight face to say anything nice or positive about him!


  *   Lindsey Graham crassly talked about how no one in the Senate would ob=
ject if he was killed on the Senate floor, and said that endorsing him over=
 Trump was the equivalent of choosing to get poisoned over being shot.


  *   Senator Jim Risch of Idaho =96 TWICE =96 gave one of the most passive=
, non-endorsement endorsements I=92ve ever seen.


  *   It=92s going to be very difficult for Senators and Congress members t=
o run alongside a presidential nominee they really don=92t like! And if the=
se guys are reluctant to show their support for a Senate colleague, I am no=
t sure how the American people will be able to back Cruz either.


The GOP=92s Problem with Women Voters


Trump is viewed unfavorably by 7 out of 10 women, but both of his primary o=
pponents showed this week that they would also alienate women voters with t=
heir policies as the nominee.


  *   Kasich said that he wants to see Roe v. Wade repealed<https://www.you=
tube.com/watch?v=3DlAoKQM1sv0M&feature=3Dyoutu.be>, and when asked what kin=
d of punishment that would lead to, he evaded the question by saying that i=
t should be left to the states.


  *   Cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped, she should be=
 forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to term.


  *   In the past, the Republican candidates have opposed ensuring equal pa=
y, family leave, and voted against the Violence Against Women Act.


This past Tuesday was Equal Pay Day was a couple week ago, the day in 2016 =
when women=92s earnings have caught up with men=92s earnings from 2015. On =
average we earn 79 cents to their dollar, and it=92s worse for women of col=
or. All of the Republican presidential candidates would stand against prote=
ctions that ensure greater equality in the workplace.


  *   John Kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we don=92t=
 need workplace protections, just a =91change of heart=92 among major emplo=
yers.


  *   Ted Cruz voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act three times and ridi=
culed the legislation as a =91show vote.=92


  *   Donald Trump stated that women would have pay equity if we did =91as =
good a job=92 as men.

Republicans to Blame for Trump and His Down Ballot Impact


It=92s fitting that Donald Trump is the standard-bearer of a party that has=
 relied on divisive politics and scapegoating for electoral gain for so lon=
g. Since 2004 they=92ve used gay marriage as a wedge issue, demonized immig=
rants and stoked fears about border security. They=92ve given birthers like=
 Trump a pass, and fueled the Tea Party with lies about a total government =
takeover of healthcare and the economy. Then while in office, the only thin=
g Republicans have done in Washington over the last seven years is obstruct=
. Trump IS the Republican Party.


Advantage, Democrats


Despite all the media attention that Republican frontrunner Trump gets with=
 his say-anything strategy, Democrats are winning where it matters.


Secretary Clinton has earned over 10.4 million vote 9.6 million votes =96 a=
 full 1.4 1.7 million more than Trump =96 while Senator Sanders has seven a=
lmost 8 million votes (well ahead of Kasich and Cruz) and has garnered more=
 than seven million individual campaign contributions.


Overall fundraising shows a Democratic edge, with Democrats raising a total=
 of $72.1 million in February and 67.5 million in March, and eclipsing Repu=
blicans=92 fundraising, which amounted to less than $12 million for Cruz, $=
6<http://docquery.fec.gov/pres/2016/M2/C00580100.html> million for Trump, a=
nd just $3.4 million for Kasich in February.


Overall


And while Trump continues to claim that he is self-funding his campaign, hi=
s latest report with the FEC<http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/050/20160320901193=
1050/201603209011931050.pdf> shows that he has loaned his campaign $24 mill=
ion throughout this election cycle, while he raising just $34 million from =
outside contributors and loans for the entire cycle.


Democrats will have the strongest candidate in November. Period. And we are=
 poised to take back the Senate and make serious gains in the House.


Broad Contrast and Infrastructure


We have been building an infrastructure and operation that will work regard=
less of who the Republicans nominate. We see the numbers of course; it=92s =
clear Trump is far ahead of his competitors, and we=92re ready for him if h=
e makes it through what is shaping up to be a train wreck of a convention.


But we don=92t think taking on Trump is fundamentally different from any of=
 the others.

At least with Trump, he=92s not shy about exposing what the Republican bran=
d has truly become. Ted Cruz and John Kasich are every bit as extreme as th=
eir party=92s front-runner, they just hide it a bit better.


They promise the same extreme agenda on women=92s rights, they deny the thr=
eat of climate change, and they oppose fixing a broken immigration system w=
ith a path to  citizenship.


They all want to drag America back to the failed economic policies of the l=
ast Republican president who left office losing 800,000 jobs a month and ha=
ving plunged our country into the Great Recession.


And they=92ve all been just as offensive in their rhetoric, using language =
that alienates our allies, helps ISIS recruit terrorists, and makes America=
 less safe.


So if it is Trump, we=92re ready. Maybe it=92s Cruz, but it=92s hard to see=
 how that comes together in the end. But regardless we=92re building a grou=
nd game and an infrastructure that=92s ready to challenge him on every sing=
le position he=92s taking on the campaign trail, and that holds him account=
able for what those positions would actually mean for the American people.

<p class=3D"p1"><span class=3D"s1">We have been building an infrastructure =

 it through what is shaping up to be a train wreck of a convention.</span><=

<p class=3D"p2"><span class=3D"s1"></span><br>

<p class=3D"p1"><span class=3D"s1">But we don=92t think taking on Trump is =

<p class=3D"p1"><span class=3D"s1">At least with Trump, he=92s not shy abou=

<p class=3D"p2"><span class=3D"s1"></span><br>
</p>
<p class=3D"p1"><span class=3D"s1">They promise the same extreme agenda on =

</p>
<p class=3D"p1"><span class=3D"s1">They all want to drag America back to th=

 losing 800,000 jobs a month and having plunged our country into the Great =

<p class=3D"p2"><span class=3D"s1"></span><br>

<p class=3D"p1"><span class=3D"s1">And they=92ve all been just as offensive=

<p class=3D"p1"><span class=3D"s1">So if it is Trump, we=92re ready. Maybe =
it=92s Cruz, but it=92s hard to see how that comes together in the end. But=
 regardless we=92re building a ground game and an infrastructure that=92s r=
