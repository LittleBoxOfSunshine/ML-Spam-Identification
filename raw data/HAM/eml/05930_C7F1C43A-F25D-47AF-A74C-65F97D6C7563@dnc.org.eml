Sen. Menendez Condemns Reports of Continued Immigration Raids

WASHINGTON, D.C. =96 U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) issued the followin=
g statement in reaction to press reports indicating plans of a month-long s=
eries of nationwide immigration raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcemen=
t (ICE). Reports indicate that the raids will target mothers and children a=
nd minors who have turned 18 years old, are mostly from Central America and=
 who entered the United States after January 1, 2014. The Department of Hom=
eland Security (DHS) conducted similar controversial immigration raids in J=
anuary which resulted in the apprehension of 121 immigrants, mostly women a=
nd children from Central America who arrived to the United States fleeing t=
he region=92s violence.

"At a time when we should be standing up for the values and ideals we hold =
as Americans and against the xenophobic rhetoric being propagated by Donald=
 Trump's party, it is truly disheartening to read reports of a possible new=
 round of deportation raids further targeting Central American mothers and =
children in the U.S. who recently fled their homelands to avoid a certain d=
eath.=94

"As I've said before, trying to send a message of deterrence by forcefully =
removing desperate individuals who may very well have a valid protection cl=
aim is not only ill-advised, it is disturbing and un-American.  The Norther=
n Triangle nations of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have the highest =
murder rates in the world, and we must recognize that this is a humanitaria=
n crisis being caused by those who believe it is better to run for their li=
ves and risk dying, than stay and die for sure."

"Instead of eagerly deporting vulnerable populations, we should be addressi=
ng the root causes of this urgent hemispheric crisis by providing alternati=
ve safe havens in the region, expanding refugee resettlement programs, and =
forging new partnerships that will create security, peace and safety for fa=
milies in their native countries. Now is simply not the time to turn a blin=
d eye to the desperate reality facing these mothers and children, and the A=
dministration's cruel insistence on addressing this crisis strictly through=
 the lens of border security and immigration enforcement will continue to f=
ail and contradicts their commitment to remove felons and not families.=93

"I will continue to fight to protect our nation's long tradition of standin=
g up for refugees around the world.  We must prioritize fair and meaningful=
 due process for these Central American children and families who are seeki=
ng asylum.=94

On January 21, 2016, Senator Menendez and twenty one Senate Democrats and 1=
46 House Democrats sent letters to President Obama denouncing the first rou=
nd of immigration raids.
