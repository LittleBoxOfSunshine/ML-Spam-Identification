Beware of Social Security Myths=C2=A0

April 27, 2016

=C2=A0

Read our full Social Security myths paper here=2E

Social Security is on the road to insolvency, with its trust fund proje=
cted to run dry within the next 18 years=2E At that point, tens of mill=
ions of seniors, dependents, and workers with disabilities who depend o=
n the program will face an abrupt and painful 21 percent cut in their b=
enefits=2E Yet too little of the discussion in Washington and on the ca=
mpaign trail has focused on the solutions necessary to fix Social Secur=
ity, and too much has focused on perpetuating myths that cloud the disc=
ussion=2E

=C2=A0

Today, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget presents =E2=80=9C=
Nine Social Security Myths You Shouldn=E2=80=99t Believe=2E=E2=80=9D

=C2=A0

Myth #1: We don=E2=80=99t need to worry about Social Security for many =
years=2E

Myth #2: Social Security faces only a small funding shortfall=2E

Myth #3: Social Security solvency can be achieved solely by making the =
rich pay the same as everyone else=2E

Myth #4: Today=E2=80=99s workers will not receive Social Security benef=
its=2E

Myth #5: Social Security would be fine if we hadn=E2=80=99t =E2=80=9Cra=
ided the trust fund=2E=E2=80=9D

Myth #6: Social Security cannot run a deficit=2E

Myth #7: Social Security has nothing to do with the rest of the budget=2E

Myth #8: Social Security can be saved by ending waste, fraud, and abuse=
=2E

Myth #9: Raising the retirement age hits low-income seniors the hardest=
=2E

=C2=A0


Read our summary of a few of these myths below=2E


=C2=A0

Myth #1: We don=E2=80=99t need to worry about Social Security for many =
years=2E

=C2=A0

Because the Social Security Trustees estimate the programs=E2=80=99 tru=
st funds will not become insolvent until 2034, many argue there is litt=
le need to rush reforms=2E But the reality is that the longer policymak=
ers wait to act, the harder it will be to fix the program=2E

=C2=A0



=C2=A0

As we explain, waiting would literally make the problem larger=2E What =
could be solved by increasing taxes or reducing new benefits by about o=
ne-fifth today would require a one-third tax increase or a benefit cut =
larger than all new benefits if lawmakers wait until 2034=2E Waiting al=
so reduces the number of options available and gives workers less time =
to plan and adjust for any change=2E

=C2=A0

Myth #3: Social Security can be fixed solely by making the rich pay the=
 same as others=2E

=C2=A0

Because Social Security=E2=80=99s benefit formula and 12=2E4 percent pa=
yroll tax do not apply to wage income above $118,500 (indexed to wage g=
rowth), many have proposed increasing or eliminating this =E2=80=9Ctaxa=
ble maximum=E2=80=9D in order to make the program solvent=2E

=C2=A0

Certainly increasing the wages subject to the payroll tax will improve =
the program=E2=80=99s finances, but those who argue it will achieve lon=
g-term solvency overstate the case=2E Depending on the details and esti=
mating agency, fully eliminating the taxable maximum will close 40 to 9=
0 percent of the program=E2=80=99s 75-year shortfall and only one-fifth=
 to one-half of the program=E2=80=99s long-term structural gap=2E This =
means further action would be needed to truly achieve sustainable solve=
ncy=2E

=C2=A0

Myth #8: Social Security can be saved by ending waste, fraud, and abuse=
=2E

=C2=A0

One popular idea to reduce Social Security spending is to eliminate imp=
roper and fraudulent payments within the program=2E Of course nobody li=
kes fraud, but there is little that anti-fraud measures can do to impro=
ve the program=E2=80=99s solvency=2E

=C2=A0

The Social Security Administration estimates that improper payments tot=
al about $5 billion per year=2E Even if somehow all these payments coul=
d be ended, it would only address 3 percent of the $150 billion needed =
each year to make the program solvent=2E

=C2=A0

Myth #9: Raising the retirement age hits low-income seniors the hardest=
=2E

=C2=A0

Because life expectancy is higher for wealthier Americans, it seems int=
uitive that raising Social Security=E2=80=99s normal retirement age (NR=
A) to above 67 would represent a larger cut for lower earners=2E Yet in=
 reality, raising the NRA represents a roughly even reduction in benefi=
ts for all income groups=2E

=C2=A0

Raising the NRA is not regressive is because it does not affect eligibi=
lity but rather the size of the benefit reduction one receives for reti=
ring early=2E

=C2=A0

As we show in our paper, the Congressional Budget Office, Social Securi=
ty Actuary, Social Security=E2=80=99s Office of Retirement Policy, and =
Urban Institute all calculate that increasing the retirement age to 68 =
results in at least as large (and in many cases larger) a percentage cu=
t for higher earners as for lower earners, on both an annual and lifeti=
me basis=2E

rcent payroll tax do not apply to wage income above $118,500 (indexed to wa=
ge growth), many have proposed increasing or eliminating this =E2=80=9Ctaxa=
ble maximum=E2=80=9D in order to make the program solvent.</span></span></d=

<div>
	<span style=3D"font-size:14px;"><span style=3D"font-family:arial,helvetica=
,sans-serif;">Certainly increasing the wages subject to the payroll tax wil=
l improve the program=E2=80=99s finances, but those who argue it will achie=
ve long-term solvency overstate the case. Depending on the details and esti=
mating agency, fully eliminating the taxable maximum will close 40 to 90 pe=
rcent of the program=E2=80=99s 75-year shortfall and only one-fifth to one-=
half of the program=E2=80=99s long-term structural gap. This means further =
action would be needed to truly achieve sustainable solvency.</span></span>=

	<span style=3D"font-size:14px;"><span style=3D"font-family:arial,helvetica=

minate improper and fraudulent payments within the program. Of course nobod=
y likes fraud, but there is little that anti-fraud measures can do to impro=
ve the program=E2=80=99s solvency.</span></span></div>

<div>
	<span style=3D"font-size:14px;"><span style=3D"font-family:arial,helvetica=

yments total about $5 billion per year. Even if somehow all these payments =
could be ended, it would only address 3 percent of the $150 billion needed =
each year to make the program solvent.</span></span></div>

<div>
	<span style=3D"font-size:14px;"><span style=3D"font-family:arial,helvetica=

 seems intuitive that raising Social Security=E2=80=99s normal retirement a=
ge (NRA) to above 67 would represent a larger cut for lower earners. Yet in=
 reality, raising the NRA represents a roughly even reduction in benefits f=
or all income groups.</span></span></div>

	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<span style=3D"font-size:14px;"><span style=3D"font-family:arial,helvetica=

ct eligibility but rather the size of the benefit reduction one receives fo=
r retiring early.</span></span></div>
