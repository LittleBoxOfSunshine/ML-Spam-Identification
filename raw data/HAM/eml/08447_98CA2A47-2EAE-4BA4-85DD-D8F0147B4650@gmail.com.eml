<p>In what many called an unusually large state convention, the Alaska Demo=
cratic Party this weekend&nbsp;chose its delegates for&nbsp;the national co=
nvention in July, amid a clash over concerns by some Bernie Sanders&nbsp;fa=
ns that the head of the Democratic National Committee
 has improperly taken steps to benefit Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The anger over Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was highlighted when more t=
han 25 Sanders&nbsp;supporters walked out of her keynote speech Saturday ni=
ght at the Dena=E2=80=99ina&nbsp;Civic and Convention Center in Anchorage, =
though they left in a trickle while a huge crowd remained
 to hear the Florida congresswoman and DNC chair call for unity among Democ=
rats to stop the presumptive GOP nominee, Donald Trump.</p>
</font></span></span></div>
<div style=3D"color:rgb(0,0,0)"><span class=3D"updated" style=3D"font-size:=
16px"><font face=3D"Times">
<p>She warned that the Republican party has&nbsp;laid the groundwork for Tr=
ump's political rise&nbsp;with its divisive and hateful rhetoric. She warne=
d that Trump, as president, would return America to the days of George W. B=
ush&nbsp;that in 2007 led to the nation=E2=80=99s worst
 economic crash since the Great Depression.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>=E2=80=9CSo Trump isn=E2=80=99t something new -- he=E2=80=99s just the o=
ld Republican brand, but with a little extra bronzer on -- and he=E2=80=99s=
 that much more dangerous,=E2=80=9D she said. &quot;We have only ourselves =
to blame if we don't come together.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Her message didn't resonate with&nbsp;some Sanders supporters who say sh=
e <a href=3D"http://www.adn.com/article/20151221/outside-billionaires-fuel-=
joint-effort-between-clinton-alaska-democrats" target=3D"_blank">
improperly steered funds and other support toward the Clinton campaign</a>.=
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ian Smith from Kenai walked out of her speech.</p>
<p></p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAs long as she takes this money I can=E2=80=99t trust her,=E2=
=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CIt hurts me to say that.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p></p>
<p>After Wasserman Schultz spoke, Luis Miranda, DNC communications director=
, said she&nbsp;wasn=E2=80=99t doing interviews and had to hurry to catch&n=
bsp;a plane leaving&nbsp;Alaska.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But when pressed, she denied taking steps to benefit Clinton.</p>
<p></p>
<p>=E2=80=9CNothing could be further from the truth,=E2=80=9D she said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Miranda added:&nbsp;=E2=80=9CIf she was trying to stack the deck, she=E2=
=80=99s doing a terrible job because it=E2=80=99s been a competitive primar=
y.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the nearby Egan Center, Sanders supporters danced at an event organiz=
ed to protest&nbsp;Wasserman Schultz's speech. The event, attended by more =
than 200 through the night, was organized in part by Ed&nbsp;Cullinane. A m=
ember of the state central committee from
 an Anchorage House district, Cullinane&nbsp;supported efforts at the state=
=E2=80=99s three-day convention, but said he couldn=E2=80=99t tolerate&nbsp=
;Wasserman Schultz's =E2=80=9Cunethical actions.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The event featured a prerecorded televised appearance by Sanders'&nbsp;w=
ife, Jane Sanders, who shocked the crowd when she&nbsp;introduced her husba=
nd on screen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a short speech, Sanders&nbsp;thanked Alaska for its huge support, and=
 said he wants to create =E2=80=9Ca government that works for all of us and=
 not just the 1 percent.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the appearance&nbsp;ended, one woman shouted, =E2=80=9CThis is awes=
ome!=E2=80=9D as the dancing resumed and the crowd chanted, =E2=80=9CBernie=
! Bernie!=E2=80=9D</p>

<p>The events capped a day when the party delegates chose 16 delegates for =
the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, with 13 to vote for San=
ders and three for Clinton. Four superdelegates that can vote for either ca=
ndidate are also headed to the national&nbsp;convention
 to help pick the presidential nominee.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The delegates will include Jill&nbsp;Yordy, the Alaska director for the =
Sanders campaign, who will cast her vote for Sanders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sanders has a shot at overtaking Clinton, she said. One thing Yordy&nbsp=
;wants to share with others in Philadelphia is the passion Alaskans have fo=
r Sanders, who earned more than 80 percent support in the Democratic caucus=
 in March.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That passion was apparent at the state=E2=80=99s convention, she said, w=
ith unusually large numbers of delegates traveling huge distances from acro=
ss Alaska to show their support for him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>=E2=80=9CHe appeals to people who have felt disenfranchised by the party=
 system,=E2=80=9D she said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>State Rep. Andy&nbsp;Josephson, D-Anchorage, is also heading to Philadel=
phia. Calling a Trump presidency &quot;a dangerous proposition,=E2=80=9D he=
 said he will vote for Clinton.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He said he supports Sanders=E2=80=99 idealism and said the candidate has=
 shaped the discussion in a positive way,&nbsp;highlighting issues such as =
income disparity and the need for campaign finance reform.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>=E2=80=9CNothing but good has come from his run,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=
=80=9CIf he was selected as Hillary Clinton=E2=80=99s running mate, that=E2=
=80=99d be terrific.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;</p>

<p>At the State Democratic Convention in Anchorage, one of the big jobs par=
ty leaders have is to elect delegates to attend the national convention in =
July, when the presidential nominee will be decided.</p>
<p>Back in March, candidate Bernie Sanders won the state=E2=80=99s Democrat=
ic caucus in a big way. All 16 of the state=E2=80=99s regular delegates who=
 will go the national convention in Philadelphia are pledged to vote for hi=
m. But the state also has four super delegates who
 can vote for whomever they want.</p>
<p>Casey Steinau is one of the super delegates. Steinau is the chairman of =
the Alaska Democratic Party, but as a super delegate, she=E2=80=99s undecla=
red.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9DI am the chairman of the party and I believe that it is my job =
to represent 100 percent of the Alaska Democrats and I take that roll very =
seriously,=E2=80=9D Steinau said. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think my persona=
l preferences should be influencing anyone.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>But the idea that super delegates can vote for whomever they want doesn=
=E2=80=99t sit well with many Democrats.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI think there probably will be a resolution or a platform chang=
e or something coming out of this convention which says we don=E2=80=99t ne=
cessarily agree with this and we would ask the DNC to reassess it,=E2=80=9D=
 Steinau said.</p>
<p>Steinau said the resolution might ask to get rid of super delegates alto=
gether or require them to vote for the person who won the state caucus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ddemocrats who support Hilary Clinton are also attending the =
convention. Carolyn Lee with the Hilary for Alaska campaign said there are =
a lot of people who like both candidates.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe are also getting a lot of Bernie supporters coming up and sa=
ying, =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m going to be with Hilary in a couple of weeks but=
 today I=E2=80=99m with Bernie,=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D Lee said.</p>
<p>Steinau said she was hopeful Alaska Democrats would support whichever ca=
ndidate wins the Party=E2=80=99s nomination.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThey both bring so much to the table and at the end of the day =
when that person is decided I know that we will come together as a united f=
ront.=E2=80=9D</p>
