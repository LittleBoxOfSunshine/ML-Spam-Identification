DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda:

Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining our call. This is on the re=
cord. My name is Luis Miranda, and I=92m the Communications Director at the=
 DNC.

Yesterday voters went to the polls in five states, and the exit polling sho=
wed a trend we=92ve seen now in states like Wisconsin and New York, and now=
 Pennsylvania and others=85 71 percent of Democratic voters said our primar=
y had energized the party while 58 percent of Republican voters said their =
primary had divided their party. Donald Trump has secured his chokehold on =
the Republican nomination, the culmination of years of the Reublican Party =
 pushing a cynical and feckless political strategy that exploits unfounded =
fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all=
 for political gain. All while selling hardworking Americans on the empty p=
romise of trickle-down economics that only served to benefit those at the v=
ery top while leaving America=92s middle class footing the bill.

And now they=92re dealing with what they created, so we wanted to hold this=
 call on the chaos unfolding in the Republican primary ahead of the Califor=
nia GOP Convention this weekend.  Senator Barbara Boxer will kick us off, t=
hen Chairman Becerra, and then we=92ll open it up for questions.

Let=92s get started. Senator Boxer?

Senator Barbara Boxer:

Thanks for the introduction, Luis, and thanks everyone for being a part of =
this important call.

As most of you know, I=92ll be leaving the United States Senate this year, =
but that doesn=92t mean I=92m going to take after my Republican colleagues =
and stop doing my job =96 because, as they=92ve shown time and again with C=
hief Judge Merrick Garland, they have absolutely zero interest in fulfillin=
g their constitutional obligations. No, instead, I=92m going to continue do=
ing the job that I was elected to do and advocate on the behalf of Californ=
ians.

On that note, let=92s talk about what=92s happening this weekend. Folks, th=
is weekend, the three remaining Republican presidential candidates will be =
making their way to California for the GOP Convention. And let=92s face it:=
 they have no business coming to our great state.

The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich are =
completely out-of-touch with Californians on issue after issue.

Let=92s start off with the economy. When President Bush left office, our ec=
onomy was in terrible shape. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month; foreclosu=
re signs littered the streets of communities across our country; and thousa=
nds upon thousands of Americans had to decide between illness and bankruptc=
y from medical bills. This, of course, was a reality that far too many Cali=
fornians had to deal with. Fortunately enough, we=92ve made strides of prog=
ress since those dark days: six years of consecutive private-sector job gro=
wth, 14 million new jobs, and unemployment at or below five percent.

California, in particular, has done a remarkable job<https://www.gov.ca.gov=
/news.php?id=3D19280> of climbing out of the Great Recession. We=92ve gone =
from having a state deficit of $27 billion, an unemployment rate of 12%, an=
d the worst credit rating in the country, to now having a budget surplus, c=
reating a Rainy Day Fund to offset the next economy downturn, and we=92ve e=
ven had our credit rating raised three times by Standard and Poor=92s. But =
that=92s not all: earlier this month, California also raised the state mini=
mum wage, expanded paid sick leave, and expanded paid family leave. All thi=
s progress didn=92t just happen out of the blue; it=92s been the result of =
Democratic leadership =96 both at the White House and at the Governor=92s M=
ansion in California. And that=92s precisely why we can=92t afford to give =
Trump, Cruz, or Kasich the keys to the White House. They would undo all of =
this, and go back to giving huge tax cuts to those at the very top and huge=
 corporations, while blowing a huge hole in our budget and leaving hard-wor=
king Americans footing the bill.

Let=92s also talk about a woman=92s right to choose. The entire Republican =
field has been just awful in how they=92ve talked about a woman=92s right t=
o a safe and legal abortion, despite the fact that Roe v. Wade is the law o=
f the land. Trump has said that women should be punished for having an abor=
tion; John Kasich has defunded<http://sendgrid.dnc.org/wf/click?upn=3D5Sjws=

ng within [his] power to end=94 what he called =93the scourge of abortion o=
nce and for all.=94 And so, I have a very simple and clear message for thes=
e Republicans: we absolutely are not going back to the days of back alley a=
bortions.

Finally, let=92s talk about climate change. Every single Republican preside=
ntial candidate refuses to believe the overwhelming majority of scientists =
who have repeatedly warned of the growing threat from climate change. It=92=
s as if they=92re living in a different world! For instance, Trump has said=
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D0hLI1UdBhGQ> =93no, I=92m not a believer=
 in climate change,=94 while Cruz has said that =93there has been nowarming=
 whatsoever.=94  They don=92t realize how serious of an issue climate chang=
e is, but we know all about it here in California. After all, we=92ve had t=
o deal with a major drought, rising sea levels, and record temperatures. Bu=
t we haven=92t just stood by idly; we=92ve taken action, and now California=
 is the leader on clean energy.

And so, it=92s crystal clear that Republicans=92 values and beliefs do not =
align at all with the people of California. In California, we are everythin=
g that the Republican Party is not: we are tolerant, we are inclusive, and =
we believe in an economy that works for everyone.

With that, I=92ll turn it over to the Chairman of the House Democratic Cauc=
us, Congressman Xavier Becerra.

Chairman Xavier Becerra

Thank you, Senator Boxer.

As a representative of Los Angeles for nearly 24 years, I share the Senator=
's concern: these Republican presidential candidates just don=92t have what=
 it takes to be our next Commander-in-Chief.

And, in particular, as California's Republican Convention approaches, I'm a=
fraid Republicans seem to have forgotten about the Pete Wilson effect =96 t=
hat is, what happens when someone scapegoats and alienates large portions o=
f the population by proposing extremepositions on immigration that divide f=
amilies and hurt our economy.

Governor Pete Wilson, who pushed hard in 1996 for an anti-immigrant ballot =
initiative known as Proposition 187, helped turn our state from red to blue=
 because of his offensive rhetoric and divisive policies.

It was unconscionable then, and it=92s unacceptable now as Trump campaigns =
on the an even more offensive platform and even uglier tone.

California thankfully didn't take the bait then, and we=92re not going to f=
all for the Republican candidate's extremism now. The Republican candidates=
 have offended women, Hispanics, Muslim-Americans, Asian Americans and just=
 about everybody else with the tone they=92ve embraced that frankly runs co=
unter to the values of opportunity and equality our country was founded on.

Unfortunately, all signs point to a 2016 Republican presidential field that=
 has a short memory and I expect we'll hear more of the same hateful rhetor=
ic from Republicans this weekend at the Convention. We=92re going to contin=
ue to see a field of Republicans that clearly doesn=92t have the judgment o=
r temperament to serve as our President and Commander in Chief.

And let=92s be clear, while Donald Trump is securing his grip on the Republ=
ican nomination, the other candidates who are trying to do everything they =
can to put their convention into turmoil haven=92t been any better. We=92ve=
 seen them use extreme language and childish name-calling, we=92ve seen the=
m embrace the politics of fear on everything from refugees to the thinly ve=
iled but discriminatory bathroom bills they=92re pushing around the country=
 to deny the rights of LGBT Americans. And we=92ve seen it in how they talk=
 about immigrants.

  *   Senator Ted Cruz has said undocumented immigrants should "absolutely<=
http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/ted-cruz-trump-will-let-deported-im=
migrants-back-in-i-wont?utm_term=3D.fj7wApaaZ&bftw=3Dpol#.vgd4lmOOY>" be de=
ported and that the President=92s executive actions on DAPA and DACA should=
 be immediately rescinded.

  *   Governor John Kasich has mocked a path to citizenship and likened it =
to cutting a line at a concert. He said and I quote, "I don't favor citizen=
ship because, as I teach my kids, you don't jump the line to get into a Tay=
lor Swift concert,=94 clearly not understanding the impact his words would =
have on families and on our economy in California and across the country.

  *   And they=92ve all tried to keep up with Donald Trump, who of course k=
icked off his campaign claiming Mexican immigrants were "bringing drugs and=
 they are bringing crime, they=92re rapists."
Simply put, they have not heeded the lessons from their very own autopsy re=
port, which clearly stated that Republicans needed to be more inclusive if =
they wanted to have a real shot at winning a presidential election again.
And today, as Donald Trump delivered a foreign policy speech we can=92t hel=
p but be reminded of just how dangerous his commentary has been throughout =
this campaign. Whether it=92s his call to ban an entire religion, his threa=
t to pull back from our most important military alliance in NATO, his embra=
ce of nuclear proliferation from Europe to Asia, Donald Trump is dangerous =
and will make America less safe.
Now, our country is stronger when we work together, and we expand opportuni=
ties for everyone in America. With Republicans, we=92ll have the opposite.
Ours is a country where no matter where you come from, or your last name, y=
ou can work hard and get ahead. Just as my dad, who never made it past the =
sixth grade and my mother, who both instilled in me the values and work eth=
ic that have gotten me so far.
That=92s precisely what=92s at stake, folks: the lives of real people who w=
ant nothing but the chance to live the American dream.
Because of all of this, I=92ve never been more sure about the fact that we =
need to elect a Democrat as the 45th President of the United States.
And with that, I=92ll turn it over to Luis.
Luis Miranda

Thank you Congressman Becerra. We=92ll now open it up to questions.

and now Pennsylvania and others=85 71 percent
 of Democratic voters said our primary had energized the party while 58 per=
cent of Republican voters said their primary had divided their party. Donal=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">As most of you know, I=92ll be leaving the United St=
ates Senate this year, but that doesn=92t mean I=92m going to take after my=
 Republican colleagues and stop doing my job =96 because, as they=92ve show=

 they have absolutely zero interest in fulfilling their constitutional obli=
gations. No, instead, I=92m going to continue doing the job that I was elec=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">On that note, let=92s talk about what=92s happening =
this weekend. Folks, this weekend, the three remaining Republican president=
ial candidates will be making their way to California for the GOP Conventio=
n. And let=92s face it: they have no business
 coming to our great state. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump, Ted Cru=
z, and John Kasich are completely out-of-touch with Californians on issue a=
fter issue.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Let=92s start off with the economy. When President B=
ush left office, our economy was in terrible shape. We were losing 800,000 =
jobs a month; foreclosure signs littered the streets of communities across =
our country; and thousands upon thousands
 of Americans had to decide between illness and bankruptcy from medical bil=
ls. This, of course, was a reality that far too many Californians had to de=
al with. Fortunately enough, we=92ve made strides of progress since those d=
ark days: six years of consecutive
 private-sector job growth, 14 million new jobs, and unemployment at or bel=
ow five percent.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">California, in particular, has done a <a href=3D"htt=
ps://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=3D19280">
remarkable job</a> of climbing out of the Great Recession. We=92ve gone fro=
m having a state deficit of $27 billion, an unemployment rate of 12%, and t=
he worst credit rating in the country, to now having a budget surplus, crea=
ting a Rainy Day Fund to offset the
 next economy downturn, and we=92ve even had our credit rating raised three=
 times by Standard and Poor=92s. But that=92s not all: earlier this month, =
California also raised the state minimum wage, expanded paid sick leave, an=
d expanded paid family leave. All this
 progress didn=92t just happen out of the blue; it=92s been the result of <=
i>Democratic
</i>leadership =96 both at the White House and at the Governor=92s Mansion<=
span style=3D"color:#1F497D"> in California</span>. And that=92s precisely =
why we can=92t afford to give Trump, Cruz, or Kasich the keys to the White =
House. They would undo all of this, and go
 back to giving huge tax cuts to <span style=3D"color:#1F497D">those at the=
 very top
</span>and huge corporations<span style=3D"color:#1F497D">, while blowing a=
 huge hole in our budget and leaving hard-working Americans footing the bil=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Let=92s also talk about a woman=92s right to choose.=
 The entire Republican field has been just awful
<span style=3D"color:#1F497D">in how they=92ve talked about a woman=92s rig=
