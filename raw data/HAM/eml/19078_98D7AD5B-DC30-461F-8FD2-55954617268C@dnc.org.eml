 Hey there! Just got off the phone with Jordan, Henry, and Bittel. They wan=
t to look into doing some sort of pre-convention reception/dinner on that T=
uesday, 7/27. I'm sure a lot of places have been scooped up already, but ca=
n you try to get a few options for them this week? I think we'd need a spac=
e that could accommodate about 75-100 of us. Thanks!
