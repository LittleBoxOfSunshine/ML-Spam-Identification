THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 17, 2016



*FACT SHEET: Growing Middle Class Paychecks and Helping Working Families =
Get Ahead By Expanding Overtime Pay*



"Were making more workers eligible for the overtime that youve earned. An=
d its one of the single most important steps we can take to help grow mid=
dle-class wages. "" President Barack Obama, La Crosse, WI, July 2, 2015"



Every week, millions of Americans work more than 40 hours a week but do n=
ot receive the overtime pay they have earned. Tomorrow, the Department of=
 Labor will be finalizing a rule to fix that by updating overtime protect=
ions for workers. In total, the new rule is expected to extend overtime p=
rotections to 4.2 million more Americans who are not currently eligible u=
nder federal law, and it is expected to boost wages for workers by $12 bi=
llion over the next 10 years.



For much of the 20th century, the 40-hour workweek was a pillar of econom=
ic security for working families. The rules of the road were simple: if y=
ou were called on to put in extra work, your employer had to pay you extr=
a regardless of whether you received an hourly wage or a salary. This lef=
t most Americans with more money in their pockets, more time to balance o=
bligations at home and at work, and the opportunity to get ahead with mor=
e time outside of work for school or additional training.=20



Yet over the past 40 years, overtime protections eroded as a result of in=
flation and lobbyists efforts to weaken them. The share of full-time work=
ers qualifying for overtime based on their salaries has plummeted from 62=
 percent in 1975 to 7 percent todayeven though the protections are more i=
mportant than ever. Parents now have more demands on their time, with all=
 parents working in more than six out of ten households with children. An=
d despite a recent acceleration in wage growth and businesses adding 14.6=
 million jobs over a record 74 straight months of job growth, most Americ=
ans have seen relatively stagnant wages for the past few decades.



Thats why tomorrow, the Department of Labor is finalizing a rule to updat=
e overtime protections so they can help millions more Americans. The fina=
l rule, which takes effect on December 1, 2016, doubles the salary thresh=
oldfrom $23,660 to $47,476 per yearunder which most salaried workers are =
guaranteed overtime (hourly workers are generally guaranteed overtime pay=
 regardless of their earnings level). Additionally, this new level will b=
e automatically updated every three years to ensure that workers continue=
 to earn the pay they deserve.=20



Increasing overtime protections is another step in the Presidents effort =
to grow and strengthen the middle class by raising Americans wages. This =
extra income will not only mean a better life for American families impac=
ted by overtime protections, but will boost our economy across the board =
as these families spend their hard-earned wages.=20



*RESTORING OVERTIME PROTECTIONS*



In March 2014, President Obama signed a memorandum directing the Departme=
nt of Labor to modernize our nations overtime rules, which have been comp=
rehensively updated only once since the 1970s.=20



Overtime protections were first put into place by the Fair Labor Standard=
s Act of 1938, and established the general standard that workers be paid =
time-and-a-half for any hours worked over 40 hours in a week. In general,=
 all hourly employees are guaranteed overtime, and salaried employees are=
 presumed to have the same guarantee unless they both: (1) make more than=
 a salary threshold set by the Department of Labor, and (2) pass a test d=
emonstrating that they primarily perform executive, administrative, or pr=
ofessional duties. A limited number of occupations are not eligible for o=
vertime pay (including teachers, doctors, and lawyers) or are subject to =
special provisions.



Tomorrows rule takes into account input from 270,000 public comments and =
extensive outreach meetings with employers, business associations, small =
businesses, workers, worker advocates, non-profit organizations, educatio=
nal institutions, and state and local government representatives. It will=
:



 *_Raise the salary threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 a year, or from $45=
5 to $913 a week._** *This doubles the current salary threshold while bei=
ng responsive to public comments regarding regional variations in income =
by setting the salary threshold at the 40th percentile of full-time salar=
ied workers in the lowest income Census region (currently the South). Tyi=
ng the salary threshold to the lowest-wage region of the country has stro=
ng historical precedent in previous rulemakings.



 *_Raise Americans wages by an estimated $12 billion over the next 10 yea=
rs, with an average increase of $1.2 billion annually._* At the same time=
, employers retain considerable flexibility in how they comply with the n=
ew rule, such as increasing salaries to at least the new threshold to kee=
p positions that are primarily executive, administrative, or professional=
 exempt from overtime pay; paying overtime for hours worked in excess of =
40 in a week; or reducing overtime hours.=20



 *_Extend overtime protections to 4.2 million additional workers who are =
not currently eligible for overtime under federal law._* Others who may a=
lready be eligible for overtime will also benefit as the higher salary th=
reshold will serve as a useful bright line test for workersand their empl=
oyersto understand whether they are eligible for overtime. The number of =
workers in each state who will benefit from the rule can be found HERE [ =
https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/OT_state_=
by_state_fact_sheet_final_rule_v3.pdf ].



 *_Update the salary threshold every three years._* The updates will ensu=
re the threshold is maintained at the 40th percentile of full-time salari=
ed workers in the lowest income region of the country. Based on projectio=
ns of wage growth, the threshold is expected to rise to more than $51,000=
 with the first update on January 1, 2020.

**

 *_Raise the highly compensated employee threshold  from $100,000 to $134=
,004  above which only a minimal showing is needed to demonstrate an empl=
oyee is not eligible for overtime._* This upper threshold was designed to=
 ease the burden on employers in identifying overtime eligible employees =
since it is more likely that workers earning above this high salary level=
 perform the types of job duties that would exempt them from overtime req=
uirements.



 *_Respond to employers concerns by making no changes to the duties test =
and allowing bonuses and incentive payments to count toward up to 10 perc=
ent of the new salary level._** *Workers earning more than the salary thr=
eshold are still subject to the duties test to determine eligibility for =
overtime. In their comments to the proposed rule, employers argued that c=
hanging the duties test would be difficult and costly to implement, and t=
he final rule leaves the existing duties test in place. Additionally, for=
 the first time, employers will be able to count bonuses and commissions =
toward as much as 10 percent of the salary threshold.



The Department of Labor will also release three technical guidance docume=
nts, designed to help private employers, non-profit employers, and instit=
utions of higher education come into compliance with the new rule.=20

 put in extra work, your employer had to pay you extra regardless of whethe=

as a result of inflation and lobbyists&#8217; efforts to weaken them.&nbsp;=
 The share of full-time workers qualifying for overtime based

&#8212;even though the protections are more important than ever.&nbsp; Pare=

 And despite a recent acceleration in wage growth and businesses adding 14.=
6 million jobs over a record 74 straight months of job growth, most America=

7,476 per year&#8212;under which most salaried workers are guaranteed overt=
