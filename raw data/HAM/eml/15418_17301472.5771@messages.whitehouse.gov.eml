THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release May 4, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

TO THE FLINT COMMUNITY=20



Northwestern High School

Flint, Michigan







4:10 P.M. EDT



THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Flint! (Applause.) How's it going, Wildcats? (Appla=
use.) Well, it is good to be back in Flint, Michigan. (Applause.)=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER! Obama!



THE PRESIDENT: That's me! (Applause.)=20



All right, settle down, everybody. (Laughter.)=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)



THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.



All right. Let me do some business here. Let me begin by recognizing some=
 of the guests who are here. Your mayor, Karen Weaver, is here. (Applause=
.) I know Governor Rick Snyder is here.=20



AUDIENCE: Boo --



THE PRESIDENT: No, no -- because here's here to -- we're doing some busin=
ess here. Members of Congress are here, including your outstanding senato=
r, Debbie Stabenow. (Applause.) Flint's own Dan Kildee is here. (Applause=
.) Debbie Dingell is here. (Applause.) Brenda Lawrence is here. (Applause=
.) John Conyers is here. (Applause.) And Sandy Levin. An outstanding Mich=
igan delegation. We've got Secretary Sylvia Burwell, who is the head of H=
ealth and Human Services, works for me. And Administrator Gina McCarthy i=
s here, as well. I want to thank Superintendent Bilal Tawwab -- (applause=
) -- and Principal Tim Green for their hospitality. And I want to thank a=
ll of you for being here.=20



Now, not too long ago, I received a letter from a young lady, an eight-ye=
ar-old girl named Mari Copeny. You may know her as Little Miss Flint.=20



Those of you who have seats, please feel free to sit down so folks can se=
e behind you. If you dont have a seat, dont sit down.=20



And like a lot of you, Mari has been worried about what happened here in =
Flint. Shes worried about what it means for children like her. She's worr=
ied about the future of this city and this community.



So in the middle of a tragedy that should have never happened here in the=
 United States of America -- the denial of something as basic as clean, s=
afe drinking water -- this eight-year-old girl spoke out and marched and,=
 like many of you, protested. As Mari was getting ready to hop on a bus t=
o Washington, she wrote to ask if she could meet with me while she was in=
 town. There she is. (Applause.)=20



Now, I would have been happy to see Mari in Washington. But when somethin=
g like this happens, a young girl shouldnt have to go to Washington to be=
 heard. I thought her President should come to Flint to meet with her. (A=
pplause.) And thats why Im here -- to tell you directly that I see you an=
d I hear you, and I want to hear directly from you about how this public =
health crisis has disrupted your lives, how it's made you angry, how it's=
 made you worried.=20



And I just had a chance to meet with a few of your neighbors in a roundta=
ble discussion, and I heard from them what I know a lot of you are feelin=
g: That a lot of you are scared. That all of you feel let down. And I tol=
d them that I understood why you'd be afraid -- not just for yourselves, =
but for your kids.=20



I also wanted to come here, though, to tell you that I've got your back -=
- (applause) -- that we're paying attention. So I met and heard directly =
from those who are leading the federal response and who are working hard =
to make sure that Flint is whole again, to make sure that this proud city=
 bounces back not just to where it was, but stronger than ever. And I wan=
t all of you to know I am confident that Flint will come back. (Applause.=
) I will not rest, and I'm going to make sure that the leaders, at every =
level of government, dont rest until every drop of water that flows to yo=
ur homes is safe to drink and safe to cook with, and safe to bathe in -- =
because that's part of the basic responsibilities of a government in the =
United States of America. (Applause.)=20



So as President, Ive sent Flint the best resources our federal government=
 has to support our state and local partners. The agencies that serve you=
 -- the agencies that specialize in health and housing, and those that su=
pport small businesses and our kids education; those that are responsible=
 for the food that our children eat and, of course, the water we drink. E=
verybody is on duty. The National Guard is on duty. This is a hands-on-de=
ck situation -- all hands on deck. Because if there's a child who feels n=
eglected on the north side of Flint, or a family on the east side of this=
 city who wonders whether they should give up on their hometown and move =
away, or an immigrant who wonders whether America means what we say about=
 being a place where we take care of our own. That matters to all of us -=
- not just in Flint, not just in Michigan, but all across America. Flints=
 recovery is everybodys responsibility. (Applause.) And Im going to make =
sure that responsibility is met. (Applause.)=20



So I just talked with some of the team of responders that are on the grou=
nd to make sure that theyre coordinating. And theyre doing some incredibl=
e things. Theyve distributed enough water to fill more than three Olympic=
-sized swimming pools. Theyve distributed thousands of filters. Theyre he=
lping students afford nutritious food that work against the contaminants =
in bad water. Theyre making sure new moms have access to instant infant f=
ormula that doesnt require water. Theyve expanded health services for chi=
ldren and pregnant women, and education programs for Flints youngest chil=
dren. Theyre out there testing homes for lead and testing children for ex=
posure to lead.



But like all our best responses in tough times, this is not a government =
effort alone. We need our businesses and nonprofits and philanthropies to=
 step up. And whats incredible about Flint is how many volunteers have al=
ready been leading the way. (Applause.) Youve got members of one union, U=
A Local 370, that have donated tens of thousands of dollars and 10,000 ho=
urs of their time. Theyve installed thousands of filters, hundreds of fau=
cets by going door to door, night and day. Theyre not asking for anything=
 in return, theyre just doing the right thing.



So many Americans, here in Flint and around the country, have proven that=
 you dont have be a plumber or a pipefitter to pitch in -- although its v=
ery helpful if youre a plumber or pipefitter. (Laughter.) So, in March, d=
ozens of accountants teamed up with the American Red Cross to help reside=
nts recycle all the plastic water bottles that have been piling up. Relig=
ious and community groups are organizing supply drives, supporting famili=
es, offering free medical services.=20



The director of a local dance studio, I understand, found a creative way =
to help; shes letting people use her studio as a space to support one ano=
ther by sharing their stories and realizing theyre not alone. Even inmate=
s at an Indiana prison came together to donate more than $2,500 to the pe=
ople of Flint. (Applause.) And a second-grader from Virginia, a young man=
 named Isiah Britt, set up a website to see if he could raise $500 for ha=
nd sanitizers to send to the kids at Eisenhower Elementary here in Flint.=
 (Applause.) So Isiah, its fair to say, surpassed his goal, because he ra=
ised $15,000. (Applause.) And he explained that the experience taught him=
 just because youre small doesnt mean you cant do big things.



So when you think of all those stories, it should be clear that the Ameri=
can people care about Flint. The American people are paying attention and=
 they care about you. And as is true when disasters strike in other ways,=
 people pitch in, they come together. Because they imagine, All right, th=
at could have been me. Thats the good news.=20



The bad news is that this should not have happened in the first place. (A=
pplause.) And even though the scope of the response looks sort of like th=
e efforts were used to seeing after a natural disaster, thats not what th=
is was. This was a manmade disaster. This was avoidable. This was prevent=
able.



Now, Im not here to go through the full history of what happened. Like a =
lot of manufacturing towns, Flints economy has been taking hits for decad=
es now -- plants closing, jobs moving away. Manufacturing has shrunk. And=
 thats made it harder for the city to maintain city services. And lets fa=
ce it, government officials at every level werent attentive to potential =
problems the way they should have been. So they start getting short-staff=
ed, they start getting a shrinking tax base, more demand for services. Th=
ings start getting strained, and theres not enough help from the outside.=
 And then when Flints finances collapsed, an emergency manager was put in=
 place whose mandate was primarily to cut at all costs. And then some ver=
y poor decisions were made. All these things contributed to this crisis. =
Many of you know the story.



Now, I do not believe that anybody consciously wanted to hurt the people =
in Flint. And this is not the place to sort out every screw-up that resul=
ted in contaminated water. But I do think there is a larger issue that we=
 have to acknowledge, because I do think that part of what contributed to=
 this crisis was a broader mindset, a bigger attitude, a corrosive attitu=
de that exists in our politics and exists in too many levels of our gover=
nment. (Applause.)=20



And its a mindset that believes that less government is the highest good =
no matter what. Its a mindset that says environmental rules designed to k=
eep your water clean or your air clean are optional, or not that importan=
t, or unnecessarily burden businesses or taxpayers. Its an ideology that =
undervalues the common good, says were all on our own and whats in it for=
 me, and how do I do well, but Im not going to invest in what we need as =
a community. And, as a consequence, you end up seeing an underinvestment =
in the things that we all share that make us safe, that make us whole, th=
at give us the ability to pursue our own individual dreams. So we underin=
vest in pipes underground. We underinvest in bridges that we drive on, an=
d the roads that connect us, and the schools that move us forward. (Appla=
use.)=20



And this is part of the attitude, this is part of the mindset: We especia=
lly underinvest when the communities that are put at risk are poor, or do=
n't have a lot of political clout -- (applause) -- and so are not as ofte=
n heard in the corridors of power.=20



And this kind of thinking -- this myth that government is always the enem=
y; that forgets that our government is us -- its us; that its an extensio=
n of us, ourselves -- that attitude is as corrosive to our democracy as t=
he stuff that resulted in lead in your water. Because what happens is it =
leads to systematic neglect. It leads to carelessness and callousness. (A=
pplause.) It leads to a lot of hidden disasters that you don't always rea=
d about and arent as flashy, but that over time diminish the life of a co=
mmunity and make it harder for our young people to succeed.



In one of the roundtables, I was listening to somebody -- I think it was =
a pastor who told me, you know, it made us feel like we didn't count. And=
 you can't have a democracy where people feel like they don't count, wher=
e people feel like they're not heard.



And that attitude ignores how this country was built, our entire history =
-- which is based on the idea that we're all connected and that what happ=
ens in a community like Flint matters everybody, and that there are thing=
s that we can only do together, as a nation, as a people, as a state, as =
a city that no man is an island.=20



We've been debating this since the Republic began: What are our individua=
l responsibilities and what are our collective responsibilities. And that=
's a good debate. But Ive always believed what the first Republican Presi=
dent, a guy named Abraham Lincoln, said. He said we should do individuall=
y those things that we do best by ourselves. But through our government, =
we should do together what we can't do as well for ourselves. (Applause.)=
=20



So it doesn't matter how hard you work, how responsible you are, or how w=
ell you raise your kids -- you can't set up a whole water system for a ci=
ty. That's not something you do by yourself. You do it with other people.=
 You can't hire your own fire department, or your own police force, or yo=
ur own army. There are things we have to do together -- basic things that=
 we all benefit from.=20



And thats how we invested in a rail system and a highway system. That's h=
ow we invested in public schools. That's how we invested in science and r=
esearch. These how we invested in community colleges and land grant colle=
ges like Michigan State. (Applause.)=20



Can I get some water? (Applause.) Come on up here. Give me some water. I =
want a glass of water. I want a glass of water. Sit down. Im all right. I=
m going to get a glass of water right here. Lets make sure we find one. I=
t will be filtered. Hold on, Im going to talk about that in a second. Set=
tle down, everybody.=20



Where was I? We invested in our communities and our cities. And by making=
 those investments in the common good, we invested in ourselves. That's t=
he platform we create that allows each of us independently to succeed. Th=
ats what made America great.=20



So the people in Flint, and across Michigan, and around the country -- in=
dividuals and church groups and non-for-profits and community organizatio=
ns -- you've proven that the American people will step up when required. =
And our volunteers, our non-for-profits, they're the lifeblood of our com=
munities. We so appreciate what you do. (Applause.)=20



But volunteers dont build county water systems and keep lead from leachin=
g into our drinking glasses. We cant rely on faith groups to reinforce br=
idges and repave runways at the airport. We cant ask second-graders, even=
 ones as patriotic as Isiah Britt who raised all that money, to raise eno=
ugh money to keep our kids healthy.



You hear a lot about government overreach, how Obama -- hes for big gover=
nment. Listen, its not government overreach to say that our government is=
 responsible for making sure you can wash your hands in your own sink, or=
 shower in your own home, or cook for your family. (Applause.) These are =
the most basic services. There is no more basic element sustaining human =
life than water. Its not too much to expect for all Americans that their =
water is going to be safe.



Now, where do we go from here?=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)



THE PRESIDENT: Well, Im still waiting for my water. (Laughter.) Somebody =
obviously didn't hear me. Usually I get my water pretty quick. Hold on a =
second.=20



Now, the reason I know Im okay is because I already had some Flint water.=
 There we go. I really did need a glass of water. This is not a stunt.=20=




Now, Im going to talk about this. Everybody settle down. This is a feisty=
 crowd. Hold on a second. All right, everybody settle down. I got some se=
rious points to make here.



So where do we go from here? Now, Mayor Weaver has a plan to fix the pipe=
s in Flint. And unfortunately, because the state initially cut so many co=
rners, its going to end up being more expensive -- much more expensive no=
w than it would have been to avert the disaster in the first place. But t=
he good news is that Michigan does have funds it can use from the federal=
 government to help Flint. (Applause.) The Governor indicated that in his=
 budget he has put forward additional funds to replace the pipes. In orde=
r for it to happen -- and I said this to the Mayor and the Governor; I ha=
d them both in my car, the Beast -- I told them I wasnt going to let eith=
er of them out until we figured this out. (Laughter.) I had Secret Servic=
e surrounding everybody. (Applause.)=20



But what I said was, is that the city and the state and the federal gover=
nment, everybody is going to have to work together to get this done. So i=
ts not going to happen overnight. But we have to get started. We have to =
get the money flowing. We've got to work with our plumbers and pipefitter=
s, but also train local residents and start getting apprenticeship progra=
ms going -- (applause) -- so that even as were trying to deal with this d=
isaster, were also hopefully lifting people up and giving them an opportu=
nity for employment. (Applause.) Congress, led by your congressional dele=
gation, needs to act in a bipartisan fashion, do their job, make sure Fli=
nt has the necessary resources.=20



And so its long past time that Flint has a well-managed, monitored, moder=
n water system that protects not just against lead, but other contaminant=
s. All right? So thats our goal. Thats one goal.=20



But weve got to do more than just ensure the integrity and safety of your=
 water for the long term. What we also have to do is work as one team -- =
federal, state, and local leaders, Democrats and Republicans -- to addres=
s some of the broader issues that have been raised by this crisis. The fe=
deral officials I met with today are committed to staying on the job unti=
l we get it done. (Applause.) But that requires the state of Michigan to =
step up and be fully invested in this process, as well. (Applause.) Today=
s vote in Lansing to increase funding for health care was a good start.



But part of keeping the faith with the people of Flint means making sure =
that youre first in line for the jobs this effort will create. (Applause.=
) It means that since the state voted this afternoon to expand Medicaid, =
every child who lived in Flint while the water was bad needs to be able t=
o get seen by a doctor, diagnosed, make sure that theres follow-up. We ca=
nt just promise it, weve got to deliver it. And that means everybody has =
got to cooperate. Everybody has got to cooperate.



And keeping the faith with you also means the state has to step up and de=
liver the resources that will help not only fix the water, but transform =
Flint so that it is once again a functioning city with the capacity and t=
he democratic structures to work. The city government has to be on a firm=
 foundation. The mayor cant do it by herself. Shes got to have a team and=
 a staff, and theres got to be a budget that works, thats sustainable, an=
d a plan for long-term economic development, and a plan to make sure that=
 health care is available to all of our kids, and a plan to make sure tha=
t education is top-notch in this city, and that more jobs are being creat=
ed. (Applause.) And that will require many more of the good work that wev=
e seen from citizens and community groups who care about your families.=20=




But its not enough just to fix the water. Weve got to fix the culture of =
neglect, the mindset I was talking about -- (applause) -- that has degrad=
ed too many schools and too many roads and hurt too many futures. Weve go=
t to fix the mindset that only leaves people cynical about our government=
. Our government is us -- of us, by us, for us -- the people.=20



So weve got a lot of work to do. But Im here to tell you Im prepared to w=
ork with you on this. (Applause.) Im paying attention.=20



Now, a couple of specific things I want to address. These arent in my pre=
pared remarks, but this is what I gathered from the conversations that I =
had.=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) Detroit!



THE PRESIDENT: Im in Flint right now, not Detroit. (Applause.) But I do l=
ove Detroit. And their school needs support, and there is -- some of that=
 same mindset has hurt the schools there.



But listen up, because this is drawn from the conversations I had with ma=
ny of your neighbors and friends, as well as the federal response teams t=
hat I sent out here a while back. Were going to do everything we can to a=
ccelerate getting new pipes here in Flint. (Applause.) But even with all =
the money, even with an efficient, speeded-up process, its going to take =
a while for all the pipes to be replaced. Its not going to happen next mo=
nth. Its not going to happen six months from now, where all the pipes in =
Flint are going to be replaced. Weve got to get started, and you need to =
see that its getting started and that progress is being made. But its not=
 going to happen overnight. Even if we get all the plumbers and pipefitte=
rs, and we get some more apprentices trained -- even if we do all that, i=
ts going to take some time.=20



And so one of the things I heard talking to a lot of your neighbors is, b=
oy, right now its rough just trying to figure out how to get bottled wate=
r on the way home from work, and youre trying to just shower real quick, =
and people are still concerned about whats safe and what information is c=
orrect and what is not. So I do want to just tell you what I know, based =
on not just what Ive been reading in the papers, but what our top scienti=
sts have told me.=20



The first is that while you are waiting to get your pipes replaced, you n=
eed to have a filter installed, and use that filter. And if you do use th=
at filter, then the water is safe to consume for children over the age of=
 six and who are not pregnant.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)



THE PRESIDENT: Now, hold on a second. Dont just start shouting, okay? Bec=
ause this is the problem -- we're going to have to solve this problem. An=
d if people dont listen to each other, then it's not going to get fixed. =
(Applause.)=20



 So Im telling you -- and I promise you, Im really good at stirring folks=
 up. So if I want to just come here and stir folks up, I know how to do t=
hat. But that's not actually going to solve the problem, all right? So Im=
 telling what I know, because I guarantee you that the scientists who wor=
k for me, if they tell me something -- which Im saying in front of all th=
ose cameras -- turns out to be wrong, that person will not have a job. (A=
pplause.)=20



 So although I understand the fear and concern that people have, and it i=
s entirely legitimate, what the science tells us at this stage is you sho=
uld not drink any of the water that is not filtered. But if you get the f=
ilter and use it properly, that water can be consumed. That's point numbe=
r one.



 And you can get those filters free, and people will help install them if=
 you need help -- particularly seniors who may have trouble going back an=
d forth and trying to get a whole bunch of bottles of water and so forth.=
 So that's information that I trust and I believe. That's point number on=
e.



 Point number two: Every child in Flint who may have consumed water durin=
g the course of this tragedy -- and that is the overwhelming majority of =
children here -- should get checked.=20



 Now, the reason that's important is because lead is a serious issue. And=
 if undiagnosed and not dealt with, it can lead to some long-term problem=
s. But -- and this is really important, so I want everybody to pay attent=
ion -- if you know that your child may have been exposed and you go to a =
health clinic, a doctor, a provider, and are working with them, then your=
 child will be fine. And the reason I can say that with some confidence i=
s not just based on science, but based on the fact that keep in mind that=
 it wasnt until the 80s where we started banning lead in paint, lead in t=
oys, lead in gasoline. So if you are my age, or older, or maybe even a li=
ttle bit younger, you got some lead in your system when you were growing =
up. You did. I am sure that somewhere, when I was two years old, I was ta=
king a chip of paint, tasting it, and I got some lead. Or sometimes toys =
were painted with lead, and you were chewing on them.=20



 Now, I say that not to make light of the situation. We know now what we =
didn't know then, which is it can cause problems if children get exposed =
to lead at elevated levels. But the point is that as long as kids are get=
ting good health care, and folks are paying attention, and they're gettin=
g a good education, and they have community support, and they're getting =
some good home training, and they are in a community that is loving and n=
urturing and thriving, these kids will be fine. And I don't want anybody =
to start thinking that somehow all the kids in Flint are going to have pr=
oblems for the rest of their lives, because that's not true. That is not =
true. (Applause.) And I don't want that stigma to be established in the m=
inds of kids.=20



 We've learned a lot of things since I was a kid. I used to have adults b=
lowing smoke in my face all the time. (Laughter.) We didn't use seat belt=
s. We wrapped dry-cleaning bags around us and thought that was funny. (La=
ughter.) Folks didn't know. No, no, but the reason I think this is import=
ant is because I heard from a lot of folks who were saying how moms and d=
ads were feeling guilty. They're feeling sad. They're feeling depressed. =
Oh, Lord, whats -- how is this going to affect my child. And its right to=
 be angry. But you can't get passive. You can't just suddenly sit back an=
d sink into despair. Our kids will be fine, but you have to now take acti=
on. Don't wait for somebody else to reach out and ask whether your child =
has gotten a checkup recently. We just expanded Medicaid. Go take your ch=
ild to that doctor. (Applause.) Use that health system.



 And so community organizations, churches, et cetera, one of the things t=
hat we need to do is -- and Ive talked to the Governor and the Mayor abou=
t this -- is set up a system of outreach so that we're getting everybody =
as a village looking out for every child, making sure that they're gettin=
g checked up, making sure they've got pediatric care, making sure they're=
 being tested effectively, making sure then that they're getting nutritio=
us food.



 Just to give you an example, we know that if kids are getting vegetables=
 and eating properly -- that, just by itself, is going to have some impac=
t on any effects of lead. But I know that here in Flint there are whole n=
eighborhoods that don't even have a supermarket. So we're going to have t=
o figure out how to get supermarkets in those communities. (Applause.) An=
d in the meantime, we got to help make sure that those kids are getting t=
he nutrition they need.



 So I say all this just to indicate you should be angry, but channel that=
 anger. You should be hurt, but don't sink into despair. And most of all,=
 do not somehow communicate to our children here in this city that they'r=
e going to be saddled with problems for the rest of their lives. Because =
they will not. (Applause.) Theyll do just fine, just like I did fine with=
 a single mom, and a lot of you did fine growing up in a tough neighborho=
od. Theyll make it as long as we're there for them and looking after them=
, and doing the right thing for them and giving them the resources that t=
hey need. (Applause.) Don't lose hope. (Applause.) Don't lose hope.=20



 I talked longer than I was going to. (Laughter.) But I feel strongly abo=
ut this whole issue with kids now. Kids rise to the expectations we set f=
or them. (Applause.) A lot of kids in Flint already got some crosses they=
 got to bear. They've already got people telling them, oh, its too tough =
for you because you're black or you're poor. They will do fine as long as=
 we do right by them. And that's my intention. And set high expectations =
for them.=20



Just a couple more points. What happened here is just an extreme example,=
 an extreme and tragic case of whats happening in a lot of places around =
the country. Weve seen unacceptably high levels of lead in townships alon=
g the Jersey Shore and in North Carolinas major cities. Weve seen it in t=
he capitals of South Carolina and Mississippi. And even, not long ago, le=
ad-contaminated drinking water was found right down the street from the U=
nited States Capitol.



So Flint is just a tip of the iceberg in terms of us reinvesting in our c=
ommunities. (Applause.) Weve seen bridges fall and levies break. So weve =
got to break that mindset. These things arent a coincidence. Theyre the s=
ame mindset that left Flints water unsafe to drink. And its self-destruct=
ive when we dont invest in our communities. Because a lot of times the pe=
ople who are against government spending, theyll say, well, the private s=
ector is the key. The private sector is the key for our economy. Free mar=
kets and free enterprise are great. But companies wont invest in a place =
where your infrastructure is crumbling and your roads are broke. (Applaus=
e.) Youre not going to start a business or be able to recruit outstanding=
 staff if theres no safe drinking water in the city. (Applause.)=20



So my hope is, is that this begins a national conversation about what we =
need to do to invest in future generations. And its no secret that, on th=
is pipeline of neglect, a lot of times its the most poor folks who are le=
ft behind. Its working people who are left behind. We see it in communiti=
es across the Midwest that havent recovered since the plants shut down. W=
e see it on inner city corners where they might be able to drink the wate=
r, but they cant find a job. We see it in the rural hills of Appalachia.



Weve got to break that mindset that says that that neighborhood over ther=
e, thats not my problem; those kids over there, they dont look like my ki=
ds exactly, so I dont have to worry about them -- out of sight, out of mi=
nd. Weve got to break that attitude that says somehow theres an us in the=
m, and remind ourselves that theres just one big we -- the American famil=
y, and everybody has got to look out for each other. (Applause.) Because =
the kids here in Flint arent those kids, theyre our kids. (Applause.) Tha=
ts what Scripture teaches us. But Im not going to start preaching in fron=
t of some pastors.=20



So let me just close by saying this. Look, I know this has been a scary t=
ime. I know this is disappointing. Youve been let down. But there is a se=
rmon about a phoenix rising from these ashes. And there is the opportunit=
y out of this complete screw-up, this painful tragedy, this neglect, this=
 disappointment to actually pull together and make for a better future.=20=




Sometimes it takes a crisis for everybody to focus their attention. Becau=
se there have been a lot of crises going on in Flint; they just werent as=
 loud and noisy, and nobody noticed. (Applause.) There are a lot of small=
, quiet crises going on in the lives of people around this country. And t=
his helps lift it up.=20



And when we see it, and we understand it, and we feel it, then maybe we s=
tart making a connection with each other. And that begins to change our m=
indset and improve our politics and improve our government to make it mor=
e responsive and more accountable. And the good news is, is that thats th=
e natural mindset of our young people. Thats why Im so hopeful about the =
people of Flint. Thats why Im so hopeful about America generally, is I me=
et young people all the time, and theyve got a mindset just like Little M=
iss Flint here. She decides, Im just going right to the President, becaus=
e I think we can fix this. Or the mindset of Isiah raising $15,000 to hel=
p an elementary school where hes never been.=20



Thats America. Thats who we are at our best. We are a nation of individua=
ls, and we should be proud of everything that we can accomplish on our ow=
n through hard work, and grit, and looking after our own families, and ma=
king sure were raising our children right. But we dont do these things al=
one. Ultimately, our success is dependent on each other. Our success is d=
ependent on each other.



I have had the privilege of being the President of the United States, a b=
ig office -- (applause) -- an office that gives me enormous power and eno=
rmous responsibility. But the thing Ive learned in that job is that I can=
t do it by myself. I cant fix every problem on my own. I need a mother-in=
-law who helps Michelle and me raise Malia and Sasha. (Applause.) I need =
incredible staff who are carrying out our policies to sign people up for =
health care. Ive got to have our incredible men and women in uniform who =
are willing to go overseas and fight on behalf of our freedom. (Applause.=
) Ive got to have governors and mayors who are willing to work with me to=
 get things done in their states and in their cities.=20



And, most of all, I need fellow citizens who share the values that built =
this great country and are willing to work with me and work together to m=
ake it better. I said this before: The most important office in a democra=
cy is the office of citizen. Its more important than the President. More =
important than any senator or governor or mayor. (Applause.) It is the id=
ea that each of us has something to contribute, each of us has something =
to give back.=20



So, Flint, Im here not just to say Ive got your back. Im here not just to=
 say that you will get help. Im also here to say youve got power. Im also=
 here to say you count. Im also here to say that you can make a differenc=
e and rebuild this city better than ever. And youll have a friend and par=
tner in the President of the United States. (Applause.)=20



God bless you. God bless Flint. God bless Michigan. God bless the United =
States of America. (Applause.)=20

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Now, not too long ago, I rec=
eived a letter from a young lady, an eight-year-old girl named Mari Copeny.=
&nbsp; You may know her as &#8220;Little Miss Flint.&#8221;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Those of you who have seats,=
 please feel free to sit down so folks can see behind you.&nbsp; If you don=
&#8217;t have a seat, don&#8217;t sit down.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And like a lot of you, Mari =
has been worried about what happened here in Flint.&nbsp; She&#8217;s worri=
ed about what it means for children like her.&nbsp; She's worried
 about the future of this city and this community.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So in the middle of a traged=
y that should have never happened here in the United States of America -- t=
he denial of something as basic as clean, safe drinking
 water -- this eight-year-old girl spoke out and marched and, like many of =
you, protested.&nbsp; As Mari was getting ready to hop on a bus to Washingt=
on, she wrote to ask if she could meet with me while she was in town.&nbsp;=
 There she is.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Now, I would have been happy=
 to see Mari in Washington.&nbsp; But when something like this happens, a y=
oung girl shouldn&#8217;t have to go to Washington to be heard.&nbsp;
 I thought her President should come to Flint to meet with her.&nbsp; (Appl=
ause.)&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here -- to tell you directly th=
at I see you and I hear you, and I want to hear directly from you about how=
 this public health crisis has disrupted your lives, how
 it's made you angry, how it's made you worried.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And I just had a chance to m=
eet with a few of your neighbors in a roundtable discussion, and I heard fr=
om them what I know a lot of you are feeling:&nbsp; That
 a lot of you are scared.&nbsp; That all of you feel let down.&nbsp; And I =
told them that I understood why you'd be afraid -- not just for yourselves,=
 but for your kids.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">I also wanted to come here, =
though, to tell you that I've got your back -- (applause) -- that we're pay=
ing attention.&nbsp; So I met and heard directly from
 those who are leading the federal response and who are working hard to mak=
e sure that Flint is whole again, to make sure that this proud city bounces=
 back not just to where it was, but stronger than ever.&nbsp; And I want al=
l of you to know I am confident that
 Flint will come back.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I will not rest, and I'm goi=
ng to make sure that the leaders, at every level of government, don&#8217;t=
 rest until every drop of water that flows to your homes is safe to drink a=
nd safe to cook with, and safe to bathe in -- because
 that's part of the basic responsibilities of a government in the United St=
ates of America.&nbsp; (Applause.)
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So as President, I&#8217;ve =
sent Flint the best resources our federal government has to support our sta=
te and local partners.&nbsp; The agencies that serve you --
 the agencies that specialize in health and housing, and those that support=
 small businesses and our kids&#8217; education; those that are responsible=
 for the food that our children eat and, of course, the water we drink. Eve=
rybody is on duty.&nbsp; The National Guard
 is on duty.&nbsp; This is a hands-on-deck situation -- all hands on deck.&=
nbsp; Because if there's a child who feels neglected on the north side of F=
lint, or a family on the east side of this city who wonders whether they sh=
ould give up on their hometown and move away,
 or an immigrant who wonders whether America means what we say about being =
a place where we take care of our own.&nbsp; That matters to all of us -- n=
ot just in Flint, not just in Michigan, but all across America.&nbsp; Flint=
&#8217;s recovery is everybody&#8217;s responsibility.&nbsp;
 (Applause.)&nbsp; And I&#8217;m going to make sure that responsibility is =
met.&nbsp; (Applause.)
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So I just talked with some o=
f the team of responders that are on the ground to make sure that they&#821=
7;re coordinating.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re doing some incredible
 things.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve distributed enough water to fill more than thr=
ee Olympic-sized swimming pools.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve distributed thousands =
of filters.&nbsp; They&#8217;re helping students afford nutritious food tha=
t work against the contaminants in bad water.&nbsp; They&#8217;re making su=
re
 new moms have access to instant infant formula that doesn&#8217;t require =
water.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve expanded health services for children and pregna=
nt women, and education programs for Flint&#8217;s youngest children.&nbsp;=
 They&#8217;re out there testing homes for lead and testing children
 for exposure to lead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">But like all our best respon=
ses in tough times, this is not a government effort alone.&nbsp; We need ou=
r businesses and nonprofits and philanthropies to step
 up.&nbsp; And what&#8217;s incredible about Flint is how many volunteers h=
ave already been leading the way.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got =
members of one union, UA Local 370, that have donated tens of thousands of =
dollars and 10,000 hours of their time.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve installed
 thousands of filters, hundreds of faucets by going door to door, night and=
 day.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not asking for anything in return, they&#8217;re =
just doing the right thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So many Americans, here in F=
lint and around the country, have proven that you don&#8217;t have be a plu=
mber or a pipefitter to pitch in -- although it&#8217;s very
 helpful if you&#8217;re a plumber or pipefitter.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; S=
o, in March, dozens of accountants teamed up with the American Red Cross to=
 help residents recycle all the plastic water bottles that have been piling=
 up.&nbsp; Religious and community groups are organizing
 supply drives, supporting families, offering free medical services.&nbsp; =
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">The director of a local danc=
e studio, I understand, found a creative way to help; she&#8217;s letting p=
eople use her studio as a space to support one another
 by sharing their stories and realizing they&#8217;re not alone.&nbsp; Even=
 inmates at an Indiana prison came together to donate more than $2,500 to t=
he people of Flint.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And a second-grader from Virgin=
ia, a young man named Isiah Britt, set up a website to
 see if he could raise $500 for hand sanitizers to send to the kids at Eise=
nhower Elementary here in Flint.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; So Isiah, it&#8217=
;s fair to say, surpassed his goal, because he raised $15,000.&nbsp; (Appla=
use.)&nbsp; And he explained that the experience taught him
 just because you&#8217;re small &#8220;doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t =
do big things.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So when you think of all tho=
se stories, it should be clear that the American people care about Flint.&n=
bsp; The American people are paying attention and they
 care about you.&nbsp; And as is true when disasters strike in other ways, =
people pitch in, they come together.&nbsp; Because they imagine, &#8220;All=
 right, that could have been me.&#8221;&nbsp; That&#8217;s the good news.&n=
bsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">The bad news is that this sh=
ould not have happened in the first place.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And even=
 though the scope of the response looks sort of like the efforts
 we&#8217;re used to seeing after a natural disaster, that&#8217;s not what=
 this was.&nbsp; This was a manmade disaster.&nbsp; This was avoidable.&nbs=
p; This was preventable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Now, I&#8217;m not here to g=
o through the full history of what happened.&nbsp; Like a lot of manufactur=
ing towns, Flint&#8217;s economy has been taking hits for decades
 now -- plants closing, jobs moving away.&nbsp; Manufacturing has shrunk.&n=
bsp; And that&#8217;s made it harder for the city to maintain city services=
.&nbsp; And let&#8217;s face it, government officials at every level weren&=
#8217;t attentive to potential problems the way they should have
 been.&nbsp; So they start getting short-staffed, they start getting a shri=
nking tax base, more demand for services.&nbsp; Things start getting strain=
ed, and there&#8217;s not enough help from the outside.&nbsp; And then when=
 Flint&#8217;s finances collapsed, an emergency manager was
 put in place whose mandate was primarily to cut at all costs.&nbsp; And th=
en some very poor decisions were made.&nbsp; All these things contributed t=
o this crisis.&nbsp; Many of you know the story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Now, I do not believe that a=
nybody consciously wanted to hurt the people in Flint.&nbsp; And this is no=
t the place to sort out every screw-up that resulted
 in contaminated water.&nbsp; But I do think there is a larger issue that w=
e have to acknowledge, because I do think that part of what contributed to =
this crisis was a broader mindset, a bigger attitude, a corrosive attitude =
that exists in our politics and exists
 in too many levels of our government.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p><=
/span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And it&#8217;s a mindset tha=
t believes that less government is the highest good no matter what.&nbsp; I=
t&#8217;s a mindset that says environmental rules designed to keep
 your water clean or your air clean are optional, or not that important, or=
 unnecessarily burden businesses or taxpayers.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an ideology=
 that undervalues the common good, says we&#8217;re all on our own and what=
&#8217;s in it for me, and how do I do well, but I&#8217;m not
 going to invest in what we need as a community.&nbsp; And, as a consequenc=
e, you end up seeing an underinvestment in the things that we all share tha=
t make us safe, that make us whole, that give us the ability to pursue our =
own individual dreams.&nbsp; So we underinvest
 in pipes underground.&nbsp; We underinvest in bridges that we drive on, an=
d the roads that connect us, and the schools that move us forward.&nbsp; (A=
pplause.)
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And this is part of the atti=
tude, this is part of the mindset:&nbsp; We especially underinvest when the=
 communities that are put at risk are poor, or don't
 have a lot of political clout -- (applause) -- and so are not as often hea=
rd in the corridors of power.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And this kind of thinking --=
 this myth that government is always the enemy; that forgets that our gover=
nment is us -- it&#8217;s us; that it&#8217;s an extension of
 us, ourselves -- that attitude is as corrosive to our democracy as the stu=
ff that resulted in lead in your water.&nbsp; Because what happens is it le=
ads to systematic neglect.&nbsp; It leads to carelessness and callousness.&=
nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It leads to a lot of hidden
 disasters that you don't always read about and aren&#8217;t as flashy, but=
 that over time diminish the life of a community and make it harder for our=
 young people to succeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">In one of the roundtables, I=
 was listening to somebody -- I think it was a pastor who told me, you know=
, it made us feel like we didn't count.&nbsp; And you
 can't have a democracy where people feel like they don't count, where peop=
le feel like they're not heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And that attitude ignores ho=
w this country was built, our entire history -- which is based on the idea =
that we're all connected and that what happens in
 a community like Flint matters everybody, and that there are things that w=
e can only do together, as a nation, as a people, as a state, as a city tha=
t no man is an island.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">We've been debating this sin=
ce the Republic began:&nbsp; What are our individual responsibilities and w=
hat are our collective responsibilities.&nbsp; And that's
 a good debate.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ve always believed what the first Republi=
can President, a guy named Abraham Lincoln, said.&nbsp; He said we should d=
o individually those things that we do best by ourselves.&nbsp; But through=
 our government, we should do together what we can't
 do as well for ourselves.&nbsp; (Applause.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So it doesn't matter how har=
d you work, how responsible you are, or how well you raise your kids -- you=
 can't set up a whole water system for a city.&nbsp;
 That's not something you do by yourself.&nbsp; You do it with other people=
.&nbsp; You can't hire your own fire department, or your own police force, =
or your own army.&nbsp; There are things we have to do together -- basic th=
ings that we all benefit from.&nbsp;

 public schools.&nbsp; That's how we invested in science and research.&nbsp=

 These how we invested in community colleges and land grant colleges like M=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

&#8217;m still waiting for my water.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Somebody obvio=
usly didn't hear me.&nbsp; Usually I get my water pretty quick.&nbsp; Hold =
on a

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Now, the reason I know I&#82=
17;m okay is because I already had some Flint water.&nbsp; There we go.&nbs=
p; I really did need a glass of water.&nbsp; This is not a stunt.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So where do we go from here?=
&nbsp; Now, Mayor Weaver has a plan to fix the pipes in Flint.&nbsp; And un=
fortunately, because the state initially cut so many corners,
 it&#8217;s going to end up being more expensive -- much more expensive now=
 than it would have been to avert the disaster in the first place.&nbsp; Bu=
t the good news is that Michigan does have funds it can use from the federa=
l government to help Flint.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; The
 Governor indicated that in his budget he has put forward additional funds =
to replace the pipes.&nbsp; In order for it to happen -- and I said this to=
 the Mayor and the Governor; I had them both in my car, the Beast -- I told=
 them I wasn&#8217;t going to let either of
 them out until we figured this out.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I had Secret S=
ervice surrounding everybody.&nbsp; (Applause.)
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">But what I said was, is that=
 the city and the state and the federal government, everybody is going to h=
ave to work together to get this done.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s
 not going to happen overnight.&nbsp; But we have to get started.&nbsp; We =
have to get the money flowing.&nbsp; We've got to work with our plumbers an=
d pipefitters, but also train local residents and start getting apprentices=
hip programs going -- (applause) -- so that even
 as we&#8217;re trying to deal with this disaster, we&#8217;re also hopeful=
ly lifting people up and giving them an opportunity for employment.&nbsp; (=
Applause.)&nbsp; Congress, led by your congressional delegation, needs to a=
ct in a bipartisan fashion, do their job, make sure Flint
 has the necessary resources.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And so it&#8217;s long past =
time that Flint has a well-managed, monitored, modern water system that pro=
tects not just against lead, but other contaminants.&nbsp;
 All right?&nbsp; So that&#8217;s our goal.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one goal.&nb=
sp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">But we&#8217;ve got to do mo=
re than just ensure the integrity and safety of your water for the long ter=
m.&nbsp; What we also have to do is work as one team -- federal,
 state, and local leaders, Democrats and Republicans -- to address some of =
the broader issues that have been raised by this crisis.&nbsp; The federal =
officials I met with today are committed to staying on the job until we get=
 it done.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But that requires
 the state of Michigan to step up and be fully invested in this process, as=
 well.&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;Today&#8217;s vote in Lansing to increase fu=
nding for health care was a good start.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">But part of keeping the fait=
h with the people of Flint means making sure that you&#8217;re first in lin=
e for the jobs this effort will create.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
 It means that since the state voted this afternoon to expand Medicaid, eve=
ry child who lived in Flint while the water was bad needs to be able to get=
 seen by a doctor, diagnosed, make sure that there&#8217;s follow-up.&nbsp;=
 We can&#8217;t just promise it, we&#8217;ve got to deliver
 it.&nbsp; And that means everybody has got to cooperate.&nbsp; Everybody h=
as got to cooperate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And keeping the faith with y=
ou also means the state has to step up and deliver the resources that will =
help not only fix the water, but transform Flint
 so that it is once again a functioning city with the capacity and the demo=
cratic structures to work.&nbsp; The city government has to be on a firm fo=
undation.&nbsp; The mayor can&#8217;t do it by herself.&nbsp; She&#8217;s g=
ot to have a team and a staff, and there&#8217;s got to be a budget
 that works, that&#8217;s sustainable, and a plan for long-term economic de=
velopment, and a plan to make sure that health care is available to all of =
our kids, and a plan to make sure that education is top-notch in this city,=
 and that more jobs are being created.&nbsp;
 (Applause.)&nbsp; And that will require many more of the good work that we=
&#8217;ve seen from citizens and community groups who care about your famil=
ies.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">But it&#8217;s not enough ju=
st to fix the water.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got to fix the culture of neglect, t=
he mindset I was talking about -- (applause) -- that has degraded
 too many schools and too many roads and hurt too many futures.&nbsp; We&#8=
217;ve got to fix the mindset that only leaves people cynical about our gov=

<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

dible) Detroit!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I&#8217=
;m in Flint right now, not Detroit.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But I do love D=
etroit.&nbsp; And their school needs support, and there is -- some of that
 same mindset has hurt the schools there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">But listen up, because this =
is drawn from the conversations I had with many of your neighbors and frien=
ds, as well as the federal response teams that I
 sent out here a while back.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to do everything we ca=
n to accelerate getting new pipes here in Flint.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Bu=
t even with all the money, even with an efficient, speeded-up process, it&#=
8217;s going to take a while for all the pipes to be replaced.&nbsp;
 It&#8217;s not going to happen next month.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not going to h=
appen six months from now, where all the pipes in Flint are going to be rep=
laced.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got to get started, and you need to see that it&#8=
217;s getting started and that progress is being made.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s=
 not
 going to happen overnight.&nbsp; Even if we get all the plumbers and pipef=
itters, and we get some more apprentices trained -- even if we do all that,=
 it&#8217;s going to take some time.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And so one of the things I h=
eard talking to a lot of your neighbors is, boy, right now it&#8217;s rough=
 just trying to figure out how to get bottled water on
 the way home from work, and you&#8217;re trying to just shower real quick,=
 and people are still concerned about what&#8217;s safe and what informatio=
n is correct and what is not.&nbsp; So I do want to just tell you what I kn=
ow, based on not just what I&#8217;ve been reading in the
 papers, but what our top scientists have told me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">The first is that while you =
are waiting to get your pipes replaced, you need to have a filter installed=
, and use that filter.&nbsp; And if you do use that filter,
 then the water is safe to consume for children over the age of six and who=
 are not pregnant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

dible.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Now, ho=
ld on a second.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t just start shouting, okay?&nbsp; Because =
this is the problem -- we're going to have to solve this problem.&nbsp; And
 if people don&#8217;t listen to each other, then it's not going to get fix=
ed.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I&#8217;m telling you --=
 and I promise you, I&#8217;m really good at stirring folks up.&nbsp; So if=
 I want to just come here and stir folks up, I know how to do that.&nbsp; B=
ut that's not actually going to solve the problem, all right?&nbsp; So I&#8=
217;m telling
 what I know, because I guarantee you that the scientists who work for me, =
if they tell me something -- which I&#8217;m saying in front of all those c=
ameras -- turns out to be wrong, that person will not have a job.&nbsp; (Ap=
plause.)
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So although I understand th=
e fear and concern that people have, and it is entirely legitimate, what th=
e science tells us at this stage is you should not drink any of the water t=
hat is not filtered.&nbsp; But if you get the filter and use
 it properly, that water can be consumed.&nbsp; That's point number one.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you can get those filte=
rs free, and people will help install them if you need help -- particularly=
 seniors who may have trouble going back and forth and trying to get a whol=
e bunch of bottles of water and so forth.&nbsp; So that's information
 that I trust and I believe.&nbsp; That's point number one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Point number two:&nbsp; Eve=
ry child in Flint who may have consumed water during the course of this tra=
gedy -- and that is the overwhelming majority of children here -- should ge=
t checked.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the reason that's impo=
rtant is because lead is a serious issue.&nbsp; And if undiagnosed and not =
dealt with, it can lead to some long-term problems.&nbsp; But -- and this i=
s really important, so I want everybody to pay attention -- if you
 know that your child may have been exposed and you go to a health clinic, =
a doctor, a provider, and are working with them, then your child will be fi=
ne.&nbsp; And the reason I can say that with some confidence is not just ba=
sed on science, but based on the fact
 that keep in mind that it wasn&#8217;t until the &#8216;80s where we start=
ed banning lead in paint, lead in toys, lead in gasoline.&nbsp; So if you a=
re my age, or older, or maybe even a little bit younger, you got some lead =
in your system when you were growing up.&nbsp; You did.&nbsp;
 I am sure that somewhere, when I was two years old, I was taking a chip of=
 paint, tasting it, and I got some lead.&nbsp; Or sometimes toys were paint=
ed with lead, and you were chewing on them.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I say that not to make=
 light of the situation.&nbsp; We know now what we didn't know then, which =
is it can cause problems if children get exposed to lead at elevated levels=
.&nbsp; But the point is that as long as kids are getting good health
 care, and folks are paying attention, and they're getting a good education=
, and they have community support, and they're getting some good home train=
ing, and they are in a community that is loving and nurturing and thriving,=
 these kids will be fine.&nbsp; And I
 don't want anybody to start thinking that somehow all the kids in Flint ar=
e going to have problems for the rest of their lives, because that's not tr=
ue.&nbsp; That is not true.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp; And I don't want =
that stigma to be established in the minds of kids.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've learned a lot of thin=
gs since I was a kid.&nbsp; I used to have adults blowing smoke in my face =
all the time.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; We didn't use seat belts.&nbsp; We wr=
apped dry-cleaning bags around us and thought that was funny.&nbsp; (Laught=
er.)&nbsp;
 Folks didn't know.&nbsp; No, no, but the reason I think this is important =
is because I heard from a lot of folks who were saying how moms and dads we=
re feeling guilty.&nbsp; They're feeling sad.&nbsp; They're feeling depress=
ed.&nbsp; Oh, Lord, what&#8217;s -- how is this going to affect
 my child.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s right to be angry.&nbsp; But you can't get =
passive.&nbsp; You can't just suddenly sit back and sink into despair.&nbsp=
; Our kids will be fine, but you have to now take action.&nbsp; Don't wait =
for somebody else to reach out and ask whether your child has gotten
 a checkup recently.&nbsp; We just expanded Medicaid.&nbsp; Go take your ch=
ild to that doctor.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Use that health system.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so community organizati=
ons, churches, et cetera, one of the things that we need to do is -- and I&=
#8217;ve talked to the Governor and the Mayor about this -- is set up a sys=
tem of outreach so that we're getting everybody as a village
 looking out for every child, making sure that they're getting checked up, =
making sure they've got pediatric care, making sure they're being tested ef=
fectively, making sure then that they're getting nutritious food.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to give you an example=
, we know that if kids are getting vegetables and eating properly -- that, =
just by itself, is going to have some impact on any effects of lead.&nbsp; =
But I know that here in Flint there are whole neighborhoods
 that don't even have a supermarket.&nbsp; So we're going to have to figure=
 out how to get supermarkets in those communities.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; =
And in the meantime, we got to help make sure that those kids are getting t=
he nutrition they need.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I say all this just to i=
ndicate you should be angry, but channel that anger.&nbsp; You should be hu=
rt, but don't sink into despair.&nbsp; And most of all, do not somehow comm=
unicate to our children here in this city that they're going to
 be saddled with problems for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; Because they w=
ill not.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; They&#8217;ll do just fine, just like I di=
d fine with a single mom, and a lot of you did fine growing up in a tough n=
eighborhood.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll make it as long as we're there
 for them and looking after them, and doing the right thing for them and gi=
ving them the resources that they need.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Don't lose =
hope.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Don't lose hope.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I talked longer than I was =
going to.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But I feel strongly about this whole issu=
e with kids now.&nbsp; Kids rise to the expectations we set for them.&nbsp;=
 (Applause.)&nbsp; A lot of kids in Flint already got some crosses they got=
 to
 bear.&nbsp; They've already got people telling them, oh, it&#8217;s too to=
ugh for you because you're black or you're poor.&nbsp; They will do fine as=
 long as we do right by them.&nbsp; And that's my intention.&nbsp; And set =
high expectations for them.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Just a couple more points=
.&nbsp; What happened here is just an extreme example, an extreme and tragi=
c case of what&#8217;s happening in a lot of places around the country.&nbs=
p; We&#8217;ve seen unacceptably high levels of lead in townships
 along the Jersey Shore and in North Carolina&#8217;s major cities.&nbsp; W=
e&#8217;ve seen it in the capitals of South Carolina and Mississippi.&nbsp;=
 And even, not long ago, lead-contaminated drinking water was found right d=
own the street from the United States Capitol.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So Flint is just a tip of=
 the iceberg in terms of us reinvesting in our communities.&nbsp; (Applause=
.)&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen bridges fall and levies break.&nbsp; So we&#8217;=
ve got to break that mindset.&nbsp; These things aren&#8217;t a coincidence=
.&nbsp;
 They&#8217;re the same mindset that left Flint&#8217;s water unsafe to dri=
nk.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s self-destructive when we don&#8217;t invest in our=
 communities.&nbsp; Because a lot of times the people who are against gover=
nment spending, they&#8217;ll say, well, the private sector is the key.&nbs=
p;
 The private sector is the key for our economy.&nbsp; Free markets and free=
 enterprise are great.&nbsp; But companies won&#8217;t invest in a place wh=
ere your infrastructure is crumbling and your roads are broke.&nbsp; (Appla=
use.)&nbsp; You&#8217;re not going to start a business or be able
 to recruit outstanding staff if there&#8217;s no safe drinking water in th=
e city.&nbsp; (Applause.)
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So my hope is, is that th=
is begins a national conversation about what we need to do to invest in fut=
ure generations.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s no secret that, on this pipeline of n=
eglect, a lot of times it&#8217;s the most poor folks
 who are left behind.&nbsp; It&#8217;s working people who are left behind.&=
nbsp; We see it in communities across the Midwest that haven&#8217;t recove=
red since the plants shut down.&nbsp; We see it on inner city corners where=
 they might be able to drink the water, but they can&#8217;t find
 a job.&nbsp; We see it in the rural hills of Appalachia.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We&#8217;ve got to break =
that mindset that says that that neighborhood over there, that&#8217;s not =
my problem; those kids over there, they don&#8217;t look like my kids exact=
ly, so I don&#8217;t have to worry about them -- out of sight,
 out of mind.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got to break that attitude that says someho=
w there&#8217;s an &#8220;us&#8221; in &#8220;them,&#8221; and remind ourse=
lves that there&#8217;s just one big &#8220;we&#8221; -- the American famil=
y, and everybody has got to look out for each other.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp=
; Because the kids here in
 Flint aren&#8217;t &#8220;those&#8221; kids, they&#8217;re &#8220;our&#822=
1; kids.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That&#8217;s what Scripture teaches us.&nb=
sp; But I&#8217;m not going to start preaching in front of some pastors.&nb=
sp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So let me just close by s=
aying this.&nbsp; Look, I know this has been a scary time.&nbsp; I know thi=
s is disappointing.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve been let down.&nbsp; But there is a =
sermon about a phoenix rising from these ashes.&nbsp; And there is
 the opportunity out of this complete screw-up, this painful tragedy, this =
neglect, this disappointment to actually pull together and make for a bette=
r future.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Sometimes it takes a cris=
is for everybody to focus their attention.&nbsp; Because there have been a =
lot of crises going on in Flint; they just weren&#8217;t as loud and noisy,=
 and nobody noticed.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; There are a
 lot of small, quiet crises going on in the lives of people around this cou=
ntry.&nbsp; And this helps lift it up.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And when we see it, and w=
e understand it, and we feel it, then maybe we start making a connection wi=
th each other.&nbsp; And that begins to change our mindset and improve our =
politics and improve our government to make
 it more responsive and more accountable.&nbsp; And the good news is, is th=
at that&#8217;s the natural mindset of our young people.&nbsp; That&#8217;s=
 why I&#8217;m so hopeful about the people of Flint.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why=
 I&#8217;m so hopeful about America generally, is I meet young people all t=
he
 time, and they&#8217;ve got a mindset just like Little Miss Flint here.&nb=
sp; She decides, I&#8217;m just going right to the President, because I thi=
nk we can fix this.&nbsp; Or the mindset of Isiah raising $15,000 to help a=
n elementary school where he&#8217;s never been.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That&#8217;s America.&nbs=
p; That&#8217;s who we are at our best.&nbsp; We are a nation of individual=
s, and we should be proud of everything that we can accomplish on our own t=
hrough hard work, and grit, and looking after our own families,
 and making sure we&#8217;re raising our children right.&nbsp; But we don&#=
8217;t do these things alone.&nbsp; Ultimately, our success is dependent on=
 each other.&nbsp; Our success is dependent on each other.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I have had the privilege =
of being the President of the United States, a big office -- (applause) -- =
an office that gives me enormous power and enormous responsibility.&nbsp; B=
ut the thing I&#8217;ve learned in that job is
 that I can&#8217;t do it by myself.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t fix every problem =
on my own.&nbsp; I need a mother-in-law who helps Michelle and me raise Mal=
ia and Sasha.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I need incredible staff who are carry=
ing out our policies to sign people up for health care.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve go=
t
 to have our incredible men and women in uniform who are willing to go over=
seas and fight on behalf of our freedom.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I&#8217;ve=
 got to have governors and mayors who are willing to work with me to get th=
ings done in their states and in their cities.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And, most of all, I need =
fellow citizens who share the values that built this great country and are =
willing to work with me and work together to make it better.&nbsp; I said t=
his before:&nbsp; The most important office in
 a democracy is the office of citizen.&nbsp; It&#8217;s more important than=
 the President.&nbsp; More important than any senator or governor or mayor.=
&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It is the idea that each of us has something to co=
ntribute, each of us has something to give back.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, Flint, I&#8217;m here=
 not just to say I&#8217;ve got your back.&nbsp; I&#8217;m here not just to=
 say that you will get help.&nbsp; I&#8217;m also here to say you&#8217;ve =
got power.&nbsp; I&#8217;m also here to say you count.&nbsp; I&#8217;m also=
 here to say that you can
 make a difference and rebuild this city better than ever.&nbsp; And you&#8=
217;ll have a friend and partner in the President of the United States.&nbs=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
