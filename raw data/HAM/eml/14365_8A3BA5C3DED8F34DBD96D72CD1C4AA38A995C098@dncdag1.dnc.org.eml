I'm holding until we hear about Ken's blast. I'm also not sure if he'll be able to afford it, but wanted to let you know!

Hello Daniel,

We spoke earlier this week with regard to information I needed to pass on to you in order to attend the dinner on June 8.

Are seats at the event still available? My daughter worked as a volunteer for President Obama's campaign in Ohio in 2008, when she was seventeen. As it turns out, it was a formative event in her life. Getting an opportunity to meet the President in such an intimate setting would be an enormous thrill for her. She is leaving NYC in August to start a PhD in Molecular Biology and Genetics at Cal Berkeley and I would like to give her the best sendoff possible by getting her into the dinner on June 8th, assuming I can afford it!

Please let me know if there are any open seats and what would be expected for a donation to the DNC.

Many thanks,
Giulio Martini(gmartini@lordabbett.com is the email address we've been in contact through previously.)
