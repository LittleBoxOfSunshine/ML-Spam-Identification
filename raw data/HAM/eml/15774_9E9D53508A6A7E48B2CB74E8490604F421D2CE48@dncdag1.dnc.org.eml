Keep in mind that under Rand Paul's logic, actual slaves, who pay no taxes =
on their zero income, are therefore completely free.

us<http://www.salon.com/2015/07/07/rand_paul_dorm_room_philosopher_why_his_=

Salon - Simon Maloy

Presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul has a tax plan he'd like to sell you =
on. The plan, which would put in place a 14.5 percent flat tax, was crafted=
 with the input of some of the wrongest people in the conservative economic=
 policy world, and it would redistribute wealth up the economic ladder whil=
e tossing a bone or two to the people at the bottom. But Rand is proud of i=
t nonetheless, mainly because he thinks it's less slavery-like than your av=
erage tax scheme.

Here's what Paul said last week about taxation and "freedom," as reported b=
y BuzzFeed:

"Now you can have some government, we all need government," the Kentucky se=
nator said while discussing Thomas Paine and the role of government at the =
local public library. "Thomas Paine said that government is a necessary evi=
l. What did he mean by that?"

Paul said he believes that "you have to give up some of your liberty to hav=
e government," saying he was "for some government."

"I'm for paying some taxes," continued Paul. "But if we tax you at 100% the=
n you've got zero percent liberty. If we tax you at 50% you are half slave,=
 half free. I frankly would like to see you a little freer and a little mor=
e money remaining in your communities so you can create jobs. It's a debate=
 we need to have."

That was his big pitch - The Rand Paul tax plan: Only 14.5 percent slavery!

This is a dumb argument. And it's upsetting to hear this dumb argument comi=
ng from someone who is trying to be president, but will go back to writing =
and approving legislation if/when that doesn't work out. Taxation is not ta=
ntamount to slavery. The only thing that's comparable to slavery is actual =
slavery. You might not like it that a portion of your paycheck is sent to t=
he feds and your state government, and you may disagree with how your tax d=
ollars are spent, but that is in no way comparable to being kept in bondage=
 and having the fruits of your labor stolen from you.

Any way you look at this argument, it's bad. When you've staked out the pos=
ition that your effective tax rate is how you measure one's slave status, t=
hen you're arguing that a progressive tax structure means rich people are l=
ess free than the lucky poor folks who would see a smaller percentage of th=
eir income go to the government. By this reading, a hedge fund billionaire =
who moves his assets offshore to avoid paying taxes is basically Frederick =
Douglass. And when you refer to something as slavery, how can you then make=
 the case that there is an acceptable threshold for it? Why should 14.5 per=
cent slavery be any more tolerable than 100 percent slavery?


It gets even worse when you remember that Rand Paul is trying to make inroa=
ds with black voters and repair his party's abysmally bad reputation with A=
frican-Americans. Rand obviously understands at a certain level that slaver=
y was a uniquely horrific crime, the memory of which still haunts our polit=
ics. After the shootings in Charleston last month, Paul called for the Conf=
ederate flag to be removed from grounds of the South Carolina Capitol becau=
se "to every African-American in the country it's a symbolism of slavery to=
 them and now it's a symbol of murder to this young man." Here we are, just=
 a couple of weeks later, and he's comparing the grotesque human rights vio=
lations represented by that flag to the banal act of filing your annual tax=
 return.

And this isn't Rand Paul's first foray into comparing policies he disagrees=
 with to slavery. In 2011, during a Senate hearing, he said that a "right t=
o healthcare" would, in effect, make slaves out of doctors such as himself:

With regard to the idea whether or not you have a right to health care you =
have to realize what that implies. I am a physician. You have a right to co=
me to my house and conscript me. It means you believe in slavery. You are g=
oing to enslave not only me but the janitor at my hospital, the person who =
cleans my office, the assistants, the nurses. ... You are basically saying =
you believe in slavery.


On the flip side of the "slavery" argument, Paul argued earlier this year t=
hat the vaccination of children was "an issue of freedom," essentially sayi=
ng that parents should be free to have their kids be vectors for the commun=
ication of dangerous disease. (Before he was elected to the Senate, Paul we=
nt on Alex Jones' radio show and warned that mandatory vaccinations were a =
precursor to martial law.)

Rand's been espousing this strain of dorm-room libertarianism for quite som=
e time, reducing complex policy issues to black-and-white questions of "fre=
edom" and "slavery." He and others like him who carp on the slavery of taxe=
s and the tyranny of public health promotion are an obvious source of frust=
ration to other libertarians who would very much prefer that the public fac=
es of the "Libertarian Moment" stop making asses of themselves by cheapenin=
g the horror of America's slave past.
