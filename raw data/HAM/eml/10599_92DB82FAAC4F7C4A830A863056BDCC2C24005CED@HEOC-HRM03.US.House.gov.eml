Republicans Continue ABUSIVE INVESTIGATION IN VIOLATION OF House Rules
Democratic Leaders Call on Speaker Ryan to End the Panel=92s Witch Hunt
WASHINGTON, D.C. =96 Today, the Democratic Members of the Select Investigat=
ive Panel sent a letter<https://selectpaneldems-energycommerce.house.gov/si=
tes/default/files/2016_5_12_Dem_Letter_to_Speaker_Ryan.pdf> to Speaker Paul=
 Ryan calling on him to end Chair Blackburn=92s abusive investigation, whic=
h is being conducted in violation of House and Committee rules and practice=
 and putting doctors and researchers in danger.
=93The Republicans continue to be complicit in this coordinated attack on a=
bortion and women=92s health care providers,=94 said Ranking Member Jan Sch=
akowsky.  =93They have repeatedly targeted doctors and clinics in their wit=
ch hunt, putting patients and providers at risk.  Chair Blackburn=92s actio=
n yesterday goes beyond the pale, by issuing a press release naming a healt=
h care provider =96 whom the Panel has never reached out to =96 and making =
inflammatory accusations with no evidence of wrongdoing.  This reckless pan=
el is acting as judge, jury, and executioner and endangering lives. This go=
es beyond McCarthyism because now lives, not simply livelihoods are at risk=
.  It is time for Speaker Ryan to shut down this dangerous witch hunt witho=
ut delay.=94
In the letter the members write, =93Just last week, for example =96 and aft=
er Chair Blackburn and her staff repeatedly promised Ranking Member Schakow=
sky that they would provide a complete list of the individuals or entities =
being subpoenaed but then refused to do so =96 the Chair issued nineteen un=
ilateral subpoenas.  Of the nineteen entities and individuals served, seven=
teen were never afforded an opportunity to comply voluntarily before receiv=
ing a subpoena.=94  These subpoenas are in addition to fifteen unilateral s=
ubpoenas issued previously.
The letter continues, =93Just yesterday, for example, the Chair issued a pr=
ess release naming a doctor as now under investigation by the Panel.  Repub=
licans have not shared with Democrats any objective basis for targeting thi=
s individual, who has been the subject of anti-abortion violence for decade=
s, including a 1991 fire that destroyed his family farm, killing his dog, c=
at, and seventeen horses in claimed retaliation for the care that he provid=
es for women in this country.  The Chair=92s complete disregard for this do=
ctor=92s safety, particularly in light of the long history of targeted hara=
ssment and violence directed against him, is further evidence that this dan=
gerous witch hunt must end.=94
=93One deponent has already appealed to the Chairman of the Energy and Comm=
erce Committee and to you, Speaker Ryan, in an effort to get basic protecti=
on for individual privacy and safety.  Those requests have been refused or =
met with deafening silence.  Facing the threat of contempt, that person app=
eared before the Panel last week.  During eight hours of questioning, she w=
as asked to =93name names=94 by Republican staff who refused to explain how=
 their requests bore any relation to a legitimate investigative aim.  The R=
epublican demand that people appear and name other individuals when they do=
 so is reminiscent of Senator Joe McCarthy, whose bullying behavior ultimat=
ely resulted in censure by the U.S. Senate but not before he had damaged ma=
ny American=92s lives and careers with unfounded accusations.=94
The letter concludes, =94This investigation has uncovered no evidence of wr=
ongdoing and Chair Blackburn=92s unjustified witch hunt against researchers=
 and doctors is putting life-saving research and health care at risk.  This=
 investigation has never been =96 and has no hope of becoming =96 fair or f=
act-based and we call on you to disband it.=94
The letter was signed by Reps. Jan Schakowsky, Jerrold Nadler, Diana DeGett=
e, Jackie Speier, Suzan K. DelBene, and Bonnie Watson Coleman.
The full text of the letter is available below.


The Honorable Paul Ryan

Speaker of the House

H-232, United States Capitol

Washington, D.C. 20515


Dear Mr. Speaker:


We ask for your assistance in resolving what we believe is a serious abuse =
of congressional power.



When you were elected Speaker of the House, you stressed your desire to =93=
make some changes, starting with how the House does business,=94 including =
a =93return to regular order=94 and a desire to =93open up the process.=94[=
1]  We agree.  In your role as chairman of the Budget Committee and the Way=
s and Means Committee, you demonstrated your commitment to operate in an op=
en, transparent, and collegial manner.  The House Select Investigative Pane=
l created through H.Res. 461 is not operating in that fashion and should be=
 disbanded.





Chair Blackburn is Operating in Violation of House Rules



After promising Ranking Member Schakowsky last December that she would hold=
 an initial organizational meeting, Chair Blackburn has refused to hold any=
 such meeting or to discuss with Democrats an investigative plan or rules a=
nd a timeline for completion of the Panel=92s work.



In fact, when asked during the Panel=92s first public hearing to explain wh=
at the Panel is investigating and, in particular, how her sweeping demand f=
or the names of researchers, graduate students, lab technicians, clinical s=
taff, and doctors furthers any legitimate aim of this investigation, Chair =
Blackburn refused to do so.

Rep. Nadler:  =93Madam Chair, will you explain how the names of individual =
medical or graduate students, researchers, health care providers, and clini=
c personnel are pertinent to this investigation?=94

Chair Blackburn:  =93No, sir, I am not going to do that.=94[2]

Congress=92s broad authority to seek information is not unlimited.  Members=
 have an obligation to explain what they are investigating and how the info=
rmation that they seek furthers an authorized investigation.  =93To be mean=
ingful, the explanation must describe what the topic under inquiry is and t=
he connective reasoning whereby the precise questions asked relate to it.=
=94[3]

In addition to refusing to provide the basic, required explanation of what =
she is investigating and why, Chair Blackburn=92s day-to-day operation viol=
ates longstanding rules and practice of the House and its committees.  Chai=
r Blackburn has denied Democrats access to the Panel=92s records and files,=
 refused to identify the source or foundation for materials used in public =
hearings, and routinely issued unilateral subpoenas without the required no=
tice or consultation with Ranking Member Schakowsky.


Just last week, for example =96 and after Chair Blackburn and her staff rep=
eatedly promised Ranking Member Schakowsky that they would provide a comple=
te list of the individuals or entities being subpoenaed but then refused to=
 do so =96 the Chair issued nineteen unilateral subpoenas.  Of the nineteen=
 entities and individuals served, seventeen were never afforded an opportun=
ity to comply voluntarily before receiving a subpoena.  The remaining two h=
ad been sent a letter requesting information and already had provided docum=
ents and information to the Panel voluntarily.  They were never notified of=
 any purported non-compliance before then being issued subpoenas.



Having refused to afford entities the opportunity to comply voluntarily, th=
e Chair has made false public claims of widespread non-compliance and unjus=
tly portrayed individuals and entities as =93clearly rattled with basic fac=
ts coming to light=94 and resistant to =93letting all the facts come out.=
=94[4]  In fact, the Panel has received more than 18,000 pages of documents=
 over the course of this investigation, along with answers to questions pos=
ed by the Chair.


Through H.Res. 461, the Republican Majority unfortunately gave Chair Blackb=
urn unilateral subpoena authority; it did not grant her the power to exerci=
se that authority in blatant disregard of House and committee rules and pra=
ctice.  Chair Blackburn=92s =93secret=94 subpoenas =96 issued without the r=
equired notice or consultation, and without any effort to obtain voluntary =
cooperation first =96 do not reflect the values you have laid out or the ac=
cepted rules and practices of the House.

Chair Blackburn and Republican Leaders Are

Putting Researchers and Doctors in Danger



Perhaps most egregious, however, is the mistreatment of individuals who are=
 now being compelled to appear before the Panel.



Almost every person contacted by the Panel has expressed fear for their saf=
ety if identified in connection with this investigation, which has repeated=
ly been described by the Chair and other Republicans using highly misleadin=
g and inflammatory language.  These concerns are not hypothetical or exagge=
rated.


One of the individuals that Chair Blackburn has targeted already received g=
raphic death threats after being identified in David Daleiden=92s inflammat=
ory and deceptively-edited videos.[5]  The gunman who killed three people, =
injured nine others, and terrorized patients and providers at a Planned Par=
enthood clinic last November echoed nearly identical words as those used by=
 the Chair and others in connection with this investigation.[6]  And federa=
l Judge William H. Orrick has blocked further release of Daleiden=92s fraud=
ulent videos in light of the increased harassment, including death threats,=
 against individuals identified in those videos.[7]

Despite this clear risk, and after publicly and privately making assurances=
 that she would put procedures in place to safeguard individual privacy and=
 security, Chair Blackburn has refused to do so and, instead, has publicly =
named some of the key targets of her investigation.  Just yesterday, for ex=
ample, the Chair issued a press release naming a doctor as now under invest=
igation by the Panel.[8]  Republicans have not shared with Democrats any ob=
jective basis for targeting this individual, who has been the subject of an=
ti-abortion violence for decades, including a 1991 fire that destroyed his =
family farm, killing his dog, cat, and seventeen horses in claimed retaliat=
ion for the care that he provides for women in this country.[9]  The Chair=
=92s complete disregard for this doctor=92s safety, particularly in light o=
f the long history of targeted harassment and violence directed against him=
, is further evidence that this dangerous witch hunt must end.

The Chair=92s willingness to put doctors and researchers at risk =96 indivi=
duals against whom there is no objective evidence of wrongdoing =96 stands =
in stark contrast to the assurance on the Republicans=92 website, which pro=
mises that =93any personal information that you provide us will be kept in =
strict confidence.=94[10]  That assurance appears directly above a =93form=
=94 for individuals looking to =93blow the whistle.=94[11]  Apparently Repu=
blicans are willing to protect individuals who provide information that mig=
ht support their preferred partisan narratives, but are denying this same p=
rotection to individuals who perform life-saving research and health care.

One deponent has already appealed to the Chairman of the Energy and Commerc=
e Committee and to you, Speaker Ryan, in an effort to get basic protection =
for individual privacy and safety.[12]  Those requests have been refused or=
 met with deafening silence.  Facing the threat of contempt, that person ap=
peared before the Panel last week.  During eight hours of questioning, she =
was asked to =93name names=94 by Republican staff who refused to explain ho=
w their requests bore any relation to a legitimate investigative aim.

The Republican demand that people appear and name other individuals when th=
ey do so is reminiscent of Senator Joe McCarthy, whose bullying behavior ul=
timately resulted in censure by the U.S. Senate but not before he had damag=
ed many American=92s lives and careers with unfounded accusations and insin=
uations.   As Representative Jerry Nadler noted at the Panel=92s second hea=
ring, held April 20, 2016:  =93this committee is worse than McCarthy invest=
igations because McCarthy endangered people's jobs.  This committee is know=
ingly endangering people's lives . . . . =93[13]


Conclusion


No body of the Congress should target individuals or organizations as possi=
ble subjects of investigation =96 and demand information that has grave pri=
vacy and security implications =96 without a legitimate basis for doing so.=
  Chair Blackburn has repeatedly refused to tell us or the American people =
what she is investigating and why.  The manner in which she is conducting t=
his investigation violates clear rules and longstanding practice, and is br=
inging dishonor and discredit on the House.

We ask you to exercise your leadership as Speaker to bring an end to these =
abusive actions.  This investigation has uncovered no evidence of wrongdoin=
g and Chair Blackburn=92s unjustified witch hunt against researchers and do=
ctors is putting life-saving research and health care at risk.  This invest=
igation has never been =96 and has no hope of becoming =96 fair or fact-bas=
ed and we call on you to disband it.

Given the seriousness of this issue, we hope that you will respond as soon =
as possible.
