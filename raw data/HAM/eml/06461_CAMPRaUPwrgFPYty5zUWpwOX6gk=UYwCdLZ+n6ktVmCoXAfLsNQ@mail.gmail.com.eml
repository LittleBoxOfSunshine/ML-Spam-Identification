Cortez Masto plans to follow Reid into US senate seat

By Daria Sokolova
Pahrump Valley Times



Nevada governments must utilize natural resources in rural counties, such
as Nye, to create jobs and provide sustainable energy, U.S. Senate
Democratic hopeful Catherine Cortez Masto said.

The rural areas in Nevada have an abundance of natural resources such as
wind, solar, and geothermal energy, that have the potential to create
good-paying jobs and provide sustainable energy, Cortez Masto told the
Pahrump Valley Times.

=E2=80=9CThe federal, state, and local governments must fully utilize the n=
atural
resources in rural areas and I will work with Democrats and Republicans in
the Senate to create jobs and secure a clean energy future for residents in
all areas of Nevada,=E2=80=9D she said in an email.

Cortez Masto, a former two-term attorney general, actively campaigns ahead
of the November election, where she is expected to compete for outgoing
U.S. Sen. Harry Reid=E2=80=99s seat.

Since launching her bid for the U.S. Senate a year ago, Cortez Masto picked
up endorsements from several prominent Nevada Democrats including Reid,
former Nevada Gov. Richard Bryan, and Latino leader Otto Merida. On
Tuesday, Nevada=E2=80=99s American Federation of Labor and Congress of Indu=
strial
Organizations (AFL-CIO) announced its endorsement for the Cortez Masto
campaign.

=E2=80=9CAs Nevada=E2=80=99s next senator, my first priorities will be work=
ing to protect
and pass initiatives that benefit hardworking Nevada families,=E2=80=9D she=
 said.

Among her main priorities, Cortez Masto named increasing the minimum wage,
passing comprehensive immigration reform, passing equal pay for equal work,
and ensuring =E2=80=9Cworld-class education=E2=80=9D for Nevada=E2=80=99s c=
hildren.

Cortez Masto sought to draw a stark contrast between herself and her main
contender, Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Heck.

=E2=80=9CI have spent my career solving problems and know how to work with
Democrats and Republicans to actually get things done,=E2=80=9D she said. =
=E2=80=9CThis is
the biggest difference between myself and my opponent, Congressman Heck. =
=E2=80=A6
While I will work to end the partisan bickering and dysfunction,
Congressman Heck will only worsen it.=E2=80=9D

Heck currently represents Nevada=E2=80=99s 3rd Congressional District that =
includes
most of unincorporated Clark County south of the Las Vegas metropolitan
area. It covers Henderson, Laughlin and Searchlight.

He successfully fought off Democratic challengers since he got into his
seat in 2010.

Cortez Masto outraised Heck in the first quarter of 2016 garnering over $2
million from more than 22,000 donors.

If elected, Cortez Masto will be Nevada=E2=80=99s first female senator and =
the
first Latino senator in U.S. history.

Cortez Masto said Nye County and all of rural Nevada are critical to the
=E2=80=9Cdiverse and growing economy=E2=80=9D that makes up the state.

=E2=80=9CAdditionally, I will fight to increase investments in Nye County=
=E2=80=99s
infrastructure and education system, as well as ensuring every rural
community has access to high-speed broadband, and small businesses have
access to necessary capital to keep and create jobs,=E2=80=9D she said.

=E2=80=9CFederal, state, and local governments must work together to preser=
ve our
state=E2=80=99s many public lands,=E2=80=9D Cortez Masto said. =E2=80=9CPro=
posals to hand over
public lands to the state put in the cross hairs the places Nevadans love
and millions come from all over the world to visit,=E2=80=9D she said.

Cortez Masto faces three opponents in the Democratic primary June 14, and
is expected to emerge to face Heck, who is anticipated to win the
nine-candidate Republican primary.
