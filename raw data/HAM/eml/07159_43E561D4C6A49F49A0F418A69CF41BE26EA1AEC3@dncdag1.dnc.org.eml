SL: The =93King of Debt,=94 Donald Trump and the GOP on the Economy

In less than a week since becoming the GOP=92s presumptive nominee, Donald =
Trump has already exposed himself as reckless and dangerous on the American=
 economy. His comments over the last few days promise to undermine  the rol=
e of the United States as a major economic power and potentially threaten t=
he global financial system. While his stances mimic those of Republicans in=
 Congress, they often go further and are more irresponsible than those of h=
is counterparts in the House and Senate.

On Taxes, Trump Can=92t Hide from GOP=92s Obsession with Trickle Down Econo=
mics =96 Yesterday, Trump tried to dismiss concerns about his reckless tax =
plan, which would reward those at the top<http://www.reuters.com/article/us=
-usa-election-trump-idUSKCN0XZ0I3> by slashing the top income tax rate to 2=
5 percent from 39.6 percent, claiming that =93the rich=94 are =93probably g=
oing to end up paying more.=94 In reality, such a move would give<http://ww=
w.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-why-trump-s-flip-flop-taxes-ma=
tters-n570431> the =93top 0.1% of income earners like himself an average ta=
x cut of more than $1.3 million (versus $2,700 for those in the middle clas=
s).=94 And just this morning, Trump once again confirmed<http://www.reuters=
.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN0Y01J4> that he would, in fact, lower t=
axes on the wealthiest of Americans. Trump also plans to substantially<http=
s://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform> reduce the corporate tax rat=
e to 15 percent, even beyond the reckless plan put forth by Republican Spea=
ker Paul Ryan.
Trump=92s plans are just like the proposal put forth by Republicans in Cong=
ress who want to cut<http://www.taxjusticeblog.org/archive/2015/10/paul_rya=
n_wants_to_cut_taxes_f.php#.VzCi6oQrK70> the top tax rate to 25 percent. Pa=
ul Ryan and his colleagues would also cut corporate taxes down to 25 percen=
t =96 but Trump wants to go even further, down to 15 percent. There=92s a n=
ame for this: Trickle Down Economics. And it doesn=92t work. Just ask the l=
ast two Republican Administrations, which both left our country mired in re=
cession and facing massive deficits.

On America=92s Debt: A Page Out of the GOP Playbook =96 This morning, Trump=
 doubled down on his statements that the United States should consider<http=
://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-no-debt-default-222957#ixzz48AeHAol=
A> playing fast and loose with our nation=92s finances, even calling himsel=
f =93the king of debt.=94 He also said, =93this is the United States govern=
ment. First of all, you never have to default because you print the money.=
=94 Such reckless positions, if implemented, could threaten America=92s sta=
nding in the world and lead to chaos in the financial markets.

This is the same sort of behavior that Republicans in Congress undertook wh=
en they played politics last year with the debt ceiling (this was not the f=
irst time), leading one credit rating agency to remark<http://www.latimes.c=
om/business/la-fi-government-shutdown-credit-rating-fitch-20150923-story.ht=
ml> that any protracted fight over the issue could endanger America=92s cre=
dit rating.

=93Donald Trump=92s reckless tax policies and his suggestion that we should=
 play chicken with the country=92s finances are lifted directly from the sa=
me old failed Republican playbook. Trump can ignore reality and crown himse=
lf the king of debt, but it=92s clear that his economic ideas, and those of=
 his fellow Republicans are simply bankrupt. The American people and our ec=
