 For Immediate Release May 13, 2016





REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA

PRESIDENT NIINIST OF FINLAND=20

AMD PRIME MINISTER SOLBERG OF NORWAY

AT THE NORDIC LEADERS SUMMIT ARRIVAL CEREMONY



Grand Foyer





9:24 A.M. EDT



PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good morning, everybody. Due to the possibility of thund=
erstorms, we decided to move our arrival ceremony indoors. Of course, our=
 Nordic friends are used to tough weather. You should know that here in W=
ashington we have not seen the sun for about three weeks, which you exper=
ience for months on end. But despite that fact, we want you to know that =
we are deeply happy to have all of you here.=20



We're honored to welcome not one nation, but five -- our great Nordic fri=
ends and partners: President Niinist and Mrs. Haukio of Finland. Prime Mi=
nister Solberg and Mr. Finnes of Norway. Prime Minister and Mrs. Lfven of=
 Sweden. Prime Minister and Mrs. Rasmussen of Denmark. And Prime Minister=
 Jhannsson and Mrs. Ingjaldsdottir of Iceland.=20



To you and your delegations, welcome to the United States. Im going to tr=
y this as best as I can. Tervetuloa. (Applause.) Velkommen. Vlkommen. (La=
ughter.) And Velkomin. (Laugher and applause.) Those I'm not sure were de=
livered perfectly, but I think the spirit was understood.=20



Today is an opportunity for Michelle and me to return some of the warmth =
and hospitality that weve received on our visits to Copenhagen and Oslo, =
and during my visit to Stockholm. And to Americans who cannot visit thems=
elves, dont worry -- I understand that Sweden has a phone number where yo=
u can call a Swede and learn about all things Swedish. Iceland invites yo=
u to send your questions to #AskGudmunder. (Laughter.) I gather that Icel=
and has a lot of folks named Gudmunder -- and theyll answer.



But they are extraordinary countries. And most importantly, for our purpo=
ses here today, they are extraordinary friends. This is also a special da=
y for the millions of Americans who proudly trace their ancestry to Nordi=
c countries, particularly in the Midwest, including my home state of Illi=
nois. Theyll remind you that Leif Erickson reached this continent more th=
an a thousand years ago. They honor their parents and grandparents who cr=
ossed oceans and carved out new lives and helped build our country. They =
wear their wooly sweaters, they display Dala horses, and love lutefisk an=
d lefse. This is the history and the heritage and the ties of family and =
friendship that bring us together here today.=20



Around the world, Americas closest partners are democracies. And we only =
need to look at our Nordic friends to see why. We share the same interest=
s and we share the same values.



We believe that our citizens have the right to live in freedom and securi=
ty -- free from terrorism and in a Europe where smaller nations are not b=
ullied by larger nations. We believe in free markets, and trade that supp=
ort jobs, and strong protections for workers and the environment, and a s=
trong safety net that provides a basic measure of security in life. We be=
lieve that we have a moral obligation -- to this and future generations -=
- to confront the reality of climate change and to protect our planet, in=
cluding our beautiful Arctic.=20



We believe in societies that create opportunity for all people, through e=
ducation, health care, and equal opportunity -- including for women. In f=
act, in a world of growing economic disparities, Nordic countries have so=
me of the least income inequality in the world -- which may explain one o=
f the reasons that they're some of the happiest people in the world, desp=
ite not getting much sun.=20



And we believe in the inherent dignity of every human being. We believe i=
n pluralism and tolerance and respect for free speech and freedom of reli=
gion. Its why we welcome the refugee who seeks a better life. It's why we=
 stand up for human rights around the world. Its why our nations are lead=
ing contributors of humanitarian and development aid -- to spare a child,=
 even on the other side of the world, a preventable disease; to give girl=
s, even on the other side of the world, the chance at an education; and t=
o end the outrage of extreme poverty.=20



In their own region and with the world, the Nordic countries are a model =
of cooperation and they consistently punch above their weight in meeting =
the challenges of our time. Our Nordic partners are not large countries, =
but there are almost no issues that we deal with -- whether in terms of s=
ecurity or economics or humanitarian assistance -- where the Nordic count=
ries are not some of our most reliable and effective and important partne=
rs. And thats why I wanted to invite them here today, because sometimes w=
e have a tendency to take our best friends for granted, and its important=
 that we not do so. They have been extraordinarily important for us in sh=
aping and maintaining an international order that is rule-based, that is =
fair, that is just.=20



So I really do believe that the world would be more secure and more prosp=
erous if we just had more partners like our Nordic countries. There have =
been times where Ive said, why dont we just put all these small countries=
 in charge for a while? (Laughter.) And they could clean things up.



Now, I will admit that, to our American ears, Nordic languages and expres=
sions can sometimes be a little confusing. We have a television program h=
ere called Game of Thrones -- thats what it sounds like sometimes. (Laugh=
ter.)=20



But the truth is, we are grateful to everything that our Nordic friends h=
ave contributed to us, not just in terms of partnerships and politics but=
 also our culture. We read our children Hans Christian Andersen and Pippi=
 Longstocking. Our childrens imaginations come to life with Legos. Our ho=
mes and lives are infused with Scandinavian furniture and design. Some of=
 us dance and sing to ABBA and Avicii. (Laughter.) I do want to point out=
 that Finland has perhaps the most heavy metal bands in the world -- (lau=
ghter) -- per capita, and also ranks high on good governance. I dont know=
 that theres any correlation there. (Laughter.) Thanks to Nordic innovato=
rs, we share our music on Spotify, stay in touch by Skype, and millions s=
pend what would otherwise be productive hours on Minecraft, Angry Birds a=
nd Candy Crush. (Laughter.)



The poet, Henrik Ibsen, once wrote that a community is like a ship; every=
one ought to be prepared to take the helm. As democratic societies, we be=
lieve that our ship is stronger when everyone has the opportunity to succ=
eed. As free nations, we believe our world is safer when all of us contri=
bute to security and peace. So, to my fellow leaders, this is the work I =
look forward to advancing with you here today. And in that spirit, I welc=
ome you all, once again, to the United States of America.



Now, given the unique nature of this visit, we have an unusual arrangemen=
t to our program. Throughout the day, we are going to hear from all five =
Nordic leaders, but were not going to have them speak consecutively in ea=
ch occasion -- otherwise wed be here all day. (Laughter.) So because the =
Nordic countries are famous for their cooperation, there has been an allo=
cation of time, and were going to begin this morning with President Niini=
st of Finland and Prime Minister Solberg of Norway. So they will provide =
us some brief remarks, and you will hear from the other leaders later tod=
ay.=20



Mr. Prime Minister. (Applause.)



 PRESIDENT NIINIST: Mr. President and Mrs. Obama, we, the leaders of the =
five Nordic countries and our spouses, are grateful to you for inviting u=
s and convening the second U.S.-Nordic Summit. Thank you for the wonderfu=
l welcome.=20



 Already, upon arrival, the flags on Pennsylvania Avenue gave a heartenin=
g feeling to us. Dear President, I have to apologize that we forgot to ta=
ke the sun with us. (Laughter.) We have had a lot of sunshine this spring=
. (Laughter.)



 The Nordics are a family with a profound commonality of values and histo=
ry, and with strong ties of cooperation. With you, Mr. President, we feel=
 we have a kindred spirit. Gender equality, equal opportunity, and human =
rights for all, democracy, the rule of law, and respect of international =
law -- these are hallmarks of our societies and an agenda that we share. =
Together, the Nordics are a superpower -- not militarily, but when it com=
es to innovation, education, competitiveness, sustainable development and=
 clean technologies. See, together, we are the worlds 12th largest econom=
y. Free trade is clearly in our interest. We also claim superpower status=
 as far as culture and sports are concerned. And as you see, we are champ=
ions in modesty, too. (Laughter.)=20



Mr. President, we are grateful for the leadership the United States has s=
howed in combatting the most existential threat in the world -- that is c=
limate change -- and focusing attention to the Arctic, where we are pract=
ically neighbors. The Arctic Council can be used also as an instrument of=
 confidence-building. The Nordic countries give high value to multilatera=
l cooperation, which you have stressed during your tenure. This is vitall=
y important.



 Times are turbulent in many respects. Security threats abound. The situa=
tion has become more tense, even in the Baltic Sea region and northern Eu=
rope, our neck of the woods. Strengthening security and stability there i=
s called for, and this includes appropriate dialogue with Russia to enhan=
ce transparency and reduce risks.=20



 The Nordic countries are, in many ways, security providers in our own re=
gion and Europe, but also globally. We shoulder our responsibilities. We =
seek solutions instead of problems. We are willing and able to continue t=
o cooperate with you in promoting security and stability. We value highly=
 the U.S. commitment to Europe and to our security.



 Finland is proud of the longstanding and firm friendship with the U.S. I=
t is based on common values and interests, proud contacts between our peo=
ple and (inaudible) interaction, economically and socially. We are commit=
ted to strengthening this partnership even further.=20



Today, I am honored to say to you on behalf of the Nordic countries: In u=
s, Nordic countries, Mr. President, the United States has a solid friend =
and a strong partner. We are willing to work together with the United Sta=
tes to build a better future for the whole mankind. (Applause.)



 PRIME MINISTER SOLBERG: President, First Lady, Nordic colleagues, distin=
guished guests, and dear friends: Thank you very much for the very warm w=
elcome youve given both to my husband and me and the other members of our=
 delegation. As you make the most of your final year in the White House, =
we are delighted to note, Mr. President, you have clearly saved the best =
for last. (Laughter.)



 A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of welcoming some special American g=
uests to Norway. It was our annual NATO exercise, Cold Response. The exer=
cise provided valuable joint training in winter warfare. But Ill be hones=
t, and Ill confess that one of the highlights for the Norwegians is watch=
ing U.S. Marines learning how to ski -- cross-country ski. (Laughter.)=20=




 Mr. President, you stand shoulder to shoulder with us in the deep snows =
of Norway -- just as our navy proudly patrolled waters of Hawaii, your bi=
rth state, two years ago during the RIMPAC exercise; just as we stood tog=
ether after 9/11, and just as we now have joined forces in the fight agai=
nst ISIL. This is the nature of our alliance and our partnership. We are =
bound by the experiences and the history that we share.=20



 One of the Marines I met in the NATO exercise in Norway was called Cage =
-- Cage Solberg. (Laughter.) As his name illustrates, there are millions =
of people of Norwegian descent in the United States. In fact, there are m=
ore here than there are in Norway. Thousands of Norwegians crossed the hu=
ge, expansive Atlantic Ocean in the mid-19th century to pursue the new op=
portunities for themselves and their children. They carried the dream of =
a better life in the United States.



 Today, the Atlantic Ocean unites us more than it separates us. It has ma=
de Norway a seafaring nation, open to trade with the world and committed =
to developing our fish, gas, and oil resources in a sustainable matter. T=
he Norwegian coastline reaches to the North Cape. Keeping close eyes on t=
he development in the high north is a key priority for us. Preserving sta=
bility and predictability in our own region benefits the entire NATO Alli=
ance.=20



 And as close allies, we share common values. And that is, of course, no =
coincidence. In 1814, our Founding Fathers looked to America for inspirat=
ion in drafting the Norwegian constitution. Our common values remain stea=
dfast -- freedom, democracy, equality, and human rights. Our values refle=
ct the nature of our friendship and the partnership that we hold dear.



 Todays U.S.-Nordic Summit is a strong reminder of what we have achieved =
together. But we know theres more to be done. The United States is a grea=
t power, and the five Nordic countries have different roles to play in th=
e international arena, but we can achieve great things when we pursue the=
 same goals.=20



 Mr. President, I would like to commend you on your leadership. Your comm=
itment to achieving real progress in climate change was essential for the=
 Paris agreement. American leadership is key to ensuring the future of th=
e planet. You show your dedication to disarmament and nuclear security, n=
onproliferation. Disarmament and arms control are key elements of interna=
tional security. And we support your request for bold new reductions on a=
 reciprocal basis to make the world safer.



 Mr. President, in New York last year, the international community establ=
ished a roadmap for the future by agreeing on the sustainable development=
 goals. If we make the right choices, over the next 15 years we can eradi=
cate extreme poverty and we can have a fair and more peaceful future. And=
 we can do all this in a way that safeguards the planet. Bold partnership=
s and innovative new approaches will be needed to achieve these goals. Th=
e United States and the Nordics will be in front. And we know of few vent=
ures that will provide a better return than girls education. I greatly ap=
preciate the leadership of the First Lady, who has (inaudible) in this ca=
use. Its a cause we share as women and as mothers and as leaders.



 Todays summit is an important opportunity to advance the U.S.-Nordic coo=
peration and to reiterate the values that we share and the truths that we=
 hold for being self-evident. Because we are stronger and more effective =
together, let us ensure that the bonds between us and our countries remai=
n as powerful as they are today. Thank you. (Applause.)



 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you, everybody. Were going to go get to work. Wer=
e very grateful for the presence of our leaders here.

 And to Americans who cannot visit themselves, don&#8217;t worry -- I under=
stand that Sweden has a phone number where you can call a Swede and learn a=

 who proudly trace their ancestry to Nordic countries, particularly in the =
Midwest, including my home state of Illinois.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll remind yo=

&nbsp; They honor their parents and grandparents
 who crossed oceans and carved out new lives and helped build our country.&=
nbsp; They wear their wooly sweaters, they display Dala horses, and love lu=
tefisk and lefse.&nbsp; This is the history and the heritage and the ties o=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

ive in freedom and security -- free from terrorism and in a Europe where sm=
aller nations are not bullied by larger nations.&nbsp;
 We believe in free markets, and trade that support jobs, and strong protec=
tions for workers and the environment, and a strong safety net that provide=
s a basic measure of security in life.&nbsp; We believe that we have a mora=
l obligation -- to this and future generations
 -- to confront the reality of climate change and to protect our planet, in=
cluding our beautiful Arctic.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

for all people, through education, health care, and equal opportunity -- in=
cluding for women.&nbsp; In fact, in a world of growing
 economic disparities, Nordic countries have some of the least income inequ=
ality in the world -- which may explain one of the reasons that they're som=
e of the happiest people in the world, despite not getting much sun.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

human being.&nbsp; We believe in pluralism and tolerance and respect for fr=
ee speech and freedom of religion.&nbsp; It&#8217;s why we welcome
 the refugee who seeks a better life.&nbsp; It's why we stand up for human =
rights around the world.&nbsp; It&#8217;s why our nations are leading contr=
ibutors of humanitarian and development aid -- to spare a child, even on th=
e other side of the world, a preventable disease;
 to give girls, even on the other side of the world, the chance at an educa=
tion; and to end the outrage of extreme poverty.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">=
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=
y:&quot;Courier New&quot;">In their own region and with the world, the Nord=
ic countries are a model of cooperation and they consistently punch above t=
heir weight in meeting the challenges of our time.&nbsp;
 Our Nordic partners are not large countries, but there are almost no issue=
s that we deal with -- whether in terms of security or economics or humanit=
arian assistance -- where the Nordic countries are not some of our most rel=
iable and effective and important
 partners.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why I wanted to invite them here today, b=
ecause sometimes we have a tendency to take our best friends for granted, a=
nd it&#8217;s important that we not do so.&nbsp; They have been extraordina=
rily important for us in shaping and maintaining an international
 order that is rule-based, that is fair, that is just. <o:p></o:p></span></=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=
y:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So I really do believe that the world would be m=
ore secure and more prosperous if we just had more partners like our Nordic=
 countries.&nbsp; There have been times where I&#8217;ve said,
 why don&#8217;t we just put all these small countries in charge for a whil=
e?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And they could clean things up.<o:p></o:p></span=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

rdic languages and expressions can sometimes be a little confusing.&nbsp; W=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=
y:&quot;Courier New&quot;">But the truth is, we are grateful to everything =
that our Nordic friends have contributed to us, not just in terms of partne=
rships and politics but also our culture.&nbsp; We read
 our children Hans Christian Andersen and Pippi Longstocking.&nbsp; Our chi=
ldren&#8217;s imaginations come to life with Legos.&nbsp; Our homes and liv=
es are infused with Scandinavian furniture and design.&nbsp; Some of us dan=
ce and sing to ABBA
</span><span lang=3D"EN" style=3D"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">and =
Avicii.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I do want to point out that Finland has per=
haps the most heavy metal bands in the world -- (laughter) -- per capita, a=
nd also ranks high on good governance.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know that
 there&#8217;s any correlation there.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Thanks to Nor=
dic innovators, we share our music on Spotify, stay in touch by Skype, and =
millions spend what would otherwise be productive hours on Minecraft, Angry=
 Birds and Candy Crush.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

#8221;&nbsp; As democratic societies, we believe that our ship is
 stronger when everyone has the opportunity to succeed.&nbsp; As free natio=
ns, we believe our world is safer when all of us contribute to security and=
 peace.&nbsp; So, to my fellow leaders, this is the work I look forward to =
advancing with you here today.&nbsp; And in that
 spirit, I welcome you all, once again, to the United States of America.<o:=

 going to hear from all five Nordic leaders, but we&#8217;re
 not going to have them speak consecutively in each occasion -- otherwise w=
e&#8217;d be here all day.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So because the Nordic co=

 joint training in winter warfare.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ll be honest, and I&#8=
217;ll confess that one of the highlights for the Norwegians is watching U.=
S. Marines learning how to ski -- cross-country ski.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp=

tand shoulder to shoulder with us in the deep snows of Norway -- just as ou=
r navy proudly patrolled waters of Hawaii, your birth state, two years
 ago during the RIMPAC exercise; just as we stood together after 9/11, and =
just as we now have joined forces in the fight against ISIL.&nbsp; This is =
the nature of our alliance and our partnership.&nbsp; We are bound by the e=
xperiences and the history that we share.&nbsp;

 met in the NATO exercise in Norway was called Cage -- Cage Solberg.&nbsp; =
(Laughter.)&nbsp; As his name illustrates, there are millions of people of =
Norwegian
 descent in the United States.&nbsp; In fact, there are more here than ther=
e are in Norway.&nbsp; Thousands of Norwegians crossed the huge, expansive =
Atlantic Ocean in the mid-19th century to pursue the new opportunities for =
themselves and their children.&nbsp; They carried
 the dream of a better life in the United States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ocean unites us more than it separates us.&nbsp; It has made Norway a seafa=
ring nation, open to trade with the world and committed to developing our
 fish, gas, and oil resources in a sustainable matter.&nbsp; The Norwegian =
coastline reaches to the North Cape.&nbsp; Keeping close eyes on the develo=
pment in the high north is a key priority for us.&nbsp; Preserving stabilit=

 the entire NATO Alliance.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

 American leadership is key to ensuring the future of the planet.&nbsp; You=

 future by agreeing on the sustainable development goals.&nbsp; If we make
 the right choices, over the next 15 years we can eradicate extreme poverty=
 and we can have a fair and more peaceful future.&nbsp; And we can do all t=
his in a way that safeguards the planet.&nbsp; Bold partnerships and innova=

 these goals.&nbsp; The United States and the Nordics will be in front.&nbs=
