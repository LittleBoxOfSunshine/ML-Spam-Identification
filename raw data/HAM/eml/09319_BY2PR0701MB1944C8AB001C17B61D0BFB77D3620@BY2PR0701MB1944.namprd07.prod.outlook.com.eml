Today in the call for a full and functioning Supreme Court: Vice President =
Biden discusses the chaos that could result from a 4-4 tie at the Supreme C=
ourt, state polls continue to show that voters want their Republican Senato=
rs to give a fair hearing and vote for Chief Judge Merrick Garland, while v=
oters in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Iowa call on their Senators to put politics=
 aside and do what is best for the state's hardworking constituents.

Vice President Biden weighs in on the dangers of an extended Supreme Court =
vacancy.
In an interview with ATTN:<https://www.facebook.com/attn/videos/10425877824=
43347/>, Vice President Joe Biden explains the chaos that could result:

"Because of the disrespect that will grow for the law. Federal law should a=
pply exactly the same throughout the country. The Constitution should apply=
 exactly the same throughout the country. Not to let the Constitution funct=
ion is totally responsible and it's never happened this way before."

Survey: Most Wisconsinites Want Senate Vote On SCOTUS Nominee.
According to a Wisconsin Public Radio<http://www.wpr.org/survey-most-wiscon=
sinites-want-senate-vote-scotus-nominee> survey, 54% of Wisconsin voters wa=
nt the Senate to hold hearings and a vote on Chief Judge Garland's nominati=
on to the Supreme Court.

David Helpap, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay political scientist: "Perha=
ps (the survey) reflects the idea that this is what's called for in the Con=
stitution. That the president should nominate someone and the Senate should=
 hold a vote."

Garland Watch: The Senate Judiciary Committee Did Literally Nothing This We=
ek.
Despite poll after poll showing that American voters want Senate Republican=
s to do their job, the Senate Judiciary Committee had a completely empty sc=
hedule last week.

"Recent data<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/19/demo=
crats-are-winning-the-supreme-court-fight-over-merrick-garland-big-time/>, =
from Democratic pollster Peter Hart, shows that public opinion has been shi=
fting in favor of Garland over the past three months. The public appeared t=
o be starkly divided along partisan lines in February over whether Garland =
should get a hearing. However, Hart's data now shows a 9 percent increase i=
n those who believe a nominee should be voted on this year. What's more is =
that this change appears to be coming from shifting opinions of those ident=
ifying as Republican...It is worth noting that the Senate Judiciary Committ=
ee did not hold any hearings this week....One can't help but wonder if ther=
e was a better way to spend that free time than by doing literally nothing?=
" [Slate, 04/22/2016<http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/04/22/what=
_the_gop_has_done_since_merrick_garland_was_nominated.html>]

Nathanial R. Jones, former Judge for the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,=
 urges Sen. Rob Portman to do his job.
Writing in the Youngstown Vindicator<http://www.vindy.com/news/2016/apr/24/=
portman-gop-should-act-on-high-court-nom/?newswatch%20%3Chttp://www.vindy.c=
om/news/2016/apr/24/portman-gop-should-act-on-high-court-nom/>:

"We may come from different political parties and have differing political =
philosophies, but most Ohioans are united over a belief in the rule of law =
and that the United States Senate must act promptly to comply with the Cons=
titution by confirming a qualified nominee to fill the vacancy on the Unite=
d States Supreme Court. All Americans will be harmed if the Senate defaults=
 in its duty...As Ohioans, we have a right to expect that our Sen. Portman =
will do the job that the people of Ohio elected him to do. Obstruction is n=
ot the solution."

Pennsylvania voter: Sen. Pat Toomey's Supreme Court obstruction has disqual=
ified him from my support.
In a letter to the editor in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette<http://www.post-ga=
zette.com/opinion/letters/2016/04/24/Sen-Pat-Toomey-has-disqualified-himsel=
f-from-my-support/stories/201604240129>:

Paul Foster, Squirrel Hill, Pennsylvania: "Regardless of his motive, Sen. P=
at Toomey has disqualified himself from my support by refusing to consider =
the nomination of Merrick Garland for Supreme Court. Apparently he doesn't =
want to be held accountable for his decision, whether for or against, so he=
 dodges making any decision at all...If not, come this fall I'll vote for t=
he Democrat before I'll vote for the Republican who isn't doing his job."

The cure for an Supreme Court vacancy battle is to give Chief Judge Merrick=
 Garland a hearing and a vote.
Debbie Hoffmann, national president of the National Council of Jewish Women=
 writes in an op-ed for the Cleveland Plain Dealer<http://www.cleveland.com=
/opinion/index.ssf/2016/04/best_cure_for_the_ugliness_of.html>:

Debbie Hoffmann, national president of the National Council of Jewish Women=
 "Sen. Portman announced that he would not support a confirmation during a =
presidential election cycle. 'I think [waiting to vote until after the elec=
tion] is the better thing for the country right now,' he was quoted as sayi=
ng by cleveland.com. 'If you did it this year, it would be ugly...With all =
due respect to Sen. Portman, democracy and doing one's job isn't ugly; what=
 is ugly is the current state of affairs in which some lawmakers, including=
 Grassley and Portman, seek to obstruct the constitutional process for pure=
ly partisan politics."

Ahead of Earth Day, Sen. Chuck Grassley needs to stop playing politics with=
 the Supreme Court vacancy and America's clean energy future.
Zack Davis, NextGen Climate's Iowa state director, writes in a letter to th=
e editor in the Des Moines Register<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/=
opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2016/04/22/grassley-stop-playing-politics-cour=
t-energy/83337888/>:

Zack Davis, NextGen Climate's Iowa state director: "The American people des=
erve a full Supreme Court to rule on the crucial issues facing our nation, =
including the president's Clean Power Plan...The senator's own state is mak=
ing tremendous progress with clean energy. The largest economic development=
 investment in Iowa's history was announced last week - putting Iowa on the=
 path to 40 percent wind generation within the next few years. But without =
a ninth Supreme Court justice, further progress is at risk. It shouldn't be=
 about the politics anymore, it's about building a better environment for o=
ur children to grow up in."

The GOP has "set itself up for failure" by refusing to consider Chief Judge=
 Merrick Garland's nomination.
The Harvard Political Review<http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/the-r=
epublicans-rash-rejection-of-merrick-garland/> considers how, by refusing t=
o give Chief Judge Garland's nomination fair consideration, Senate Republic=
ans are setting themselves and the Supreme Court up for failure.

"A common argument from Republicans has been that the nominee should be cho=
sen by the president-elect, ignoring the fact the President Obama still has=
 nine months remaining in his term. But the way the election cycle is looki=
ng now, the GOP would not stand to gain by waiting for a Trump or Clinton p=
residency. Trump's radical and "un-Republican" beliefs would most likely re=
sult in a contentious Supreme Court nomination, while Clinton's choice may =
be more liberal and left-leaning than Garland. By acting so rashly and reje=
cting Garland without much forethought, the GOP seems to have set itself up=
 for failure. Despite Obama's attempts to reach across the aisle with a mod=
erate nominee, the GOP has refused to create a constructive dialogue."

c Senators:
