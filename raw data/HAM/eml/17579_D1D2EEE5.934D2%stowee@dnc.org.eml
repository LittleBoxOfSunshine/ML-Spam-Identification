Sorry for the late response and unfortunately this is an email full of
sorrys.  

Im not going to be able to make it to Vermont for your wedding next month.
I had ever intention on being there because I still consider you both really
good friends and I will never forget how much fun we had together during our
short stint at the DNC.  As you know I have been trying to transition out
for awhile and I will actually be in San Francisco the week of your wedding
for a job interview.  I just found out about the job interview yesterday and
I have figure out a way to make it work logisticallyI definitely have to
come visit you guys before I transition back to the west coast.

Congratulations again on the wedding and take lots of pictures!!

Hey man! How's it going? Pep and I are firming up numbers for our wedding
and just wanted to be sure you got our invite and wondered if you had
figured out your plans yet? We would love to see you! But of course no
pressure because we also get that it's tough to make a trip up like this.
Either way, we'd love to see you soon either up here or down there!

Hope you are well! If for some reason you didn't get the invite, details are
all at www.ourspicyromance.com <http://www.ourspicyromance.com>  ;-)  You
know how we like our puuuhd-ing! Ha!

A few DNCers are going to make an appearance - AWright and family, Mabel,
and Jane Stetson of all people (!?!) We ran into her and she told us she
would kill us if we didn't invite her to our wedding!! Tracking down Kevin
and Hildy and family for their RSVPs, too.

xo,
Aly
