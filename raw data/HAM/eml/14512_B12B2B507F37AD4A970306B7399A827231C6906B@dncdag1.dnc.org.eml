Washington, DC- Today, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced Ph=
iladelphia will host the 2016 Democratic National Convention the week of Ju=
ly 25, 2016. The DNC signed the final contract with Philadelphia this morni=
ng.
"I am thrilled to announce that Philadelphia will host the convention where=
 we will nominate the 45th President of the United States," Wasserman Schul=
tz said. "In addition to their commitment to a seamless and safe convention=
, Philadelphia's deep rooted place in American history provides a perfect s=
etting for this special gathering. I cannot wait to join Democrats across t=
he country to celebrate our shared values, lay out a Democratic vision for =
the future, and support our nominee."

The DNC's Technical Advisory Group evaluated cities across the country, loo=
king at factors such as hotel capacity, transportation, security, financing=
 and logistics.

"The City of Philadelphia is excited and honored to be selected as the host=
 city for the 2016 Democratic National Convention," Philadelphia Mayor Mich=
ael A. Nutter said. "We believe that it was our proven track record of host=
ing big events safely and efficiently with a dynamic team of top-tier profe=
ssionals to organize and manage a conference of this magnitude, paired with=
 our City's tremendous amenities, its accessible location and historical si=
gnificance, which made Philadelphia the ideal choice for the 2016 DNC.  I w=
ant to thank our great team at PHL DNC 2016, Governor Rendell and Governor =
Wolf, Senator Casey, Congressman Brady, Congressman Fattah, and former Cong=
resswoman Schwartz.  I especially want to acknowledge our great partners in=
 the Labor unions, business and political communities, clergy and our citiz=
ens, who are eager to see Philadelphia on the national stage as the host ci=
ty.  We're all delighted to make history again, here in the City of Brother=
ly Love and Sisterly Affection."

Additional details on the convention structure, host committee, and staff, =
will be made available in the coming weeks.
