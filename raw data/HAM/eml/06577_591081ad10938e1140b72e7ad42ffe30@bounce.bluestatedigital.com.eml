Luis, we know what our values are -- now we just need to make
sure we're ready to fight for them.

Answer President Obama's call. Say you're in before our

Subject: My vote for president

Friend --=20

In a few months, I'll be heading into the voting booth to cast my
vote for the next President of the United States. And, like so many
of you, I've spent this primary observing the candidates and the
parties, and what they represent.

And I have to say, this has been a difficult period for the Republicans.
They're trying to figure out what they're standing for -- whether they
will be the party of building walls and surveilling neighborhoods,
whether they will be the party that enshrines discrimination in our laws.

But the good news for Democrats is that we know what we believe.
We believe that climate change is real and that we must do something
about it. We believe in raising the minimum wage, and that women
should be paid the same as men for doing the same job. We believe
that our laws should reflect our heritage as a nation of immigrants. We
believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect, no
matter their race or religion, gender or sexual orientation.

We have two fine Democratic candidates who, no matter their
differences, share this same set of core beliefs that defines our party.
And in November, we're going to make sure that one of them becomes
our next president.

But first -- right now -- I need to know that you're in:
