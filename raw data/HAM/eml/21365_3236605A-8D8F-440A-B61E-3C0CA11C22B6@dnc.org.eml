Mr. Lowe,

Thank you for your prompt response. Is Henry Munoz still the NFC Chair? If =
he is please say hello to him for me.

I am willing to max out again this year to show support for the DNC like I =
always do. But I need you to do me a huge favor and get me 4 invites to the=
 holiday party this year. I think it'll going all the way until the 22nd.

Can you at least shoot an email out to the social sec office and see if u c=
an get me added?

Thanks so much. I will send you vitals for SS upon request. Hope to meet yo=
u in person soon.

Mike

As I am sure you know, the DNC exists to support the Democratic Party acros=

 be critically important to ensure the DNC is well funded going into the 20=
