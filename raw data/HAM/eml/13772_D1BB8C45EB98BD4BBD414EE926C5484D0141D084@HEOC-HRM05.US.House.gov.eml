POST RELEASE: Wasserman Schultz, Women=92s Health Groups Stand Against Rick=
 Scott=92s Extreme H.B. 1411

Pembroke Pines, Fla. =96 Earlier today, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz =
(FL-23); Laura Goodhue, Executive Director of FL Alliance of Planned Parent=
hood Affiliates; Gaby Garcia-Vera, National Latina Institute for Reproducti=
ve Health; and Diane Mecias, Planned Parenthood Patient; and other women=92=
s health care advocates held a press conference on Governor Scott=92s signi=
ng of H.B. 1411, which bans Medicaid funding for organizations that provide=
 abortion services. The group released the following statements after the p=
ress conference:

=93Rick Scott and Florida's Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for=
 H.B. 1411, which violates federal Medicaid law. Governor Scott's Administr=
ation knew that signing H.B. 1411 would violate longstanding federal law pr=
otecting health care providers from these kinds of political games - and he=
 signed it anyway. Regrettably, I don't expect this to be the last we'll he=
ar about his Administration=92s extreme actions on women's health care, but=
 you can be certain that I will continue fighting for Florida's women every=
 step of the way and that we will hold Rick Scott accountable for violating=
 federal law,=94 said Rep. Wasserman Schultz.

=93Planned Parenthood has had successful public/private partnerships with C=
ounty Health Departments and other state funded organizations for many year=
s. It is not Planned Parenthood, but Floridians seeking health care who suf=
fer the most from this defunding. Almost 70% of Planned Parenthood health c=
enters in Florida are located in medically underserved or physician shortag=
e areas- making them the only places where Floridians can seek preventive s=
ervices such as contraception, cancer screenings and testing and treatment =
for sexually transmitted infections including HIV,=94 said Laura Goodhue, E=
xecutive Director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates.

=93We know that placing numerous Barriers in front of reproductive health a=
nd access actively works to destroy, shame, and cowers women into not getti=
ng the lifesaving health services they need, but also sends a message to Fl=
oridians everywhere that our state is one that doesn=92t value the health, =
and dignity of its people,=94 said Gaby Garcia-Vera of the National Latina =
Institute for Reproductive Health.

=93When I was alone, and my resources were limited, Planned Parenthood was =
there. They provided me with the state-mandated abortion counseling and edu=
cation, and it only reinforced my thoughts about what was the right decisio=
n for my daughter, myself, and my future family. In that moment, it wasn=92=
t about politics. It wasn=92t about numbers. It wasn=92t about moral judgem=
ents. It was about me.  My health, my safety and my life. They cared no mat=
ter what,=94 said Diane Mecias, a Planned Parenthood patient.
