Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at a rally in =
Carson, Calif., this week. (Jae C. Hong/AP)

By David Weigel May 18 at 3:42 PM

When Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont took the stage this week after falling =
short in the Kentucky primary, supporters of Hillary Clinton wondered if he=
 would finally soften his tone and let her move onto a general election aga=
inst Donald Trump.

They didn=92t have to wonder for long.

Sanders credited Clinton=92s victory to =93a closed primary, something I am=
 not all that enthusiastic about, where independents are not allowed to vot=
e.=94 He commanded the Democratic party to =93do the right thing, and open =
its doors, and let into the party people who are prepared to fight for econ=
omic and social change.=94 And then he promised that he=92s staying in the =
race until the convention. =93Let me be as clear as I can be. We are in til=
 the last ballot is cast!=94

The performance prompted cheers across a crowd of about 8,000 in Carson, Ca=
lif., highlighting the mistrust and alienation that Sanders=92s most ardent=
 fans feel about Clinton, the Democrats and their =93rigged=94 system. Yet =
the whole spectacle also sent shudders through those supporting Clinton, wh=
o are growing increasingly irritated by Sanders=92s ever-presence in the ra=
ce =97 and nervous that he is damaging Clinton.

All of it seems to have come to a head in recent days, as bitterness on bot=
h sides has boiled over and prompted new worries that a fractured party cou=
ld lead to chaos at the national convention and harm Clinton=92s chances ag=
ainst Trump in November. Two realities seem to be fueling it all: The nomin=
ation is for all intents and purposes out of Sanders=92s reach, yet his sup=
porters are showing no signs of wanting to rally behind Clinton.

=93If you lose a game that you put your heart and soul into, and you lose s=
quarely, you can walk off the court and shake someone=92s hand and say, =91=
Well done,=92=94 said Rep. Diane Russell, a Maine legislator and Sanders su=
pporter. =93If you don=92t feel like the game was working fairly, it=92s ha=
rd to do that.=94

On the other side is this view: It=92s also hard to win a general election =
with a protracted, divisive primary battle that won=92t go away. =93The way=
 he=92s been acting now is a demonstration of why he=92s had no support fro=
m his colleagues,=94 said former Massachusetts congressman Barney Frank.

Sanders supporters are crying =93fraud=94 over delegate selection and threa=
tening to sit out the election. They have promised to press their case to t=
he convention floor. It happened in 2008 in the final throes of Clinton=92s=
 failed bid against Barack Obama; what remains unclear is whether this year=
=92s divisions will go deeper or longer.

An explosive weekend convention in Nevada, where Sanders supporters turned =
on the state party chairwoman for overruling their challenges and seating C=
linton delegates, exposed the depth of the acrimony. In his statements sinc=
e then, Sanders has made no attempt to heal it.

Sanders is also keeping his supporters riled up by making what many Democra=
ts view as an unrealistic, and even dishonest, view of his candidacy given =
Clinton=92s large lead in delegates.

=93There are a lot of people out there, many pundits and politicians, they =
say Bernie Sanders should drop out, the people of California should not hav=
e the right to determine who the next president will be,=94 he said at the =
rally Tuesday, insisting that the state had enough pledged delegates to put=
 him over the top.

Increasingly, Sanders=92s most passionate supporters claim that the primary=
 has been rigged. A Reddit user=92s chart comparing the first wave of exit =
polls with Clinton=92s stronger-than-expected performances has been circula=
ted =97 most famously by Sanders surrogate and actor Tim Robbins =97 as evi=
dence of election fraud.

Clinton=92s 16-point victory in New York is explained by the state=92s oner=
ous registration rules and by the still-unexplained purge of Brooklyn voter=
 rolls. Anyone questioning her lead of three million votes can find solace =
in an article at Counterpunch, titled =93Clinton Does Best Where Voting Mac=
hines Flunk Hacking Tests.=94

=93Do these people read newspapers?=94 said Bob Mulholland, a California su=
perdelegate and Clinton supporter who has accused Sanders supporters of har=
assing his peers. =93Are they reading some chain email with bogus numbers? =
I hold Sanders somewhat responsible for this, because he comes across on TV=
 as a very angry old man, riling people up.=94

As Kentucky slid away from Sanders Tuesday, some of his supporters saw a cu=
lprit in Alison Lundergan Grimes. The secretary of state and 2014 candidate=
 for U.S. Senate, a long-time supporter of Clinton, even went on CNN to dec=
lare Clinton the winner.

=93Hillary doesn=92t even care anymore,=94 wrote one Sanders supporter, twe=
eting a link to a story about alleged fraud in Kentucky.

=93Yet another state we would=92ve won if everyone could vote,=94 wrote ano=
ther supporter on Reddit.

=93Better watch out for illegal conduct by Grimes since she said electing C=
linton is more important than doing her job,=94 tweeted another.

The evidence for the last claim was a video clip from a rally with Clinton =
and Grimes, where the secretary of state said she was =93not only here to d=
o my job=94 but to back her candidate. It was cut and distributed by Americ=
a Rising, a conservative opposition research firm that=92s adept at finding=
 wedges between Clinton and the left.

As Sanders has fallen behind Clinton, more conservatives have looked for wa=
ys to exploit the angst. On Tuesday morning, Fox News sent one of its morni=
ng show hosts onto the streets of New York to ask voters if the primary had=
 been rigged for Clinton. Dan Backer, the conservative attorney and treasur=
er of the pro-Trump Great America PAC, has egged on Sanders supporters on F=
acebook with pep talks like =93Bernie will win the most primaries, and can =
still take the most pledged (elected) delegates while narrowing the total v=
ote gap.=94 Trump himself has announced a kind of snarky solidarity with Sa=
nders, telling voters and Twitter followers that the senator should bolt th=
e party over his foul treatment.

=93Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats =97 the syst=
em is rigged against him,=94 Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning. =93Many of=
 his disenfranchised fans are for me!=94

The Sanders campaign has endorsed none of this =97 but it hasn=92t tamped i=
t down. Sanders=92s sympathetic response to the Nevada convention fracas an=
gered the state and national party, with DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Sc=
hultz comparing the worst scenes there to the violence at Trump rallies. As=
ked if there had been any actual fraud in the primaries, Sanders=92s spokes=
man Michael Briggs suggested that the Democratic Party=92s infrastructure h=
ad been sabotaged in a way that hurt one candidate.

=93Most state parties tried to do a good job,=94 he said, =93but often they=
 are short on resources and there are institutional impediments to a fair p=
rocess, like super-early registration, party-switch deadlines, closed prima=
ries, complicated party registration rules, bad voter lists.=94

Sanders himself has made harder-to-argue cases against the Democratic prima=
ries. The truncated debate schedule struck supporters of both candidates as=
 unfair, something the party seemed to acknowledge by tacking on more of th=
em in March and April. While Clinton is on track to win a majority of pledg=
ed delegates, Sanders has suggested that early support for Clinton among su=
perdelegates, the party leaders and elected officials who get an automatic =
convention vote but are not bound by their state=92s popular vote, created =
a barrier that no candidate could scale.

=93It is absurd that you had 400 establishment Democrats on board Hillary C=
linton=92s campaign before anybody was in the race,=94 Sanders told MSNBC=
=92s Rachel Maddow in an interview last week. =93That stacks the deck in a =
very, very, unfair way for any establishment candidate, and against the wis=
hes of the people.=94

At the same time, Sanders and his supporters argue that superdelegates shou=
ld consider bolting Clinton to back him, based on polls that show him leadi=
ng Trump as her favorables sink. That irritates Clinton supporters on two l=
evels =97 by suggesting that the voters got it wrong, and by dismissing the=
 judgment of the sort of elected leaders whom any president would need to p=
ass an agenda.

=93If you believe you represent the people, and the people are uncooperativ=
e with your goal of winning, you have to find some explanation,=94 said Fra=
nk, whose appointment to the DNC rules committee sparked anger from Sanders=
 supporters. =93Look, I understand you have some disagreements, but does th=
e overwhelming view of the black leadership, LGBT leadership, women=92s lea=
dership =97 does that count for nothing?=94

As they contemplate Sanders=92s =93contested contest=94 at the Philadelphia=
 convention, Clinton supporters think warmly back to 2008. By the time thos=
e primaries concluded, as many as 40 percent of Clinton voters said they co=
uld not support Barack Obama. The most dedicated PUMAs (Party Unity My A--)=
 became TV stars; the vast majority of Clinton holdouts eventually went for=
 the ticket. While Clinton=92s favorable rating with Sanders supporters has=
 been falling, many of his endorsers think that can be reversed.

=93I want people to see this as a fair process because I=92m not in the =91=
Bernie or Bust=92 camp,=94 said Russell, the Sanders supporter from Maine. =
=93I love this campaign, but I love my country more. And I tell the =91Bern=
ie or Bust=92 people, if you=92re angry at the end of this, you=92re not go=
nna take it out on the DNC. You=92re gonna take it out on the most vulnerab=
le people, the ones we are fighting for.=94

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">At the same time, Sanders and his supporters argue t=

 suggesting that the voters got it wrong, and by dismissing the judgment of=

 I understand you have some disagreements, but does the overwhelming view o=

 2008. By the time those primaries concluded, as many as 40 percent of Clin=

 Obama. The most dedicated PUMAs (Party Unity My A--) became TV stars; the =
vast majority of Clinton holdouts eventually went for the ticket. While Cli=

 And I tell the =91Bernie or Bust=92 people, if you=92re
