Subject: Biden meets Jabouri; pool 3

Following a nearly 90-minute meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-=
Abadi, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met with Speaker of Parliament =
Saleem al-Jabouri. The meeting was held at the American Embassy, and the =
pool was ushered into a generous conference room with the two leaders at =
the meeting's beginning.
Here is a transcript of Mr. Biden's remarks:
"Well, it's good to be back in Baghdad. This is my 27th or 28th, I don't =
know how many, time. The first time in four years. This is an old friend,=
" Mr. Biden said and put his hand of Mr. Jabouri.
"I'm having meetings today. Had a meeting with the prime minster and now =
the speaker to talk about the progress we're making against Daesh. It's r=
eal, serious, and it's committed. And we've talked about, we will be talk=
ing about a number of things. But in my last meeting with the prime minst=
er, we talked about the plans that are in store for Mosul and the coordin=
ation going on with all of our friends here. And so I'm very optimistic. =
And I'm anxious to hear what the speaker has to say. Like I said, we've b=
een doing this a long time. The last time you were in my office."
Then Mr. Jabouri spoke. His remarks were in Arabic, although a translator=
 at Mr. Biden's side whispered a translation into his ear. When Mr. Jabou=
ri's remarks were finished, Mr. Biden said:
"Well, we're committed."
The pool was then ushered out.
