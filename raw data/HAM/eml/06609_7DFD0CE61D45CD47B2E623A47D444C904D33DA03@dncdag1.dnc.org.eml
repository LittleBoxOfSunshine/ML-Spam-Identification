Talking about Ted Cruz, and about how to make GOP convention more exciting

Donald Trump called on Ted Cruz on Monday to quit the presidential race and=
 go back to the U.S. Senate if Tuesday's Indiana primary ends with the bill=
lionaire beating the senator.

'Yes, he should. He should leave the race if I win,' Trump told DailyMail.c=
om in a wide-ranging interview at an Indianapolis hotel during his last day=
 of campaigning in the Hoosier State.

'Now, let's see what happens. Indiana's a great state and I have the suppor=
t of Bobby Knight and so many other people. We'll have to see what happens,=
 but yes, I think he should get out of the race,' Trump said.

The Republican front-runner also said Cruz's 'tough temperament' might make=
 him unsuitable for a spot on his short-list of potential Supreme Court nom=
inees =96 a consolation prize he could offer the Texas as a party-unifying =
gesture.

Instead, Trump insisted Ted prepare to pack his bags =96 and doubled down o=
n his demand later during a lunchtime stop at Shapiro's Delicatessen a few =
blocks from Lucas Oil Stadium.

Asked during an impromptu press gaggle whether an Indiana defeat should spe=
ll the end of a Cruz candidacy, he told reporters: 'I think it should.'


A Cruz spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Monday morning's interview touched on Trump's foreign policy goals, his att=
itude toward the media, his criticism of past Republican National Conventio=
ns, and whether a President Trump would deliver a comedy routine at the Whi=
te House Correspondents Association's annual gala.

Indiana's 57 delegates to the Republican National Convention, should Trump =
claim them in Tuesday's winner-take-all primary election, would put the bus=
inessman within striking distance of the magic number =96 1,237 =96 that he=
 needs in order to become the party's White House nominee.

Cruz has insisted that he will stay in the contest all the way to the July =
convention in Cleveland, Ohio.

he launched an ad Monday in Indiana in which he tries to turn Trump's nickn=
ame for him =96 'Lyin' Ted' =96 back on the real estate tycoon.

The ad, titled 'Lying,' features an announcer claiming that 'Donald Trump i=
s lying about Ted Cruz' with respect to the senator's positions on trade, i=
llegal immigration and work visas.

'Trump also had a one-million-dollar judgment against him for hiring illega=
ls,' the ad claims.

'What a phony.'


But Indianans seem to be siding with Trump, giving him a 15-point edge in a=
n NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released yesterday.

Trump lashed out at Cruz Monday morning, telling DailyMail.com that he disa=
grees with the Texan's characterization of him earlier in the day as a hate=
ful bully and his base as 'bitter, angry, petty, bigoted people.'

'That is not America. I reject that vision of America,' Cruz told reporters=
 in Indiana after a campaign stop.

'They're not angry,' Trump said of his loyal following. 'They're very disap=
pointed in politicians like him that get a lot of money from special intere=
st groups, and they protect their special interest groups very much to the =
detriment of the country.'


Trump has faced calls for specifics about how he will 'unify' the Republica=
n Party if he performs well enough in the remaining ten primary elections t=
o claim the GOP's nomination outright.

But the billionaire said he isn't ready to put Cruz on the Supreme Court as=
 a consolation prize =96 because his 'temperament' might not be suited to t=
he job.

Cruz, once the solicitor general for the Lone Star State, argued nine cases=
 before America's highest court, winning five of them.

'I don't know. I'd have to think about it. That's a big decision,' he told =
DailyMail.com, saying that he's aware of Cruz's record as a constitutional =
lawyer.

'But there's a whole question of uniting, and there's a whole question as t=
o temperament. And I'd have to think about it.'

Trump raised Cruz's 'temperament' four separate times while explaining why =
putting the lawmaker on his Supreme Court short-list wasn't an easy call.

He has said in the past that in order to quell conservatives' concerns abou=
t how he would approach Supreme Court appointments, he would release a list=
 of names during the campaign and pledge to to only choose nominees from it=
.

'He's got a tough temperament for what we're talking about,' Trump said of =
Cruz. 'You have to be a very, very smart, rational person in my opinion, to=
 be a justice of any kind at a high level or low.'

'You need a proper temperament. And that would be a question that I would h=
ave.'


At Shapiro's, Trump projected confidence as the lunch crowd milled around h=
im and asked for autographs and selfies. He signed one man's $50 bill befor=
e dining at a table that included campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and no=
nfiction author Ed Klein.

Asked whether the general election season begins for him on Wednesday, he s=
aid: 'Yes, I mean it's sort of already started.'

Citing a new national poll, he added: 'Rasmussen just came out and I'm thre=
e points up on Hillary ... and I haven't even started yet.'
