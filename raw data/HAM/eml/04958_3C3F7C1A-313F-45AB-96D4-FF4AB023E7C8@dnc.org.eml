Sanders drops lawsuit against DNC<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presi=
dential-races/278228-sanders-drops-lawsuit-against-dnc>

By Ben Kamisar
THE HILL

Bernie Sanders<http://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders>' campaign is dropp=
ing its lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee for restricting a=
ccess to its voter files.

The move came Friday after an independent investigation into Democratic pre=
sidential campaigns' handling of party voter data.
The Sanders team said the investigation vindicated them and showed no evide=
nce that they improperly accessed information belonging to Hillary Clinton<=
http://thehill.com/people/hillary-clinton>'s campaign.

"An independent investigation of the firewall failures in the DNC=92s share=
d voter file database has definitively confirmed that the original claims b=
y the DNC and the Clinton campaign were wholly inaccurate," the campaign sa=
id in a statement.

"The Sanders campaign never 'stole' any voter file data; the Sanders campai=
gn never 'exported' any unauthorized voter file data; and the Sanders campa=
ign certainly never had access to the Clinton campaign=92s 'strategic road =
map.'

The withdrawal of the lawsuits ends a months-long fight between Sanders and=
 the Democratic party.

In December, the DNC alleged that Sanders staffers had improperly accessed =
Clinton's campaign information. A Sanders aide at the time denied wrongdoin=
g, saying they had only tried to document the security error to alert the D=
NC. That initial finding prompted the party to briefly block the Sanders ca=
mpaign's access to party files and data.

The Sanders campaign cried foul, accusing the DNC of tipping the scales to =
help front-runner Clinton less than two months before the Iowa caucuses.

The DNC rejected those charges, arguing they were acting to keep campaign d=
ata secure.

The final results of the investigation on Friday were not made public.

But Sanders' campaign claimed the investigation showed the unauthorized acc=
ess came from "the DNC's security failures" and that only four campaign sta=
ffers, including one who was immediately fired, were aware they could acces=
s some of Clinton's data for a one-hour window.

The DNC said the investigation confirmed what they first learned.

=93The forensic analysis conducted by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike co=
nfirmed that the DNC=92s initial findings, which were the basis of the temp=
orary shutdown in December, were accurate," said DNC communications directo=
r Luis Miranda in a statement.

"The audit confirmed that one campaign gained unauthorized access to the da=
ta of another, and the audit further confirmed that the results of those se=
arches were saved within the system and that data was exported. Following t=
he conclusion of the audit that confirmed the DNC's original findings, the =
Sanders campaign withdrew its lawsuit."

The DNC also provided a timeline that notes that the four Sanders staffers =
"conducted 25 searches using proprietary Hillary for America score data acr=
oss 11 states."

Both sides acknowledge that one summary sheet with data related to New Hamp=
shire appeared to have been saved off-site, but the Sanders campaign argued=
 that the file did not exist on their computers and was never seen by any S=
anders staffer.

Sanders sits far behind Hillary Clinton in the delegate count and is effect=
ively unable to steal the lead from her without convincing large numbers of=
 superdelegates to switch their support.
