DNC Chair Statement on  Cruz Suspending Campaign and Trump Becoming Republic=
an Presumptive Nominee
=20
WASHINGTON =E2=80=93 DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the foll=
owing statement on Ted Cruz dropping out of the Republican primary and Donal=
d Trump becoming the GOP=E2=80=99s presumptive nominee:
=20
=E2=80=9CTonight, Donald Trump is the Republican Party. Ted Cruz may have be=
en the least-liked politician in Washington, but Trump is one of the least l=
iked men in America, and Democrats will hold him accountable for his offensi=
ve rhetoric, dangerous ideas, and lack of judgment every single day between t=
oday and November 8th.
=20
=E2=80=9CWhile Ted Cruz was known for obstruction, having forced a governmen=
t shutdown that cost the U.S. economy $24 billion and even opposing emergenc=
y aid for a region hit by a devastating hurricane, he didn=E2=80=99t stand u=
p to Donald Trump until it was too late. None of the Republicans running for=
 president did, because after years of elevating extreme voices in their par=
ty, they didn=E2=80=99t want to alienate them.
=20
=E2=80=9CThe decades-old Republican strategy of exploiting unfounded fear of=
 immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all for poli=
tical gain, have laid the groundwork for Donald Trump. The Republican Party s=
old hardworking Americans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, whil=
e strangling America=E2=80=99s middle class with backwards economic policies=
 that only enrich those already at the top. Donald Trump=E2=80=99s looming n=
omination will be the ultimate, destructive culmination of the results of th=
at strategy.
=20
=E2=80=9CDemocrats won=E2=80=99t hesitate to fight for the vast majority of t=
he American people, who share our values of inclusion, hard work, dignity an=
d opportunity for all, and we=E2=80=99ll hold Republicans on the ballot at e=
very level accountable for their standard bearer. Voters will have a clear c=
hoice come November, and Americans of every stripe, including those disillus=
ioned and disaffected by this year=E2=80=99s unprecedentedly nasty Republica=
n primary have a home in the Democratic Party. Our voters are energized, ent=
husiastic, and optimistic because our candidates are committed to moving Ame=
rica forward. And that=E2=80=99s why we=E2=80=99re going to win on Election D=
ay in November.=E2=80=9D
