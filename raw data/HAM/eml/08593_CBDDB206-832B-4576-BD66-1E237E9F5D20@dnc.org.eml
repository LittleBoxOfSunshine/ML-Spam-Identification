At tense Alaska Democratic convention, allegations of Clinton favoritism fl=
y<https://www.adn.com/article/20160515/tense-alaska-democratic-convention-a=
llegations-clinton-favoritism-fly>
By Alex DeMarban<https://www.adn.com/author/alex-demarban>, Alaska Dispatch=
 News

In what many called an unusually large state convention, the Alaska Democra=
tic Party this weekend chose its delegates for the national convention in J=
uly, amid a clash over concerns by some Bernie Sanders fans that the head o=
f the Democratic National Committee has improperly taken steps to benefit H=
illary Clinton.

The anger over Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was highlighted when more than=
 25 Sanders supporters walked out of her keynote speech Saturday night at t=
he Dena=92ina Civic and Convention Center in Anchorage, though they left in=
 a trickle while a huge crowd remained to hear the Florida congresswoman an=
d DNC chair call for unity among Democrats to stop the presumptive GOP nomi=
nee, Donald Trump.

She warned that the Republican party has laid the groundwork for Trump's po=
litical rise with its divisive and hateful rhetoric. She warned that Trump,=
 as president, would return America to the days of George W. Bush that in 2=
007 led to the nation=92s worst economic crash since the Great Depression.

=93So Trump isn=92t something new -- he=92s just the old Republican brand, =
but with a little extra bronzer on -- and he=92s that much more dangerous,=
=94 she said. "We have only ourselves to blame if we don't come together."

Her message didn't resonate with some Sanders supporters who say she improp=
erly steered funds and other support toward the Clinton campaign<http://www=
.adn.com/article/20151221/outside-billionaires-fuel-joint-effort-between-cl=
inton-alaska-democrats>.

Ian Smith from Kenai walked out of her speech.

=93As long as she takes this money I can=92t trust her,=94 he said. =93It h=
urts me to say that.=94

After Wasserman Schultz spoke, Luis Miranda, DNC communications director, s=
aid she wasn=92t doing interviews and had to hurry to catch a plane leaving=
 Alaska.

But when pressed, she denied taking steps to benefit Clinton.

=93Nothing could be further from the truth,=94 she said.

Miranda added: =93If she was trying to stack the deck, she=92s doing a terr=
ible job because it=92s been a competitive primary.=94

At the nearby Egan Center, Sanders supporters danced at an event organized =
to protest Wasserman Schultz's speech. The event, attended by more than 200=
 through the night, was organized in part by Ed Cullinane. A member of the =
state central committee from an Anchorage House district, Cullinane support=
ed efforts at the state=92s three-day convention, but said he couldn=92t to=
lerate Wasserman Schultz's =93unethical actions.=94

The event featured a prerecorded televised appearance by Sanders' wife, Jan=
e Sanders, who shocked the crowd when she introduced her husband on screen.

In a short speech, Sanders thanked Alaska for its huge support, and said he=
 wants to create =93a government that works for all of us and not just the =
1 percent.=94

When the appearance ended, one woman shouted, =93This is awesome!=94 as the=
 dancing resumed and the crowd chanted, =93Bernie! Bernie!=94

The events capped a day when the party delegates chose 16 delegates for the=
 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, with 13 to vote for Sander=
s and three for Clinton. Four superdelegates that can vote for either candi=
date are also headed to the national convention to help pick the presidenti=
al nominee.

The delegates will include Jill Yordy, the Alaska director for the Sanders =
campaign, who will cast her vote for Sanders.

Sanders has a shot at overtaking Clinton, she said. One thing Yordy wants t=
o share with others in Philadelphia is the passion Alaskans have for Sander=
s, who earned more than 80 percent support in the Democratic caucus in Marc=
h.

That passion was apparent at the state=92s convention, she said, with unusu=
ally large numbers of delegates traveling huge distances from across Alaska=
 to show their support for him.

=93He appeals to people who have felt disenfranchised by the party system,=
=94 she said.

State Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, is also heading to Philadelphia. Ca=
lling a Trump presidency "a dangerous proposition,=94 he said he will vote =
for Clinton.

He said he supports Sanders=92 idealism and said the candidate has shaped t=
he discussion in a positive way, highlighting issues such as income dispari=
ty and the need for campaign finance reform.

=93Nothing but good has come from his run,=94 he said. =93If he was selecte=
d as Hillary Clinton=92s running mate, that=92d be terrific.=94

Hundreds of Democrats Converge in Anchorage for State Democratic Party Conv=
ention<http://www.ktuu.com/content/news/Hundreds-of-Democrats-Converge-in-A=
nchorage-for-State-Democratic-Party-Convention-379472211.html>
ANCHORAGE (KTUU) Hundreds of Alaska democrats are converging in Anchorage t=
his weekend for the state party convention to decide who will represent the=
 state at the national convention in July.

The first day of the weekend-long event kicked off Friday at UAA Student Un=
ion.

The convention follows the democratic caucus where Bernie Sanders won 81 pe=
rcent of the vote in the March.

Hillary Clinton captured 21 percent of delegates.

Jake Hamburg, communications director for Alaska Democratic Party, said amo=
ng party business items delegates will discuss possible changes to the cauc=
us process.

"We saw some people wanting to participate, but just couldn't access a cauc=
us location so we're exploring some ideas of doing remote caucus participat=
ion, or absentee process or maybe even going to a presidential preference p=
oll," Hamburg said.

Greg Smith, a delegate from Juneau said there's always room for improvement=
.

"I think there is a group of people that feel like the process, the nominat=
ion process maybe isn't fully open, fully fair," Smith said. "You have to b=
e a registered democrat to participate in that caucus, you have to have bee=
n free from 9:30 until noon on the day of the caucus so you know people are=
 working and there's discussions going on about is there way to improve tha=
t."

Hamburg said much like the caucus in March, there's a record turnout for th=
e state convention.

"We've not seen a turnout a turnout like this for a state convention, I thi=
nk certainly in recent memory if not ever," Hamburg said. "There's just a l=
ot of enthusiasm this year and because we have presidential campaigns activ=
e in Alaska they are making sure their folks turn out to the state conventi=
on."

Wanda Smith, a delegate from Anchorage said she's seen some differences in =
the voters who have turned out this year in comparison with 2008.

"We have more younger people that are out, there are more issues they're fi=
red up over the issues they would like to see changed or implemented, they'=
re excited about getting even more younger people to vote on issues that co=
ncern them, they seem to be more interested in politics and reality of life=
 and life's issues," Smith said.

537 of 539 elected delegates have registered to attend the convention.

On Saturday, delegates will participate in the presidential fan out and ele=
ct District-Level delegates, party leader and elected official delegates an=
d elect at large delegates along with alternates.

In the evening, ADP will host a reception with Democratic National Conventi=
on Chair, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz at the Dena'ina Civic & Co=
nvention Center.

A group of Alaska democrats who say they're not affiliated with any campaig=
n said disagree with the party's leadership at the national level and DNC C=
hair, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz' treatment of Bernie Sanders s=
upporters.

Ed Cullinane, a Sanders supporter is part of a group organizing an alternat=
ive event at the Egan Convention Center on Saturday.

"The alternative is about our displeasure with the keynote speaker at the d=
emocratic convention dinner after the dinner by the name of Debbie Wasserma=
n Schultz," Cullinane said.

Hamburg said it's not uncommon to see tension in a contested election year =
and democrats should celebrate Debbie Wasserman Schultz coming to the state=
.

"We invited our national committee woman back in February of last year to c=
ome to Alaska and she accepted our offer to come and help us this time and =
we're just really excited that somebody from the national party would come =
to speak to Alaskans and provide her thoughts and I expect democrats will g=
ive her the respect that she deserves," Hamburg said.

Hamburg said on Friday it's the party's responsibility to remain neutral an=
d he believes democrats will rally behind whoever wins the democratic nomin=
ation.

Internal strife rocked the Alaska Democratic Party on Friday as it headed i=
nto its three-day state convention, with some members of the party that hea=
vily favor Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton protesting the convention by=
 planning an alternative event Saturday night.

=93Alaska voters are an independent people and they don=92t want to be told=
 what to do,=94 said Ed Cullinane, a member of the state central committee =
from an Anchorage House district.

Cullinane helped organize the protest to the convention, where Democrats on=
 Saturday will choose delegates to cast votes at the Democratic National Co=
nvention in Philadelphia in July.

Though Clinton appears poised for victory in the hard-fought race, Sanders =
supporters say he can still claim a win though it would take a surge of del=
egates.

The anti-convention event at the Egan Civic and Convention Center comes bec=
ause Florida congresswoman and Democratic National Committee chair Debbie W=
asserman Schultz plans to give the keynote speech at the convention in Anch=
orage Saturday, Cullinane said.

Alaskan Democrats gave Sanders 81.6 percent of their support in the March c=
aucus. Many believe Wasserman Schultz has limited debates and unfairly allo=
cated resources to give Clinton a boost, he said.

=93A lot of us feel that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has displayed very unethi=
cal behavior,=94 he said.

At the state convention on Friday afternoon at the UAA Student Union, durin=
g an opening day filled with discussions on matters such as Medicaid expans=
ion and climate change, supporters of both Sanders and Clinton said it was =
important for Alaska Democrats to unite as the national convention approach=
es.

=93We all need to be respectful and find common ground,=94 said Shauna Thor=
nton, a state delegate and =93Bernie fan=94 who hopes to be selected as a n=
ational delegate from Alaska on Saturday.

Thornton, who is running for a state House seat on the Kenai Peninsula, sai=
d she=92s not angry Wasserman Schultz is speaking.

=93She was asked to come over a year ago, so what do you do? So I=92ll atte=
nd and ask questions about her positions,=94 Thornton said.

Cullinane also launched a petition at MoveOn.org<http://moveon.org> asking =
the Alaska party to =93un-invite=94 Wasserman Schultz. It had 64 signatures=
 Friday afternoon.

He said the anti-convention, which has no official name, will feature a tel=
econferenced appearance from Tim Canova, Schultz=92 Democratic primary oppo=
nent in Florida. Plans also include a prerecorded presentation by Jane Sand=
ers=92 and a dunk tank with political activist Ray Metcalfe in the wet seat=
. The event will be held in Summit Hall at the Egan, starting at 6:30 p.m.

Wasserman's speech is planned for 8 p.m. Saturday at the Dena'ina Civic and=
 Convention Center. She's also scheduled to attend a reception there at 6 p=
.m.

People need to put aside the =93divisiveness=94 said Jennifer Smith, a stat=
e convention delegate from a Juneau district who supports Clinton because s=
he=92s =93cool under fire=94 and well-versed on critical national issues.

=93If you want to have an alternative convention then fine, but if you real=
ly want to have change in the party structure you should directly address i=
t to (Wasserman Schultz), and not do it through protests,=94 she said.


Alaska Democratic Convention gets underway in Anchorage<http://www.ktva.com=
/alaska-democratic-convention-gets-underway-in-anchorage-925/>

By Lauren Maxwell<http://www.ktva.com/authors/lauren-maxwell/>, KTVA Alaska

At the State Democratic Convention in Anchorage, one of the big jobs party =
leaders have is to elect delegates to attend the national convention in Jul=
y, when the presidential nominee will be decided.

Back in March, candidate Bernie Sanders won the state=92s Democratic caucus=
 in a big way. All 16 of the state=92s regular delegates who will go the na=
tional convention in Philadelphia are pledged to vote for him. But the stat=
e also has four super delegates who can vote for whomever they want.

Casey Steinau is one of the super delegates. Steinau is the chairman of the=
 Alaska Democratic Party, but as a super delegate, she=92s undeclared.

=94I am the chairman of the party and I believe that it is my job to repres=
ent 100 percent of the Alaska Democrats and I take that roll very seriously=
,=94 Steinau said. =93I don=92t think my personal preferences should be inf=
luencing anyone.=94

But the idea that super delegates can vote for whomever they want doesn=92t=
 sit well with many Democrats.

=93I think there probably will be a resolution or a platform change or some=
thing coming out of this convention which says we don=92t necessarily agree=
 with this and we would ask the DNC to reassess it,=94 Steinau said.

Steinau said the resolution might ask to get rid of super delegates altoget=
her or require them to vote for the person who won the state caucus.

Meanwhile, Ddemocrats who support Hilary Clinton are also attending the con=
vention. Carolyn Lee with the Hilary for Alaska campaign said there are a l=
ot of people who like both candidates.

=93We are also getting a lot of Bernie supporters coming up and saying, =91=
I=92m going to be with Hilary in a couple of weeks but today I=92m with Ber=
nie,=92=94 Lee said.

Steinau said she was hopeful Alaska Democrats would support whichever candi=
date wins the Party=92s nomination.

=93They both bring so much to the table and at the end of the day when that=
 person is decided I know that we will come together as a united front.=94

<p>In what many called an unusually large state convention, the Alaska Demo=
cratic Party this weekend&nbsp;chose its delegates for&nbsp;the national co=
nvention in July, amid a clash over concerns by some Bernie Sanders&nbsp;fa=
ns that the head of the Democratic National Committee
 has improperly taken steps to benefit Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The anger over Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was highlighted when more t=
han 25 Sanders&nbsp;supporters walked out of her keynote speech Saturday ni=
ght at the Dena=92ina&nbsp;Civic and Convention Center in Anchorage, though=
 they left in a trickle while a huge crowd remained
 to hear the Florida congresswoman and DNC chair call for unity among Democ=
rats to stop the presumptive GOP nominee, Donald Trump.</p>
</font></span></span></div>
<div style=3D"color:rgb(0,0,0)"><span class=3D"updated" style=3D"font-size:=

<p>She warned that the Republican party has&nbsp;laid the groundwork for Tr=
ump's political rise&nbsp;with its divisive and hateful rhetoric. She warne=
d that Trump, as president, would return America to the days of George W. B=
ush&nbsp;that in 2007 led to the nation=92s worst
 economic crash since the Great Depression.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>=93So Trump isn=92t something new -- he=92s just the old Republican bran=
d, but with a little extra bronzer on -- and he=92s that much more dangerou=
s,=94 she said. &quot;We have only ourselves to blame if we don't come toge=
ther.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Her message didn't resonate with&nbsp;some Sanders supporters who say sh=
e <a href=3D"http://www.adn.com/article/20151221/outside-billionaires-fuel-=
joint-effort-between-clinton-alaska-democrats" target=3D"_blank">
improperly steered funds and other support toward the Clinton campaign</a>.=
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ian Smith from Kenai walked out of her speech.</p>
<p></p>
<p>=93As long as she takes this money I can=92t trust her,=94 he said. =93I=
t hurts me to say that.=94</p>
<p></p>
<p>After Wasserman Schultz spoke, Luis Miranda, DNC communications director=
, said she&nbsp;wasn=92t doing interviews and had to hurry to catch&nbsp;a =
plane leaving&nbsp;Alaska.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But when pressed, she denied taking steps to benefit Clinton.</p>
<p></p>
<p>=93Nothing could be further from the truth,=94 she said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Miranda added:&nbsp;=93If she was trying to stack the deck, she=92s doin=
g a terrible job because it=92s been a competitive primary.=94 &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the nearby Egan Center, Sanders supporters danced at an event organiz=
ed to protest&nbsp;Wasserman Schultz's speech. The event, attended by more =
than 200 through the night, was organized in part by Ed&nbsp;Cullinane. A m=
ember of the state central committee from
 an Anchorage House district, Cullinane&nbsp;supported efforts at the state=
=92s three-day convention, but said he couldn=92t tolerate&nbsp;Wasserman S=
chultz's =93unethical actions.=94 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The event featured a prerecorded televised appearance by Sanders'&nbsp;w=
ife, Jane Sanders, who shocked the crowd when she&nbsp;introduced her husba=
nd on screen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a short speech, Sanders&nbsp;thanked Alaska for its huge support, and=
 said he wants to create =93a government that works for all of us and not j=
ust the 1 percent.=94</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the appearance&nbsp;ended, one woman shouted, =93This is awesome!=
=94 as the dancing resumed and the crowd chanted, =93Bernie! Bernie!=94</p>

<p></p>
<p>The events capped a day when the party delegates chose 16 delegates for =
the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, with 13 to vote for San=
ders and three for Clinton. Four superdelegates that can vote for either ca=
ndidate are also headed to the national&nbsp;convention
 to help pick the presidential nominee.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The delegates will include Jill&nbsp;Yordy, the Alaska director for the =
Sanders campaign, who will cast her vote for Sanders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sanders has a shot at overtaking Clinton, she said. One thing Yordy&nbsp=
;wants to share with others in Philadelphia is the passion Alaskans have fo=
r Sanders, who earned more than 80 percent support in the Democratic caucus=
 in March.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That passion was apparent at the state=92s convention, she said, with un=
usually large numbers of delegates traveling huge distances from across Ala=
ska to show their support for him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>=93He appeals to people who have felt disenfranchised by the party syste=
m,=94 she said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>State Rep. Andy&nbsp;Josephson, D-Anchorage, is also heading to Philadel=
phia. Calling a Trump presidency &quot;a dangerous proposition,=94 he said =
he will vote for Clinton.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He said he supports Sanders=92 idealism and said the candidate has shape=
d the discussion in a positive way,&nbsp;highlighting issues such as income=
 disparity and the need for campaign finance reform.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>=93Nothing but good has come from his run,=94 he said. =93If he was sele=
cted as Hillary Clinton=92s running mate, that=92d be terrific.=94 &nbsp;</=

Lauren Maxwell</a>, KTVA Alaska</b></span>
<p>At the State Democratic Convention in Anchorage, one of the big jobs par=
ty leaders have is to elect delegates to attend the national convention in =
July, when the presidential nominee will be decided.</p>
<p>Back in March, candidate Bernie Sanders won the state=92s Democratic cau=
cus in a big way. All 16 of the state=92s regular delegates who will go the=
 national convention in Philadelphia are pledged to vote for him. But the s=
tate also has four super delegates who
 can vote for whomever they want.</p>
<p>Casey Steinau is one of the super delegates. Steinau is the chairman of =
the Alaska Democratic Party, but as a super delegate, she=92s undeclared.</=
p>
<p>=94I am the chairman of the party and I believe that it is my job to rep=
resent 100 percent of the Alaska Democrats and I take that roll very seriou=
sly,=94 Steinau said. =93I don=92t think my personal preferences should be =
influencing anyone.=94</p>
<p>But the idea that super delegates can vote for whomever they want doesn=
=92t sit well with many Democrats.</p>
<p>=93I think there probably will be a resolution or a platform change or s=
omething coming out of this convention which says we don=92t necessarily ag=
ree with this and we would ask the DNC to reassess it,=94 Steinau said.</p>
<p>Steinau said the resolution might ask to get rid of super delegates alto=
gether or require them to vote for the person who won the state caucus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ddemocrats who support Hilary Clinton are also attending the =
convention. Carolyn Lee with the Hilary for Alaska campaign said there are =
a lot of people who like both candidates.</p>
<p>=93We are also getting a lot of Bernie supporters coming up and saying, =
=91I=92m going to be with Hilary in a couple of weeks but today I=92m with =
Bernie,=92=94 Lee said.</p>
<p>Steinau said she was hopeful Alaska Democrats would support whichever ca=
ndidate wins the Party=92s nomination.</p>
<p>=93They both bring so much to the table and at the end of the day when t=
hat person is decided I know that we will come together as a united front.=
