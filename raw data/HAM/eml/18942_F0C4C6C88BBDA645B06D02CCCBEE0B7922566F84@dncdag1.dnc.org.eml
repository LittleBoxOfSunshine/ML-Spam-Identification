Not too slammed yet... Will draft language shortly and send back to you. Do you mind sending me the updated link and invite? 

Also, are we blasting with the new date change today? Just wondering~ 

Thanks and feel better!

So now that Miami is confirmed, we can notify our attendees that the date has changed to June 2. Can you mock up some language and send it to me to review? Just something that thanks them for their support while notifying them of the change (with an apology for any inconvenience). 

Ideally we would send it this afternoon, but if you're slammed we can do it tomorrow. Thank you!
