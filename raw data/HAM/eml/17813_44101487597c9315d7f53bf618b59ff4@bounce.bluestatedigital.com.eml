The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friend --

Every day the Democratic Party fights for people of all stripes, because we=
 know that America is at its best when each of us has the opportunity to fu=
lfill our God-given potential. That's why we fought to expand healthcare to=
 millions of Americans, ensure equal pay for women, and protect the middle =
class.=20

The values we share as Democrats could not stand in starker contrast to tho=
se of Republicans and their presumptive nominee for president, Donald Trump=
.

Their dangerous vision for America threatens all of the progress we have ma=
de under President Obama, which is why we must stand up and fight -- for hi=
s legacy and our future. We have the opportunity to take a stand when DNC C=
hair Debbie Wasserman Schultz rallies Democrats in Knoxville on Thursday, J=
une 2nd. To RSVP for this important event, please click the link below:

This election is too important to remain on the sidelines.

Thank you for your support.
