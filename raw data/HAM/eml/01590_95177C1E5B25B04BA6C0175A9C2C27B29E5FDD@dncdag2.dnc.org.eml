Excerpts From DNC Press Call to Discuss Donald Trump=92s Visit to the Los A=
ngeles Area



Today, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Chair of the Democratic Party of=
 Orange County Henry Vandermeir hosted a press call to hold Donald Trump ac=
countable ahead of his visit to the Los Angeles area. Simply put, Trump is =
divisive and lacks the temperament to be president, and so, we cannot affor=
d to give him the keys to the White House.



Please find excerpts below from the call as prepared for delivery:



Mayor Eric Garcetti



Donald Trump will be making his way to the Los Angeles area tomorrow, and w=
e simply can=92t afford to give him a free pass. The fact of the matter is =
that on issue after issue, he is completely out of touch with Angelinos.



Let=92s take the minimum wage, for instance. It just so happens that tomorr=
ow marks the nine-year anniversary of the last time Americans got a minimum=
 wage increase. On May 25, 2007, President Bush signed into law the Fair Mi=
nimum Wage Act which raised the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour.



I=92ve been a proud champion of the $15 minimum wage because I know that ha=
rdworking Americans deserve some relief from back-breaking poverty, and tha=
t=92s precisely why earlier this year, I signed into law<http://www.latimes=
.com/local/california/la-me-0614-minimum-wage-signing-20150614-story.html> =
a measure to raise the citywide minimum wage to $15 by 2020. But where does=
 Donald Trump stand on this critical issue? Well, we already know that Repu=
blican politicians across the country are opposed to raising the minimum wa=
ge, but believe it or not, Trump is even worse. He's said on multiple occas=
ions that wages are actually =93too high=94 in the United States, and he do=
esn=92t support the idea of a federal minimum wage at all. Is this the pers=
on we want running the economy?



Let=92s also take the recent housing crisis. Angelinos were hit hard by it,=
 and foreclosure signs littered far too many of our streets. Trump  - on th=
e other hand - was cheerleading for a housing crash so that he could benefi=
t financially. To quote Trump, regarding the housing bubble bursting, =93I =
sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy.=
=94 Clearly, he=92s only looking out for himself, and until Trump releases =
his tax returns, it=92s impossible to tell how much he profited while milli=
ons of Americans were suffering through the worst economic crisis since the=
 Great Depression.



Finally, let=92s talk about the issue of immigration. Instead of focusing o=
n fixing our country=92s broken immigration system, Donald Trump has been d=
oing the exact opposite: he has been trying to exploit unfounded fears for =
political gain. Among other things, he=92s called Mexicans =91rapists=92 an=
d =91drug-dealers=92; he wants to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants=
; he wants to repeal President Obama=92s executive actions, DAPA and DACA; =
and he wants to erect a giant wall along our Southern border, all while ban=
ning Muslims from entering our country. That=92s not leadership, and that=
=92s not who we are as a people. We are and will always be a country of imm=
igrants, and my story is a testament to that =96 I=92m absolutely proud to =
be the grandson of Mexican immigrants. And for that reason, I=92ve made sur=
e to take action on immigration as Mayor, even though we don=92t have a lot=
 of formal power at the local level. Our =93citizenship corners=94 program =
is a testament to that, as it helps immigrants attain citizenship.



And so, to wrap things up, I=92d like to reiterate that Donald Trump does n=
ot represent the values and beliefs of Angelinos. Los Angeles is a beautifu=
l and thriving city not because we=92re afraid of diversity; but because we=
 embrace it and we make sure that everyone is treated with the respect and =
dignity that they deserve.



Orange County Democratic Chair Henry Vandermeir



Orange County was once known as the "Most Conservative County in the Nation=
,=94 but the fact of the matter is, that it=92s no longer the GOP stronghol=
d it once was. The Republicans have been losing an average of 1.1% per year=
 in registration over the last decade and now hold just a 8-point voter reg=
istration advantage over Democrats, down from 22 points in 1990.



=85



In fact, since the beginning of the year when Donald Trump began winning pr=
imaries, Democratic registration has surged in Orange County - outpacing Re=
publican registration 2 to 1. The three largest cities in the county (Anahe=
im, Santa Ana and Irvine) already have Democratic majorities and four of th=
e top five voting blocs are in the Democratic column.



Although the Democratic Party of Orange County has worked hard over the pas=
t several years to make significant in-roads with our targeted registration=
 programs, the truth is, Donald Trump has become our best marketing tool. H=
e's insulted pretty much every constituency in this county and that=92s hel=
ped drive Democratic registration to new highs.



And so, the difference between the two parties has never been clearer than =
in this election. Trump has helped to spotlight the difference in our polic=
ies and priorities. I think that=92s what=92s resonating with the people of=
 Orange County, who understand just how dangerous and divisive Trump=92s ca=
ndidacy really is.

Unlike the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, our Party c=
elebrates and encourages diversity. We know that our nation was made great =
by valuing - not vilifying - immigrants and people of all faiths. Both of o=
ur presidential candidates have records of inclusiveness and campaign on is=
sues that bring us together, so it=92s no surprise that they=92ve been a hu=
ge hit with voters.

Trump's impending nomination is a reminder that for years the Republican Pa=
rty has elevated extreme voices, and I think the registration numbers clear=
ly show that the people of Orange County are not interested in that type of=
 rhetoric.

ter is, that it=92s no longer the GOP stronghold it once was. The
 Republicans have been losing an average of 1.1% per year in registration o=
ver the last decade and now hold just a 8-point voter registration advantag=
e over Democrats, down from 22 points in 1990.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">In fact, since the beginning of t=
he year when Donald Trump began winning primaries, Democratic registration =
has surged in Orange County - outpacing Republican registration
 2 to 1. The three largest cities in the county (Anaheim, Santa Ana and Irv=
ine) already have Democratic majorities and four of the top five voting blo=
cs are in the Democratic column.

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Although the Democratic Party of =
Orange County has worked hard over the past several years to make significa=
nt in-roads with our targeted registration programs, the
 truth is, Donald Trump has become our best marketing tool. He's insulted p=
retty much every constituency in this county and that=92s helped drive Demo=
cratic registration to new highs.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span style=3D"fon=
t-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">An=
d so, the difference between the two parties has never been clearer than in=
 this election. Trump has helped to spotlight the difference
 in our policies and priorities. I think that=92s what=92s resonating with =
the people of Orange County, who understand just how dangerous and divisive=
 Trump=92s candidacy really is.

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing" style=3D"margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span style=3D"fon=
t-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Un=
like the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, our Party cel=
ebrates and encourages diversity. We know that our nation
 was made great by valuing - not vilifying - immigrants and people of all f=
aiths. Both of our presidential candidates have records of inclusiveness an=
d campaign on issues that bring us together, so it=92s no surprise that the=
y=92ve been a huge hit with voters.

t-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Tr=
ump's impending nomination is a reminder that for years the Republican Part=
y has elevated extreme voices, and I think the registration
 numbers clearly show that the people of Orange County are not interested i=
n that type of rhetoric.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
