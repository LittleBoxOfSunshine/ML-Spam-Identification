THE NEW YORK TIMES // PATRICK HEALY

Donald J. Trump is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but=
 he is also keenly aware that many in his own party =97 and many Americans,=
 frankly =97 are scared and anxious about the idea of him in the Oval Offic=
e. Even he is not sure how a deeply divided nation would adjust to the firs=
t 100 days of a Trump presidency.



What he does know, however, is what he wants to do in those early months. I=
n a series of recent interviews, he sketched out plans that include showdow=
ns with business leaders over jobs and key roles for military generals, exe=
cutives and possibly even family members in advising him about running the =
country.



Shortly after the Nov. 8 election, President-elect Trump and his vice presi=
dent =97 most likely a governor or member of Congress =97 would begin inter=
viewing candidates for the open Supreme Court seat and quickly settle on a =
nominee in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia.



He would launch a charm offensive to start =93building a government based o=
n relationships,=94 perhaps inviting the Republican leaders Paul D. Ryan an=
d Mitch McConnell to escape the chilly Washington fall and schmooze at Mar-=
a-Lago over golf and two-pound lobsters.



On Inauguration Day, he would go to a =93beautiful=94 gala ball or two, but=
 focus mostly on rescinding Obama executive orders on immigration and calli=
ng up corporate executives to threaten punitive measures if they shift jobs=
 out of the United States.



And by the end of his first 100 days as the nation=92s 45th leader, the wal=
l with Mexico would be designed, the immigration ban on Muslims would be in=
 place, the audit of the Federal Reserve would be underway and plans to rep=
eal the Affordable Care Act would be in motion.



=93I know people aren=92t sure right now what a President Trump will be lik=
e,=94 he said. =93But things will be fine. I=92m not running for president =
to make things unstable for the country.=94



The New York Times interviewed Mr. Trump three times over the past two mont=
hs, most recently on Saturday, as well as several campaign advisers and Tru=
mp confidants.



The possibility of Mr. Trump in the Oval Office =97 an outcome that once se=
emed fanciful =97 became less remote on Tuesday night when Mr. Trump=92s ma=
in challenger, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, quit the race and on Wednesday, G=
ov. John Kasich, indicated he would withdraw too.



Despite his radical vision of how to remake America, and all his outrageous=
 talk on juvenile subjects like his anatomy =97 to say nothing of the polls=
 showing him behind Hillary Clinton =97 Jan. 20 may find the most underesti=
mated politician in America assuming the presidency.



While professing some surprise at his success, Mr. Trump increasingly sound=
s like a man who thinks he knows where he will be eight months from now, an=
d the unrivaled power he will hold. He talked of turning the Oval Office in=
to a high-powered board room, empowering military leaders over foreign affa=
irs specialists in national security debates, and continuing to speak harsh=
ly about adversaries. He may post on Twitter less, but everyone will still =
know what he thinks.



=93As president, I=92ll be working from the first day with my vice presiden=
t and staff to make clear that America will be changing in major ways for t=
he better,=94 Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview on Saturday. =93We ca=
n=92t afford to waste time. I want a vice president who will help me have a=
 major impact quickly on Capitol Hill, and the message will be clear to the=
 nation and to people abroad that the American government will be using its=
 power differently.=94



But he also acknowledged that he might face significant and incessant prote=
sts =97 even thousands of demonstrators massing on the National Mall as he =
takes the oath of office nearby at the Capitol.



Mr. Trump said he would try to unite Republicans and disaffected Democrats =
and independents over the next six months before the November election, and=
 then work in office to show Americans that his chief interest was fighting=
 for their needs. He argued that the fact that he would not have to rely on=
 wealthy donors to finance his campaign would ultimately prove appealing to=
 many voters as they realize he is not =93bought and paid for.=94



=93I know everyone won=92t like everything I do, but I=92m not running to b=
e everyone=92s favorite president,=94 Mr. Trump said. =93Things are serious=
ly wrong in this country. People are hurting, business is hurting. I=92m ru=
nning to move quickly to make big changes.=94



Several friends and allies of Mr. Trump said that =93negotiating=94 was the=
 word he used the most to encapsulate his first 100 days in office. He want=
s to put strong-willed people =97 business executives and generals are ment=
ioned most often =97 in charge of cabinet agencies and throughout his senio=
r staff, and direct them to negotiate deals and plans with congressional le=
aders and state officials, as well as insurance companies and others in the=
 private sector. They say he will accomplish the things he has promised or =
else keep trying, well aware that his supporters will have his head if he d=
oes not.



=93He=92s not going to depart from the agenda he=92s laid out, not a bit,=
=94 said Roger Stone, a longtime adviser and confidant. Mr. Stone declined =
to describe details of his private conversations with Mr. Trump, except to =
say: =93Having gone out a thousand times to say =91I=92m going to build a w=
all,=92 he has to build a wall. He has said he would scrap trade deals; his=
 voters will demand he scrap trade deals. He knows that.=94



Modern America has never seen anything like a Trump administration. Busines=
s leaders and even entertainment figures new to politics have been elected =
governors, of course, and insurgents like Newt Gingrich rose to power.



But this is different. A Manhattan real estate developer and bombastic real=
ity television star, Mr. Trump would be a president like no other. Yet most=
 historians suggest the country would adjust: He would quickly find himself=
 consumed with the urgent and normalizing tasks of building a cabinet, asse=
mbling senior staff and reassuring Wall Street and the public that he was c=
apable of governing America.



=93Trump is predicting he=92ll be able to do all these things, but his work=
load will be pretty enormous and his power would be so limited by precedent=
, by the bureaucracy, by the Constitution,=94 said Robert Dallek, a preside=
ntial historian. =93Even in trade and immigration, where Trump says he will=
 make revolutionary changes, Congress has a say on those things. A lot of p=
eople have a say. The president is not king.=94



But Mr. Trump pledged in the interviews to deliver on his campaign promises=
, even if they prove disruptive or explosive.



On his first day in office, he said, he would meet with Homeland Security o=
fficials, generals, and others =97 he did not mention diplomats =97 to take=
 steps to seal the southern border and assign more security agents along it=
. He would also call the heads of companies like Pfizer, the Carrier Corpor=
ation, Ford and Nabisco and warn them that their products face 35 percent t=
ariffs because they are moving jobs out of the country. Democrats and some =
Republicans have warned that financial markets would react poorly and that =
Mr. Trump=92s protectionist stances might plunge the country into recession=
, but he insisted that trade is =93killing the country=94 and =93the market=
s would be fine.=94



=93Bilateral talks with Mexico would start pretty quickly on the wall, and =
I would have chief executives into the Oval Office soon, too,=94 he said. =
=93The Oval Office would be an amazing place to negotiate. It would command=
 immediate respect from the other side, immediate understanding about the n=
ation=92s priorities.=94



As for which foreign leader he would call first as president, he said =93th=
ey would not necessarily be a priority.=94



=93We have to take a tougher stand with foreign countries,=94 Mr. Trump sai=
d. =93We=92re like the policemen of the world right now. So I wouldn=92t be=
 calling them up right away and getting more entangled.=94



For good or ill, he would command the nation=92s attention unlike any moder=
n president, and not simply because of his penchant for redecorating in gol=
d and renaming planes and buildings after himself. (For the record, he said=
 he had no ambitious renovation plans.)



=93His first 100 days would be riveting,=94 said Ari Fleischer, a former pr=
ess secretary for President George W. Bush. =93The question would be whethe=
r he is capable of downshifting from the hot rhetoric of his campaign to th=
e serious business of building a presidency based on sound judgment and nec=
essary coalition building.=94



Mr. Fleischer said it was possible that Mr. Trump would make the adjustment=
, given his frequent comments about negotiating with Democrats and Republic=
ans to reach compromises.



=93That side of him intrigues me,=94 Mr. Fleischer said. =93He keeps alludi=
ng to how well he gets along with people. It=92s almost like Trump is playi=
ng a shrewd game. Tough campaigner today. Great deal maker later.=94 He add=
ed, =93Of course, if he wins he=92ll have some level of strength and moment=
um akin to a mandate. That would help.=94



Mr. Trump did seem aware that his early months could be consumed with tryin=
g to win confirmation for his cabinet and perhaps a new Supreme Court justi=
ce and with making appointments throughout the bureaucracy.



He made it clear that he was not interested in delegating these tasks and t=
hat he wanted to make sure his appointees shared his governing philosophy. =
One of his closest advisers, his daughter Ivanka, would probably stay with =
his company, but he said he would seek counsel from her and her husband, th=
e businessman Jared Kushner, and noted that family members had served in ad=
ministrations before.



Even jobs that might seem incidental in a Trump universe, like a United Sta=
tes ambassador to the United Nations, have apparently crossed his mind.



=93I think about a U.N. ambassador, about a secretary of defense and secret=
ary of treasury, but I think more about winning first,=94 Mr. Trump said. =
=93Otherwise I=92m wasting time. I want people in those jobs who care about=
 winning. The U.N. isn=92t doing anything to end the big conflicts in the w=
orld, so you need an ambassador who would win by really shaking up the U.N.=
=94

 Trump?=92 Here=92s How He Says It Would Look</a><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&q=
uot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">THE NEW YORK TIMES // PATRICK =
HEALY<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Donald J. Trump is now the presum=
ptive Republican presidential nominee, but he is also keenly aware that man=
y in his own party =97 and many Americans, frankly =97 are scared
 and anxious about the idea of him in the Oval Office. Even he is not sure =
how a deeply divided nation would adjust to the first 100 days of a Trump p=
residency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">What he does know, however, is wh=
at he wants to do in those early months. In a series of recent interviews, =
he sketched out plans that include showdowns with business
 leaders over jobs and key roles for military generals, executives and poss=
ibly even family members in advising him about running the country.<o:p></o=
:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Shortly after the Nov. 8 election=
, President-elect Trump and his vice president =97 most likely a governor o=
r member of Congress =97 would begin interviewing candidates
 for the open Supreme Court seat and quickly settle on a nominee in the mol=
d of Justice Antonin Scalia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">He would launch a charm offensive=
 to start =93building a government based on relationships,=94 perhaps invit=
ing the Republican leaders Paul D. Ryan and Mitch McConnell
 to escape the chilly Washington fall and schmooze at Mar-a-Lago over golf =
and two-pound lobsters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">On Inauguration Day, he would go =
to a =93beautiful=94 gala ball or two, but focus mostly on rescinding Obama=
 executive orders on immigration and calling up corporate executives
 to threaten punitive measures if they shift jobs out of the United States.=
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">And by the end of his first 100 d=
ays as the nation=92s 45th leader, the wall with Mexico would be designed, =
the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place, the audit
 of the Federal Reserve would be underway and plans to repeal the Affordabl=
e Care Act would be in motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">=93I know people aren=92t sure ri=
ght now what a President Trump will be like,=94 he said. =93But things will=
 be fine. I=92m not running for president to make things unstable
 for the country.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The New York Times interviewed Mr=
. Trump three times over the past two months, most recently on Saturday, as=
 well as several campaign advisers and Trump confidants.<o:p></o:p></span><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The possibility of Mr. Trump in t=
he Oval Office =97 an outcome that once seemed fanciful =97 became less rem=
ote on Tuesday night when Mr. Trump=92s main challenger, Senator
 Ted Cruz of Texas, quit the race and on Wednesday, Gov. John Kasich, indic=
ated he would withdraw too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Despite his radical vision of how=
 to remake America, and all his outrageous talk on juvenile subjects like h=
is anatomy =97 to say nothing of the polls showing him behind
 Hillary Clinton =97 Jan. 20 may find the most underestimated politician in=
 America assuming the presidency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">While professing some surprise at=
 his success, Mr. Trump increasingly sounds like a man who thinks he knows =
where he will be eight months from now, and the unrivaled
 power he will hold. He talked of turning the Oval Office into a high-power=
ed board room, empowering military leaders over foreign affairs specialists=
 in national security debates, and continuing to speak harshly about advers=
aries. He may post on Twitter less,
 but everyone will still know what he thinks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">=93As president, I=92ll be workin=
g from the first day with my vice president and staff to make clear that Am=
erica will be changing in major ways for the better,=94 Mr. Trump
 said in a telephone interview on Saturday. =93We can=92t afford to waste t=
ime. I want a vice president who will help me have a major impact quickly o=
n Capitol Hill, and the message will be clear to the nation and to people a=
broad that the American government will
 be using its power differently.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">But he also acknowledged that he =
might face significant and incessant protests =97 even thousands of demonst=
rators massing on the National Mall as he takes the oath of
 office nearby at the Capitol.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Mr. Trump said he would try to un=
ite Republicans and disaffected Democrats and independents over the next si=
x months before the November election, and then work in
 office to show Americans that his chief interest was fighting for their ne=
eds. He argued that the fact that he would not have to rely on wealthy dono=
rs to finance his campaign would ultimately prove appealing to many voters =
as they realize he is not =93bought
 and paid for.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">=93I know everyone won=92t like e=
verything I do, but I=92m not running to be everyone=92s favorite president=
,=94 Mr. Trump said. =93Things are seriously wrong in this country.
 People are hurting, business is hurting. I=92m running to move quickly to =
make big changes.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Several friends and allies of Mr.=
 Trump said that =93negotiating=94 was the word he used the most to encapsu=
late his first 100 days in office. He wants to put strong-willed
 people =97 business executives and generals are mentioned most often =97 i=
n charge of cabinet agencies and throughout his senior staff, and direct th=
em to negotiate deals and plans with congressional leaders and state offici=
als, as well as insurance companies
 and others in the private sector. They say he will accomplish the things h=
e has promised or else keep trying, well aware that his supporters will hav=
e his head if he does not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">=93He=92s not going to depart fro=
m the agenda he=92s laid out, not a bit,=94 said Roger Stone, a longtime ad=
viser and confidant. Mr. Stone declined to describe details of his
 private conversations with Mr. Trump, except to say: =93Having gone out a =
thousand times to say =91I=92m going to build a wall,=92 he has to build a =
wall. He has said he would scrap trade deals; his voters will demand he scr=
ap trade deals. He knows that.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Modern America has never seen any=
thing like a Trump administration. Business leaders and even entertainment =
figures new to politics have been elected governors, of
 course, and insurgents like Newt Gingrich rose to power.<o:p></o:p></span>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">But this is different. A Manhatta=
n real estate developer and bombastic reality television star, Mr. Trump wo=
uld be a president like no other. Yet most historians suggest
 the country would adjust: He would quickly find himself consumed with the =
urgent and normalizing tasks of building a cabinet, assembling senior staff=
 and reassuring Wall Street and the public that he was capable of governing=
 America.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">=93Trump is predicting he=92ll be=
 able to do all these things, but his workload will be pretty enormous and =
his power would be so limited by precedent, by the bureaucracy,
 by the Constitution,=94 said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian. =93E=
ven in trade and immigration, where Trump says he will make revolutionary c=
hanges, Congress has a say on those things. A lot of people have a say. The=
 president is not king.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">But Mr. Trump pledged in the inte=
rviews to deliver on his campaign promises, even if they prove disruptive o=
r explosive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">On his first day in office, he sa=
id, he would meet with Homeland Security officials, generals, and others =
=97 he did not mention diplomats =97 to take steps to seal the
 southern border and assign more security agents along it. He would also ca=
ll the heads of companies like Pfizer, the Carrier Corporation, Ford and Na=
bisco and warn them that their products face 35 percent tariffs because the=
y are moving jobs out of the country.
 Democrats and some Republicans have warned that financial markets would re=
act poorly and that Mr. Trump=92s protectionist stances might plunge the co=
untry into recession, but he insisted that trade is =93killing the country=
=94 and =93the markets would be fine.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">=93Bilateral talks with Mexico wo=
uld start pretty quickly on the wall, and I would have chief executives int=
o the Oval Office soon, too,=94 he said. =93The Oval Office would
 be an amazing place to negotiate. It would command immediate respect from =
the other side, immediate understanding about the nation=92s priorities.=94=
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">As for which foreign leader he wo=
uld call first as president, he said =93they would not necessarily be a pri=
ority.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">=93We have to take a tougher stan=
d with foreign countries,=94 Mr. Trump said. =93We=92re like the policemen =
of the world right now. So I wouldn=92t be calling them up right away
 and getting more entangled.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">For good or ill, he would command=
 the nation=92s attention unlike any modern president, and not simply becau=
se of his penchant for redecorating in gold and renaming planes
 and buildings after himself. (For the record, he said he had no ambitious =
renovation plans.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">=93His first 100 days would be ri=
veting,=94 said Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary for President Georg=
e W. Bush. =93The question would be whether he is capable of downshifting
 from the hot rhetoric of his campaign to the serious business of building =
a presidency based on sound judgment and necessary coalition building.=94<o=
:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Mr. Fleischer said it was possibl=
e that Mr. Trump would make the adjustment, given his frequent comments abo=
ut negotiating with Democrats and Republicans to reach compromises.<o:p></o=
:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">=93That side of him intrigues me,=
=94 Mr. Fleischer said. =93He keeps alluding to how well he gets along with=
 people. It=92s almost like Trump is playing a shrewd game. Tough
 campaigner today. Great deal maker later.=94 He added, =93Of course, if he=
 wins he=92ll have some level of strength and momentum akin to a mandate. T=
hat would help.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Mr. Trump did seem aware that his=
 early months could be consumed with trying to win confirmation for his cab=
inet and perhaps a new Supreme Court justice and with making
 appointments throughout the bureaucracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">He made it clear that he was not =
interested in delegating these tasks and that he wanted to make sure his ap=
pointees shared his governing philosophy. One of his closest
 advisers, his daughter Ivanka, would probably stay with his company, but h=
e said he would seek counsel from her and her husband, the businessman Jare=
d Kushner, and noted that family members had served in administrations befo=
re.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Even jobs that might seem inciden=
tal in a Trump universe, like a United States ambassador to the United Nati=
ons, have apparently crossed his mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">=93I think about a U.N. ambassado=
r, about a secretary of defense and secretary of treasury, but I think more=
 about winning first,=94 Mr. Trump said. =93Otherwise I=92m wasting
 time. I want people in those jobs who care about winning. The U.N. isn=92t=
 doing anything to end the big conflicts in the world, so you need an ambas=
sador who would win by really shaking up the U.N.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
