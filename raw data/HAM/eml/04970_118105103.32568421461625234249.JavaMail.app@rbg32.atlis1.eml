Hello Luis!

Have you felt it? There&rsquo;s a noticeable shift http://links.grassrootst=

b=3D2&j=3DNzgzOTM2NTcxS0&mt=3D1&rt=3D0 in the content of the 2016 president=
ial campaign as Democratic hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are =
taking turns pushing the disability agenda &ndash; a first for any presiden=
tial campaign.

Five states - Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Islan=
d - head to the polls tomorrow and candidates on both sides of the aisle ar=
e pulling out all the stops to up their delegate counts.

The disability vote can play a large part in that.

Fully one-out-of-five voters Americans (56 million) has a disability and 52=
 percent of likely voters have a loved one with a disability so if any cand=
idate wants to be elected president of the United States, they are going to=
 need the votes of people with disabilities. Presidential candidates need t=
o work for all of us. They need to represent all of us.

Both Clinton and Sanders were quick to complete the #PwDsVote 2016 Campaign=
 Questionnaire. Neither of the leading Republican candidates have responded=
 to our numerous requests to fill out the questionnaire (though Ohio Gov. J=
ohn Kasich has answered some of the questions).=20

RespectAbility is nonpartisan and does not endorse candidates. The question=
naire is purely for educational purposes as voters go to the polls. Its gro=
undbreaking publication, The RespectAbility Report http://links.grassrootst=

itics and disability, and has covered 100 percent of the candidates on both=
 sides of the aisle. Their reporters are people with disabilities themselve=
s, and people who care deeply about disability issues.=20

Please take a look at some recent coverage of the candidates on a variety o=
f disability issues from subminimum wage to the Disability Integration Act =
and more.Thanks,

eleased its state-specific Disability Voter Guides. The #PwDsVote 2016 Camp=
aign Questionnaire was designed for people with disabilities (PwDs) and tho=
se who love them to know where candidates stand on the issues. The question=
naire asked all of the presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle t=
o comment on 16 disability questions on issues relating to employment and s=
tigma. Former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders respond=
ed by addressing all of the questions, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich filled out=
 parts of the questionnaire. They each have significantly different views o=
n the issues. Despite numerous requests in person and by phone and email, t=
he campaigns of Sen. Ted Cruz and Republican frontrunner Donald Trump have =
not yet filled out the questionnaire. Read More: Connecticut http://links.g=

to one-up each other beginning with subminimum wage.

&ldquo;When it comes to jobs, we&rsquo;ve got to figure out how we get the =
minimum wage up and include people with disabilities in the minimum wage,&r=
dquo; Clinton said in Madison, Wisconsin. &quot;When people talk about rais=

 raise the minimum wage for all workers &ndash; including people with disab=

&ldquo;This campaign is about building on these successes so that everyone =
in this country can enjoy the dignity and basic economic security that come=

d in a statement as Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislati=

as signed on as a cosponsor of the Disability Integration Act (DIA) and Cli=
nton released an official statement on her website announcing support of th=
e bill, but none of the Republican candidates for president have stated if =
they support the monumental bill introduced by Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) =
that would greatly affect the lives of people with disabilities.

&ldquo;In this campaign, I have committed to improving opportunities for pe=
ople with disabilities to live in integrated community settings, consistent=
 with the full promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Supre=
me Court&rsquo;s historic Olmstead decision,&rdquo; Clinton said in an offi=

Later that day, Sanders signed on as a cosponsor of the DIA, which will ens=
ure that people in need of long-term services and supports such as personal=
 care attendants can receive these services while living at home or in the =
community instead of in an institutionalized setting if they wish to do so.=
 Studies have shown that it is more cost effective to do so than to live in=
 institutionalized settings such as nursing homes where people with disabil=
ities can no longer participate and contribute to society by working and pa=
ying taxes. Read More http://links.grassrootstargeting.mkt7273.com/ctt?kn=

Then, Kasich was approached by members of ADAPT who asked the governor to a=
nswer if he supports the DIA. &ldquo;We have worked aggressively to get peo=
ple out of these institutions and in the community, and in the course of do=
ing that, by the way, you get criticized,&rdquo; Kasich said, without givin=

 Voters Looking for More From Cruz and TrumpThe Republican frontrunners hav=
e not paid much attention to the interests of the nation&rsquo;s largest mi=
nority: voters with disabilities.=20

If businessman Donald Trump wins the Republican nomination, the disability =
community could see a huge contrast between the two candidates. Trump has b=
een widely criticized for making fun of reporters with disabilities, evicti=
ng veterans with disabilities from outside Trump Tower, and using the word =
&ldquo;stupid&rdquo; interchangeably with &ldquo;loser&rdquo; and &ldquo;in=
competent.&rdquo; This is despite the fact that people with intellectual di=
sabilities can be very good at specific tasks. When he is asked a question =
about disability issues - from employment to drug addiction to Autism - his=
 replies often are short without any specifics. He has yet to announce his =
specific plans on employment, education and a wide variety of other issues =
important to people with disabilities and their families. Read More http://=

<br>
Five states - Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and&nbsp;Rhode =

<br>
The disability vote can play a large part in that.<br>
<br>
Fully one-out-of-five voters&nbsp;Americans (56 million) has a disability a=
nd 52 percent of likely voters have a loved one with a disability&nbsp;so i=

ndidates need to work for all of us. They need to represent all of us.<br>
<br>
Both Clinton and&nbsp;Sanders were quick to complete the&nbsp;#PwDsVote 201=

As voters prepare to head to the polls in five states tomorrow, RespectAbil=
ity released&nbsp;its state-specific Disability Voter Guides. The&nbsp;#PwD=
sVote 2016 Campaign Questionnaire&nbsp;was designed for people with disabil=
ities (PwDs) and those who love them to know where candidates stand on the =
issues. The questionnaire asked all of the presidential candidates on both =
sides of the aisle to comment on&nbsp;16 disability questions on issues rel=
ating to employment and stigma. Former Sec. of State&nbsp;Hillary Clinton&n=
bsp;and Sen.&nbsp;Bernie Sanders&nbsp;responded by addressing all of the qu=
estions, and Ohio Gov.&nbsp;John Kasich&nbsp;filled out parts of the questi=
onnaire. They each&nbsp;have significantly different views on the issues.&n=
bsp;Despite numerous requests in person and by phone and email, the campaig=
ns of Sen. Ted Cruz and Republican frontrunner Donald Trump have not yet fi=
lled out the questionnaire. Read More:&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://links.grassro=

Later that day, Sanders signed on as a cosponsor of the DIA, which&nbsp;wil=
l ensure that people in need of long-term services and supports such as per=
sonal care attendants can receive these services while living at home or in=
 the community instead of in an institutionalized setting if they wish to d=
o so. Studies have shown that it is&nbsp;more cost effective&nbsp;to do so =
than to live in institutionalized settings such as nursing homes where peop=
le with disabilities can no longer participate and contribute to society by=
 working and paying taxes. <a href=3D"http://links.grassrootstargeting.mkt7=

nswer if he supports the DIA.&nbsp;=E2=80=9CWe have worked aggressively to =
get people out of these institutions and in the community, and in the cours=

<br>
If businessman Donald&nbsp;Trump wins the Republican nomination, the disabi=

has been widely criticized for making fun of reporters with disabilities, e=
victing veterans with disabilities from outside Trump Tower, and using the =

h intellectual disabilities can be very good at specific tasks. When he is =
asked a question about disability issues - from employment to drug addictio=
n to Autism - his replies often are short without any specifics. He&nbsp;ha=
s yet to announce his specific plans on employment, education and a wide va=
riety of other issues important to people with disabilities and their famil=
