Trump bails out Christie with fundraisers<http://www.usatoday.com/story/new=

r/84572212/>
ASSOCIATED PRESS // MICHAEL CATALINI
Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump is helping dig former rival Chris Chri=
stie and the New Jersey Republican Party out of big debt they incurred from=
 the George Washington Bridge scandal and the governor's presidential campa=
ign.

Trump on Thursday will attend a $25,000-per-person fundraiser for the state=
 GOP to help it pay off about $500,000 incurred in legal fees responding to=
 legislative subpoenas in the bridge scandal. Trump and Christie will headl=
ine the event as well as a separate, $200 per-person fundraiser to pay down=
 Christie's roughly $250,000 presidential campaign debt.

"Governor Christie has been very supportive of Mr. Trump," said Trump spoke=
swoman Hope Hicks. "Mr. Trump looks forward to raising money for the Govern=
or and spending time with the great people of New Jersey on Thursday night.=
"

The hand-in-hand fund raising help is a sharp turnabout from five months ag=
o, when Trump said Christie "totally knew" that some of his allies had shut=
 down access lanes to bridge to retaliate against a Democratic mayor who wo=
uldn't support Christie's re-election, as prosecutors allege. Two former Ch=
ristie allies have pleaded not guilty to federal wire fraud and civil right=
s charges. Christie has not been charged and denies involvement.

Christie has since folded his presidential campaign and taken the big polit=
ical risk of endorsing Trump, and the billionaire has tapped the governor t=
o head his White House transition team.

Now Trump, eager to show support for the Republican Party, is making what s=
ome members of the GOP see as a helpful gesture.

"We certainly take it as a demonstration of their long and deep friendship,=
" said Bill Palatucci, a long-time Christie adviser and New Jersey Republic=
an National Committeeman. "Whether it's a thank-you or not, we appreciate i=
t nonetheless."

The events, both held at the National Guard Armory in Lawrenceville, are ex=
pected to draw roughly 1,000 people for the presidential debt fundraiser an=
d 15 to 20 for the state party fundraiser, Palatucci said. The fundraisers,=
 he says, are expected to retire the debt almost entirely, if not completel=
y.

Trump is coming to New Jersey as the bridge scandal is in headlines again t=
his week after a federal appeals court delayed the release of a list of uni=
ndicted co-conspirators in the scheme sought by media organizations, includ=
ing The Associated Press.

New Jersey taxpayers have spent more than $10 million for legal services fo=
r the Christie administration. Christie's 2013 gubernatorial campaign also =
still owes nearly $1 million for legal services. None of the money raised T=
hursday will go toward those costs, according to Palatucci.

Asked about the fundraisers this week by a reporter, Christie shook his hea=
d and laughed but refused to comment.

Hicks did not address whether Trump still believes Christie knew about the =
lane closures.

In recent comments Christie has highlighted his friendship with Trump, whic=
h goes back more than a decade, and insisted support doesn't stem from poli=
tical expediency.

"This is not like some political marriage," Christie said. "This is a guy I=
've known and been friends with for 14 years."

The state party is praising Trump ahead of his first visit to the state sin=
ce he has become the presumptive nominee.

"We are proud that Mr. Trump has shown his commitment to growing our party =
here in New Jersey," said Pete Sheridan, executive director of the Republic=
an State Committee.

Christie's presidential campaign was a magnet for New Jersey Republicans wi=
th most of the party establishment backing him. He raised nearly $4 million=
 from New Jersey donors, far more than any other Republican candidate, acco=
rding to federal records. That produced a squeeze on contributors, which li=
kely cost other Republicans running for office in the state, according to p=
olitical experts.

"It really created a vacuum in the last years," Montclair State University =
political science professor Brigid Harrison said. "There was this kind of s=
ucking from New Jersey donors to his campaign at the cost of down-ballot ca=
ndidates."
