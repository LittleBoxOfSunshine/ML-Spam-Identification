to be smarter, try harder and work harder just to compete in a man=92s worl=

Trump has said some very sexist things in print and on camera about women. =
Does this reflect the real Donald Trump or, as he puts it, just entertainme=
nt? He chose to appear on the cover of Playboy magazine with a naked woman.=
 He chose to be interviewed by Howard Stern where he discussed and rated wo=
men=92s physical attributes. Trump used the print media to describe how he =
thought women wanted and expected to be treated poorly. How can he distance=
 himself from his own words and acts?

The Trump I started working with in 1978 was very different from who he is =
today. He used to be deferential to women. He had tremendous respect for hi=
s mother and I think this influenced his treatment of women. He did not tal=
k about them disparagingly. He did not discriminate against women in hiring=
.

When he put Ivana in charge of the Plaza Hotel, he said he would pay her in=
 dresses, a remark that devalued her contribution and hurt her badly. When =
his breakup happened, he bragged about being with so many women, it distrac=
ted him from his work. He boasted about newspaper headlines detailing his s=
ex life. I heard him talk, for the first time, about women=92s bodies. Thos=
e sexist comments attributed to him recently come as no surprise. Neither d=
o his remarks about Hillary Clinton.When I worked there, Trump had several =
extremely strong, outspoken women whom he listened to. Even his wife, Ivana=
, was put in a position of great power and trust. But over the years, I saw=
 him change. As Trump became more famous, his behavior towards women worsen=
ed. He started talking about movie stars who wanted to date him, even while=
 he was still married.

Trump=92s positions on the issues are anti-women on their face. He is oppos=
ed to reproductive freedom. This is a fundamental right and important to mo=
st women in the electorate. He is opposed to the Affordable Care Act, which=
 has empowered women. He is opposed to raising the minimum wage, which affe=
cts women more than men. He is in favor of deporting undocumented migrants =
who have raised families in the United States. A cabinet full of women woul=
d not mitigate the impact of his stance on these matters.

Trump would be well served to listen to his advisers with regard to his tre=
atment of Clinton and women=92s issues. But he continues to show that he is=
 not being =93handled=94, and it=92s likely he will go on with this bluster=
 and braggadocio. Trump has threatened to go after Clinton and no doubt, he=
 will do it in a way that reeks of sexism. Trump probably thinks his commen=
ts about women and treatment of Hillary will win him more of the men=92s vo=
te. He will need as many as he can get if that=92s true, because he won=92t=
 be getting many from women.
