Re: There's still time to take advantage of today's record low rates, visit here> http://viewhere.deservestrong.eu/visit



It's no surprise that mortgage rates sank after the Federal Reserve raised the cost of banks to borrow overnight. This may seem contradictory, but history shows otherwise.

"Mortgage rates continued a trend of small, steady improvements into the new week today," said the Mortgage News Daily, explaining that real estate financing rates had gone down. "This marks the 4th straight day of a winning streak that began last Wednesday when the Fed announced its much-anticipated rate hike."

While banks were busily raising loan rates as soon as the Fed announced its long-anticipated decision, the cost to finance real estate was going down.e9d5726d67d2992e0994d5e1bac98ff8+

<p><span style="color: #65635d; width: 600px;">&quot;Mortgage rates continued a trend of small, steady improvements into the new week today,&quot; said the Mortgage News Daily, explaining that real estate financing rates had gone down. &quot;This marks the 4th straight day of a winning streak that began last Wednesday when the Fed announced its much-anticipated rate hike.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #65635d; width: 600px;">This makes no sense for those who believe all interest rates move in unison, but that's not how the marketplace works. While the Fed controls the overnight cost of interest paid by banks and credit unions, mortgage rates are different. Mortgage rates are not controlled by the Fed, instead they tend to parallel the interest rates for 10-year Treasury notes.&#43;e9d5726d67d2992e0994d5e1bac98ff8&#43;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #65635d; width: 600px;">The two rates have virtually nothing in common, and to some extent, this is good news for mortgage borrowers. Bank rates are effectively set by the Federal Reserve as it attempts to guide the economy. Mortgage rates are established by supply and demand. If there's a lot of cash floating around than interest rates fall, if cash is tight interest rates rise.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #65635d; width: 600px;">There can be many factors which investors will look at when determining what to do with their capital. For instance, what is the inflation rate? How do mortgage returns compare with investments? How secure are the mortgages?&#43;e9d5726d67d2992e0994d5e1bac98ff8&#43;</span></p>
