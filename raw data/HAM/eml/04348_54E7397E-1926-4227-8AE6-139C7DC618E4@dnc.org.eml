Donald Trump launches tax plan rewrite - POLITICO
[160510_donald_trump_44_gty_1160.jpg]

Donald Trump=92s campaign has enlisted influential conservative economists =
to revise his tax package and make it more politically palatable by slashin=
g the $10 trillion sticker price. Their main targets: Lifting the top tax r=
ate from Trump=92s original plan and expanding the number of people who wou=
ld have to pay taxes under it.

Trump=92s initial proposal, rolled out with fanfare at Trump Tower in Manha=
ttan last September, has been in the spotlight since he became the presumpt=
ive Republican nominee last week and promptly declared that it was only a s=
tarting point for any negotiations with congressional Democrats, should he =
become president.

Story Continued Below

But it turns out Trump=92s team is open to revamping it far sooner than tha=
t; the campaign last month contacted at least two prominent conservative ec=
onomists =97 Larry Kudlow, the CNBC television host, and Stephen Moore of t=
he Heritage Foundation and a longtime Wall Street Journal writer =97 to spe=
arhead an effort to update the package.

=93What we=92ve been trying to do is help advise him a little bit to try to=
 reduce the cost of the plan=94 and still encourage economic growth, Moore =
said in an interview.

Trump=92s initial plan<https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/trump-tax-reform.pdf=
> has come under criticism from both the right and left for vastly expandin=
g the deficit, with the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimating it would add =
$10 trillion<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/donald-trump-tax-plan-an=
alysis-deficit-214211> to the federal deficit in the next decade. Democrati=
c frontrunner Hillary Clinton has moved quickly<http://www.politico.com/sto=
ry/2016/05/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-heartless-tycoon-222972> to tattoo =
the plan=92s steep price tag onto Trump, with her team holding a call on Mo=
nday calling it a reckless expansion of debt.

"This is the most risky, restless and regressive tax proposal ever put forw=
ard by a major presidential candidate," one of President Obama=92s former t=
op economic advisers, Gene Sperling, said on the Clinton campaign call.

The Trump team=92s quiet outreach to Moore and Kudlow, even before the New =
York billionaire had wrapped up the GOP nomination, is a sign the campaign =
was seeking to shore up a possible general-election vulnerability early.

Over the weekend, Trump spoke openly of changing his tax plan on the Sunday=
 shows. =93The thing I'm going to do is make sure the middle class gets goo=
d tax breaks,=94 he said on NBC=92s Meet the Press<http://www.nbcnews.com/m=
eet-the-press/meet-press-may-8-2016-n570111>. =93Because they have been abs=
olutely shunned. The other thing, I'm going to fight very hard for business=
. For the wealthy, I think, frankly, it's going to go up. And you know what=
, it really should go up.=94

The next day, on CNN, Trump tried to clarify that he wasn=92t actually talk=
ing about raising rates on the wealthy, just raising them from his original=
 plan. =93If I increase it on the wealthy, they're still going to pay less =
than they pay now,=94 he said.

While Kudlow cast the changes he and Moore are recommending as =93tweaking,=
=94 what he described would have an enormous financial impact. Kudlow said =
they had already resubmitted their revisions to the Tax Foundation, which h=
e said was now preliminarily estimating that the package would expand the d=
eficit by $3.8 trillion =97 a roughly 60 percent cut.

=93The full effect of all the things we talked about would have a very impo=
rtant reduction in the deficit,=94 Kudlow said, adding, =93The economic gro=
wth would be increased, as would jobs and wages.=94

Trump has not offered many policy specifics in his campaign so far but his =
tax package was among his most detailed. It included eliminating federal in=
come taxes for individuals making less than $25,000 and for married couples=
 earning below $50,000, slashing the highest income tax rate from 39.6 perc=
ent to 25 percent and cutting the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 p=
ercent.

Some of those numbers could now shift, according to Kudlow, who stressed th=
at the proposed changes he and Moore are drafting are simply =93suggestions=
=94 for Trump.

=93Mr. Trump has not signed off on any of this,=94 Kudlow cautioned.

Among their most notable revenue-generating recommendations is raising the =
top tax bracket higher from the 25 percent that Trump had originally propos=
ed to 28 percent, according to Kudlow. That would still represent a substan=
tial tax cut for the richest Americans.

Kudlow also said that the threshold for paying no income taxes could =93be =
lowered a bit=94 =97 Trump would take 33 million low-income Americans off t=
he rolls entirely =97 from the original proposed $50,000 level for married =
couples. He did not specify the new threshold.

In his initial rollout, Trump had promised that millions of households no l=
onger paying taxes were going to get a one-page form to send to the Interna=
l Revenue Service simply saying, =93I win.=94

Not every change Kudlow and Moore are drafting would result in more revenue=
. Kudlow said they were also suggesting that Trump keep the capital gains t=
ax rate at 15 percent across all income levels; Trump=92s original plan had=
 that rate at 20 percent for those earning more than $150,000.

He also said they would recommend letting corporations use =93immediate exp=
ensing of equipment=94 for tax purposes to spur investment and economic gro=
wth. This has become a top priority for many Republicans, though it wasn=92=
t in Trump=92s original plan.

=93Eventually the candidate will make a call,=94 Kudlow said of the new pro=
posals.

The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

Kudlow and Moore are well known voices in conservative economic circles. Th=
ey are two of the founders, with economist and former Ronald Reagan adviser=
 Art Laffer and former GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes, of the Comm=
ittee to Unleash Prosperity, established last year to advance for conservat=
ive economic policies. The group met with multiple GOP presidential candida=
tes in the last year, including Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, John Kasich, Carly =
Fiorina and Mike Huckabee.

The group=92s imprint could help add credibility on the right to a revised =
Trump tax plan, after his original proposal came under attack from some Rep=
ublicans as unrealistically large. By one measure, Trump=92s proposed tax c=
ut was four times the size of George W. Bush=92s 2001 tax cuts.

Ryan Ellis, former tax policy director for Grover Norquist=92s Americans fo=
r Tax Reform, said such a proposal =93drags down the entire effort at conse=
rvative tax reform to a circus level.=94

=93It=92s simply not realistic,=94 Ellis said. =93There=92s no amount of en=
titlement reform that can pay for that, and there=92s no amount of base bro=
adening that can pay for that.=94

The proposed revision =97 reducing the overall cost to the budget, putting =
more people back on the income tax rolls and expanding business =93expensin=
g=94 =97 appears to be an effort to put Trump more in line with the broader=
 Republican consensus on tax policy.

Trump has been far more reticent than most Republicans to make changes to S=
ocial Security and Medicare, the biggest entitlement programs, instead talk=
ing about cutting back on more amorphous waste and abuse that most independ=
ent analysts agree don=92t add up to significant savings.

But Kudlow suggested there was more spending cut details on the horizon, as=
 well.

=93There would also be a spending reduction piece as part of this overall p=
ackage, which, frankly, would probably slice another $2 trillion=94 off the=
 federal deficit, he said.
