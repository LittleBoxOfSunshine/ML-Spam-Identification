Excerpts from Press Call in Advance of Rubio=92s Proposal on the Department=
 of Veterans Affairs with Congressman Ruben Gallego and Iowa Democratic Par=
ty Vice Chair Danny Homan


Like the entire GOP presidential field, Marco Rubio=92s plans for our count=
ry=92s veterans are backwards and out-of-touch. In advance of his proposal =
to privatize the Department of Veterans Affairs tomorrow, Congressman Ruben=
 Gallego and Iowa Democratic Party Vice Chair Danny Homan held a press call=
 discussing how Rubio will offer no ideas. Instead, Rubio=92s proposal will=
 roll back the progress that has been made for veterans under President Oba=
ma, such as providing tax credits for businesses who hire veterans, providi=
ng new housing and educational credits in the post-9/11 G.I. Bill, decreasi=
ng veterans=92 homelessness by one-third, and boosting mental health servic=
es for veterans through the Affordable Care Act. Find excerpts from the pre=
ss call below.



Danny Homan, Vice Chair of IDP

=85



Our veterans in Iowa, and across the nation, have sacrificed tremendous amo=
unts to help keep our country safe. And unlike Marco Rubio, we showed up ev=
ery day to do our jobs and protect this country.



Iowa veterans rely on the specialized care provided by the VA to meet their=
 often times complex health needs. But the plan that Marco Rubio supports t=
o privatize the VA wouldn=92t reform the system=97it would dismantle it.



That's an approach opposed by two thirds of veterans - and I count myself i=
n that overwhelming majority. It's also opposed by both the VFW and the Ame=
rican Legion.

=85



In fact, the plan praised by Rubio would exclude 20% of future veterans fro=
m receiving health care benefits. It would lead to reduced care, and remove=
 the guaranteed health care our veterans have earned.



Republicans like Rubio think the only solution to problems is to leave them=
 up to the private sector. But veterans=92 health care is too important to =
be left to the whims of the private market. Outside care can play a role, b=
ut we should not look into those options and then try and tear down the VA.=
 Rubio isn=92t offering anything new. Just something dangerous.



Congressman Ruben Gallego

=85



Tomorrow in Iowa, Marco Rubio will lay out his plan to privatize the Depart=
ment of Veterans Affairs. I cannot stress enough how disastrous this would =
be for our nation=92s veterans.

            =85



Last year, Senate Republicans blocked efforts to move ahead with a $21 bill=
ion bill that would have improved health and education services and job ben=
efits for veterans. That bill would have guaranteed that veterans who serve=
d after 9/11 were granted access to in-state tuition rates at public colleg=
es and universities in any state.



The House Appropriations Subcommittee cut more than $690 million earmarked =
for direct VA medical care and $582 million in VA construction projects fro=
m President Obama=92s proposed 2016 budget. Those cuts would mean about 70,=
000 fewer veterans would be able to receive necessary care.



Republicans have killed other legislation that would benefit veterans by ta=
cking on controversial and unrelated provisions. They sadly prioritize poli=
tics over taking care of our nation=92s heroes every single day. And that i=
s exactly what Marco Rubio has been doing on foreign policy and what he hop=
es to do with the Veterans Administration.



When one of our Democratic presidential candidates announced their support =
of increasing VA funding =96 Rubio responded with the claim that the VA did=
 not have a =93funding problem.=94  Makes sense, considering Rubio has vote=
d to block an increase in funding to the VA =96 all in an effort to dig dee=
per into the Koch bank and throw aside the concern for caring for our natio=
n=92s vets.



But caring for our nation=92s veterans goes beyond funding as well.



Until Marco Rubio is willing to say that he will not support Trump if he be=
comes their nominee, then he is clearly playing political games and isn=92t=
 serious about defeating extremists and caring for our soldiers. His attemp=
t to try to distance himself from Trump=92s un-American proposal to ban Mus=
lims from the United States is laughable, seeing as they =96 along with par=
ty leadership =96 have refused to stand up to him, and are echoing his xeno=
phobia.

=85



No veteran should have to worry about our national security, health care, h=
omelessness, or unemployment. Taking care of our brothers and sisters in un=
iform who have selflessly served our country must be a priority =96 before =
and after service.
