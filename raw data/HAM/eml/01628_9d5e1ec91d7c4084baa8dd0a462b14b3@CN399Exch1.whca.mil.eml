Jordan- just got approval from counsel!=20

Counsel will need to review and approve the invite and any other materials =
with her name on it.  Her name should not be on the same page as anything a=
sking for donations (including lists of prices to attend).

Once you have a more firm idea about timing, I am happy to send you flight =
times that would work. Thanks you! =20
