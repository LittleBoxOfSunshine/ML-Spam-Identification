THE WHITE HOUSE



Office of the Press Secretary



_________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release May 20, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

AFTER MEETING ON ZIKA UPDATE



Oval Office=20





12:04 P.M. EDT





 THE PRESIDENT: I just had an opportunity to get a full briefing from Sec=
retary Burwell, CDC Director Frieden, as well as Tony Fauci from NIH abou=
t the Zika situation, and I want to give the American people an update on=
 where we are.



 As it has been explained repeatedly, but I want to reemphasize, Zika is =
not like Ebola. This is not a human-to-human transmission, with the one e=
xception that we'll talk about. It's primarily transmitted through mosqui=
toes, a very particular type of mosquito. But what we do know is that if =
you contract Zika, even if you don't appear to have significant symptoms,=
 it is possible for Zika to cause significant birth defects, including mi=
crocephaly, where the skull casing -- the head of the infant is significa=
ntly smaller. We think that there may be other neurological disorders tha=
t are caused as a consequence of Zika, and we don't know all of the poten=
tial effects. We do know that they are serious.=20



 Right now, what we've seen is a little over 500 cases of Zika in the con=
tinental United States, and they all appear to be travel related, not mos=
quito-transmitted, meaning somebody from the U.S. went down to an area th=
at has Zika, got a bite, came back. We have seen at least 10 cases in whi=
ch a individual went to one of these areas, got infected, and then sexual=
ly transmitted Zika to their partner.=20



A more significant, immediate concern is Puerto Rico, where we know that =
there are over 800 cases that have been diagnosed. However, we suspect th=
at it could be significantly higher. The reason is, is that for most peop=
le, you may not have a lot of symptoms when you get Zika. If you are not =
pregnant, or the partner of somebody who is pregnant or trying to get pre=
gnant, then you may not even know that you end up having Zika. And that m=
eans that people oftentimes are not affirmatively going to the doctor and=
 getting tested on these issues.



Now, heres the good news, is that because of the good work that's been do=
ne by the Department of Health and Human Services, by the CDC, as well as=
 NIH, we have put forward a plan -- we've got a plan over the next severa=
l months to begin developing a vaccine and to continually improve our dia=
gnostic tests. We're also working with all the states so that theyre prop=
erly prepared if we start seeing an outbreak here in the primary United S=
tates during the summer when obviously mosquitoes are more active.



And what we're also trying to do is to develop new tools for vector contr=
ol, meaning how do we kill mosquitoes and reduce their populations, parti=
cularly this kind of mosquito. That's a tricky piece of business because =
we've been using a lot of insecticides for a long time that have become l=
ess and less effective. New strains of mosquitoes become resistant to the=
 insecticides that we have. The methods we use aren't as effective as the=
y used to be. And so we're also investing a lot of time, research, logist=
ical support to states and local communities to start improving our abili=
ty to control mosquitoes.



Puerto Rico is more urgent, and some of the territories, but we're also s=
pending time working with the states so that they can be better prepared.=




All of this work costs money. And we have put forward a package that cost=
s $1.9 billion in emergency funding in order for us to make sure that we =
are doing effective mosquito control, to make sure that we are developing=
 effective diagnostic tools and distributing them, make sure that we are =
developing the vaccines that ultimately will prevent some of the tragedie=
s that we've seen for those who have contracted Zika and then end up havi=
ng children with significant birth defects.



And we didnt just choose the $1.9 billion from the top of our heads. This=
 was based on public health assessments of all the work that needs to be =
done. And to the extent that we want to be able to feel safe and secure, =
and families who are of childbearing years want to feel as if they can ha=
ve confidence that when they travel, when they want to start a family tha=
t this is not an issue -- to the extent that that's something that we thi=
nk is important, then this is a pretty modest investment for us to get th=
ose assurances.=20



Unfortunately, what we have right now is the Senate approving a package t=
hat would fund a little over half of whats been requested. The House so f=
ar has approved about a third of the money that's been requested -- excep=
t that money is taken from the fund that we're currently using to continu=
e to monitor and fight against Ebola. So, effectively, theres no new mone=
y there; all that the House has done is said, you can rob Peter to pay Pa=
ul. And given that I have, at least, pretty vivid memories of how concern=
ed people were about Ebola, the notion that we would stop monitoring as e=
ffectively and dealing with Ebola in order to deal with Zika doesnt make =
a lot of sense. And I don't think it will make a lot of sense to the Amer=
ican people.



So heres the upshot. This is something that is solvable. It is not someth=
ing that we have to panic about, but it is something we have to take seri=
ously. And if we make a modest investment on the front end, then this is =
going to be a problem that we don't have to deal with on the back end.=20=




Every child that has something like microcephaly, that may end up costing=
 up to $10 million over the lifetime of that child in terms of that famil=
y providing that child the support that they need. That sets aside the pa=
in and the sorrow and the challenges that theyre going to go through. Add=
 that up. It doesnt take a lot of cases for you to get to $1.9 billion. W=
hy wouldn't we want to make that investment now?=20



So my hope was that we would have had a bill that I could sign now, becau=
se part of what we're trying to do is to accelerate, get the process goin=
g for vaccines. You don't get a vaccine overnight. Initially, you have to=
 test it to make sure that any potential vaccine is safe. Then you have t=
o test to make sure that it's effective. You have to conduct trials where=
 you're testing it on a large enough bunch of people that you can make sc=
ientific determinations that it's effective.=20



So we've got to get moving. And what essentially NIH and CDC have been do=
ing is taking pots of money from other things -- universal flu funds or E=
bola funds or other funds -- just to get the thing rolling. But we have t=
o reimburse those pots of money that have already been depleted and we ha=
ve to be able to sustain the work thats going to need to be done to finis=
h the job.



So bottom line is Congress needs to get me a bill. It needs to get me a b=
ill that has sufficient funds to do the job. They should not be going off=
 on recess before this is done. And certainly this has to get done over t=
he course of the next several weeks in order for us to be able to provide=
 confidence to the American people that we're handling this piece of busi=
ness.



If I'm a young family right now, or somebody whos thinking about starting=
 a family, this is just a piece of insurance that I want to purchase. And=
 I think that's true for most Americans. And understand that this is not =
something where we can build a wall to prevent -- mosquitoes don't go thr=
ough Customs. To the extent that we're not handling this thing on the fro=
nt end, we're going to have bigger problems on the back end.



So, for those of you who are listening, tell your members of Congress, ge=
t on the job on this. This is something we can handle. We should have con=
fidence in our ability to take care of it. We've got outstanding scientis=
ts and researchers who are in the process of getting this done, but theyv=
e got to have the support from the public in order for us to accomplish o=
ur goal.



Okay. Thank you very much, everybody.

;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it has been explained repea=
tedly, but I want to reemphasize, Zika is not like Ebola.&nbsp; This is not=
 a human-to-human transmission, with the one exception that we'll talk
 about. It's primarily transmitted through mosquitoes, a very particular ty=
pe of mosquito.&nbsp; But what we do know is that if you contract Zika, eve=
n if you don't appear to have significant symptoms, it is possible for Zika=
 to cause significant birth defects,
 including microcephaly, where the skull casing -- the head of the infant i=
s significantly smaller.&nbsp; We think that there may be other neurologica=
l disorders that are caused as a consequence of Zika, and we don't know all=
 of the potential effects.&nbsp; We do know
 that they are serious.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now, what we've seen is =
a little over 500 cases of Zika in the continental United States, and they =
all appear to be travel related, not mosquito-transmitted, meaning
 somebody from the U.S. went down to an area that has Zika, got a bite, cam=
e back.&nbsp; We have seen at least 10 cases in which a individual went to =
one of these areas, got infected, and then sexually transmitted Zika to the=
ir partner.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">A more significant, immediate concern is Puerto Rico, w=
here we know that there are over 800 cases that have been diagnosed.&nbsp; =
However, we suspect that it could be significantly
 higher.&nbsp; The reason is, is that for most people, you may not have a l=
ot of symptoms when you get Zika.&nbsp; If you are not pregnant, or the par=
tner of somebody who is pregnant or trying to get pregnant, then you may no=
t even know that you end up having Zika.&nbsp;
 And that means that people oftentimes are not affirmatively going to the d=
octor and getting tested on these issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">Now, here&#8217;s the good news, is that because of the=
 good work that's been done by the Department of Health and Human Services,=
 by the CDC, as well as NIH, we have put forward a plan
 -- we've got a plan over the next several months to begin developing a vac=
cine and to continually improve our diagnostic tests.&nbsp; We're also work=
ing with all the states so that they&#8217;re properly prepared if we start=
 seeing an outbreak here in the primary United
 States during the summer when obviously mosquitoes are more active.<o:p></=
o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">And what we're also trying to do is to develop new tool=
s for vector control, meaning how do we kill mosquitoes and reduce their po=
pulations, particularly this kind of mosquito.&nbsp;
 That's a tricky piece of business because we've been using a lot of insect=
icides for a long time that have become less and less effective.&nbsp; New =
strains of mosquitoes become resistant to the insecticides that we have.&nb=
sp; The methods we use aren't as effective
 as they used to be.&nbsp; And so we're also investing a lot of time, resea=
rch, logistical support to states and local communities to start improving =
our ability to control mosquitoes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">Puerto Rico is more urgent, and some of the territories=
, but we're also spending time working with the states so that they can be =
better prepared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">All of this work costs money.&nbsp; And we have put for=
ward a package that costs $1.9 billion in emergency funding in order for us=
 to make sure that we are doing effective mosquito
 control, to make sure that we are developing effective diagnostic tools an=
d distributing them, make sure that we are developing the vaccines that ult=
imately will prevent some of the tragedies that we've seen for those who ha=
ve contracted Zika and then end
 up having children with significant birth defects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">And we didn&#8217;t just choose the $1.9 billion from t=
he top of our heads.&nbsp; This was based on public health assessments of a=
ll the work that needs to be done.&nbsp; And to the extent that
 we want to be able to feel safe and secure, and families who are of childb=
earing years want to feel as if they can have confidence that when they tra=
vel, when they want to start a family that this is not an issue -- to the e=
xtent that that's something that
 we think is important, then this is a pretty modest investment for us to g=
et those assurances.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">Unfortunately, what we have right now is the Senate app=
roving a package that would fund a little over half of what&#8217;s been re=
quested.&nbsp; The House so far has approved about a third
 of the money that's been requested -- except that money is taken from the =
fund that we're currently using to continue to monitor and fight against Eb=
ola.&nbsp; So, effectively, there&#8217;s no new money there; all that the =
House has done is said, you can rob Peter to
 pay Paul.&nbsp; And given that I have, at least, pretty vivid memories of =
how concerned people were about Ebola, the notion that we would stop monito=
ring as effectively and dealing with Ebola in order to deal with Zika doesn=
&#8217;t make a lot of sense.&nbsp; And I don't
 think it will make a lot of sense to the American people.<o:p></o:p></span=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">So here&#8217;s the upshot.&nbsp; This is something tha=
t is solvable.&nbsp; It is not something that we have to panic about, but i=
t is something we have to take seriously.&nbsp; And if we make a modest
 investment on the front end, then this is going to be a problem that we do=
n't have to deal with on the back end.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">Every child that has something like microcephaly, that =
may end up costing up to $10 million over the lifetime of that child in ter=
ms of that family providing that child the support
 that they need.&nbsp; That sets aside the pain and the sorrow and the chal=
lenges that they&#8217;re going to go through.&nbsp; Add that up.&nbsp; It =
doesn&#8217;t take a lot of cases for you to get to $1.9 billion.&nbsp; Why=
 wouldn't we want to make that investment now?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">So my hope was that we would have had a bill that I cou=
ld sign now, because part of what we're trying to do is to accelerate, get =
the process going for vaccines.&nbsp; You don't get
 a vaccine overnight.&nbsp; Initially, you have to test it to make sure tha=
t any potential vaccine is safe.&nbsp; Then you have to test to make sure t=
hat it's effective.&nbsp; You have to conduct trials where you're testing i=
t on a large enough bunch of people that you can
 make scientific determinations that it's effective.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></spa=
n></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">So we've got to get moving.&nbsp; And what essentially =
NIH and CDC have been doing is taking pots of money from other things -- un=
iversal flu funds or Ebola funds or other funds --
 just to get the thing rolling.&nbsp; But we have to reimburse those pots o=
f money that have already been depleted and we have to be able to sustain t=
he work that&#8217;s going to need to be done to finish the job.<o:p></o:p>=
</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">So bottom line is Congress needs to get me a bill.&nbsp=
; It needs to get me a bill that has sufficient funds to do the job.&nbsp; =
They should not be going off on recess before this is done.&nbsp;
 And certainly this has to get done over the course of the next several wee=
ks in order for us to be able to provide confidence to the American people =
that we're handling this piece of business.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">If I'm a young family right now, or somebody who&#8217;=
s thinking about starting a family, this is just a piece of insurance that =
I want to purchase.&nbsp; And I think that's true for most
 Americans.&nbsp; And understand that this is not something where we can bu=
ild a wall to prevent -- mosquitoes don't go through Customs.&nbsp; To the =
extent that we're not handling this thing on the front end, we're going to =
have bigger problems on the back end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">So, for those of you who are listening, tell your membe=
rs of Congress, get on the job on this.&nbsp; This is something we can hand=
le.&nbsp; We should have confidence in our ability to take
 care of it.&nbsp; We've got outstanding scientists and researchers who are=
 in the process of getting this done, but they&#8217;ve got to have the sup=
port from the public in order for us to accomplish our goal.<o:p></o:p></sp=
