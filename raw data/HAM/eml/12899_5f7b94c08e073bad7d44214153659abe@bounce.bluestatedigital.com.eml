		<span style=3D"font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;">BY JESSE=
 JACKSON</span><br><span style=3D"font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;">April 26=
, 2016</span></p>
	<div>
		<p>
			Chicago is a city on edge. Last weekend, 20 people were shot over 13 hou=
rs. According to the Chicago Tribune, 1,051 have been shot this year alone,=
 through April 25. One hundred seventy-eight have been killed, more than on=
e each day. And while shootings take place across the city, they are concen=
trated in neighborhoods scarred by deep poverty.</p>
		<p>
			At the same time, relations between these most endangered communities an=
d the Chicago Police Department have been fractured. As Mayor Rahm Emanuel=
=E2=80=99s own Police Accountability Task Force reported, =E2=80=9CCPD=E2=
=80=99s own data gives validity to the widely held belief the police have n=
o regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color.=E2=80=
=9D It concluded, =E2=80=9CThe community=E2=80=99s lack of trust in the CPD=
 is justified.=E2=80=9D The task force detailed over 100 recommendations fo=
r fundamental reform.</p>
		<p>
			These realities cannot be ignored. Without fundamental reform, the CPD w=
ill continue to brutalize too many of the people it is pledged to defend. A=
nd without a serious initiative to deal with impoverished communities, the =
CPD will remain in an impossible position, that of an occupying force tryin=
g to keep the peace in communities of deepening misery.</p>
		<p>
			The mayor just released what he calls his =E2=80=9Cdown payment=E2=80=9D=
 on the reforms in a five-page memo. It claims to adopt one-third of the ta=
sk force recommendations. But this is more spin than substance. The mayor=
=E2=80=99s office takes credit for reforms that it claims to be =E2=80=9Cin=
 process of designing and developing=E2=80=9D or that it has begun to revie=
w. It offers tiny steps when giant strides are needed.</p>
		<p>
			Among other measures, the task force called for basic structural reforms=
. First, it recommended the creation of a =E2=80=9Cdedicated inspector gene=
ral for public safety,=E2=80=9D located in the city inspector general=E2=80=
=99s office, which would =E2=80=9Cindependently audit and monitor CPD and t=
he police oversight system, including for patterns of racial bias.=E2=80=9D=
</p>
		<p>
			It further called for abolishing the Independent Police Review Authority=
, which it deemed neither independent nor effective. It called instead for =
a =E2=80=9Cfully transparent and accountable Civilian Police Investigative =
Agency=E2=80=9D whose head would be selected by a community board, not the =
mayor.</p>
		<p>
			Finally, it advocated rewriting the city=E2=80=99s contracts with police=
 unions. Collective bargaining agreements, the task force concluded, =E2=80=
=9Ccreate unnecessary barriers to identifying and addressing police miscond=
uct=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Chave essentially turned the code of silence into =
official policy.=E2=80=9D</p>
		<p>
			Emanuel has addressed none of these reforms. Nor has he provided any hin=
t of a bold effort to address Chicago=E2=80=99s distress. He=E2=80=99s sugg=
ested he may wait for the conclusion of the Department of Justice review th=
at may take a year or more. This appears to be a strategy of delay, waiting=
 for attention to wane. But Chicago=E2=80=99s distress will get worse, not =
better.</p>
		<p>
			Perhaps the City Council will step up to provide the leadership needed. =
Two ordinances have been introduced, with dozens of cosponsors, that would =
create an independent police auditor with civilian oversight along the line=
s suggested by the task force.</p>
		<p>
			Emanuel=E2=80=99s response to the report doesn=E2=80=99t approach what i=
s needed. He should not only be championing the task force recommendations;=
 he also should be leading an effort at the national, state and local level=
 for a major initiative on deeply impoverished neighborhoods in Chicago and=
 other major cities.</p>
		<p>
			Youth unemployment is at destructive levels. Schools are underfunded and=
 undersupplied. Good jobs are scarce; guns and drugs are readily available.=
 The police need reform. But even a reformed department will have trouble k=
eeping the peace and providing security in neighborhoods deprived of hope. =
It is time for bold leadership, not foot-dragging and delay. The mayor has =
used his national profile to lure investment in Chicago=E2=80=99s business =
districts. Now he should use that energy and visibility to address Chicago=
=E2=80=99s neglected neighborhoods. That begins with real reform of the pol=
ice, but it does not end there.</p>
