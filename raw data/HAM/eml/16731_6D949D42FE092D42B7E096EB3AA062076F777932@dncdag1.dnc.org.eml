Oh my gosh! Not a problem at all! I'm sorry I've been incommunicado today. 

The lack of sleeping caught up with me and I've had a hard time catching up on email today and was running around catching up with PAC stuff today. 

The long and the short of JK's rant was that we're looking at June 8th as the day we'll be talking to our counterparts a bit more. It's the day after California and we'll likely see a bit more movement. Our convention packages are going to be honored and reflected in what they offer. 

You should have received the finance_d blasts on events--Miami is June 3rd; NYC is June 8th. I believe they're both reception/dinner get ups but there may be slight differences. 

Yesterday went well. Kaplan had a last minute change of heart on the Stetson family photo line and made it happen. Jane was sniffing around for someone to blame for why it was going to take so long and I made sure she knew that you were advocating on her behalf the entire time and that the issue was purely logistics and making sure we were fair about the President's time. So we'll see! 

Q&A went well, very foreign affairs focused. Dick got two questions in and Bill Eacho was very pleased with his seat. He seemed very open to the idea of doing something for us in the future, too. 

Thank you again for your help on this one! We raised a good chunk of change which was nice for a change (sorry for the pun, I had to). 


So looks like we're on the up and up!
