Hey Tema,

  The Joint Fundraising report should be better. Shomik was able to fix it.



The google sheet: I have an idea about, but not sure how it will all work t=
ogether.

Hey,

  I'm alive! I promise! I've been in and out for the last three weeks (thre=
e straight weekends of travel), but I'm back and not traveling soon.



I had Shomik look into the report; I should have an answer soon.



As for the google sheet, I'll take a look. That sounds really frustrating. =
I'm not sure the best way for a fix, but I'll figure something out.



I'll take a look today, and have an update later today.

Hi Matt!



I have two quick questions for you. The NFC sheet stopped overwriting the P=
ackage column for a few days, which was great, but now it=92s back to overw=
riting it. Is it possible to leave it alone so we don=92t have to update th=
e formulas each day?



And I was looking at the latest transfer in toolbox, but it only shows one =
person=92s contribution from HVF instead of the $2.3 million on April 1st a=
nd $305,000 on April 11th. Will that update soon? I=92m hoping to get thing=
s set for regular reports for the department.



Thanks!
