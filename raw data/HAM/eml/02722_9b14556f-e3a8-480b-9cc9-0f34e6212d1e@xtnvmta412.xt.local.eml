By Natasha Korecki (nkorecki@politico.com; @natashakorecki) with Manuela Tobias (mtobias@politico.com; @manuelatobiasm)  

Good Tuesday morning, Illinois. In this unceasing state budget fight, Dems (and a former Republican governor) have long accused Gov. Bruce Rauner of holding the budget hostage until the Legislature approved his pro-business, anti-union agenda. 

Now Rauner has gone on tour accusing Democrats of plotting to hold hostage K-12 schools by demanding an immediate overhaul to the state's school funding system. Last year, schools opened on time despite a budget stalemate because the Democratic-controlled Legislature gave Rauner a separate education spending plan that he signed. He vetoed the rest of the budget. This session, Rauner says Democrats are scheming to keep schools from opening in the Fall by demanding an immediate education funding formula overhaul that the governor calls a "bailout" for Chicago schools. 

Not in Madigan's playbook: But a high-level Democrat close to House Speaker Mike Madigan tells Illinois Playbook the speaker has no desire or intention of delaying school openings in the fall. The discussion over a funding formula overhaul timed for this session has largely played out in the Illinois Senate. The source says Madigan believes the strategy of attempting to leverage school openings in order to pass a full state budget is a losing gambit, saying it could be viewed as placing the interest of children on equal footing with even the most mundane of spending. 

So what's the most likely legislative budget scenario? Similar to last year: Lawmakers are required to put forward a budget and it's likely be a Democratic plan (surprise!). Rauner will have the option to veto it in its entirety as he did in 2015 (with the exception of K-12) or use reduction veto power to fund certain services that suffered over the last year like higher ed, social services, rape crisis centers, senior services, etc. It's unclear how Chicago schools would fare in such a scenario, however. That's something Senate Pres. John Cullerton sought to address in his formula change push. 

WRONG TO HOLD SCHOOLS 'HOSTAGE' -- "Rauner: Dems Holding School Budget Hostage," by WLS-AM News' Bill Cameron: "Rauner is now claiming the Democrats are holding the state school budget hostage. 'They're screaming and saying it's got to change this year and it can't go further and they've threatened to hold up school funding and school opening in the fall for a new school funding formula,' Rauner said. 'That's wrong. Our schools should not be held hostage.' ... Absent from his negotiating points was Rauner's willingness to raise the state income tax to achieve a grand compromise." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab8922785e00b03e362b625a419ceac5bd96fd2900c131bc2966b 

GIVE IT TO ME CLEAN -- "Rauner renews push for 'clean' school funding bill; Democrats back overhaul," Lee Enterprises' Dan Petrella: "Gov. Bruce Rauner is renewing his call for a 'clean' bill to fund elementary and secondary education next school year ... The governor has said he supports changing the way the state distributes money to school districts, but he wants to fully fund the current formula while lawmakers continue to work on those changes. If lawmakers approve his plan, it'd mark the first time in seven years that districts would receive the whole amount state law says they should." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892552961aa802abb3591522196a8466e4e67a1e4624ae772c5 

VIDEO HERE: "Rauner: Democrats could delay school openings to bail out Chicago schools," by Daily Herald's Mick Zawislak: "'We cannot let the General Assembly hold up school funding, hold up our schools opening in the fall to get a Chicago schools bailout,' he said. Rauner shared a similar message later Monday morning at Lyons Township High School in LaGrange, adding he wants schools to be fully funded at their per-student 'foundation' levels." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892a8bc448fb492927f9af5c6370442c6387d5f62b2cfe9ae5c 

CULLERTON SAYS RAUNER'S PLAN HURTS SCHOOLS -- Cullerton's response to Rauner on Monday: "Governor Rauner said in his budget speech that no schools should lose funding, and yet more than one-third of the school districts in Illinois lose money under his plan. He would force schools across Illinois to slash services and staff. Some might not be able to open or stay open next year. Chicago schools alone lose $74 million. Governor Rauner's plan cuts funding for schools in East St. Louis and Naperville as well." 

THE QUOTE: A veteran Democratic operative talking about the Rauner era in Springfield: "In the Civil War we had a budget. In the first War World we had a budget. In the Great Depression we had a budget. In the second World War we had a budget. 18 months ago we had a budget. We don't have a budget now. What's the only difference?"

RAHM EMANUEL PICKETED OUTSIDE FUNDRAISER -- "Chicago Housing, Police Accountability Advocates Picket Emanuel Fundraiser Over CHA Practices," by Progress Illinois' Aricka Flowers: "Police accountability and housing activists are pushing back against city government as Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel attempts to replenish his campaign coffers at his first fundraiser since the Laquan McDonald shooting video was released. The activists are picketing at Emanuel's pricey Monday night fundraiser, which costs individuals $5,400 while corporations are required to cough up $10,000. The event is being held at the home of real estate developer Robert Winslow ... 

"Affordable housing advocates are calling on the mayor to make 'substantive reforms' to the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA), including a complete overhaul of the agency's policies ... The Chicago Housing Initiative ... blasting the agency for reportedly hoarding about 6,000 housing vouchers and 2,800 vacant units while more than 120,000 needy families sit idle on the agency's waitlist." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab89245fae0032105f0ad424b707d4492fdb4271ba8cb47b51196 

DISTRICT 211 TRANSGENDER BATTLE GETS ACLU -- First look: The ACLU of Illinois is moving to intervene in a lawsuit filed last week against school District 211, the Dept. of Justice and the U.S. Dept. of Education that seeks to reverse a decision allowing a transgender student limited access to a female locker room. 

The ACLU plans to announce later today its intended involvement in this latest round of the ongoing fight. From ACLU's Director of Communications and Public Policy Edwin Yohnka: "Since the lawsuit and public announcement of the filing, we have been in regular contact with our client, Student A, and her family. We have spoken out through the media regularly to point out the factual misstatements and hurtful personal attacks made against our client ... parents and students from District 211 have ... expressed anger at the misstatements and factual inaccuracies advanced by those filing the lawsuit last week. More have voiced concern about any effort to reverse policies that treat all students,
 including those who are transgender, in a fair and equitable way ... 

"We believe that these voices from the school district deserve to be heard as part of this process. In the coming days, the ACLU will file a motion with the court to intervene in the proceedings to represent a group of parents and students from District 211, as well as others. We look forward to working vigorously to defeat this attempt to turn back the clock and re-install discrimination in the District 211 schools. We remain confident that fairness for students who are transgender will prevail." 

CITY VIOLENCE  

JUST WHEN IT WAS LOOKING BETTER -- "8 Killed, 46 Wounded In Deadliest Weekend Since September 2015," by DNAinfo's Alex Nitkin: "Shootings around the city left eight people dead and another 46 wounded between Friday morning and Monday morning, police said, making it Chicago's most violent weekend in nearly eight months, police said. Three people were gunned down, including a 16-year-old boy, and another three were hurt in shootings during the day Sunday, police said. Between late Saturday and early Sunday, police said, another three men were killed and 15 were wounded, including a man who was shot dead while sitting at his kitchen table." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892918e90b680c24f0b9e07d1dd704306319edbecad5cbade86 
 
SHOT DEAD AT KITCHEN TABLE -- "Bullet through door kills Southwest Side man at his kitchen table," by Chicago Sun-Times: "A man was shot to death Saturday while he was sitting at his kitchen table in the Archer Heights neighborhood on the Southwest Side. Andres Rivera, 58, was eating at his kitchen table just after 8 p.m. in the 5200 block of South Kolin when shots fired from the street tore through the front door and struck him in the head ... Rivera, who lived in the home, was pronounced dead at the scene at 8:36 p.m." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab89282e2ed7a68cfa51bd27bea0adecd54c4e76aa33d162ba03a 

 POLICE-INVOLVED FATAL SHOOTING -- "Bank Robbery Suspect Fatally Shot By Chicago Police In Archer Heights," CBS: "A suspect was fatally shot by Chicago Police following a bank robbery Monday morning in the Southwest Side Archer Heights neighborhood. The officer-involved shooting happened in the 4900 block of South Karlov after a bank robbery, according to Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892938a5b1c63b448bb91f16107c8d8d4342782ed2b06528ec9 

 
 CITY 

JON STEWART CALLS TRUMP 'MAN-BABY' -- "Jon Stewart may no longer be hosting his show known for biting takedowns of political figures, but that didn't stop him Monday from going on an epic rant against Donald Trump. The former "Daily Show" host told David Axelrod at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics that he isn't even sure the presumptive Republican nominee is eligible for the presidency. 'I'm not a constitutional scholar, so I can't necessarily say, but are you eligible to run if you are a man-baby, or a baby-man?' Stewart said during a taping of Axelrod's podcast 'The Axe Files.' "He has the physical countenance of a man and a baby's temperament and hands."

HOW TAXES WORK IN THE 'BURBS -- "Should 'affluent' neighborhoods pay extra tax for schools?" by Crain's Greg Hinz: "Those who live in 'affluent' neighborhoods-especially those located near a good high school-would pay an extra $100 million in property taxes to help avoid school cuts in poorer areas under a plan being pitched by the Chicago Teachers Union. The additional property tax is tucked into a larger $500 million proposal released last week by the union to help schools gain more in local funds at a time when the possibility of additional state aid seems to be balled up in Springfield politics. The proposal for a sort of reverse tax increment financing district so far hasn't received
 much notice. But CTU allies such as Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 35th, vowed to push it hard at City Hall. And as it starts to be better known, it's already sparking pretty strong blowback from some of Ramirez-Rosa's colleagues." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab89254acf862a2d546f38598a0eb8fb8a010fee067eb67d4d170 

DEEP DIVE INTO CHICAGO'S BLACK MIDDLE CLASS -- "In Kenwood, black picket fences," by The Chicago Reporter's Deborah L. Shelton: "When Bill Lowry learned that 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton had been shot to death near his home, he was working in his corner office at a law firm in Chicago's financial district ... Her death, steps from the Lowry family's elegant two-story home - not far from the Obama's house - would have been unthinkable in Mayor Rahm Emanuel's North Side neighborhood of Ravenswood. But it is not in Kenwood, a predominantly African-American community on the city's South Side ... 

"The Kenwood community area is 68 percent African-American. One in three residents has an advanced degree, and one in six lives below the federal poverty line ... While some middle-class African-Americans like the Lowrys benefit from living in neighborhoods like Kenwood, with its tree-lined streets, striking architecture, short commute to downtown, less costly housing and a connection to the history and cultural legacy of the Great Migration, they also pay a price. Their homes have less value than those in comparable white neighborhoods. They live in close proximity to poverty. They sometimes go home to gunfire." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892dffbbf69b884305e27ea4615a9b0478e886c6d4c8175dad1 

 DECLINE BY DESIGN -- "Chicago on pace to have fewest drug arrests since Nixon era," by Chicago Sun-Times' Mick Dumke and Frank Main: "In 2015, total drug-related arrests dropped to the lowest level in three decades, a Chicago Sun-Times analysis of city crime data found. And the rate of drug busts plunged more sharply in the first four months of 2016. Chicago Police are on pace to make 13,000 narcotics arrests by year's end. That would be the smallest annual tally since 1973, two years after President Richard Nixon declared a national war on drugs." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab89246ad5f7474d72e636023d8fe34f52bfc246bab5923347e15 

OUSTED PRINCIPAL COULD HEAD PRINCIPAL GROUP -- "The politics at stake in the principals' association election," by The Reader's Ben Joravsky: "It's time for a brief primer on the heated election for the presidency of an organization that until recently you probably never heard of-the Chicago Principals and Administrators Association. As you may recall from my last treatise on this topic, the two candidates are Troy LaRaviere, the ousted principal of Blaine Elementary School, and Ken "Buzz" Hunter, the former principal of Prosser Career Academy. The mayor's school appointees reassigned LaRaviere-a high-profile critic of the mayor's school policies-for several unspecified reasons they may
 someday get around to revealing." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892067cb970177591dbc6d46ffd23db1f41a8fb0dc01e328035 

GRIFFIN HQ SITE OF PICKETING, ARRESTS -- "Photos: 19 Arrested At Moral Monday Demonstration In The Loop," the Chicagoist: "At least 19 demonstrators were arrested Monday afternoon for shutting down the lobby of Citadel, LLC, a hedge fund management company run by Illinois richest man and top donor to Gov. Bruce Rauner, Ken Griffin. The activists used lockboxes made of PVC pipe wrapped around their arms to shut down the elevator banks leading to the hedge fund, according to organizers, while others blocked access to the lobby by wedging themselves inside the revolving doors as hundreds of supporters looked on. The demonstration was the first 'Moral Monday Illinois' protest to take place in
 many months; the protests have a religious theme calling on the wealthy to pay more taxes. Fair Economy Illinois, a coalition of community groups that helped organize the demonstration, says they want the state to adopt a 'People and Planet First Budget' to turn Illinois into a 'promised land.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892011d1ab85b65036947eb624f4576e2a2c6119137a5ef2135 

 
 STATE 

PRESUME NOTHING ON TRUMP -- "Madigan warns Democrats not to 'rest' if Trump is GOP choice," by The Associated Press: "Illinois' top Democrat has warned party faithful not to get lackadaisical because the Republicans are poised to nominate Donald Trump for president. Michael Madigan of Chicago, the Illinois House speaker, closed a meeting with Democratic delegates Monday advising them not to 'rest on your laurels.' Many Democrats are tittering at the presumed nomination of Trump, the New York businessman known for questionable comments about immigrants and his cutting criticism of opponents. They believe top Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders would easily defeat him and
 boost down-ballot Democrats." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab89225af4c436b38e931fba5621bc0d83db27b544cbff84ab5e8 

STUDENTS GRILL RAUNER -- "Lakes High School students quiz Rauner on budget, medical marijuana," by Lake County News-Sun's Emily K. Coleman: "Gov. Bruce Rauner pushed for more education spending as he visited two suburban high schools Monday ... senior Ally Rudolph ... asked Rauner about unpaid bills to state social-service providers, pointing to a lawsuit that was filed last week against Rauner ... 'All our priorities have not been getting paid for years and years and years, and we've got to change that system,' Rauner said ... Rudolph said she felt the answer wasn't much of an answer ... 'He definitely dodged my question.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892331b17095229ae7012628d4910e78ea44814e087872c122b 

STO LAT!-- "Rauner: Poland 1st stop on tour after state reforms accomplished," by Chicago Sun-Times' Mitch Dudek: "If Gov. Bruce Rauner achieves the anti-union, pro-business reforms he has made the hallmark of his administration, he plans to travel the world to promote the state - and the first country he'll visit will be Poland, he said Sunday ... 'The people of America have no greater friends in the world than the people of Poland,' Rauner said." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892ca1c252082794863925b70326220326c1afba6a2472addf6 

'NOWHERE IN AMERICA' ARE PROPERTY TAXES SO HIGH -- "From the Editor's Desk: Illinois property tax system unsustainable," by Northwest Herald: "If you own a home in Illinois, hold your breath when you check the mailbox: It's property tax bill time. This year, my household's property tax bill will increase by $500 ... so my annual tax bill increases this year to more than $7,500, pushing the amount my family will pay in property taxes up to $625 a month. Nowhere in America do people pay this much simply to live where they do. Illinois is now the state with the highest property taxes in the country." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab89265d1aecb35a43992606c2a88a52b76957008c1c8a2897e90 

CHA-CHING -- "Illinois collects another $1.6m from late-vehicle fines," by The Associated Press: "Illinois collected $1.6 million from late-vehicle registration fines in April to more than double its year-to-date haul from the same period last year as residents go without renewal reminders because there's no budget. Last month's fines bring the total this year to $6.5 million. Illinois collected nearly $3 million in fines during the same four-month span last year." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab8929bf7bf1bac0f3ee3ffd6529ab9ab809b11f0db99db36251c 

ACCOUNTABILITY FOR UNTESTED RAPE KITS -- "Bill seeks sexual assault investigation oversight," by The Associated Press: "A bill that's moving through the Illinois General Assembly is aimed at ensuring local police departments properly handle rape investigations. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart worked on the legislation with Democratic state Sen. Bill Cunningham of Chicago after dozens of rape kits were found in the Chicago suburb of Robbins in 2013 that hadn't been sent to the Illinois State Police crime lab for DNA testing." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892fbb466ff82c68167a3c4340d435c4655bb1eea2a140ab9c9 
 
STATE SHOULD LEARN FROM STEM -- "Early education, key part of stem training, getting crushed by budget impasse," by Keith Krutz for Reboot Illinois: "In my shop, we put a premium on creativity and problem-solving. Our tooling, metal-stamping, and mechanical-assembly projects present challenges that require my employees to give their best effort - and I trust them to do so ... We have to handle ... issues quickly and creatively ... to get the job done right ... Illinois needs to take the same tack in approaching workforce development ... One such movement is our increasing shift toward greater demand for employees skilled in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)."

 DIMINISHED POWER A GOOD THING -- "Why no action on progressive income tax rates is a win," by Reboot Illinois' Madeleine Doubek: "Why in the world would anyone give Illinois lawmakers more power to set different tax rates for different people? Why give them the ability to raise those rates and create more of them any time they choose with nothing more than a simple majority of both chambers and a governor's signature? Yes, Illinois needs to forge a budget compromise. Yes, it needs to start testing other ways to get pension debt addressed. Yes, that is going to take tax increases, but no way should we give lawmakers the huge power to set varying rates by majority vote."

PIGGING OUT ON HOG FARMS -- "Illinois hog farm expansion notices already at half of 2015 total," by Belleville News-Democrat: "Hog producers in Illinois have already filed half as many expansion notices with state regulators as they did all of last year. According to the state Department of Agriculture's website, there were 61 intent-to-construct applications filed so far in 2016. There were 122 such applications for the entirety of 2015. Final regulatory say on new Illinois hog farms is with the state Department of Agriculture, which notes there are usually 100 to 120 applications for new and expanded hog operations each year." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab8921358a84615be0f1816d86eb4404c041c65cea89ca44cce07 

 AMERICANS REVEALED -- "Panama Papers include dozens of Americans tied to financial frauds," by The Washington Post's Michael Hudson, Jake Bernstein, Ryan Chittum, Will Fitzgibbon and Catherine Dunn: "Len Gotshalk ... had a history of legal issues by the time he went looking to buy an offshore company in 2010 ... Mossack Fonseca, a Panama-based law firm that specializes in selling offshore companies, initially told Gotshalk that it couldn't do business with him, because of 'negative information' that its researchers had found. Gotshalk persuaded the law firm to reconsider, noting in an email that he had 'held offshore accounts in the past in Europe and Bahamas and Belize' without problems.
 Three months later - on May 21, 2010 - federal prosecutors in Philadelphia unsealed an indictment charging that Gotshalk was a key player in a scheme that used kickbacks and other tactics to inflate the prices of tech-company stocks." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892a9b04c4f39b70ed7a9059e1027d5f118d725b0a2c1d035e4 

ONE CAN SELL ONLY SO MANY STEAKS -- "Trump aides huddle with RNC to plot big-money strategy," by POLITICO's Kenneth P.

 Corey Lewandowski, senior adviser Paul Manafort and political director Rick Wiley, according to the sources." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab8926e456e09df25fcd322a7258cfb858130edd6c01ff71cc2d4 

 SINS OF FACEBOOK -- "Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News," by Gizmodo's Michael Nunez: "Facebook workers routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers from the social network's influential 'trending' news section, according to a former journalist who worked on the project. This individual says that workers prevented stories about the right-wing CPAC gathering, Mitt Romney, Rand Paul, and other conservative topics from appearing in the highly-influential section, even though they were organically trending among the site's users. 

Several former Facebook 'news curators,' as they were known internally, also told Gizmodo that they were instructed to artificially 'inject' selected stories into the trending news module, even if they weren't popular enough to warrant inclusion-or in some cases weren't trending at all. The former curators, all of whom worked as contractors, also said they were directed not to include news about Facebook itself in the trending module." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892472911241e7afd2397a68f91d4d760447cb76ddc524ddc10 

LOLLA LINEUP, HOW TO CHOOSE -- "Lollapalooza 2016 schedule released," by Chicago Tribune's Greg Kot: "July 28: Headliners J. Cole and Lana Del Rey go head-to-head, which sounds like a broad enough stylistic difference not to cause too many headaches. But rock fans will need to decide between the Arcs, a Black Keys side project, and rising U.K. band the 1975. Also not appreciating the overlap between Danny Brown and Yeasayer." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892358d00f51d0815ee3fee171d48e105bba9088ca6a6857e1f

Bruce Rauner of holding the budget hostage until the Legislature approved his pro-business, anti-union agenda.  </p>
<p><b>Now Rauner </b>has <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab89269fda9fd8d82f970ac4834e28d6d061779325e2ead968402" target="_blank">gone on tour</a> accusing Democrats of plotting to hold hostage K-12 schools by demanding an immediate overhaul to the state's school funding system.  Last year, schools opened on time despite a budget stalemate because the Democratic-controlled Legislature gave Rauner a separate education spending plan that he signed. He vetoed the rest of the budget. This session, Rauner says Democrats are scheming to keep schools from opening in the Fall by demanding an immediate education funding formula overhaul that the governor calls a &quot;bailout&quot; for Chicago schools. </p><p>
<b>Not in Madigan's playbook:</b> But a high-level Democrat close to House Speaker Mike Madigan tells Illinois Playbook the speaker has no desire or intention of delaying school openings in the fall. The discussion over a funding formula overhaul timed for this session has largely played out in the Illinois Senate. The source says Madigan believes the strategy of attempting to leverage school openings in order to pass a full state budget is a losing gambit, saying it could be viewed as placing the interest of children on equal footing with even the most mundane of spending. </p><p><b>So what's the most likely legislative budget scenario?
</b> Similar to last year: Lawmakers are required to put forward a budget and it's likely be a Democratic plan (surprise!). Rauner will have the option to veto it in its entirety as he did in 2015 (with the exception of K-12) or use reduction veto power to fund certain services that suffered over the last year like higher ed, social services, rape crisis centers, senior services, etc. It's unclear how Chicago schools would fare in such a scenario, however. That's something Senate Pres. John Cullerton sought to address in his formula change push.  </p><p><b>WRONG TO HOLD SCHOOLS 'HOSTAGE' -- &quot;Rauner: Dems Holding School Budget Hostage,&quot; by WLS-AM News' Bill Cameron: 
</b>&quot;Rauner is now claiming the Democrats are holding the state school budget hostage. 'They're screaming and saying it's got to change this year and it can't go further and they've threatened to hold up school funding and school opening in the fall for a new school funding formula,' Rauner said. 'That's wrong. Our schools should not be held hostage.' ... Absent from his negotiating points was Rauner's willingness to raise the state income tax to achieve a grand compromise.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab8922785e00b03e362b625a419ceac5bd96fd2900c131bc2966b" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1UO24J6</a> </p><p>
<b>GIVE IT TO ME CLEAN -- &quot;Rauner renews push for 'clean' school funding bill; Democrats back overhaul,&quot; Lee Enterprises' Dan Petrella: </b>&quot;Gov. Bruce Rauner is renewing his call for a 'clean' bill to fund elementary and secondary education next school year ... The governor has said he supports changing the way the state distributes money to school districts, but he wants to fully fund the current formula while lawmakers continue to work on those changes. If lawmakers approve his plan, it'd mark the first time in seven years that districts would receive the whole amount state law says they should.&quot;

Rauner shared a similar message later Monday morning at Lyons Township High School in LaGrange, adding he wants schools to be fully funded at their per-student 'foundation' levels.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab892a8bc448fb492927f9af5c6370442c6387d5f62b2cfe9ae5c" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1ZyEiQr</a> </p><p>
<b>CULLERTON SAYS RAUNER'S PLAN HURTS SCHOOLS --  </b>Cullerton's response to Rauner on Monday: &quot;Governor Rauner said in his budget speech that no schools should lose funding, and yet more than one-third of the school districts in Illinois lose money under his plan. He would force schools across Illinois to slash services and staff. Some might not be able to open or stay open next year. Chicago schools alone lose $74 million. Governor Rauner's plan cuts funding for schools in East St. Louis and Naperville as well.&quot; </p><p><b>THE QUOTE: </b><i>A<b> </b>veteran Democratic operative talking about the Rauner era in Springfield:

<b>RAHM EMANUEL PICKETED OUTSIDE FUNDRAISER -- &quot;Chicago Housing, Police Accountability Advocates Picket Emanuel Fundraiser Over CHA Practices,&quot; by Progress Illinois' Aricka Flowers:</b> &quot;Police accountability and housing activists are pushing back against city government as Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel attempts to replenish his campaign coffers at his first fundraiser since the Laquan McDonald shooting video was released. The activists are picketing at Emanuel's pricey Monday night fundraiser, which costs individuals $5,400 while corporations are required to cough up $10,000. The event is being held at the home of real estate developer Robert Winslow ... </p>

We have spoken out through the media regularly to point out the factual misstatements and hurtful personal attacks made against our client ... parents and students from District 211 have ... expressed anger at the misstatements and factual inaccuracies advanced by those filing the lawsuit last week. More have voiced concern about any effort to reverse policies that treat all students, including those who are
 transgender, in a fair and equitable way ...  </p><p><b>&quot;We believe that these voices from the school district</b> deserve to be heard as part of this process. In the coming days, the ACLU will file a motion with the court to intervene in the proceedings to represent a group of parents and students from District 211, as well as others. We look forward to working vigorously to defeat this attempt to turn back the clock and re-install discrimination in the District 211 schools.

</b>Those who live in 'affluent' neighborhoods-especially those located near a good high school-would pay an extra $100 million in property taxes to help avoid school cuts in poorer areas under a plan being pitched by the Chicago Teachers Union. The additional property tax is tucked into a larger $500 million proposal released last week by the union to help schools gain more in local funds at a time when the possibility of additional state aid seems to be balled up in Springfield politics. The proposal for a sort of reverse tax increment financing district so far hasn't received much notice. But CTU allies such as Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 35th, vowed to push it hard at City Hall. And as it
 starts to be better known, it's already sparking pretty strong blowback from some of Ramirez-Rosa's colleagues.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=996952be244ab89254acf862a2d546f38598a0eb8fb8a010fee067eb67d4d170" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1ZyELlD</a> </p><p><b>DEEP DIVE INTO CHICAGO'S BLACK MIDDLE CLASS -- &quot;In Kenwood, black picket fences,&quot; by The Chicago Reporter's Deborah L.

<b>'NOWHERE IN AMERICA' ARE PROPERTY TAXES SO HIGH -- &quot;From the Editor's Desk: Illinois property tax system unsustainable,&quot; by Northwest Herald:</b> &quot;If you own a home in Illinois, hold your breath when you check the mailbox: It's property tax bill time. This year, my household's property tax bill will increase by $500 ... so my annual tax bill increases this year to more than $7,500, pushing the amount my family will pay in property taxes up to $625 a month. Nowhere in America do people pay this much simply to live where they do. Illinois is now the state with the highest property taxes in the country.&quot;
