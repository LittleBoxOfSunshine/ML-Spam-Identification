&quot;Please leave peacefully,&quot; the security officers said. &quot;Plea=

<br>
&quot;If we do not leave, it becomes a big issue,&quot; said one Sanders su=

At one point, Ashley loses the video connection, but audio remains. &quot;I=

can hear this, but there are twenty armed sheriffs here to help them steal =
the election... They're saying leave now or else.&quot;<br>
<br>
After minute nine of the above video, Ashley asks someone what is going on:=
 &quot;We've got 620 viewers here, you have nothing to say?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The guy that is speaking is not a member of the DNC, he is head of se=

 a Democrat,&quot; someone responds. &quot;But the election process, and pl=

 (below) from inside the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas, where arcane secondary r=
ounds of the delegate selection process
 of Nevada's Democratic caucus erupted into chaos Saturday night. Bernie Sa=
nders supporters demanded 64 rejected pro-Sanders delegates listed in a &qu=

electing delegates for the national convention.
<br>
<br>
DNC leaders refused to reconsider their decision not to allow this, adjourn=
ed, and fled the building amid a chorus of boos; leaving
<i>hotel security</i> and local police officers to handle the angry Sanders=
 supporters.<br>
<br>
Earlier in the day, the Sanders camp objected to several of their delegates=
 being

<br>
A member of the rules committee called the act of disallowing votes for pur=

a violation of the spirit of the values of our nation</a>.<br>
<br>
The longest of Ashley's videos is the most consequential, others posted fur=
ther below:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sanders supporters are observed considering a sit-in in Ashley's video, but=
 hotel security forced them out, saying &quot;it is now in the hands of the=
 attorneys.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Please leave peacefully,&quot; the security officers said. &quot;Plea=
se leave, it is not safe here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If we do not leave, it becomes a big issue,&quot; said one Sanders su=
pporter. &quot;I'm not leaving.&quot;<br>
<br>
At one point, Ashley loses the video connection, but audio remains. &quot;I=
 don't know if you can see this,&quot; she says. &quot;I don't know if you =
can hear this, but there are twenty armed sheriffs here to help them steal =
the election... They're saying leave now or else.&quot;<br>
<br>
After minute nine of the above video, Ashley asks someone what is going on:=
 &quot;We've got 620 viewers here, you have nothing to say?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The guy that is speaking is not a member of the DNC, he is head of se=
curity for Paris [hotel]. He says he is a dedicated --I don't know if he is=
 a Democrat,&quot; someone responds. &quot;But the election process, and pl=
ease leave. It is not safe here. And by it is not
 safe here, I expect he means all those sheriffs at the front of the room..=
. They are asking us to 'leave the private property at this time.' This sho=
uld be national news. This needs to be national news.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eventually they <i>shut the lights off</i> to get the Sanders supporters ou=
t.<o:p></o:p></p>
