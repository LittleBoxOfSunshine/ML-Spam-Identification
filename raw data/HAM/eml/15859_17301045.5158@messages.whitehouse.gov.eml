The White House

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release

May 3, 2016



*FACT SHEET: Federal Support for the Flint Water Crisis Response and Reco=
very*



The President and his Administration are committed to doing everything po=
ssible to assist local and state efforts to help the people of Flint in t=
his crisis. At the direction of President Obama, there has been an all-of=
-government response to this crisis: from the over 9 million liters of wa=
ter and 50,000 filters distributed by FEMA, to the expansion of Medicaid,=
 funding for Head Start and local health centers by HHS, to water testing=
 and technical expertise by EPA, and helping to provide help for the loca=
l economy to recover by SBA, HUD and others. The federal government will =
continue to offer expertise and technical assistance to state and local a=
gencies for as long as needed to support in the communitys recovery and r=
esilience.



On January 16, 2016, President Obama issued an emergency declaration for =
the State of Michigan and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and loc=
al response efforts due to the emergency conditions in Flint, Michigan, a=
ffected by contaminated water. The President's action authorized the Fede=
ral Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide water, water filters, w=
ater filter cartridges, water test kits, and other necessary related item=
s; assistance with those commodities has been extended through August 14,=
 2016.=20



Additionally, the President offered assistance in identifying other Feder=
al agency capabilities that could support the recovery effort but do not =
require an emergency declaration. On January 19, the President designated=
 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead Feder=
al agency responsible for coordinating Federal support for response and r=
ecovery efforts in Flint. Dr. Nicole Lurie, the HHS Assistant Secretary f=
or Preparedness and Response and currently the Federal Governments senior=
 response official in Flint, is coordinating the efforts of all the Feder=
al agencies, including: HHS agencies, FEMA, the Environmental Protection =
Agency (EPA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Department of =
Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)=
, the Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Commerce (DOC), and th=
e Department of Education (ED). Federal agencies are providing water and =
filters to the State of Michigan, testing water in Flint residences, and =
supporting health and community outreach.



Federal agencies will continue to offer expertise and technical assistanc=
e to state and local agencies for as long as needed to support the commun=
itys recovery and resilience.

**

*_Ensuring Access to Safe Water_*



Federal officials have worked with state and local partners to improve ac=
cess to bottled water and water filters.=20



 FEMA has provided over 9.3 million liters of water to the state for dist=
ribution, over 50,000 water and pitcher filters, and over 243,000 filter =
replacement cartridges.



 HUD has worked with the Flint Housing Commission to ensure 100% installa=
tion, the future upkeep of water filters in every unit of public housing,=
 and HUDs Federally-assisted and HUD-insured properties.



 In addition, HUD is working with local partners to ensure that seniors a=
nd disabled residents in public housing receive and have continuing acces=
s to clean water.



*_Protecting Health_*



*"_Blood Lead Testing_"*

The Federal Government is working to make blood lead testing available fo=
r Flint residents, especially children under the age of six.=20



 HHS continues to work with healthcare providers and local officials to o=
ffer blood lead testing to as many children and residents as possible.



 To assist with the testing initiative, USDA temporarily authorized blood=
 lead screening at clinics for participants in the Special Supplemental N=
utrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).=20



 HUD is working with a local provider to offer onsite blood lead testing =
for children in public housing.=20



The U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps cleared a backlog of ap=
proximately 800 blood lead level screening results and prepared test resu=
lt notifications for parents and the Michigan Department of Health and Hu=
man Services (MDHHS).



*"_Rash Investigation _"*

EPA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) experts continue=
 to support the states investigation of rashes and other skin concerns af=
fecting Flint residents to help identify potential causes. Lead is not kn=
own to be a skin irritant.=20

__

*"_Services for Children _"*

The HHS Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded Medicaid =
coverage for children and young people up to age 21 and pregnant women in=
 Flint impacted by lead exposure. The Michigan Department of Health and H=
uman Services expects to begin enrollment in May.



 Approximately 15,000 additional children, young people, and pregnant wom=
en will now be eligible for Medicaid coverage, and 30,000 current Medicai=
d beneficiaries in the area are eligible for expanded services.=20



 This comprehensive health and developmental coverage includes blood lead=
 level monitoring, behavioral health services, and targeted case manageme=
nt. Targeted case management services will include assistance to help imp=
acted residents gain access to needed medical, social, educational, and o=
ther services.



HHS provided $250,000 in emergency supplemental funding to both the Hamil=
ton Community Health Network and Genesee Health System to hire new staff =
and provide additional services. In the first 30 days after receiving the=
 funds, the health centers reportedly provided outreach services to more =
than 2,600 patients to help prevent continued lead exposure, tested more =
than 1,600 patients for lead, referred 28 patients with elevated lead lev=
els for follow-up appointments, including 27 patients younger than six ye=
ars old, and provided behavioral health services for almost 450 patients.=




Since February, Federal nurses have assisted Genesee County Health Depart=
ment with enrolling children with elevated blood lead levels into Michiga=
ns Department of Health and Human Services Lead Poisoning Prevention Prog=
ram for case management. Federal nurses from the CDC, the U.S. Public Hea=
lth Service, and the HHS Health Resources and Services Administration hav=
e made 377 homes visits and phone calls to Genesee County families to hel=
p enroll children in the program and provide lead prevention education.=20=




The HHS Administration for Children and Families provided guidance to the=
 state on the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, with the g=
oal of helping families in the program access bottled water, gas cards, a=
nd bus passes to reach water distribution sites or healthcare facilities.=




One-time HHS emergency funding of $3.6 million helped Head Start grantees=
 expand early childhood education, behavioral health services, health ser=
vices, and nutrition services. Grantees have:



 Opened three additional classrooms beginning March 2016 through June 201=
7 for children in the most affected areas. These classes were filled by M=
arch 28.



 Lengthened the current school year by three weeks and lengthened the sch=
ool day from seven hours to seven-and-a-half hours.



 Provided Head Start comprehensive services to preschoolers already enrol=
led in the schools special education program.



 Enrolled two dozen additional children in the home-based model.



An assistant surgeon general with the U.S. Public Health Service Commissi=
oned Corps worked with the mayors office as a health advisor to help deve=
lop health goals for a community recovery plan and to help identify a per=
manent health advisor for the city.



*"_Nutrition_"*

Foods rich in calcium, iron and vitamin C helps mitigate lead absorption =
in children. USDA increased access to these foods by:=20



 Providing summertime nutrition assistance through a Summer Electronic Be=
nefits Transfer pilot program for the more than 15,000 Flint children who=
 live or attend schools in the area affected by lead-contaminated water. =
These students are eligible to receive a $30 benefit package each summer =
month for nutritious foods that may help mitigate lead absorption. Nation=
wide, the pilot program will provide $26.9 million for summertime nutriti=
on assistance this year.



 Encouraging all eligible Flint Community Schools and other Flint-area sc=
hools to participate in the Community Eligibility Provision, a program th=
at ensures universal access to healthy, school meals.=20



 Providing an additional $62,700 to help schools purchase fresh fruit and=
 vegetable snacks. Four additional schools serving more than 1,200 studen=
ts are now participating in this program.



Allowing eligible mothers of non-breastfed infants to use WIC benefits fo=
r ready-to-feed infant formula, which does not need to be mixed with wate=
r.



*"_Behavioral Health_"*

HHS behavioral health teams provided basic psychological first-aid skills=
 training to 183 people. They conducted stress management training with 2=
47 healthcare providers and responders and taught a Train the Trainers fo=
r 32 local providers to enable them to teach basic psychological first-ai=
d training. HHS also sponsored Spanish and English versions of the traini=
ng materials tailored to the Flint water crisis to be shared with the com=
munity.=20



HHS also facilitated development of a long-term mental health recovery an=
d resilience plan in coordination with Genesee Health System and other co=
mmunity partners to help improve the behavioral health system as the comm=
unity recovers. This plan will be implemented by the community with techn=
ical assistance from the HHS Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services A=
dministration.



*_Restoring Flints Water System_*



EPA is conducting water testing to monitor restoration of the citys water=
 system. Results show the system is recovering.



 *Diagnostic Lead Sampling*: EPA is conducting lead sampling upon request=
 and in homes that are identified as being at risk for high lead levels t=
o help determine if lead is coming from the house or the service line. Mo=
st sampling teams are accompanied by community engagement staff to ensure=
 that residents can ask questions and receive plain-language answers abou=
t sampling. EPA has evaluated over 4,500 samples in more than 650 homes a=
nd other properties. These results are available via an interactive map a=
t www.epa.gov/flint [ %3ehttp:/www.epa.gov/flint%3c ]=20



 *Lead and Copper Rule Sampling*: In accordance with the administrative o=
rder that EPA issued to the State of Michigan, EPA reviews Michigans Lead=
 and Copper Rule compliance sampling plans before they are implemented. E=
PA may also collect samples at some of these locations to gather more inf=
ormation about the impact of lead in the water.=20



 *Testing Lead Filters in Homes*: EPA has taken nearly 400 samples of dri=
nking water in approximately 200 homes at residents request and in househ=
olds with known lead levels of 100 parts per billion or higher to test th=
e effectiveness of filters at removing lead at high concentrations. Filte=
rs distributed in response to this water crisis are rated at 150 parts pe=
r billion. EPAs sampling results confirm that the filters are effective i=
n removing lead from drinking water at levels higher than 150 parts per b=
illion. As a precaution, bottled water is still considered the safest opt=
ion for vulnerable populations, including pregnant and breast-feeding wom=
en, infants, and children under six years old whose water tests higher th=
an 150 parts per billion. Everyone else should use filtered water for dri=
nking and cooking. Pets should also drink filtered water.=20



 *Overall Water Quality Testing*: EPA is collecting water samples from lo=
cations throughout Flint to evaluate the levels of fluoride, other compou=
nds, and pH. As part of this assessment, EPA is analyzing the overall sta=
bility of water quality throughout Flints distribution system. EPA is als=
o testing to be sure enough chlorine is in the water. Chlorine is used to=
 disinfect drinking water and prevent the growth of bacteria and other pa=
thogens. At locations where chlorine is low, EPA follows up with addition=
al testing for bacteria.



 *Flush for Flint Initiative*: EPA, the City of Flint, and the State of M=
ichigan launched the Flush for Flint campaign to encourage residents to r=
un water from their kitchen sinks and bathroom tubs for 5 minutes each da=
y for 14 straight days during the month of May. More water flowing will h=
elp flush out additional lead particles in the water system. The State of=
 Michigan is paying for the program and credit will be added to residents=
 water bills.



*_Economic Recovery_*



The Federal Government is providing economic development assistance to he=
lp Flint recover from the crisis and continue to grow its economy.=20



 The U.S. Department of Labor is providing a National Dislocated Worker G=
rant for up to $15 million to assist with humanitarian and recovery effor=
ts resulting from the water crisis in Flint. The $7.5 million released in=
itially is providing temporary employment for eligible individuals to ass=
ist with recovery work, as well as offer career and training services to =
help them find permanent work.



 SBA provided approximately $400,000 in additional funding through a numb=
er of programs, including $100,000 in Microloan capital, an additional $1=
00,000 available for training and technical assistance to Flint entrepren=
eurs, a $100,000 increase in existing technical assistance for small busi=
nesses in the area, and $100,000 in supplemental funding to the Kettering=
 University Small Business Development Center. SBA also approved a state =
request for low-interest disaster loans for small businesses within the g=
reater Flint area.



 The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) determined properties may still=
 qualify for FHA-insured mortgage if the individual water purification sy=
stem meets all Federal, state, and local standards. This helps homebuyers=
 in Flint secure FHA-insured loans.



 HUD allowed $325,000 of an existing lead-paint hazard grant for public h=
ousing in Flint to be applied to this crisis.



 Technical and capacity-building assistance to Flint through the White Ho=
use Strong Cities, Strong Communities (SC2) initiative has been extended =
through 2016. Co-chaired by HUD and the Domestic Policy Council with the =
involvement of 19 federal agencies, this program focuses on economic deve=
lopment in economically distressed communities. Flint has a federal team =
lead embedded in city hall coordinating Federal resources to support the =
city in three core areas: public safety, blight elimination, and economic=
 development.



*"_Connecting the Community to Public Health Resources and Services_"*

 EPA has partnered with local non-profit organizations on a door-to-door =
canvassing effort to educate residents on safeguards they should employ t=
o protect themselves from high lead exposure. To date, EPA has collaborat=
ed with these organizations to reach more than 10,000 homes. In addition,=
 EPA staff have made more than 500 visits to approximately 450 locations =
around Flint to inform and engage residents regarding the federal governm=
ent's response efforts and related resources.



 HUD, the Flint Housing Commission, and more than a dozen local partners =
collaborated on a Lead Testing and Informational pilot outreach event. Mo=
re than 250 public housing residents participated to learn more about the=
 water situation in Flint, lead testing, available health services, and g=
eneral public health information.



*"_Building Capacity through National Service _"*

 The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), which adminis=
ters AmeriCorps, recently announced $1.3 million in new AmeriCorps commit=
ments www.nationalservice.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/national-servi=
ce-agency-announces-13-million-new-americorps-commitments [ http://www.na=
tionalservice.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/national-service-agency-an=
nounces-13-million-new-americorps-commitments ] to support state and loca=
l efforts addressing the water emergency, blight, and public safety in Fl=
int. On May 2, nearly 20 AmeriCorps NCCC members arrived in Flint to supp=
ort water distribution, resource coordination, and blight elimination eff=
orts. CNCS is expanding Operation AmeriCorps to support a total of 55 Ame=
riCorps members in the Flint Community School Corps to provide before, du=
ring, and after-school and summer learning activities for K-7 grade stude=
nts, including tutoring, health education, conflict resolution, service-l=
earning, and access to social services. In total, more than 120 AmeriCorp=
s members and Senior Corps volunteers have been deployed to Flint in resp=
onse to the water crisis.=20
