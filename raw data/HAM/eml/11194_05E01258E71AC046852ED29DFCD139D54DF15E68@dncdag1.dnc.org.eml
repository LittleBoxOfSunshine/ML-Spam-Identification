Today in the fight for a full and functioning Supreme Court: Chief Judge Ga=
rland submits a comprehensive questionnaire to the Senate Judiciary Committ=
ee detailing his decades of qualified experience on and off the bench, form=
er campaign volunteers and supporters of Senator Chuck Grassley visit DC to=
 tell him he has lost their vote over his vacancy obstruction while editori=
al boards continue to urge Senate Republicans to do their jobs and move for=
ward with Chief Judge Garland's nomination.

Chief Judge Garland submits questionnaire to the Senate Judiciary Committee=
, showcasing his distinguished credentials for the Supreme Court vacancy.
Consistent with the practices of previous Supreme Court nominees, Chief Jud=
ge Merrick Garland has submitted a comprehensive questionnaire outlining hi=
s career, including his service as the lead prosecutor of the Oklahoma City=
 bombing case and his nearly twenty years on the federal bench, to the Sena=
te Judiciary Committee. You can read the entire questionnaire HERE<https://=
www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Senate%20Judiciary%20Committee%20Que=
stionnaire%205%209%202016.pdf>.

Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee=
: "[Garland] has done his part, and now it is time for the Senate Judiciary=
 Committee to do its job by promptly reviewing the nominee's record and sch=
eduling a public confirmation hearing. I and my staff have begun reviewing =
Chief Judge Garland's materials, and I expect Committee Republicans to do t=
he same."[Washington Post, 5/10/16<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powe=
rpost/wp/2016/05/10/the-latest-push-to-confirm-merrick-garland-a-141-page-q=
uestionnaire/>]

Iowa voters travel to Washington to tell Sen. Grassley that he has lost the=
ir vote over Supreme Court obstruction.
Today, MoveOn.org Political Action, Americans United for Change, We Need Ni=
ne, and the Constitutional Responsibility Project brought former supporters=
 of Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to meet with the Senator to urge him to do h=
is job and give Chief Judge Garland a hearing and an up-or-down vote. Tomor=
row, these Iowa voters will hold a press conference at 11a.m. with Senator =
Harry Reid on the steps of the Supreme Court to call on Senator Grassley to=
 take action on Chief Judge Garland's nomination.

Dianne Kamp is part of the delegation of former Sen. Grassley supporters in=
 town and shares her story HERE<https://youtu.be/dnypzjcQfkw>.
Dianne R. Kamp, retired from Rockwell Collins after a 31-year career, from =
Marion, Iowa. Kamp said: "Senator Grassley, whom I've supported, is not lis=
tening to the voters who put him in office. President Obama was elected our=
 president, so he has every right to select someone as a Supreme Court nomi=
nee. For Sen. Grassley to refuse to cooperate is appalling to me."
Senate GOP obstruction of Chief Judge Garland's nomination is a "disrespect=
ful dereliction of duty."
The editorial board of the Montgomery Advertiser<http://www.montgomeryadver=
tiser.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/05/08/gop-senators-refuse-do-their-=
jobs/83966310/> urges Alabama voters to demand that Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-=
AL) and Richard Shelby (R-AL) do their job and push for timely Senate actio=
n on Chief Judge Garland's nomination.

"Republican senators, including Alabama's Richard Shelby and Jeff Sessions,=
 immediately began playing politics with the judicial process, saying they =
wouldn't consider any nominee to the high court until a new president takes=
 office in January... The American people have already spoken loudly, twice=
, in electing a Democrat to the White House with a majority of the popular =
vote...obstructionists in the Senate should stop their disrespectful dereli=
ction of duty. Alabama voters should demand Sessions and Shelby push for ti=
mely action on Garland's Supreme Court nomination."

Senate GOP's refusal to fill federal judicial vacancies undermines the publ=
ic's trust.
Senate Republicans' refusal to confirm qualified, noncontroversial nominees=
 to fill vacancies in the federal trial courts is an affront to justice, a =
former U.S. federal district judge writes in the New York Times<http://www.=
nytimes.com/2016/05/07/opinion/americas-trial-court-judges-our-front-line-f=
or-justice.html?action=3Dclick&pgtype=3DHomepage&clickSource=3Dstory-headin=
g&module=3Dopinion-c-col-right-region&region=3Dopinion-c-col-right-region&W=
T.nav=3Dopinion-c-col-right-region&_r=3D1>.

Shira A. Scheundlin, former U.S. district judge for the Southern District o=
f New York: "Even as the spotlight shines on the high court, the Senate has=
 refused to confirm dozens of uncontroversial nominees to fill vacancies in=
 the federal trial courts...the Senate majority's policy of delaying qualif=
ied district-court nominations on purely political grounds undermines publi=
c trust in the impartiality and legitimacy of the judiciary. This is especi=
ally worrisome because the public's understanding of how justice is adminis=
tered is most likely based on its access to and experience with lower court=
 proceedings."

Garland:
