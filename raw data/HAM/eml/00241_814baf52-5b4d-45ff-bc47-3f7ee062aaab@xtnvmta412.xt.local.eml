GAME ON: Billionaire environmentalist and NextGen Climate founder Tom Steyer has kicked off his $25 million dollar outreach campaign - an effort to get out the vote among young people in swing states - ahead of California's state Republican party convention this weekend, reports POLITICO California's Carla Marinucci. As part of the campaign, TV ads featuring GOP candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz will run for all three days of the convention, starting today. Trump and Cruz, as well as Cruz's newly announced running mate Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich will attend this weekend's events in Burlingame, Calif. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2ef0ca45ffc2c8932333e3dbc337b98e5de7a8fc896b2da03e6b51418368657a

BUILDERS: Construction Dive's Kim Slowey reports construction lobbying is on the rise, citing Center for Responsive Politics data that shows the industry spent more than $53 million lobbying in 2015. Jim Tobin, National Association of Home Builders executive vice president and chief lobbyist, said his group has been "extraordinarily busy" because of the Obama administration's "anti-business" policies. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2ef0ca45ffc2c893597dc4fafe9b5d181faba6bde8338e2fc92c7256dffea5b5

ROI: A new analysis from Maplight shows that for every one dollar U.S. government contractors have invested in political influence in the past decade, the industry has received $1,171 in taxpayer money. Maplight's Frank Bass writes that the 25 largest federal contractors have received almost $1.6 trillion during fiscal 2014 for their work since October 2005. Additionally, the Pentagon spends more on contracting than all other federal agencies combined. Lockeed Martin Corp., the country's largest contractor and maker of the F-35 Lightning II jet, received $331 billion in federal money since October 2005, and spent $140 million on lobbying and political contributions between then and
 September 2015. This puts the firm's return at $2,366 for every $1 dollar used for lobbying or political spending. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2ef0ca45ffc2c8931fc4069fca6511468c2f6b6bb6dd76f43df228f8814dee4c
