FYI, this morning on CNN Jeff Weaver was asked about the protests and threats of violence in Nevada. He begins by saying Sanders supporters should "act in a civil way" but then goes on to hit the state party. Here is a transcript:

Jeff Weaver--

... Well, look, the senator has been very clear, people who are supporting the senator should act in a civil way. They should obviously fight within the context, and by fight, I mean contest if there is a convention, they should be there, they should present their case. And then they should let the votes fall where they may. The situation in Nevada is a little bit different. Obviously no context justifies any kinds of threat or violence. But you know, we have been obviously campaigning in Nevada for almost a year, because of, you know, it's one of the early states. The state party there has a lot of problems. They've run things very poorly. It has been done very undemocratically. And there seems to be an unwillingness on the part of the Nevada democratic party to bring in all of the new people that Bernie Sanders has brought into the process. If you read some of the reports from what went on there, the chair was clearly ignoring votes from the floor at the Clark county democratic convention in Nevada. They tried to arrest their own credentials chair, because she was being too fair to the Sanders people. I mean, it is dysfunctional or worse out there in the Nevada state democratic party. Obviously it is not a reflection of all Democrats in Nevada, but the party hierarchy, there's a lot of problems there. I mean they had a convention where they didn't have enough chairs for the number of people who were supposed to be there. Obviously you're trying to exclude people if the room is too small for the anticipated audience. So there is a lot of work to be done. We could have a whole show on the Nevada state democratic party. But regardless -

Chris Cuomo, CNN--

You're making the same case that Trump seems to be making, the system is set up against Sanders, the Democrats are against him, and that he should run for a third party.

Is Trump right?

Jeff Weaver--

No, Trump is wrong. You know, we have interacted with state parties all across the country. And some are more fair than others. Some are, I have to say, some are extremely fair. It just happens in Nevada not to be the case.
