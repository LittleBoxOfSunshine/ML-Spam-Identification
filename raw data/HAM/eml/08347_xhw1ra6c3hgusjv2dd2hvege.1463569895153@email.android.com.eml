I realize that this is a minor online state publication and that this perso=
n is writing their opinion. However, Robert Reich's Facebook post referred =
to in the article perpetuates the same misunderstanding and totally incorre=
ct assertion that Sanders will not be represented on the convention committ=

Not sure how to deal with this because it looks like an opinion piece but m=

DWS Cuts Bernie's Influence Out of the Democratic National Convention
Submitted by Nancy Smith

Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Florida faithful might swear by her fair play to=
ward Bernie Sanders, but the Democratic National Committee chair has shown =
her stripes and is driving a wedge between both factions of the Democratic =
Party, according to a leading Bernie supporter.

Below is a Facebook post on Monday from Robert Reich, former secretary of l=
abor under President Bill Clinton, now devoted to the Bern:
"Apparently Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chair of the Democratic National Comm=
ittee, doesn=92t care if she alienates Bernie followers. The Sanders campai=
gn had been hoping for a significant role at the Democratic convention, but=
 Wasserman Schultz has picked 75 members of the convention=92s key committe=
es -- rules, credentials and platform =96 and accepted only 3 of Bernie=92s=
 choices, failing to acknowledge the proportion of the vote Bernie has won =
in the primaries and caucuses. Negotiations with the DNC have failed to add=
 any additional Bernie picks to any of the standing committees. Worse yet, =
she=92s named as chairs Hillary backers known for their harsh criticism of =
Bernie (among them Barnie Frank, as co-chair of the influential Rules Commi=
ttee).

"This is insider politics run amok, at the very time and in the very electi=
on that insider politics is disdained =96 and at the very moment it=92s vit=
ally important to unite the Democratic Party. How can Debbie Wasserman Schu=
ltz and the DNC be so obtuse?
What do you think?"

If we thought the Nevada Democratic Convention was bad, imagine what will g=
o down at the National Convention with staunch Bernie opponents like Barnie=
 Frank running something as crucial as the rules committee. "The deck is st=
acked against us," says Reich. "What do we plan to do if the National Conve=
ntion ends up as big of a corrupt shit show as Nevada? No way we will be vo=
ting for Hillary and it doesn't even look like we will get influence on the=
 platform ..."
