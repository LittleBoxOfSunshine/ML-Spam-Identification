"The GOP's last hope was the least-liked person in Washington. Now they're left with one of the least liked men in America.

"Called 'Lucifer in the flesh,' and 'the most miserable son of a bitch I've ever worked with' by former House Speaker John Boehner, Ted Cruz has been an obstacle to progress and a rabid ideologue since he emerged on the national stage. As a Senator, he held up emergency aid for a region hit by a devastating hurricane. He engineered a government that cost the U.S. economy $24 billion, all to try to take health care away from Americans who gained it under the Affordable Care Act. He opposed rape and incest exceptions for women seeking abortions. And unfortunately for the country, he still has two years left in the U.S. Senate to do damage.

"With Ted Cruz suspending his campaign this evening, Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee, and Americans should rightly be alarmed. The GOP's presumptive nominee is one of the most dangerous individuals ever to secure the nomination of a major party. His alarming lack of foreign policy knowledge alone is disqualifying, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

"Trump is the candidate the GOP deserves. After years of obstructing progress, elevating extreme voices in their party, coddling the ultra-rich, casting doubt on science, and opposing everything from abortion rights to equal pay to immigration reform, it's not hard to see how the GOP ended up with a xenophobic, misogynistic billionaire blowhard as their party's standard-bearer. And every single down-ballot Republican candidate will have to reckon with Trump as the embodiment of their party."

"Trump may be the Republican's standard-bearer, but a Democrat will be the 45th President of the United States. Never Trump."
