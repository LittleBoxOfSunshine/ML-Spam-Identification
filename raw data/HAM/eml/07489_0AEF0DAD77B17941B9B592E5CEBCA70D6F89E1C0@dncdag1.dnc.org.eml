Donald Trump=92s Week of Playing with Financial Fire<http://www.politico.co=
m/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-debt-comments-213891>


Maybe, if he hasn=92t already seen it, Donald Trump should get himself tick=
ets to the Broadway smash =93Hamilton.=94 Because he may want to understand=
 a little bit about Alexander Hamilton's playbook. One message that Hamilto=
n, the nation=92s first Treasury secretary, was clear about was this: Never=
 do or say anything that might call your country=92s credit into question; =
it will only cost you a lot more the next time you try to borrow. Careless =
talk by itself can badly damage an economy.
That is why as I have seen up close in sensitive economic times=97from the =
Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s to the debt-limit showdown to our =
own financial crisis=97U.S. presidents and top economic officials weigh eve=
ry word on sensitive issues that could affect financial markets with great =
care and precision.
Story Continued Below

Trump, by contrast, has said so many confusing things affecting U.S. credit=
 in the past few days that, were he president, the markets would be reeling=
 right now and interest rates could easily be rising. Absent from his comme=
nts about gaming the debt of the United States was any sense of the economi=
c and historical importance of America maintaining an iron-clad commitment =
to stand by its word on our national debt, without any question. While I am=
 an outside adviser to Hillary Clinton, there was also no shortage of Repub=
licans who were also left wondering how much damage would have been done to=
 the economy and markets if it had been a President Trump, while calling hi=
mself =93the King of Debt,=94 had speculating how he might strategically se=
ek to avoid paying full value on our debt.
Trump has long said that his private-sector wheeling and dealing would be b=
eneficial experience in helping to managing economic policy. But that image=
 was dealt a harsh blow when he told Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC: =93I would=
 borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal. And if t=
he economy was good, it was good, so therefore you can't lose. It=92s like,=
 you know, you make a deal before you go into a poker game.=94
For a nation that has distinguished itself for its 226-year commitment to p=
rotecting its =93Full Faith and Credit,=94 it was stunning to hear the Repu=
blican front-runner use words like =93poker,=94 =93crashed=94 and =93discou=
nt=94 while describing his policies on the national debt. His words gave th=
e widespread impression he is advocating treating the national debt like a =
real estate transaction where if =93the economy crashed=94 and investors fe=
ared that the debt might be worth, for example, only 75 cents on the dollar=
, he would swoop in as a whiz-bang deal maker to buy back our debt at only =
76 cents on the dollar.
Imagine if we were in the middle of another debt limit stalemate like we ha=
d in 2011 (when I was watching from the White House, as director of the Nat=
ional Economic Council) and a President Trump told the world=97or repeated =
to the world=97that since the budget turmoil might be making U.S. debt look=
ed shaky, he was open to buying back debt at a discount and was instructing=
 his secretary of the Treasury to consider such options? What if he then we=
nt on for days confusing markets as to his true intentions while dropping l=
ines about being the =93King of Debt,=94 =93playing poker=94 or =93printing=
 money?=94 Does anyone doubt that even without any congressional action suc=
h Trumpisms could lead to a global panic with unknown economic harm to the =
global economy and the long-term economic reputation of the United States?
What was just as disturbing to a wide cross-section of economic commentator=
s were his attempts to retract, restate or clarify such statements.
When given a chance to withdraw his comments on This Week with George Steph=
anopoulos, he repeatedly passed. When the continued uproar led to his effor=
t to offer clarification and reassurance the next day on CNN and Fox Busine=
ss morning shows it also failed miserably, as several commentators, includi=
ng Politico=92s Ben White, pointed out. His most direct default disclaimer =
did little to disclaim or reassure: =93You never have to default because yo=
u print the money=94 was a line that suggested the candidate seemed to beli=
eve that the U.S. president simply barks out orders to a subservient, nonin=
dependent Federal Reserve.
Furthermore, Trump=92s =93print the money=94 line was bound to sound to glo=
bal investors less like a comment on debt management or monetary stimulus t=
han speculation by a soon-to-be presidential nominee on ways to avoid stand=
ing by our debt, whether through =93hair cuts=94 or the printing press. Eve=
n Trump=92s stated rationale for raising the entire discussion=97the idea o=
f buying back debt paying lower interest rate if interest rates rose=97had =
people scratching their heads. Nowhere in his repeated promotion of this id=
ea is there the recognition that if the United States were to buy such debt=
 with low interest rates when interest rates were higher, it would by defin=
ition mean that we would have to replace the retired debt with borrowing at=
 those same higher interest rates
Why should all this Trump debt, default and discount talk worry us? Conside=
r three reasons:
First, however one interprets the exact meaning from his initial comments t=
o his various attempts to retract or clarify, he has never shown any seriou=
s recognition that generations of Americans have benefited from a historica=
l commitment started by Alexander Hamilton to ensure the full faith and cre=
dit of the U.S. is rock solid. In his 1790 Report on Public Debt, Hamilton =
stated =93every breach =85 whether from choice or necessity, is in differen=
t degrees hurtful to public credit=94 and that =93when the credit of a coun=
try is in any degree questionable, it never fails to give an extravagant pr=
emium upon all the loans it has occasion to make=94 (emphasis added).
Second, even when Trump was at least trying to provide reassurance on Monda=
y morning, he seemed to think the entire issue was some form of personal at=
tack from the =93loser New York Times=94=97as opposed to any recognition th=
at making U.S. credit =93in any degree questionable=94 is a dangerous risk =
to the U.S. and global economy because U.S. Treasury obligations are the le=
ast risky financial asset on the planet and the benchmark against which the=
 price of all other financial assets is set.
Nowhere, on the other hand, was there even the slightest awareness from Tru=
mp that he might be playing with economic fire because if Treasuries were s=
een as no longer risk-free that would shake to its very foundations literal=
ly the core assumption of global financial markets, meaning that the intere=
st rate on every other financial asset=97mortgages, car loans, credit for b=
usinesses large and small=97could go up perhaps by a lot.
This economic reality did not require him to brush up on the post-Revolutio=
nary War history of the founding of our national financial system. Our nati=
on had just seen the damage of even a threat of default during the 2011 deb=
t crisis=97a threat that other, more successful billionaires such as Warren=
 Buffet likened to threatening =93a nuclear bomb=94 and that Michael Bloomb=
erg called a =93seismic event that says you can never depend 100 percent on=
 America's word anymore.=94
Third, one needs to consider these rather reckless comments on honoring our=
 debts in light of Trump=92s overall fiscal plan. So far, he has put forwar=
d a tax cut plan that both the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation hav=
e estimated as increasing the national debt by more than $11 trillion in de=
bt overn the next 10 year and that the TPC has estimated would increase the=
 debt by a staggering $34 trillion over 20 years! Sending a signal that a n=
ew United States president would plan to run up the debt by untold trillion=
s while =93knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal=94 jus=
t might not be the best thing to do to enhance economic confidence in locat=
ing new jobs and investment in the United States.
With appreciation to Alexander Hamilton=97and apologies to the United Negro=
 College Fund=97perfect public credit built up over more than two centuries=
 is a terrible thing to waste.
