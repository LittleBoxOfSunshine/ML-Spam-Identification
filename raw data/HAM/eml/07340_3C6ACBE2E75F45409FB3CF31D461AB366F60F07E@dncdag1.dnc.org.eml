*       take us back to Trump nominee realization last night
o       it seemed obvious for a long time, but I know what it's like to fight to the end
o       it didn't surprise me at all
*       are you ready for Trump, different from past?
o       I've seen presidency up close, I know what it takes
o       we can't take risk on a loose cannon like Trump, said other countries could get nukes, wages are too high, women should be punished for getting abortions
o       he's a loose cannon, he's said so many things and will be scrambling, but already said all these things
o       he said climate change was a hoax
*       willing to say things against opponents that many were not prepared for on GOP side, are you?
o       I've been in the arena for 25 years, anything that can be thrown at somebody has been thrown my way
o       I'm not running against him, I'm running for president
o       maybe GOP opponents lost because they didn't take him on on issues because they agree with him (minimum wage, climate change)
o       they couldn't run campaigns on issues that matter to America
*       Trump hit NAFTA, people say Trump would do better on economy than you did
o       look at history, 23 mil new jobs and rising incomes for everyone
o       I'm going to talk about what we will do in the future, economy does better under Dems
o       Obama had to rescue economy from failed policies of Republicans
o       at some point when you run for Pres, you actually have to put a little meat on the bones
*       Trump makes himself more available to reporters, are you going to?
o       well it worked for him, I think reporters are going to start asking him tougher questions about his plans and how they would work
o       if you think wages are too high, how do you look Americans in the eye?
o       if your budget slashes taxes on wealthy, leads to spiraling debt, how will that work?
*       Trump on running against you, said he will use same strategy against you that he did against rivals, how scorched earth will this be?
o       he's the one who made that decision, not me
o       he's been insulting people with disabilities, Muslims, immigrants
o       I have more than 3m votes over Sanders, 2m over Trump
o       I'm going to keep talking about what I'd do as Pres, being specific
*       Warren said he's built his campaign on racism/sexism/xenophobia
o       I have the highest regard for senator Warren, I think anyone who's listened to him can draw that conclusion?
*       do you think Trump is a racist?
o       I'm going to let people decide for themselves
*       Trump on coal country, will say you'll try to placate any audience?
o       no, that's a broad misinterpretation, I have been talking about how we need to make a transition to clean renewable energy, not leave coal country behind. the market has driven down the cost of coal
*       Trump has referenced your marriage-
o       he's not the first one. if he wants to go back to playbook from 1990s, follow in footsteps of those who have tried to knock me down, I'm happy to have him do that
o       this is the classic case of a blustering bully who knocked all Republicans out of the way because they were dumbfounded
*       did they wait too long?
o       you'll have to ask them, I'm not running their campaign
o       I invite Republicans and Independents to join with Dems, get on American team
*       did Trump ever engage you on substance when you were a Senator, ask for favors?
o       not that I recall
o       I have been very consistent about where I stand, he's played all sides of political spectrum
*       Sanders takes issue with you being the presumptive nominee, what would you say to his supporters?
o       I'm not calling myself that. I have a lot of empathy for where he is
o       I won 9 out of the last 12 contests in 2008
o       I welcomed him saying last week he'd do everything he could to stop Trump from becoming president
*       Trump says he wants a VP with congressional experience, what about qualities you would look for?
o       most important quality is that this person could become pres on a moment's notice, I intend to take that seriously
