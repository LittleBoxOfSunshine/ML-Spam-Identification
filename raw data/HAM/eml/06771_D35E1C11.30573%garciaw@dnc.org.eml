Prepared Remarks for Delivery: DNC Chair Rep. Wasserman Schultz at Alaska S=
tate Convention

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA -- Tonight, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz addre=
ssed the Alaska State Convention. Below you will find excerpts as prepared =
for delivery:

=93As chair of the DNC, I=92ve committed myself to getting to know my fello=
w Democrats with visits to all fifty states =96 and I=92ll be honest, it=92=
s been a little easier to reach those lower forty-eight.

=85

=93But I know I=92m not the only one here tonight who travelled a great dis=
tance to be at the convention =96 I understand there are even as many as 40=
 high school students coming all the way from Juneau, and who registered to=
 be delegates =96 let=92s give them a hand for being the future of our part=
y.

=93And let me just thank everyone else here who has travelled from across o=
ur country=92s largest state to show your support.

=93Your enthusiasm, energy, your commitment, and your dedication to our par=
ty will make all the difference on Election Day.

=85

=93So we=92ve taken the 50-state strategy that Howard Dean pioneered when h=
e was Chair of the National Party =96 and we=92ve gone even further =96

=93Providing more funding; more infrastructure; more rocket fuel to keep th=
e engines of our state parties firing on all cylinders and holding Republic=
ans in office and in elections accountable.

=93That means that here in Alaska the DNC helps fund direct mail campaigns =
to reach voters and help get them to the polls on Election Day.

=93We fund salaries for critical staff under our state party partnerships. =
In fact, Kay Brown can tell you, she was one of the first State Party Partn=
ership employees we ever hired.

=93Since 2009, the DNC has directly provided the Alaska Democratic Party mo=
re than $625,000 in direct support.

=93But it=92s not just the funding -- the DNC has been out-pacing the GOP i=
n how we offer direct support to our state parties with training, and bench=
-building; we share our deep research and communications capabilities in Al=
aska and across the country.

=93Since 2013, we have quintupled the size of our digital team, to boost fu=
ndraising and provide training and support to our state parties.

=93We=92ve organized a team of experts in messaging, branding, and polling =
to review the way we communicate, and we=92ve built an in-house Communicati=
ons team to hold Republicans accountable every single day.

=93We=92ve built out a state-of-the-art media monitoring operation to track=
 and inform our rapid response operation.

=93Our teams are providing training, disseminating best practices, sharing =
technology and design assets, and building community among State Party staf=
f and the rest of the Democratic family.

=93And combined with our national, state-of-the-art voter file, which we=92=
ve been building out for years, we have a real edge that=92s going to help =
carry us to victory.

=93And we=92ve done it all while paying off more than $20 million in debt a=
fter winning the 2012 presidential election and re-electing Barack Obama.

=93But of course, our number one advantage comes from our candidates, and t=
he contrast they=92re offering Alaska voters and the American people.

=93I couldn=92t be more proud of the two candidates at the top of our ticke=
t.

=93From Day One, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have been running smart=
, substantive campaigns focused on the issues that matter.

=93We=92ve watched them engage honestly with voters, answer thoughtfully at=
 town halls and debates, and deliver an aspirational message that speaks to=
 the hopes and dreams of the American people=85

=93And no matter which one of our candidates becomes the nominee, we will b=
e united coming out of our convention and headed toward Election Day.

=93In the words of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders =91Trum=
p will not be president.=92

=85

=93At the DNC we are not going to make the same mistake his Republican oppo=
nents made.

=93We=92re ready for Trump.

=93Ready to hold him accountable for the damage he=92s doing as a candidate=
 and the damage he=92s promising he would do as president.

=93Just this week, Trump met with Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell to show tha=
t despite their nasty, mud-slinging primary, they=92re getting ready to sin=
g =91kumbaya=92 and give us everything they=92ve got.

=93And what they=92ve got is the same old playbook: the same failed trickle=
-down economic policies that preceded the Great Recession under the last Re=
publican president.

=93So Trump isn=92t something new =96 he=92s just the old Republican brand,=
 but with a little extra bronzer on =96 he=92s that much move dangerous.

=93He only looks out for himself. He lacks the temperament and judgment to =
be commander in chief. And every aspect of his presidency would harm our co=
untry and damage our standing in the world.

=93Even as a candidate, Trump has damaged America=92s relationships across =
the globe.
In the White House, he would make America less safe.

=93He has no foreign policy experience =96 but don=92t worry about that - h=
e said he=92ll rely on his =91good brain,=92 instead of listening to expert=
s.

=93He has a decades-long record of denigrating women, which is why seven ou=
t of ten women disapprove of his candidacy.

=93He exploits racial anxieties and cultural fears. His rallies have sparke=
d violence against people of color, protestors, and the media.

=93Recent reports found that bullying at schools is on the rise as a result=
 of his hateful rhetoric. He=92s making our communities less safe and he=92=
s only a candidate!

=93And while he tries to paint a picture of his wealth and business success=
, his record is riddled with examples that he prefers to turn a quick buck =
even when it comes at the expense of workers.

=93But much of this the same old playbook gave George W. Bush two terms, so=
 we have to treat Trump=92s candidacy as a real threat because it is!

=85

=93I=92m inspired here tonight =96 I wish everyone could see how much dedic=
ation the Democrats of Alaska have.

=93Don=92t believe for a second that just because the pundits like to paint=
 Alaska red and say it isn=92t a battleground state means you=92re sideline=
d.

=93In every presidential election since 2000, the percentage of Alaskans ca=
sting their vote for the Democrat has increased =96 from 27% in 2000 to mor=
e than 40% in 2012.

=93This has already been an exciting election year nationally =96 working t=
ogether, I know we can Dump Trump and, eventually turn Alaska Blue.

=93I know we can count on you to keep working hard throughout this election=
.

=93So thank you for all you=92ve done to support our party, and thank you f=
or everything you will do to bring us all the way to victory in November.

=93Now on to victory! Thank you, Alaska Democrats!=94

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

getting ready to sing =91kumbaya=92 and give
 us everything they=92ve got.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

 same failed trickle-down economic policies that preceded the Great Recessi=
on under the last Republican president.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

h move dangerous.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">=93He only looks out for himself. He lacks the temperam=

cy would harm our country and damage our
 standing in the world.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

elationships across the globe.
</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">In the White House, he would make America less safe.
</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">=93He has no foreign policy experience =96 but don=92t =
worry about that - he said he=92ll rely on his =91good brain,=92 instead of=
 listening to experts.
</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

hich is why seven out of ten women disapprove of his candidacy.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =

 rallies have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the=
 media.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">=93Recent reports found that bullying at schools is on =
the rise as a result of his hateful rhetoric. He=92s making our communities=
 less safe and he=92s only a candidate!</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">=93And while he tries to paint a picture of his wealth =
and business success, his record is riddled with examples that he prefers t=
o turn a quick buck even when it comes
 at the expense of workers. </span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times =
New Roman', serif;">=93But much of this the same old playbook gave George W=
. Bush two terms, so we have to treat Trump=92s candidacy as a real threat =
because it is!</span></p>
