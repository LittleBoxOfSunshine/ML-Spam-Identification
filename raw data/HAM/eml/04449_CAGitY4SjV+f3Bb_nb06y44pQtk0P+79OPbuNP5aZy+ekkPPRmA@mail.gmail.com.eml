No one=E2=80=99s fears are likely to be allayed by this speech, which was c=
learly worked up by his new campaign advisers and read from a teleprompter.=
 It did not exhibit much grasp of the complexity of the world, understandin=

 even a careful reading of history.<br>
...<br>
<br>
Mr. Trump repeatedly states outright falsehoods, often based on wrong assum=

e is making =E2=80=9Cmillions of dollars a week=E2=80=9D by selling Libyan =

 the United States and other major powers has not made Iran a =E2=80=9Cgrea=

Mr. Trump says he knows how to negotiate, and to him that seems to mean put=

<br>
Which is a good place to start with the &nbsp;much-awaited foreign policy s=
peech delivered Wednesday in Washington by presidential candidate Donald Tr=
ump.<br>
<br>
As with The Apprentice, the show that helped him become a household name, t=
he Republican front-runner sought to provide appealing fare for a certain c=
lass of people. In this case, the primary audience was voters opposed to tr=
ade, resentful of immigrants, distrustful
 of foreign governments, and wistful for a time when America wielded more p=
ower in a simpler world.<br>
<br>
In reaching out to this group, Trump vividly portrayed a world that does no=
t exist: America=E2=80=99s allies would be more respectful after being lect=
ured to, while its enemies would be dealt with by bluster. China would fall=
 into line after enduring unspecified economic
 pressure. And troubled regions of the world would be stabilized through U.=
S. disengagement.<br>
