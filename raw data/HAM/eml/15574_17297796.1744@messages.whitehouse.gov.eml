Subject: Travel Pool Report #4  More detail on fair

POTUS entered the vast hall where the various companies had huge booths d=
emonstrating their wares. Think Vegas and the CES, but in German, and wit=
h industrial tech instead of consumer tech.

Here are the booths he went to, with a little color from each:

THE FIRST WAS THE AMERICAN BOOTHS:

OHIO

There was a sign that said: Ohio is putting the "advanced" in advanced en=
gineering.

"We are a great advanced manufacturing state"

they demonstrated a 3D printer they said was used by a lot of students, b=
usinesses

One of the items was a prosthetic hand

POTUS: "These three-D printers are becoming a lot more popular. And as yo=
u can see they're pretty compact"

POTUS: "You guys are doing a great job"

POTUS: "I might have to get one. When I get out of office in going to hav=
e a lot of time in my hands."

LOS ANGELES
World Trade Center

They showed off the "gecko gripper" which mimics the technology of a geck=
o to allow people to pick up things in space without using any adhesive o=
r force.

Done at the NASA at jet propulsion lab

When Ms. Merkel looked confused, POTUS said: "Hang on a sec,  need to tra=
nslate gecko."

POTUS: "The idea is that this would be used in space exclusively or does =
it have earthbound applications?"

The aswer was it does.

POTUS: "I'll be scaling walls sometime soon. It reminds me of Spider-Man.=
"

KENTUCKY

The company Space Tango demonstrated a silver box designed to carry exper=
iments on silicon chips or pharmaceuticals or other industiral design int=
o space, on the international space station.

POTUS: "What is it that you can do in space with this instrument?"

POTUS: 'I'm a company...I can use this to test certain processes, the dat=
a will come back to me."

AUTODESK

A young woman with a prosthetic leg in an athletic cyclist outfit present=
ed a 3D printed prosthesis that she said offered better comfort, fit bett=
er and better performance.

She said she and autodesk, the company, worked for 1.5 years to develop i=
t.

"Hopefully going to help me win medals in Rio," she said.

POTUS asked whether the software allows you to make quick adjustments. Ri=
ght, she said.

POTUS: "You look very fit like you're ready to go."

THEN CAME THE GERMAN PAVILION

PHOENIX CONTACT

This company demonstrated a super fast charger for electric cars. During =
a coffee break they can charge a car so they can go 650 kilometers

Next to the demonstration was an almost life-sized Delorean mocked up to =
look like it was from Back to the Future.

POTUS: "It's a great movie, Back to the Future. I'll send Angela a DVD."

POTUS asked whether the connector was standardized and the ceo said that =
it was.

POTUS: "How pervasive are they?"

7000 plug in stations all over Germany.

IFM ELECTRONIC

This company demonstrated the smallest 3D camera in the world, can be use=
d in cell phones etc

Demonstrated a picture from one of their cameras. It was in 3-d and it lo=
oked like a color coded heat map.

The CEO said it added a third dimension to cameras.

POTUS then put on a virtual reality goggles like the one made by Google f=
or free, but it had "googly eyes" on the outside.

The CEO said POTUS could use the goggles and the camera to talk to his da=
ughter virtually.

POTUS -- "It's a brave new world."

SIEMENS

The CEO of Siemens demonstrated for POTUS how they can use software to qu=
ickly make design changes to a car.

POTUS: "This kind of tailored, individualized mmfg is becoming the norm."=


At the end of the demonstration, POTUS was given two golf clubs designed =
with tthe softward. The name of the gold club is "Yes We Can."

POTUS: 'I'm going to teach Angela how to play."

THE POOL THEN HAD TO SKIP ONE OF THE BOOTHS THAT POTUS WAS AT

ABB

This company demonstrated a device to get information from electric motor=
s The information helps them reduce energy consumption by 10 percent, the=
 equivalent of 100 power plants.

HARTING

POTUS stood by a yellow racing car as the CEO said that they made a mini =
computer that gets driver data and other crucial information from cars.

POTUS noticed that the CEO, his son and his wife were all wearing special=
 shoes. "Are these the official shoes of the company? They are very nice.=
" Your pooler had no way of seeing the shoes to describe them.

POTUS: "I might have to get a pair."

LAPP GROUP

This company showed off some kind of robotic arm, including one that was =
set up to shoot a basketball into a hoop. But when POTUS asked for a demo=
, the CEO appeared to say that the basketballs were not allowed into the =
demo booth.

POTUS: "Where are the basketballs?

POTUS: "I woulda beat that robot in a second."

RITTA DAS SYSTEMS

This company showed a film that your pooler couldnt see about the company=
. It appeared to be a company that makes climate control devices and comp=
ressors.

Your pooler was then hustled back to the motorcade
