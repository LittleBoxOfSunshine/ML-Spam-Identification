Cruz Campaign Vetting Carly for VP<http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/20=

By MICHAEL WARREN

Ted Cruz=92s presidential campaign is vetting Carly Fiorina as a potential =
running mate, THE WEEKLY STANDARD has learned.

According to a spokeswoman for Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO and =
one-time presidential candidate is being vetted by Cruz's campaign.

"Normal stuff," said Sarah Isgur Flores, who served as deputy campaign mana=
ger during Fiorina's bid, when asked about the process. She added that Fior=
ina has met with members of the Cruz campaign and has given them financial =
disclosures and other documentation. Flores added that "no offers" have bee=
n made.

On ABC's This Week Sunday, reporter Jon Karl floated the idea that Cruz cou=
ld announce a running mate before next week's critical Indiana primary and =
suggested Fiorina would be the "one person" to fill that role.

Fiorina endorsed Cruz in March, after her own campaign for president ended.=
 She has made appearances on the behalf of the Texas senator and introduced=
 him at a recent campaign stop in Maryland.

Republicans in Fiorina's home state of California will vote in their state'=
s primary on June 7. Fiorina won the Republican Senate primary in Californi=
a in 2010.

Update: Cruz campaign spokeswoman Alice Stewart provided a statement to TWS=
. "We've already announced publicly that we're vetting prospecting VP nomin=
ees, but no selection has been made yet. When that decision has been made, =
we will share it."
