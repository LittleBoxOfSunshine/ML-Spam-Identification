*=E2=80=8BSenator Barbara Mikulski and President of the Center for American
Progress Action Fund Neera Tanden Discuss How Trump's Economic Policies
Would Put Women & Families at Risk*

Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Neera Tanden, President of the
Center for American Progress Action Fund, joined Hillary for America for a
press call today to discuss how Donald Trump=E2=80=99s economic policies ar=
e too
big a risk for American women and families. From his plan to give massive
tax breaks to millionaires to his opposition to a federal minimum wage
floor, Donald Trump is the wrong choice for women and families. *Audio of
the call is available here
<https://soundcloud.com/hillary-clinton-976818877/hfa-press-call-with-sen-b=
arbara-mikulski-neera-tanden-hillary-clinton>.*

"I'm with Hillary because I know that she's the only candidate who will
make fighting for women and families her priority. I've worked with her on
the macro issues, and I've worked with her on the macaroni and cheese
issues, and I know she will be a great president. She's already a great
champion for women. The presumptive Republican nominee offers a different
vision," said Senator Barbara Mikulski.

Hillary Clinton has spent her entire life taking on the tough fights and
delivering real results to improve the lives of women and families, both at
home and around the world. As first lady, she advocated for the Family and
Medical Leave Act, and she worked to increase funding for child care. As
senator, she championed the Paycheck Fairness Act, co-sponsored the Lilly
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and introduced and helped pass "The Support for
Injured Service-members Act" to allow wounded soldiers and their families
to take up to 6 months of leave in order to care for their loved ones. As
secretary of state, she made women=E2=80=99s rights a cornerstone of U.S. f=
oreign
policy, advancing women=E2=80=99s economic empowerment and spearheading
public-private partnerships to improve the status of women and girls.

"Make no mistake: Trump's divisive comments about women's health are a
direct threat to our dignity and economic security. But these ideas are not
the only risk a Trump presidency would pose for the economic future of
women and families around this country. His tax plan gives $3 trillion to
millionaires, that's enough to make Social Security and Medicare solvent
for 75 years. Women, who rely disproportionately on Social Security, can't
afford such an irresponsible giveaway," said Neera Tanden, President of the
Center for American Progress Action Fund.

Donald Trump still opposes raising the minimum wage because he believes
=E2=80=9Cwages are too high,=E2=80=9D and recently said he doesn't favor a =
federal floor
for the minimum wage, which could leave many workers subject to a lower
minimum wage. At a time when two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women,
this issue is critical to working families.

The trillions in tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires and corporations
laid out in Donald Trump=E2=80=99s tax plan would be an enormous boon for t=
he top
one percent of earners, made at the expense of working families, seniors
and the health of our economy. His plan would give $3 trillion over 10
years or more than 35% of its tax breaks to millionaires, enough money to
ensure Medicare and Social Security=E2=80=99s solvency for the next 75 year=
s,
repair our ailing infrastructure, or raise every person now living in
poverty up to the poverty line. Trump would give multi-millionaires in the
top 0.1% like himself a raise of $1.3 million a year, or $100,000 a month.
