Republican presidential candidate has a long history of dropping moderate p=
ositions in his races
WALL STREET JOURNAL // REID J. EPSTEIN

In 1993, Scott Walker ran to the right of his rivals on abortion, opposing =
it in all circumstances, including the life of the mother. In 2006, he chan=
ged a long-held position against the death penalty. And in 2010, in a matte=
r of hours, he flipped from opposing to supporting an Arizona crackdown on =
immigrants.

At each step in the Wisconsin governor's career, he has run against Republi=
can opponents with one overriding strategy: Never letting anybody get to th=
e right of him. That helps explain his move this week to instantly embrace =
the toughest position on immigration after Republican presidential primary =
opponent Donald Trump<http://topics.wsj.com/person/T/Donald-Trump/159> rele=
ased his policy platform on the matter.

After slipping in polls in must-win Iowa, Mr. Walker is positioning his cam=
paign to compete with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the slice of the GOP electora=
te angry with everyone in Washington. It's a plan with one big condition at=
tached. For it to work, Mr. Trump will need to alienate those voters, who a=
re rallying to him, or quit the race.

"He understands the anger that people are feeling out there and the reason =
why Donald Trump is catching on the last six weeks," said Jonathan Burkan, =
a Walker fundraising bundler who participated in a Monday conference call i=
n which the governor sought to reassure jittery supporters by promising to =
show more passion on the stump.

"If the voters decide not to support Trump, they want those voters. They do=
n't want to give up those voters," Mr. Burkan said. "All campaigns have to =
adjust tactics all the time."

After facing little blowback for his shifting positions before, the candida=
te who titled his autobiography "Unintimidated" is attracting scrutiny now.=
 "Until this summer, I was the only candidate who had a message focused on =
helping American workers by putting common-sense limits on this surge of im=
migrants," Republican rival Rick Santorum said Thursday. "Gov. Walker was f=
irst to change his position."

Mr. Walker declined to be interviewed. His spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said=
 his repeated electoral victories are proof his constituents understand and=
back his policies. "The people of Wisconsin know what he stands for and hav=
e repeatedly supported his agenda," she said.

The governor's willingness to adapt his positions began at the start of his=
 career. In the 1993 race for a Wisconsin State Assembly seat, the four Rep=
ublican primary opponents that the 25-year-old college dropout faced were a=
ll more accomplished. One had lived in the district for 20 years and had th=
e endorsement of the Milwaukee newspapers. Another was the lobbyist for the=
 Milwaukee chamber of commerce and had the most money. Another led a promin=
ent local antitax organization. The fourth was a local assistant district a=
ttorney.

Mr. Walker beat them all by at least 20 percentage points, in large part by=
 appealing to social conservatives. He pronounced himself opposed to aborti=
on in all cases, including after rape and incest, winning the backing of Wi=
sconsin Right to Life, the state's anti-abortion rights organization.

Barbara Kraetsch, who had the Milwaukee newspaper endorsements, says the Ri=
ght to Life endorsement was the only one that mattered. "My position was th=
at government should do everything to discourage abortion, but not make it =
illegal," she said. "I was vilified for that."

When he first ran for governor in 2006, Mr. Walker was again an underdog in=
 the GOP primary against Green Bay congressman Mark Green. Struggling to ga=
in traction, he reversed his long-held stance opposing capital punishment. =
Mr. Walker said he had been swayed by advancements in DNA technology and no=
w backed a statewide advisory referendum to reinstitute it."The timing cert=
ainly doesn't hurt," Walker told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel of his chan=
ge of heart during the primary race. Mr. Walker ultimately fell behind in t=
he polls, ran out of money and quit the race.

By the time he ran for governor again in 2010, he was the establishment can=
didate. Still, Mr. Walker made sure not to get outflanked by primary oppone=
nt Mark Neumann, a former congressman campaigning on his willingness to buc=
k the House GOP leadership.

After Mr. Neumann backed an Arizona law requiring police to check the statu=
s of anyone they thought might be illegal, Mr. Walker said he had "serious =
concerns" about the law. When his campaign Facebook page was instantly floo=
ded with criticism from conservatives, Mr. Walker changed his mind that aft=
ernoon.

He also followed Mr. Neumann's lead in opposing a state smoking ban, even t=
hough as Milwaukee County executive he had forbidden smoking outside county=
 buildings, and his wife was, and remains, a fundraiser for the American Lu=
ng Association. After he won the election, he never sought to alter the smo=
king ban, and later declared it a success.

During his 2014 re-election campaign, Mr. Walker softened his tone on socia=
l issues. He aired a TV ad on abortion that touted legislation he supported=
 that left "the final decision to a woman and her doctor," and he declared =
the gay-marriage an issue "resolved" after a federal judge invalidated the =
state's ban on same-sex weddings.

But in a February appearance before religious broadcasters in Nashville, Te=
nn., Mr. Walker hardened his rhetoric. "I think of strong families and I th=
ink it starts with a strong marriage," which comprised a husband and a wife=
, he said. During the same speech, he stressed his opposition to abortion, =
noting that he carries in utero photographs of his two sons with him.

Mr. Walker's shift on immigration is a particularly sharp turn.

For more than a decade, he was a relative progressive on the issue. In 2002=
, he signed a resolution calling for "a new program similar to the Federal =
amnesty program enacted by Congress in 1986." In 2013, as Congress debated =
overhauling federal immigration laws, he said in separate interviews that m=
ore border security wasn't necessary and that he backed a path to citizensh=
ip for illegal immigrants.

Mr. Walker has now renounced his past support for a path to citizenship and=
 suggested he would reduce the number of legal immigrants allowed into the =
country. When an MSNBC reporter asked him Monday if birthright citizenship =
guaranteed under the 14th Amendment should be ended, his reply was: "I thin=
k that's something we should, yeah, absolutely, going forward."

Mr. Walker said his policy adjustments don't make him inconsistent or, in p=
olitical terms, a flip-flopper-a dangerous label for a candidate presenting=
 himself as a fighter with political backbone. His past public support for =
more liberal immigration proposals, Mr. Walker said during a May Fox News T=
V interview, was irrelevant because he didn't have authority to act on them=
.

"There's not a flip out there," he said. "I don't have any impact on immigr=
ation as a governor."
