For Immediate Release
May 17, 2016

NV Dems Statement on Continued Misinformation from Sanders Campaign

Las Vegas, NV =96 The Nevada State Democratic Party released the following =
statement today:

"We respect and admire Senator Sanders for his values and leadership in the=
 United States Senate, but the Sanders campaign is continuing to be dishone=
st about what happened Saturday and is failing to adequately denounce the t=
hreats of violence of his supporters."


The Sanders Campaign Continues to Lie About What Happened on Saturday and H=
as Failed to Denounce The Tactics and Actions Of Their Staff and Supporters

The Temporary Convention Rules Were Passed With The Support Of Nearly 100 M=
ore Clinton Delegates Than Sanders Delegates. Convention delegates passed t=
he Temporary Convention Rules after the Credentials Committee announced the=
ir preliminary report of delegates in attendance. Clinton had nearly 100 mo=
re delegates than Sanders and the rules were passed in accordance with proc=
edures the Sanders campaign had never objected to before today.

Six Of The Sixty Four Delegates Were Seated By The Credentials Committee Af=
ter Their Information Was Verified, Eight Were Deemed Ineligible After They=
 Were Shown To Be Not Be Registered Voters Or A Registered Voter Of A Diffe=
rent Party And Fifty Of Them Never Even Attempted To Register Or Show Up At=
 The Convention. The credentials committee heard the cases of fourteen Sand=
ers supporters whose information could not be verified and sat six of them =
after they were verified as registered Democrats. Eight Sanders supporters =
were deemed ineligible after the credentials committee verified they were n=
ot registered Democrats, including one that had changed their registration =
from Democratic to Green in April and several that were not registered vote=
rs. The rest, 50 individuals, never showed up at the convention to attempt =
to register and, therefore, would not have affected the outcome of the conv=
ention at all.

NV Dems Provided The Sanders Campaign The Names Of Forty-Four Of The Sixty =
Four Delegates Whose Information Could Not Be Verified Two Days Before The =
Convention. NV Dems provided the Sanders campaign the names of 44 delegates=
 of the 64 in question whose information could not be verified. The Sanders=
 campaign never responded and never provided information to verify their el=
igibility as delegates/alternates.

Sanders=92 Convention Floor Organizer Admitted That The Sanders Campaign Fa=
iled To Properly Move Their Petitions On The Floor And Blamed Other Sanders=
 Supporters For Failing To Show Up. According to a Facebook post by Angie M=
orelli, a Sanders organizer on the Convention Floor, =93Let me explain what=
 happened today. We were at 110% registration for delegates for the convent=
ion, they just didn't show up and check in, and a lot of our delegates had =
credentialing issues. Most of our petitions had more than enough signatures=
, but we had to take the floor to do a motion. We stood up front and glorio=
usly made them allow for us to speak, via the microphones, but people who d=
idn't know what was going on decided to take the mic and we never got to ma=
ke a motion to amend based on the petitions.=94 [Angie Morelli Facebook, 5/=
