Segment 1: Sarah Palin Interview

 about abortion and they wan

Speaker Ryan said he is not ready to support Trump. If Ryan doesn't support=
 Trump, should he still be Speaker of the House?

Paul Ryan is going to end up like Eric Cantor - his political career is ove=
r. He needs to listen to the will of the people.

It screws Ryan's chances to run in 2020 if the Republican Party wins now.

Are you planning on supporting Ryan's primary challenger?

Yes, will do whatever she can for Ryan's opponent. Ryan's problem is that h=
e has become so disconnected from the people who elected him. Paul Ryan and=
 the establishment feel threatened at this point that their power, prestige=
, purse will be adversely affected by the change that is coming with Trump.

Ryan said he was very concerned with the tone Trump has taken, the Muslim b=
an, deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants, comments about women. You=
 don't believe he is concerned with these things?

Those concerns are relatively speaking superficial, talking about tone and =
certain verbiage as opposed to what Ryan would have chose to talk about.

The people of America care about getting things done finally, taking our go=
vernment back and putting it on our side.

This weekend Trump went after HRC and her husband's infidelity. What do you=
 think of that line of attack?

A lot of people may be obsessed with public figures personal lives but for =
the most part Americans are concerned with things like who will be able to =
appoint the next SCOTUS justice. People care about that much more so than B=
ill Clinton's obvious indiscretions and Donald Trump having been divorced a=
 couple times and owning up to it.

Are you willing to be vetted for Trump's VP slot?

I think i am pretty much as vetted as anyone in the country could be vetted=
 at this point.

She wants to help and not hurt - she is a realist and realizes there are a =
lot of people out there that would consider her a burden on the ticket. She=
 just wants Trump and America to win.

Republicans are worried about his poor standing with women voters, 7 of 10 =
have an unfavorable view of him. Do you wince when he says things like "wom=
en have it better than men" on the trail?

Heck, no. He is saying what a lot of other people are thinking, he just hap=
pens to be the most candid about it. She knows Trump and appreciated that h=
e has respect for women - he listens to the prominent women in his life lik=
e his daughter and wife.

John McCain has publicly maintained that Trump would not have much of an im=
pact on his campaign in Arizona but behind closed doors he said Trump might=
 hurt his reelection bid - over 30% of voters in Arizona are Hispanic. How =
is Trump going to improve his standing with Latino voters?

Palin gives a lot more credit to Latino voters than the mainstream media wo=
uld in terms of believing that they all have a herd mentality and vote for =
only one candidate.

Wishes politicians wouldn't worry about racial divides that are for the mos=
t part made up by those that thrive on division.

Trump recently said he wants to change platform as it relates to abortion t=
o include exceptions for rape, incest, life of mother. Do you agree?

She does not want the platform to change. When it comes to abortion, it is =
very sensitive and a personal issue. The platform is the way it should be r=
ight now. When we can agree that the platform should stay as it is now, the=
n we can talk about things that people are really concerned about and that =
is debt, open borders, illegal immigrants coming over and receiving freebie=
s instead of our people and especially vets, growing government - the intru=
sion that the failed liberal agenda perpetuates.

**She is basically saying that the American people aren't really concerned =
about a women's abortion rights and would rather focus on other issues.
