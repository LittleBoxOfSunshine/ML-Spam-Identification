Luis --

For the past seven and a half years, folks like you have proven that
you're committed to doing whatever it takes to make life better for=20
people in every corner of this country. Your hope and optimism
paved the way to a brighter America: One where folks can marry
who they love, where students don't just have to dream about
going to college because it's become a real possibility, where we're
taking action to make sure our kids and grandkids inherit a healthy
planet. Our progress is real, Luis. It's tangible, and every day
we're seeing the results more and more.

Together, we're going to build on that:

https://my.democrats.org/April-Deadline

And I know we've got lofty goals, Luis. We always have. And=20
there will always be cynics and naysayers -- but we can't be
beholden to them. We've got a job to do and people across the
country who are counting on us to keep doing the work around
things that matter most in their lives.

Electing Democrats is how we keep that work up, so right now I'm
asking you to pitch in $3 or whatever you can before our deadline
at midnight tonight so that Democrats across the country have the
resources they need to win in November:

https://my.democrats.org/April-Deadline

One of the greatest things about our country is that we're never
finished. We're writing our own history every single day and we have
the opportunity to create the change we believe in.

So thank you. Thank you for standing by me.
