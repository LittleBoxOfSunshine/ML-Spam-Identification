Subject: local pool #2 -- jazz concert with Aretha Franklin & Herbie Hanc=
ock

The President and First Lady hosted a jazz concert in a large temporary b=
uilding on the South Lawn for about 550 invited guests to mark Internatio=
nal Jazz Day. The structure has a clear ceiling and clear walls, with the=
 audience facing the White House behind the stage.
Among the guests sighted in the crowd were former Attorney General Eric H=
older, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, most of the cast of =
"Scandal," including Kerry Washington and Tony Goldwyn, and the Rev. Al S=
harpton. Among the administration officials seen were Susan Rice and Ben =
Rhodes. Wolf Blitzer was in the house. Emcee was Morgan Freeman.
The president and first lady were introduced at 7:31 p.m., and Mr. Obama =
made brief remarks.
After five years of the event being celebrated abroad, he said, "We could=
n't be prouder that this year, jazz comes back to America."
The president said it's a true story that jazz great Dizzy Gillespie ran =
for president in 1964 and said he would make an executive order to change=
 the White House into the Blues House. "Tonight, we're going to do right =
by Dizzy. We are going to turn this place into the Blues House."
The president was reading off a Teleprompter at the back of the room on t=
he riser.
He spoke of how he developed a love of jazz as a child, because it involv=
ed one of the few memories of his father, when they spent a month togethe=
r in 1971.
"One of the things he did was take me to my first jazz concert, to see Da=
ve Brubeck. I didn't realize at the time the impact that it had, but the =
world that concert opened up for a 10-year-old boy was spectacular. I was=
 hooked."
Jazz, he said, "is in so many ways the story of our nation's progress."
"There is something fearless and true about jazz. This is truth-telling m=
usic."
Then Aretha Franklin took the stage, in a shimmering gold gown. She sat a=
t a grand piano and played "A Song for You," and received a standing ovat=
ion.
Pool was ushered out as Morgan Freeman began to speak.
We have a lid.
