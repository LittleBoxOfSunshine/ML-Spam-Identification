Subject: Faith Voices Against Trump

Hey--

Just wanted to flag this for you--and it's candidate neutral. There have be=
en two REALLY great moments where faith voices have come out and condemned =
Trump for bringing out the worst in America. This would be a great thing to=
 amplify however possible.

Really good opportunity for us to engage and institutionalize these faith v=
oices in the party infrastructure. It would be great to try and engage them=
 and get them to do something at convention, etc. Maybe do a vigil at the C=
leveland Convention?

All just ideas.

Called to Resist:
A very powerful letter signed by a TON of faith leaders:
"Trump=92s highly visible and vulgar racial and religious demagoguery prese=
nts a danger but also an opportunity=97to publicly expose and resist the wo=
rst of American values. By confronting a message so contrary to our Christi=
an values, our religious voices can help provide a powerful way to put our =
true faith and our better American values forward in the midst of national =
moral confusion and crisis."

Russell Moore
Russell Moore who was really close with the Rubio Evangelical team came out=
 and condemned Trump.


As of this week, the nation faces a crazier election season than many of us=
 ever imagined, with Donald J. Trump as the all-but-certain nominee of the =
Republican Party. Regardless of the outcome in November, his campaign is fo=
rcing American Christians to grapple with some scary realities that will ha=
ve implications for years to come.

This election has cast light on the darkness of pent-up nativism and bigotr=
y all over the country. There are not-so-coded messages denouncing African-=
Americans and immigrants; concern about racial justice and national unity i=
s ridiculed as =93political correctness.=94 Religious minorities are scapeg=
oated for the sins of others, with basic religious freedoms for them called=
 into question. Many of those who have criticized Mr. Trump=92s vision for =
America have faced threats and intimidation from the =93alt-right<http://ww=
