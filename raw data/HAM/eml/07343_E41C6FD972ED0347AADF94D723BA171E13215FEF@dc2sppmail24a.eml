Okay -

I also put some thoughts on the questions below in red. Obviously, you shou=
ld play with the specific language you'd like to use if you want to go back=
 to him with more. I think the point that there is a lot of HVF money alloc=
ated to states that hasn't been sent to them yet  because it is for general=
 election purposes is a good one, and the reason that they're sending money=
 to us so far is because we are building the infrastructure that is necessa=
ry to support the programs that they will be running later.

Of course, if you want to go back to him with more of the below, may want t=
o coordinated/check with HFA to make sure we're on the same page and saying=
 the same things.

Thanks,

Graham

Subject: Hi Graham / Politico

Hi Graham,

Ken Vogel at Politico is doing a follow up story on the Hillary Victory Fun=
d and wants us to get back to him by Sunday. Bolded and underlined below ar=
e his questions. I've inserted draft answers to some but have left others b=
lank. Appreciate in advance your feedback.

Best,
Mark


______________________________________________________________

We're finally revisiting this subject, and I was hoping you could give me a=
n on-the-record statement about why this is a good deal for state parties a=
nd help me answer the following specific questions (I'm also emailing the q=
uestions to the Clinton campaign and, in the case of #6, Amalgamated Bank):



1.)    Of the $3.8 million that HVF has transferred to the state parties th=
rough 3/31/16, $3.3 million has been transferred almost immediately to the =
DNC. That means that through 3/31 the state parties have kept $500k - or le=
ss than 1 percent - of the $61 million raised by the HVF. Why so little?



*         All of the money that is being raised into HVF for the Democratic=
 party is to help the DNC and the state democratic parties prepare to elect=
 Democrats up and down the ticket in the general election.  The money that =
has been transferred to the DNC, both directly from HUFF, and from state pa=
rties, has been used at the DNC to build the critical infrastructure to sup=
port state parties. [EXAMPLES FROM TALKING POINTS BELOW]

*         Because the money that HUFF is raising for the party is to help D=
emocrats win the general election, HUFF has raised significant funds for th=
e state parties that has not yet been transferred. Nearly 10 million dollar=
s has already been raised, in addition to the 3.3 that was previously trans=
ferred, that are allocable to state parties that have not yet been disburse=
d to them. At this point in the cycle, the best way for the party to prepar=
e is for the DNC to build the infrastructure that will help all state parti=
es and candidates up and down the ticket. Later in the election cycle, when=
 field programs are in full swing, obviously more funds will be spent direc=
tly by the state parties, including funds raised through HUFF.


2.) Based on these numbers, are Hillary Clinton and her allies overstating =
their support for state parties?

1+2: (on background/please paraphrase) The money from the JFAs is used for =
critical investments in infrastructure, maintaining the DNC's national vote=
r file, and bolstering our research, communications and digital capabilitie=
s, all of which will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Novembe=
r and help strengthen state parties across the country. You can find some o=
f our efforts in the overview of our Democratic Victory Task Force report<h=
ttps://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=3Dhttps-3A__www.democrats.org_Pos=
t_dnc-2Dunveils-2D2016-2Ddemocratic-2Dvictory-2Dtask-2Dforce-2Dreport-2Dand=
-2Daction-2Dplan&d=3DCwMFAg&c=3DXRWvQHnpdBDRh-yzrHjqLpXuHNC_9nanQc6pPG_SpT0=
&r=3Dztfeb3sYMwYJc4m6DQzcZ1EDxKmQmE8pe5TrXm4gdCU&m=3DdVU2_6qyyDHwqjEhlA5O2I=
aa6HRPP-1vXY_n7IFKpw0&s=3DOjfy8yXJ2u9ixkqJGSwqpfrQM11AKlgtZk2TlozDpNg&e=3D>=
 that came out in November 2015.


*         No - see above.
3.) Will the HVF allow them to keep more of the overall cash raised going f=
orward?

(off the record) For these questions re strategic considerations, I would d=
irect you to the Clinton campaign. Again, the JFAs help strengthen state pa=
rties across the country.

*         You should confirm with the Clinton campaign to make sure they ar=
e comfortable with it, but I think that it would make sense here to say con=
firm that, generally speaking, yes, as we approach the general election and=
 the state parties build out their on the ground field programs, their budg=
ets will go up, and HVF is raising money to support those programs.
4.) We understand that the DNC has provided the state parties with talking =
points on how to respond to media inquiries about the joint fundraising com=
mittee. Why is that?


5.) Some state party sources have expressed concern that the arrangement co=
uld actually hurt participating state parties by keeping them from acceptin=
g cash from donors whose checks to the HVF counted towards their $10,000 li=
mit to participating state parties that never got to spend the cash because=
 it was transferred to the DNC. Does that concern you?

(possible off-the-record answer) At this giving level, these are sophistica=
ted donors; they know what they are doing.  If they don't want to give to a=
 state party through HVF and would rather give direct they certainly can.  =
They are allowed under the JFA agreement to omit any state they want to.  M=
ost state parties do not have access to the level of donors who are writing=
 huge checks.

*         I think the points you make are good.  Any donor is allowed to al=
locate their contribution however they want, and can always choose to give =
to state parties directly. Also, donations are first allocated to the HFA p=
rimary election limit and the DNC's general account, so it is only after do=
nors have given 36,100 that funds start to go to the state parties, and at =
that point, their contributions are divided evenly among 32 state parties. =
Accordingly, there are VERY few donors who make contributions so large that=
 they max out to state parties. Almost every donor who gives to HVF will st=
ill be able to also give to other state party programs directly under their=
 contribution limits.
6.) Sources also tell us that some participating state parties didn't even =
know the money had been transferred into and out of their accounts until af=
ter the fact, despite the fact that some of those parties had actually stip=
ulated in the banking documents that their affirmative consent was required=
 before such transfers could be made from their accounts (using the space o=
n the signature card that asks for "Number of signatures required for withd=
rawal"). Have any state parties complained to you or the HVF about this and=
 have you taken steps to make sure that they're kept apprised in real time =
of transfers?


*         Unless we have actually received complaints, can we say something=
 like the following: We have not received any complaints from state parties=
 about the structure of HVF. Parties of course chose to sign up voluntarily=
, and we understand that they are very appreciative of the fundraising supp=
ort to help the party build the program we need to win up and down the tick=
et in the general election.
7.) Among the online ads paid for by the HVF, many urge readers to "Stop Tr=
ump" or to support Clinton. Are those electioneering?

 The online ads that are paid for by HVF are all to help raise funds for HV=
F. Of course, in order to raise funds to help win elections, the ads talk a=
bout the election and who is running. Donors understand the critical need t=
o support the party and make sure that we have the resources we need to def=
eat the party of Trump in the general. As the Hillary Victory Fund raises c=
ontributions for HFA in addition to the party, the ads appropriately refere=
nce Secretary Clinton as well, and we have always been happy to create the =
same joint fundraising opportunities with all of our great candidates.
