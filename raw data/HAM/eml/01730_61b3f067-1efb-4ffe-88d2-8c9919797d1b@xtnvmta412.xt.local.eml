TRUMP WHISPERER -- Maureen Dowd interviews him again, "The Mogul and the Babe": "[Speaker] Ryan didn't ask Trump to stop making remarks that alienate women? 'No,' Trump said, 'he wants me to be me.' So much for the showdown. When I asked if he had been chided by any Republicans for his Twitter feud with Elizabeth Warren, he replied, 'You mean Pocahontas?' So much for reining it in. I noted that John Cornyn said he gave Trump some tips on how to discuss illegal immigration more sensitively to woo Hispanic voters. 'I love getting advice,' Trump deadpanned. 'It's just what I need, just what I need is more advice. The 17 people I beat are still giving me advice.' Trump also briefly saw Poppy
 Bush's guru, James Baker. 'I was more interested in asking him about Ronald and Nancy Reagan and the whole Reagan era than I was in terms of getting advice currently.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b75478b1e9bfd961d3dfe7d8baab410c299b35eb0185dd2dff5cc

It's Sunday morning in America. It's 64 days to Cleveland, 71 days to Philly, 177 days to election. And Florida Playbook has the wheel for another day.

TRUMP REFERENDUM - This year, the presidential race isn't a clear referendum on the outgoing president/incumbent, and whether he will effectively get four more years through Hillary Clinton. This is a referendum on Donald Trump, the reality show candidate, the infotainment ringmaster, the Twitter-meister. As Marshall McLuhan put it long ago, the medium is the message. Just watch today's Sunday talk shows. There are two major themes: WWTD (What Will Trump Do?) and WDTD (What Did Trump Do?).

ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? -- "Hillary's playing the politician game, while Trump's playing the entertainer game. The entertainer game is a lot more exciting, and maybe more persuasive too," says one top Never Trump Republican, who summed up the mood of the shocked, and somewhat revolted, GOP establishment. This was a lament, not a point of pride. Whether it's a path to general-election victory is another matter. 

--"Well this is the ultimate reality show, it's the presidency of the United States." That's from Paul Manafort, Trump's No. 2 guy (or maybe No. 1, depending on the day). Manafort is in charge of the Republican National Convention, the perfect place for Trump's veep reveal - a rose ceremony for a White House race that looks like "The Bachelor." So when Manafort told MSNBC that the RNC would be a show, it was really just an admission that the presidential campaign's a stage, and Donald Trump is unquestionably the star. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b75479b2036dfe499950c59d594e1aa08b3ffb2de555c77490779

--@alexlundry: "Latest estimate of the media's in-kind contribution to Donald Trump's campaign? $392 million." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b75477ba5140e6d9609b992c897e80792029e4d7921cac1a932ce

--@alexburnsNYT: "This is a nonsensical figure if it includes *all* coverage, including critical/investigative/Trump-gaffe coverage."

Both Lundry and Burns are right. To Burns' point, the estimates of Trump's media time don't quantify critical coverage, and there's plenty of it. But to Lundry's, there are also shows that function like an in-kind-contribution machine for Trump that nods uncritically along when he, say, ties his opponent's father to JFK's assassin.

WHO THEY ARE - "Out of the spotlight, some say there is a softer side of Trump," by Boston Globe's Matt Viser: "Interviews with former business colleagues, campaign rivals, and others who have known Trump up close say there is a jarring juxtaposition between the Trump they know and the Trump they see these days on TV. ... [M]any people who've met with him describe almost universally as charming - though not the slightest self-effacing. ... Trump - who has called Senator Lindsey Graham a 'nut job,' 'disgrace,' and 'one of the dumbest human beings I've ever seen' - was suddenly on the other end of the line last week, in a private conversation with the South Carolina Republican ... [who said:]
 'He told a few jokes. ... Of all the people running, he's the guy you'd want to go to dinner with.' ...

"[In private Trump] attempts to put those around him at ease. He's not one for small talk, but he'll ask about family members. He repeatedly uses the names of the people he's speaking with and makes his guests feel as if they are close friends, even when meeting him for the first time. It is, surprisingly to some Trump watchers, typically an insult-free space." With a Hogan Gidley cameo http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b75475d9311198e31a90e4b270ca3cd627b0499d9f417fd88dc14

RUBIO VS. "TODAY" SHOW - As he makes the most of his last few months in the U.S. Senate, Marco Rubio got a stark reminder Saturday that the national TV media cares a lot more about you know who than it does about, say, urban poverty. So Rubio was shocked (shocked!) when the "Today Show" on Saturday didn't devote enough in-depth coverage to what he calls the "slum like" conditions of Jacksonville's Eureka Gardens, run by a HUD contractor. So Rubio let the "Today Show" have it on Twitter:

--@marcorubio: "Agreed 2 bring @TodayShow on tour of HUD project run by slumlord. They turn it into campaign piece. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b754732791464b01a49b6a41b227fa760e3262765bcfc80528092 via @todayshow"

GRAYSON GROWL -- In the race to replace Rubio for Senate, Democratic U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson of Orlando has been battling his own party and an Office of Congressional Ethics investigation into his finances. It didn't go so well for Grayson when MSNBC's Joy Reid tried to ask him about it Saturday. Six awkward minutes of Grayson counter-accusing, ducking, dodging and dissembling ensued. The video was posted in full by Grayson's Democratic opponent, Rep. Patrick Murphy, for a reason. 

--"Grayson accuses TV host, misleadlingly, of spreading 'lies,'" by POLITICO Florida's Marc Caputo: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b7547ecfc1d795a3e831d8ae4fcc4cf7e7f793f51fc3a282282f2  ...Video  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b7547c6451958b5e89936f1d0c5e32305d501bcb31d26e337dd33

SNL COLD OPEN last night takes place at Trump Tower -- "Donald Trump," played by Darrell Hammond, is seen talking on the phone in his office: "No it's true, I'm telling you, Mr. Trump is the real-life inspiration for Iron Man. Who am I? I'm his publicist, Joy Pepperone. No I'm not Donald Trump is disguise. This is just what classy people sound like, okay." Later "Chris Christie" (Bobby Moynihan) comes in to talk VP choices: "How about a guy from a swing state, Florida? He's half-Hispanic with a proven track record of standing up for himself." "Trump": "George Zimmerman." "Christie": "No no no no no ... Marco Rubio." "Trump": "Oh, little Marco? I can't ask him to be VP until his parents sign
 the release form." 4-min. video http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b75472e482dbb21f3c9883bffc4e627339afe323ddb63fd02dd11

--D.C. Examiner's @BecketAdams: ".@realDonaldTrump Can we see John Miller's long form birth certificate?"

CLICKER -- "When Donald Trump brought Miss Universe to Russia," by Michael Crowley: "Critics ridiculed the idea that Trump gleaned any real understanding of Russia from hosting a beauty pageant there. But the deeper story of how he brought the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow - a classic Trumpian tale of money, power and pulchritude - does shed fresh light on the business interests and personal contacts that have helped to shape his views about the country. It also reveals more about his personal courtship of Vladimir Putin, which long predates his presidential bid." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b754792ca0ce9641c1c33cc8dc0c9133f89aa91dd770fb5668b82

SHOT -- "Inside the GOP effort to draft an independent candidate to derail Trump," by WashPost's Phil Rucker and Robert Costa: "A band of exasperated Republicans - including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a handful of veteran consultants and members of the conservative intelligentsia - is actively plotting to draft an independent presidential candidate who could keep Donald Trump from the White House. These GOP figures are commissioning private polling, lining up major funding sources and courting potential contenders ... The effort ... has intensified significantly in the 10 days since Trump effectively locked up the Republican nomination. ... [T]hese Republicans - including
 commentators William Kristol and Erick Erickson and strategists Mike Murphy, Stuart Stevens and Rick Wilson - are so repulsed by the prospect of Trump as commander in chief that they are desperate to take action. Their top recruiting prospects are freshman Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) ... and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) ...

"Romney is among those who have made personal overtures to both men in recent days ... Earlier prospects included former senator Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and retired Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis. Former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and retired Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal have been bandied about as potentially potent political outsiders. The recruiters also delved into the world of reality television for someone who might out-Trump Trump: Mark Cuban, the brash billionaire businessman and owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. Again and again, though, these anti-Trump Republicans have heard the same tepid response: Thanks, but no thanks."

CHASER -- Chris Cillizza @TheFix): "Things that aren't going to happen: A credible independent bid." ... Sasse spox @jameswegmann: "Door is shut. The answer is no."

INSIDE THE CAMPAIGNS -- "Hillary Clinton's 'Delegate Hell': Thousands of Clinton loyalists are expecting delegate slots at the Democratic convention. Many of them are going to be very disappointed," by Annie Karni: "Across the country, campaign operatives ... are currently sifting through hundreds of applications from lawmakers, activists, union bosses and state chairs who have donated to the campaign, hosted rallies, phone-banked and door-knocked - and now expect to cast historic votes for the first female presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention ... Clinton operatives said they dread the task of telling influential Democrats they will not make the cut - and they worry
 about alienating steadfast allies who they will need in the fall by telling them there are no floor tickets with their names on them." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b7547bff1a82ddb5ee307aa7bd8ffaf03ebdc9752e2d168da0af0

DAILY DONALD -- "State leaders crush 'NeverTrump' rebellions," by Kyle Cheney: "Republican activists chose party unity over 'never Trump' resistance Saturday, with party leaders in one state after another pressuring their members fall in line behind the presumptive nominee - and even punishing those who refused. Eleven states held annual Republican conventions or party leadership meetings Saturday, offering a platform for those who still object to Donald Trump as their party's standard-bearer a prime opportunity to make mischief. But at almost every turn, they slammed into state leaders who closed ranks around a candidate that many once said they'd never support."

MILESTONE - N.Y. Times A1, "Obama, as Wartime President, Has Wrestled With Protecting Nation, and Troops," by Mark Landler: "On May 6, with eight months left before he vacates the White House, Mr. Obama passed a somber, little-noticed milestone: He has now been at war longer than Mr. Bush, or any other American president. If the United States remains in combat in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria until the end of Mr. Obama's term ... he will leave behind an improbable legacy as the only president in American history to serve two complete terms with the nation at war." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b75470908db7e6053172b619e6faea3db01d4abf37db3e8b42010

SUNDAY BEST - ROBERT GATES on CBS' "Face the Nation": "I have some real issues with things [Trump has] said about national security policy and some concerns. I think there are some contradictions. You can't have a trade war with China and then turn around and ask them to help you on North Korea. I have no idea what his policy would be in terms of dealing with ISIS. I worry a little bit about his admiration for Vladimir Putin. ... I guess one of the things that makes it challenging for me is that he seems to think that he has all the answers and that he doesn't need any advice from staff or anybody else."

FOR YOUR RADAR -- "North Korea's one-percenters savor life in 'Pyonghattan,'" by WashPost's Anna Fifield in Pyongyang: "They like fast fashion from Zara and H&M. They work out to be seen as much as to exercise. They drink cappuccinos to show how cosmopolitan they are. Some have had their eyelids done to make them look more Western. North Korea now has a 1 percent. And you'll find them in 'Pyonghattan' the parallel universe inhabited by the rich kids of the Democratic People's Republic. ... [T]he rise in recent years of a merchant class has created a whole layer of nouveaux riches in the capital city." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b75471d799e20e2a3817e3ce911158b4fbe614c9c6d6e9bdc8cc2

Many of the legislature's problems stem from the generous rewards to be found in Brazil's hydra-headed party system ... There is the Party of the Brazilian Woman, for instance - a group whose elected members in Congress are all men." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b7547dde85312b2318c09a779dd7ef6d8748310316ad4d6ed1299

WHAT CHRISTINE O'DONNELL IS READING -- "Welcome to a Bernie Sanders Wiccan ritual," by L.A. Times' Chris Megerian: "Attending a rally for Bernie Sanders usually involves long lines and security screenings, but that wasn't the case at an intimate, informal event Friday evening supporting the Vermont senator's presidential campaign in a park here. Instead of metal detectors, entrance required burning ceremonial sweetgrass. Participants were 'smudged,' meaning the smoke from the sweetgrass was wafted over them before they could enter the sacred circle and begin a Wiccan ritual to support Sanders ahead of Oregon's primary on Tuesday." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b75479e8e1d1276ad638e381361a5a1934750befdab8f023e41c9

Some in the Beltway worry that the drive for wider readership has necessitated a kind of betrayal of Capitol Hill DNA. 'Put me down as questioning whether they can pull it off,' said Jim Manley ... 'It seems to me that they are
 moving away from their bread and butter and tying to find new ways to bring in clicks.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b7547124b894a045fd73abb6320bd592c939582e2d25656215569

BEST PART of the story is the caption for one of the pix: "The Hill newspaper on sale in Washington." It's actually a picture of the free newspaper boxes that are a feature on Washington, D.C. streets, so it doesn't really show The Hill on sale ... and the box also looks empty!

** A message from the Alzheimer's Association: Costing taxpayers $18.3 million every HOUR, Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's and more than 15 million unpaid caregivers are providing care for a loved one. Alzheimer's is a national issue, and now it's time we make it a national priority. Alzheimer's yearly cost of $236 billion will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation - an epidemic we cannot afford and shouldn't accept. While it is the only leading cause of death that can't be prevented, cured or even slowed, research and medical advancement can change that. That's why the Alzheimer's
 Association is fighting to eliminate the disease through the advancement of research and providing care and support for all affected. Learn more at www.alz.org/advocacy. **

</b> &quot;[Speaker] Ryan didn't ask Trump to stop making remarks that alienate women? 'No,' Trump said, 'he wants me to be me.' So much for the showdown. When I asked if he had been chided by any Republicans for his Twitter feud with Elizabeth Warren, he replied, 'You mean Pocahontas?' So much for reining it in. I noted that John Cornyn said he gave Trump some tips on how to discuss illegal immigration more sensitively to woo Hispanic voters. 'I love getting advice,' Trump deadpanned. 'It's just what I need, just what I need is more advice. The 17 people I beat are still giving me advice.' Trump also briefly saw Poppy Bush's guru, James Baker.

And Florida Playbook has the wheel for another day.</p><p><b>TRUMP REFERENDUM
</b> - This year, the presidential race isn't a clear referendum on the outgoing president/incumbent, and whether he will effectively get four more years through Hillary Clinton. This is a referendum on Donald Trump, the reality show candidate, the infotainment ringmaster, the Twitter-meister. As Marshall McLuhan put it long ago, the medium is the message. Just watch today's Sunday talk shows. There are two major themes: WWTD (What Will Trump Do?) and WDTD (What Did Trump Do?).</p><p><b>ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? -- &quot;Hillary's playing the politician game, while Trump's playing the entertainer game.
</b> The entertainer game is a lot more exciting, and maybe more persuasive too,&quot; says one top Never Trump Republican, who summed up the mood of the shocked, and somewhat revolted, GOP establishment. This was a lament, not a point of pride. Whether it's a path to general-election victory is another matter. </p><p><b>--&quot;Well this is the ultimate reality show, it's the presidency of the United States.&quot; 
</b>That's from Paul Manafort, Trump's No. 2 guy (or maybe No. 1, depending on the day). Manafort is in charge of the Republican National Convention, the perfect place for Trump's veep reveal - a rose ceremony for a White House race that looks like &quot;The Bachelor.&quot; So when Manafort told MSNBC that the RNC would be a show, it was really just an admission that the presidential campaign's a stage, and Donald Trump is unquestionably the star.  <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b75479b2036dfe499950c59d594e1aa08b3ffb2de555c77490779" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1OrTYV7</a></p><p><b>--@alexlundry</b>: &quot;Latest estimate of the media's in-kind contribution to Donald Trump's campaign? $392 million.&quot;

But to Lundry's, there are also shows that function like an in-kind-contribution machine for Trump that nods uncritically along when he, say, ties his opponent's father to JFK's assassin.</p><p>
<b>WHO THEY ARE - &quot;Out of the spotlight, some say there is a softer side of Trump,&quot; by Boston Globe's Matt Viser
</b>: &quot;Interviews with former business colleagues, campaign rivals, and others who have known Trump up close say there is a jarring juxtaposition between the Trump they know and the Trump they see these days on TV. ... [M]any people who've met with him describe almost universally as charming - though not the slightest self-effacing. ... Trump - who has called Senator Lindsey Graham a 'nut job,' 'disgrace,' and 'one of the dumbest human beings I've ever seen' - was suddenly on the other end of the line last week, in a private conversation with the South Carolina Republican ... [who said:] 'He told a few jokes. ... Of all the people running, he's the guy you'd want to go to dinner with.' ...
</p><p><b>&quot;[In private Trump] attempts to</b> put those around him at ease. He's not one for small talk, but he'll ask about family members. He repeatedly uses the names of the people he's speaking with and makes his guests feel as if they are close friends, even when meeting him for the first time. It is, surprisingly to some Trump watchers, typically an insult-free space.&quot; <i><b>With a Hogan Gidley cameo  </b></i><a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b75475d9311198e31a90e4b270ca3cd627b0499d9f417fd88dc14" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1TUn9iI</a></p><p><b>RUBIO VS. &quot;TODAY&quot; SHOW

The effort ... has intensified significantly in the 10 days since Trump effectively locked up the Republican nomination. ... [T]hese Republicans - including commentators William Kristol and Erick Erickson and strategists Mike Murphy, Stuart Stevens and Rick Wilson - are so repulsed by
 the prospect of Trump as commander in chief that they are desperate to take action. Their top recruiting prospects are freshman Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) ... and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) ...</p><p><b>&quot;Romney is among those

The recruiters also delved into the world of reality television for someone who might out-Trump Trump: Mark Cuban, the brash billionaire businessman and owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team.

</b> &quot;Republican activists chose party unity over 'never Trump' resistance Saturday, with party leaders in one state after another pressuring their members fall in line behind the presumptive nominee - and even punishing those who refused. Eleven states held annual Republican conventions or party leadership meetings Saturday, offering a platform for those who still object to Donald Trump as their party's standard-bearer a prime opportunity to make mischief. But at almost every turn, they slammed into state leaders who closed ranks around a candidate that many once said they'd never support.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=bbeb63e6049b754738ae2248039f689aa0039f394bf5523dc915dee114dcbb7c" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1Tehfdv

More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's and more than 15 million unpaid caregivers are providing care for a loved one. Alzheimer's is a national issue, and now it's time we make it a national priority. Alzheimer's yearly cost of $236 billion will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation - an epidemic we cannot afford and shouldn't accept. While it is the only leading cause of death that can't be prevented, cured or even slowed, research and medical advancement can change that. That's why the Alzheimer's Association is fighting to eliminate the
