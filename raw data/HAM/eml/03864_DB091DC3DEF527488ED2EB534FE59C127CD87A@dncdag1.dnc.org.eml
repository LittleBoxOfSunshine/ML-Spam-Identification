Barack Obama rose to prominence as a different kind of Democrat, an outside=
r who was not part of the establishment and who would chart a separate cour=
se. Eight years later, the president finds himself working hard to restore =
a party from which he was once eager to stand apart.

Obama has presided over a greater loss of electoral power for his party tha=
n any two-term president since World War II. And 2016 represents one last o=
pportunity for him to reverse that trend.

But it is also a challenge for the president who has experimented with esta=
blishing his own political base outside the Democratic National Committee a=
nd has downsized the scale of political operations inside the White House.

The first big tests of the rebuilding efforts comes Tuesday in Pennsylvania=
, where Obama is taking the unusual step of wading into two contested Democ=
ratic primaries, endorsing Senate hopeful Katie McGinty and Josh Shapiro, a=
 Montgomery County official and early supporter of his who is hoping to bec=
ome state attorney general.

Should Democrats claim those two offices in the fall, it would represent a =
small dent in what has become a worrisome decline of power for the party be=
low the presidential level under Obama's watch.

Between 2008 and 2015, Democrats lost 13 Senate seats, 69 House seats, 913 =
state legislative seats, 11 governorships and 32 state legislative chambers=
, according to data compiled by University of Virginia professor Larry J. S=
abato. The only president in the past 75 years who comes close is Dwight D.=
 Eisenhower, who saw a similar decline for the GOP during his time in offic=
e.

"The Republican Party is arguably stronger now than they've ever been in 80=
 years, despite not having the White House," said Simon Rosenberg, a longti=
me Democratic operative and president of NDN, a liberal think tank.

Democrats also are concerned about whether the coalition Obama galvanized i=
n 2008, and then reassembled in 2012, will turn out when he is no longer on=
 the ballot. The current Democratic presidential primary contest has so far=
 fractured that coalition, with young people flocking to Sen. Bernie Sander=
s of Vermont while many voters of color - especially older ones - back form=
er secretary of state Hillary Clinton.

Many factors have contributed to Republicans' gains on the state and federa=
l level, including a concerted push by their donors to target state races a=
nd a midterm election that allowed them to lock in favorable congressional =
district lines.

Obama's defenders contend that after major victories in 2006 and 2008, it w=
as predictable that Democrats would lose significant ground in the midterm =
elections of 2010 and 2014. But, they add, the president's two successful W=
hite House bids have vastly upgraded the party's voter outreach infrastruct=
ure by expanding the national voter file the Democratic National Committee =
first started in 2006. And they point to the huge increases in the number o=
f Democratic campaign volunteers - from roughly 252,000 in 2004 to 2.2 mill=
ion in 2012 - as evidence of that upgrade.

"Barack Obama has single-handedly modernized the Democrats' ability to wage=
 campaigns on the local level," said Jim Messina, who managed Obama's re=AD=
election campaign.

Rosenberg agrees, saying that the president built on the work of Bill Clint=
on, the only other two-term Democratic president of the last generation. "C=
linton established the intellectual framework for the Democratic Party and =
Obama modernized its politics," Rosenberg said. "What isn't there yet is a =
large enough set of leaders from the next generation to carry it on."

Some of Obama's earliest decisions continue to reverberate negatively for D=
emocrats.

Organizing for Action (OFA), the nonprofit group that grew out of Obama's c=
ampaign operation, has continued to compete with the Democratic National Co=
mmittee for Democratic dollars - first as a parallel organization within th=
e DNC and then as a separate entity. In the first six months of 2013, the D=
NC raised $30.8 million, while OFA raised $13 million. And this was at a ti=
me when the DNC was carrying more than $18 million in debt.

Those fiscal constraints meant the DNC had to curtail the money it provided=
 to state parties, a practice that DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fl=
a.) reversed in 2015 by increasing the monthly minimum transfer to each sta=
te from $5,000 a month to $7,500.

Close cooperation has taken time; OFA gave the DNC limited access to its li=
st of supporters starting in 2013, but it turned over the entire list only =
in August 2015. Now, according to Nevada Democratic Party chair Roberta Lan=
ge, "That voter file is used by everyone in our state."

While many OFA volunteers have focused on local referendums and other local=
 political battles, the group has earned the enmity of some party stalwarts=
 for diverting resources. During a 2010 gathering of Democratic governors i=
n Washington, according to multiple attendees, one governor asked a senior =
presidential political adviser, "Will the OFA please join the Democratic Pa=
rty?"

But this White House, unlike that of Bill Clinton, has always kept its poli=
tical operation on a separate track.

Under Clinton, the political affairs office boasted roughly a dozen people =
- in addition to the deputy chief of staff who oversaw political affairs - =
and the president got a political briefing once a week.

By contrast, Obama limited election activity in the White House, a reflecti=
on of both his desire to keep any scandal at bay and the influence of White=
 House chief of staff Denis McDonough, who has little campaign experience o=
utside of working on Obama's first presidential bid.

Obama phased out the political affairs office after two years to move the o=
peration to his Chicago campaign headquarters. He appointed David Simas, wh=
o directs the White House Office of Political Strategy and Outreach, to his=
 current position only in January 2014, after congressional Democrats compl=
ained they did not have a direct White House contact for political matters.

Obama's senior political advisers from his first term - Messina, David Plou=
ffe and David Axelrod, among others - have left to focus on ventures in the=
 private sector and academia and scaled back their involvement in day-to-da=
y Democratic politics.

Plouffe said it was natural for veteran strategists to move on, but acknowl=
edged that Obama's relationship with his top political operatives didn't au=
tomatically translate to other candidates. "You don't do your best work bei=
ng a mercenary," said Plouffe, now a strategic adviser to the car service f=
irm Uber.

He added that it will take the commitment of wealthy Democratic donors - no=
t just top party officials - to target state contests the way Republicans h=
ave. "I think we all agree something has to be done," he said. "The questio=
n is how. It's not going to be the DNC."

Obama, for his part, has set limits for what he will do in connection with =
super PACs while in office. While he did fundraising events for the one tha=
t backed his reelection campaign, Priorities USA, McDonough and Obama's law=
yers curtailed what the president would do two years later for the Senate M=
ajority PAC, a similar entity supporting Senate Democrats.

In an April 2014 memo to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.)=
, the PAC's counsel, Marc E. Elias, stipulated that to avoid any conflict o=
f interest Obama would not actually ask potential Senate Majority PAC donor=
s for money even when appearing at one of the group's events. After making =
this point on the memo's first page, he reiterated two pages later, with un=
derlined emphasis: "Again, to be clear: the President will not solicit cont=
ributions at or in connection with any of these meetings."

After a protracted and bitter exchange, Reid's aides abandoned their effort=
 to involve Obama in any more than a few super PAC events, and the presiden=
t agreed to transfer $5 million from the DNC to both the Democratic Senator=
ial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee =
in the fall of 2014. During the 2012 cycle, the DNC made no transfers to th=
e two committees.

But with his popularity high among Democrats and no election ahead of him, =
Obama has been working to shore up his party, both financially and politica=
lly. And his aides say Obama has turned controversial issues, including imm=
igration, gay rights and climate change, to the Democrats' advantage.

"He will be aggressive, from the presidential level down to the state and l=
ocal representative level," Simas said. "There's going to be a Democratic n=
ominee and Democratic candidates. They are the ones who are going to be dri=
ving the campaigns, and the president will be there to be as helpful as pos=
sible."

Recently in Dallas, before dozens of guests who had each given thousands of=
 dollars to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Obama diagnosed o=
ne of the problems: "Democrats just aren't very good at focusing on down-ba=
llot races," he said, according to two participants.

The president may have been stating the obvious. But it reflected a shift i=
n thinking among Democrats, who are working furiously to shore up state-lev=
el candidates to avoid getting beaten once again on redistricting. Since 20=
13, Obama has devoted considerable time to fundraising for the DNC and both=
 congressional committees, doing more than 100 events for the DNC alone.

Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, =
said that when he asked Obama to make a series of primary endorsements this=
 cycle, including one of McGinty, "He just did it with no muss, no fuss, in=
 a very great way."

In December, the heads of three party committees met to develop a joint red=
istricting strategy, and Obama signed a redistricting fundraising appeal fo=
r the Democratic Governors Association in January. Even former members such=
 as Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) have been asked to attend fundraisers on be=
half of state lawmakers in states such as Ohio.

"We have to be better and smarter about playing that long game and making t=
hose investments," said Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), adding that while House=
 Democrats will have "a very strong wind at their backs" this year, "The da=
y after this election, we have to understand that the wind's going to be in=
 our faces."

In 2014, many Democrats in conservative states were eager to tap Obama's fu=
ndraising prowess but were reluctant to appear side-by-side with a presiden=
t with sagging popularity ratings. Already, 2016 is different.

Longtime Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said that for a long time Demo=
crats wanted Obama's resources - including money and analytics - "but they =
didn't want his presence." When she called the White House last year to ask=
 if the president would do robocalls to African American voters during Loui=
siana's special election for governor, White House officials seemed surpris=
ed that Democrat John Bel Edwards even wanted their help. Brazile assured t=
hem that he did.

And Democrats increasingly believe that they will need Obama in the fall to=
 regain some of the ground they've lost since 2008.

"Part of his legacy is to rebuild the bench," Brazile said.

Democratic Congressional Committee Chairman Ben Ray Luj=E1n (N.M.) said in =
an interview that the president will help in unifying the Democratic base.

"He's going to help boost turnout in November, which is critical when you'r=
e winning races on the margins," Luj=E1n said.
