Amy, This is what Mark and I had drafted up as a placeholder while we figure out a more extensive response. I'll come in and talk to you, we haven't shared this beyond you yet. 

"We have received the letter and will be looking more closely at the troubling details it outlines. In the meantime we are asking both of our campaigns to stand with the Democratic Party in denouncing the type of behavior on display over the weekend. We remain firm in our belief that the democratic process should never unfold under the threat of intimidation or physical violence, and that any legitimate concerns must be addressed in an orderly and peaceful manner."
