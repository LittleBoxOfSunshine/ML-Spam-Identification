Hi Luis:

How are you?=C2=A0 Very pleased to tell you I'm wearing the hat of Director=
 of DNCC Radio Row for the 5th convention in a row.=C2=A0 I'm very excited.=
=C2=A0 It should be good because I got them to put all the shows in one loc=
ation-- which will make it one stop shopping for all our surrogates!=C2=A0 =
Remember how we used to have to go to different floors and/or all around th=
e concourse of conventions past!=20

At any rate, love to pick your brain on lining up DNC members, DNC vice cha=
irs, you yourself, and of course the Chairman to come through Radio Row.=C2=
=A0 I'm good when it comes to Hillary surrogates, House and Senate, State C=
hairs and such, but would love contacts for whoever you suggest.=C2=A0 I kn=
ow it sounds still far off, being 2+ months from now, but I already have ti=
mes and days that surrogates have committed to do shows at the convention.=
=C2=A0 Can you help me on this score, Luis?=C2=A0=20

First of all, for you...do you think you can provide a two hour block on th=
e first, second or last day of the convention?=C2=A0 There are always meeti=
ngs in the morning, but maybe an afternoon M, T, W, Thu?=C2=A0 I need you N=
OW. Literally wont have a second to be trying to set up interviews once we'=
re in situ because there are too many moving parts.=C2=A0 Can we lock in ev=
en a "maybe" time/day now for you.=C2=A0 Com'on you can do it!

And who would I reach out to for Debbie?=C2=A0 Can you arrange that?=C2=A0 =
Or do I try her scheduler? Who is that and do you have an email please.

Also, need contact for DGA to get contacts for our D govs please=20
