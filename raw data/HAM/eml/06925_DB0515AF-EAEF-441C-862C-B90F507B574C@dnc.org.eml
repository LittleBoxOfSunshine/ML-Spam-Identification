Right-Wing Billionaires
 
"Despite numerous promises he would fund his own 
campaign, Trump is now clearly the 'puppet' of 
Republican SuperPACs and right-wing billionaires."
 - DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach

and link], Trump has since changed his tune. 
 
This week Trump said would accept contributions for 
his general election campaign. And, today, GOP 
mega-donor Sheldon Adelson -- who spent XXX [amount 
and link] on SuperPACs during the 2012 election -- indicated he 
would support Trump's campaign. Of, course Trump 
said just six months ago that Adelson was "looking to
give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold 
him into his perfect little puppet." [link]
