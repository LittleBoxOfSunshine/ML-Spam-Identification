*By Marc Caputo *(mcaputo@politico.com; @MarcACaputo) with *Ali Breland* (
abreland@politico.com; @AliBreland) and the staff of POLITICO Florida

*Good Wednesday morning.* My, these are strange political times. The head
of the DNC is getting hit from the left. And it might be working.

*CASHMAN CANOVA --"Canova, Wasserman Schultz's challenger, set to announce
$1M haul," by POLITICO Florida's Marc Caputo *: Tim Canova, the upstart
liberal who's challenging DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz for her
congressional seat, is about to become a million-dollar candidate.

Fueled heavily by small-dollar donors who give to Democratic presidential
candidate Bernie Sanders, Canova said that, by the weekend, he'll be on
pace to have raised $1 million since he officially entered the race Jan. 7.
... The Canova campaign said it received 17,756 individual contributions in
April alone, that the overall average contribution was just $18.76 and that
of the 23,404 total donors as of the end of April, only nine "have maxed
out." The campaign says it soon will have 50,000 contributions from 25,000
individual donors. http://politi.co/1URikZZ

*MARIJUANA - "Poll shows 80 percent back medical marijuana plan," by
POLITICO Florida's Marc Caputo: * Eight in 10 Florida voters approve of a
proposed state constitutional amendment to legalize medical marijuana and
more than half would decriminalize personal cannabis use for adults,
according to a new poll. The survey by Quinnipiac University shows the
medical marijuana amendment is backed by a super majority of voters
regardless of party, gender, age, education and race and ethnicity. Only 16
percent oppose the amendment, while 80 percent support it overall.

$7.6 million into a political committee spearheading a solar energy ballot

*MURPHY'S LAW - "New poll shows Murphy with a slight edge in U.S. Senate
race," by POLITICO Florida's Marc Caputo:* The race for Florida's open U.S.
Senate seat still has no clear favorite, but a new poll shows Democratic
U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy might be the best general election candidate while
Republican newcomer Carlos Beruff is emerging as a real GOP contender.

According to a new Quinnipiac University poll, Murphy narrowly leads all
five Republican contenders in theoretical head-to-head matchups, while
fellow Democratic U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson does only marginally worse and
slightly trails some of them. http://politi.co/1OgkyR9

Trump," by POLITICO's Nick Gass: *Marco Rubio made clear Tuesday he has
grave reservations about Donald Trump's view of the world. But he promised
to support him anyway, telling CNN's Jake Tapper that he will stand by his

for Trump stays strong," by POLITICO Florida's Matt Dixon: *As Donald Trump
works to unite a Republican Party skeptical of his presidential bid and
conservative credentials, Gov. Rick Scott is continuing to double down on
the presumptive GOP nominee, whom he has long publicly supported.

"*We have a business person, Donald Trump, who knows how to build jobs,"
Scott told *reporters after a Florida Cabinet meeting Tuesday. "On the

life." http://politi.co/1T7ZBd9

*WHEN INEXPENSIVE IS CHEAP -- "Surprise, Florida is not the best state to
grow old in," by South Florida Business Journal's Nina Lincoff *: "The
study looked the cost and quality of senior care, and found an inverse
relationship between the two. Florida is a good example of that care
dynamic, because the state has the 12th most affordable elder care, but a
much lower quality of life and health care, coming in at 38th on
Caring.com's list. That below-average quality of care dragged the Sunshine
State below average in the rankings.

"South Dakota is the No. 1 state in the country to grow old in, followed by
Iowa and Minnestoa, according to the study." http://bit.ly/1WZJCNH

*ORANGE WOES -- "USDA improves its forecast for state's citrus crop," by
POLITICO Florida's Bruce Ritchie: * State officials reacted cautiously on
Tuesday to a federal agency's improved citrus crop forecast. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture's forecast of 81.1 million boxes of oranges, up
from 76 million boxes last month, still represents a decline of nearly 70
percent from the peak of 244 million boxes in 1997-98, the state said.
"Because it's a monthly estimate there is some variability," Agriculture
Commissioner Adam Putnam told reporters. "But the bottom line is the crop
is a fraction of what it was a decade ago." http://politi.co/1XjXFOO
