THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 18, 2016



*Fact Sheet: Mitigating the Risk of Wildfires in the Wildland-Urban Inter=
face*



The threat of wildfire is increasing in the United States.In 2015, over 6=
8,000 wildfires in the United States burned more than 4,636 structures an=
d ten million acresthe highest number of acres burned on record.The annua=
l estimates on structure loss due to wildfire have increased dramatically=
 for more than six decades.



Along with temperature, wildfires are determined by a variety of factors,=
 including precipitation. A hotter, drier climate has a major effect on w=
ildfire generation. As stated in the 2014 U.S. National Climate Assessmen=
t,increased warming, drought, and insect outbreaks, all caused by or link=
ed to climate change, have increased wildfires, especially in the western=
 U.S. Fire models project more wildfire and increased risks to communitie=
s across extensive areas in the future.Given strong relationships between=
 climate and fire, even when modified by land use and management, includi=
ng fuel treatments, projected climate changes suggest that western forest=
s in the United States will be increasingly affected by large and intense=
 fires that occur more frequently.



Since 1990, 60 percent of new homes nationally have been built in areas k=
nown as the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where houses, structures and =
people reside adjacent to or within wildlands and are therefore at risk o=
f structure loss, injury,and death from wildfire. Federal departments and=
 agencies have an estimated 6,256 buildings in WUI locations.



To better combat these fire risks, we need to increase our understanding =
of how wildfires interact with communities in terms of structures, terrai=
n, and weather. Together, we must take action to enhance community resili=
ence against these risks.

Today, the White House, in collaboration with the Departments of Interior=
, Agriculture, and Homeland Security, is hosting a roundtable to discuss =
wildfire mitigation and firefighter safety, and to identify further polic=
y actions needed to enhance community resilience within the WUI. Senior F=
ederal agency officials; State, local, and tribal government leaders; and=
 representatives of national organizations dedicated to firefighter safet=
y and to community resilience will participate. At the roundtable, the fo=
llowing announcements will be made:

**

*Executive Order for Enhanced Wildfire Risk Mitigation in the Wildland-Ur=
ban Interface*

President Obama today signed an Executive Order on"Wildland-Urban Interfa=
ce Federal Risk Mitigation", which will mitigate wildfire risks to Federa=
l buildings located in the WUI, reduce risks to people, and help minimize=
 property loss to wildfire. For new buildings and alterations to existing=
 buildings greater than 5,000 square feet on Federal land within the WUI =
at moderate or greater risk to wildfire, the Executive Order directs Fede=
ral agencies to apply wildfire-resistant design provisions delineated in =
the2015 edition of the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code (IWUIC=
) promulgated by the International Code Council (ICC), or an equivalent c=
ode. These codes, which encompass the current understanding of wildfire h=
azard potential, will help increase safety and protect the lives of peopl=
e who live or work in these buildings.

**

*Commitment Statement*

Federal, State, local, tribal and non-Government leaders from over 39 age=
ncies and jurisdictions have committed to a multi-scale, collaborative ap=
proach to address the challenges posed by wildfire in wildland-urban inte=
rface and to the following statement:



"As Federal, State, local, tribal and non-Government leaders, we recogniz=
e the challenges of managing fire in the wildland-urban interface, includ=
ing the increased complexity of fire response, air quality and public hea=
lth impacts, and loss of community infrastructure and cultural resources.=
 The consequences of a changing climate intensify these challenges, resul=
ting in more severe wildfires threatening the well-being of our communiti=
es, and jeopardizing the safety of our first responders and the public th=
ey serve."

""

"We are committed to safely and effectively extinguishing fire, when need=
ed; using fire where allowable; managing our natural resources; and as a =
Nation, living with wildland fire safely. We are committed to advancing c=
ommunity resilience in the wildland-urban interface, managing the adjacen=
t landscapes wisely, and continuing to improve the efficiency of wildland=
 fire response. We are committed to a multi-scale, collaborative approach=
 to address the challenges posed by wildfire in the wildland-urban interf=
ace."

*
Building Resilience and Sustainability*

The effort to mitigate wildfire risk to Federal facilities is part of a b=
roader set of initiatives to build resilience throughout the Federal gove=
rnment, with State, local, and tribal leaders, and with non-governmental =
partners. Recent Federal resilience initiatives have focused on flood ris=
k management, seismic early warning, long-term drought resilience, advoca=
ting for climate-smart building codes and standards, and a number of tech=
nical assistance programs to partner with communities to enhance sustaina=
bility and resilience. Together with Federal sustainability initiatives t=
o promote clean energy and lower greenhouse gas emissions across the Fede=
ral family, these actions help prepare us for those climate impacts that =
are too late to avoid.
