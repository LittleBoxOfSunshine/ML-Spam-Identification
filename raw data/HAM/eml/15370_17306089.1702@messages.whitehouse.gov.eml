Subject: VP Pool Report #3a

As promised, the pool report from VP Biden's retail stop in Columbus, Ohi=
o, immediately after his remarks on the economy at Jeni's Splendid Ice Cr=
eam.

The motorcade pulled up at North Market at 4 p.m., which according to its=
 website is the only remaining public market in Columbus and was establis=
hed in 1876. It is also where Jeni Britton Bauer had her first ice cream =
stand, before formally turning it into a business.

VP Biden was accompanied by Jeni, Sherrod Brown and Senate candidate Ted =
Strickland. Large swaths of patrons gathered upon realizing Biden was pre=
sent, chatting excitedly among themselves.

The VP worked the room, snapping selfies with their phones and making sma=
ll talk that was mostly inaudible to your pooler.

He did, however, introduce Strickland along the way, telling one group: "=
Say hello to soon to be Sen. Strickland" and repeating several times, "Re=
member guys, vote Strickland. Vote Strickland."

He made friends with a four-year-old girl, picking her up for a photo and=
 telling her, "You're such a big girl."

To a woman whose daughter was celebrating her birthday, Biden remarked: "=
Are you her sister?" The mom was quite pleased with the compliment.

He then walked up to Jeni's counter to order ice cream. Strickland, as a =
local, knew what was up by asking: "Do you have any salty caramel?"

Biden, upon the recommendation of Jeni, instead had a combination of two =
flavored -- the Ndali estate vanilla bean and Darkest chocolate.

"The problem is I eat it all," he joked, before digging in and offering h=
is stamp of approval. "It's good."

He stopped at several vendors, taking samples of artisan bread and purcha=
sing pretzels for Brown and Tom Perez, who did not come inside.

Several teenage girls were visibly freaking out, one pair as heard by you=
r pooler looking at each other and saying: "Oh my God, he's coming this w=
ay ... Be cool."

Biden continued to oblige photo requests and worked the market for a tota=
l of roughly 30 minutes.

He then gaggled with the traveling press outside, the transcript of which=
 you received in Pool Report #3.

Motorcade left North Market at 4:30 p.m. and you have the rest.

That's all you'll be hearing from me ... Thanks again for your patience o=
n a somewhat chaotic trip!
