Donald Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, as well as his false cla=
im that voters would learn nothing from them anyway, demonstrates he is not=
 being forthright with the American people and is unfit to occupy the White=
 House. His returns, according to experts, would answer a number of outstan=
ding questions about whether Trump is paying his fair share and offer a tru=
e measure of his personal wealth and his charitable giving.

Never mind that Donald Trump is now backtracking on his previous commitment=
 to transparency. When Trump first considered running for President in 1999=
, he said he, "probably wouldn't have a problem with" releasing his tax ret=
urns if he ran. Later, in 2012, he said if you're running for President, "a=
t a minimum, probably, you're going to have to show your [tax] returns" and=
 they should be released by April 1st of the election year.

"Mr. Trump has offered shifting explanations for his lack of disclosure, in=
cluding the fact that his returns were currently under audit. He said voter=
s aren't interested in the returns. And he said they don't reveal wealth. T=
hat's true, but they would show information about his sources of income, hi=
s aggressiveness in tax planning and his charitable deductions. Mr. Trump c=
laims a net worth exceeding $10 billion, though independent estimates peg t=
hat far lower. Mr. Thorndike, who directs the Tax History Project at Tax An=
alysts, a nonprofit tax policy center, said the tradition of presidential a=
nd other candidates releasing returns exists for a reason. 'It's the princi=
ple of the disclosure, that someone running for the highest office in the l=
and and someone who incidentally would be making sure that the rest of us l=
ive up to our tax obligations, should be willing to show us that he lives u=
p to his,' Mr. Thorndike said."

"Former GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who has been one of his party's most vocal=
 critics of Trump, called Trump's decision not to release returns 'disquali=
fying' in a statement release on social media. 'It is disqualifying for a m=
odern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the vote=
rs, especially one who has not been subject to public scrutiny in either mi=
litary or public service,' Romney wrote. 'Mr. Trump says he is being audite=
d. So? There is nothing that prevents releasing tax returns that are being =
audited.' Romney has previously accused Trump of attempting to conceal a "b=
ombshell" by withholding the release of his taxes, which he repeated again =
Wednesday. Romney's hesitation to release his own tax returns became an iss=
ue in the 2012 campaign."

"Trump's refusal to agree to release the documents prompted an immediate ba=
cklash from both Democrats and Republicans, including a harsh condemnation =
from 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. ... Modern president=
ial candidates have grown accustomed to releasing documentation so voters c=
an make informed decisions about their qualifications. The candidates relea=
se letters from their physicians that provide some details about their heal=
th, and usually release financial information as well. Trump himself was a =
major force pushing President Obama to release his birth certificate - and =
he also criticized Romney for not releasing his taxes earlier in 2012."

U.S. News and World Report: Trump Still Won't Release Tax Returns<http://ww=

"A closer look at Trump's finances might also feed skepticism of Trump's cl=
aim he is worth $10 billion. A businessman overseeing a vast real estate em=
pire - albeit with multiple failed companies and four bankruptcies on his r=
esume - Trump's tax returns won't reveal the true amount of his wealth, but=
 they could clear up other lingering questions. In February, when Trump's t=
axes surfaced as a campaign issue, David Cay Johnston, author of 'Perfectly=
 Legal: the Covert Campaign to Rig Our Tax System to Benefit the Super Rich=
 - and Cheat Everybody Else,' detailed the kind of damning information Trum=
p's full tax returns could potentially contain. Not only could the public l=
earn his income and the scope of his charitable giving -which has been call=
ed into doubt - the returns could indicate whether Trump is leveraging his =
assets and thus vulnerable to defaulting on his debts. It also would show i=
f he, like other wealthy Americans, has claimed negative income to avoid pa=
ying income tax."
