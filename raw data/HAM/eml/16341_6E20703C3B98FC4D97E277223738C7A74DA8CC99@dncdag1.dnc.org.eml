WASHINGTON POST // GREG JAFFE

President Obama arrived Sunday in Germany, where he will encounter a Europe=
 struggling with terrorism, an anemic economy and an unprecedented migrant =
crisis that have provoked nationalism and xenophobia in some quarters of th=
e continent. "It's not my place to tell Europe how to manage Europe," Obama=
 said in Bild Zeitung, a German newspaper, prior to his arrival. But the pr=
esident has used his tour of Britain and Germany to provide some unusually =
frank advice to the Europeans on issues such as dealing with refugees, majo=
r trade deals and terrorism. In the United Kingdom, where Britons will go t=
o the polls in June to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, Oba=
ma warned repeatedly - in an editorial, a news conference and a BBC intervi=
ew - that a withdrawal from the bloc would be unwise.



Report: Obama to send 250 troops to Syria<http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-bri=

THE HILL // CYRA MASTER

President Obama will announce Monday that he'll send up to 250 additional m=
ilitary personnel to Syria to help fight the Islamic State of Iraq and Syri=
a (ISIS), The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. The move will expand the=
 footprint of American forces inside the country. Obama recently signed off=
 on a new deployment that would increase the number of American troops oper=
ating in Syria to about 300, up from about 50. Obama is expected to announc=
e the move Monday in Hannover, Germany, at the end of a weeklong trip abroa=
d.



Obama's latest pivot - to Europe<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/obam=

POLITICO // MICHAEL CROWLEY

Barack Obama planned to pivot to Asia, escape the Middle East, reboot with =
Latin America and elevate Africa. Europe, he hoped, would take care of itse=
lf. No such luck. Europe is in crisis, many U.S. officials believe, and whe=
n Obama delivers a speech in Hanover, Germany, on Monday, aides say he will=
 be addressing the whole continent as it grapples with terrorism, nationali=
sm, refugees and questions about the European Union's survival. It also mar=
ks a turnabout in Obama's own thinking - amid grumbling by many European di=
plomats that the president hasn't given the continent the attention it need=
s. Even some Obama aides acknowledge that Europe has sometimes been oversha=
dowed by Obama's other foreign priorities, like the Iran nuclear deal and r=
elations with China. Obama's trip is a way of "sending out a signal that he=
's not indifferent to what's happening in Europe," Peter Wittig, Germany's =
ambassador to the United States, told Politico.



ISIS Targeted by Cyberattacks in a New U.S. Line of Combat<http://www.nytim=

NEW YORK TIMES // DAVID E. SANGER

The United States has opened a new line of combat against the Islamic State=
, directing the military's six-year-old Cyber Command for the first time to=
 mount computer-network attacks that are now being used alongside more trad=
itional weapons. The effort reflects President Obama's desire to bring many=
 of the secret American cyberweapons that had been aimed elsewhere, notably=
 at Iran, into the fight against the Islamic State - which has proved effec=
tive in using modern communications and encryption to recruit and carry out=
 operations. The National Security Agency, which specializes in electronic =
surveillance, has for years listened intensely to the militants of the Isla=
mic State, and those reports are often part of the president's daily intell=
igence briefing. But the N.S.A.'s military counterpart, Cyber Command, was =
focused largely on Russia, China, Iran and North Korea - where cyberattacks=
 on the United States most frequently originate - and had run virtually no =
operations against what has become the most dangerous terrorist organizatio=
n in the world.

THE HILL // JESSIE HELLMANN

President Obama on Sunday touted a trade deal between the United States and=
 the European Union (EU), but said it may be difficult to get it approved b=
y the end of the year. "During presidential elections, it's always tough wh=
en we're in the heat of campaigns," Obama said during a joint news conferen=
ce with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Obama is in Germany to open the wo=
rld's largest industrial technology trade fair and try to win support for t=
he Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a free trade and =
investment agreement being negotiated between the U.S. and the EU. There is=
 opposition to the agreement in Germany, and thousands of protesters swarme=
d the streets in Hanover on Saturday carrying signs that read: "Yes We Can =
- Stop TTIP!" Supporters say the agreement would boost business during a ti=
me of global economic uncertainty, while critics worry it could put consume=
r protections and environmental standards at risk.



Obama to send 250 additional military personnel to Syria<http://www.usatoda=

USA TODAY // KIM HJELMGAARD AND JIM MICHAElS

President Obama has approved sending another 250 U.S. military personnel to=
 Syria to help opposition forces battle the Islamic State, an administratio=
n official confirmed Sunday. Obama is expected to make the announcement Mon=
day in a speech here as he completes a week-long foreign trip. The U.S. per=
sonnel will not be engaged in direct combat but will advise the units and c=
an help coordinate airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition, the official said.=
 The 250 would join 50 U.S. advisers the White House had earlier authorized=
 for Syria, where they are helping a patchwork of Kurdish and Arab fighters=
 battling the Islamic State in northeastern Syria. There is no timeline yet=
 for deploying the new forces. The administration official asked not to be =
named because the announcement has not yet been made. The information was f=
irst reported by The Wall Street Journal. The additional personnel for Syri=
a follows last week's announcement to send another 217 military personnel t=
o Iraq, where U.S. forces are training and advising Iraqi forces.

WASHINGTON POST // GREG JAFFE

German Chancellor Angela Merkel was asked Sunday to reminisce about her fon=
dest moments with President Obama during the seven years of his presidency.=
 Her short, remarkably unsentimental answer explains why she has become Oba=
ma's closest overseas ally and the president's political and ideological so=
ul mate on critical issues such as Syria, terrorism and containing Russian =
aggression in Ukraine. More than most American presidents, Obama disdains w=
hat he regards as needy, showboating allies. Merkel is most definitely neit=
her. The chancellor grimaced at the question from the German reporter. "I a=
m not in a position to take stock now," she replied curtly. There was too m=
uch important work to do.

NBC // ELISHA FIELDSTADT

President Barack Obama said Sunday that he doesn't take seriously North Kor=
ea's claim that it would halt nuclear tests if the U.S. suspends military e=
xercises with South Korea. North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong made t=
he ultimatum in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press Saturday h=
ours after North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile from a submarine. "We=
 don't take seriously a promise to halt" nuclear tests, Obama said during a=
 joint press conference in Hanover with German chancellor Angela Merkel. He=
 said the U.S. would engage in "serious conversations" with North Korea if =
the country shows that it is serious about ending its nuclear program. "Wha=
t is clear is that North Korea continues to engage in continuous provocativ=
e behavior, that they have been actively pursuing a nuclear program, an abi=
lity to launch nuclear weapons," Obama said. "And although more often than =
not they fail in many of these tests, they gain knowledge each time they en=
gage in these tests."

NEW YORK TIMES // MICHAEL D. SHEAR

It has been, perhaps, one of the most enduring mysteries of President Obama=
's tenure: What really happened to the bust of Winston Churchill that was o=
nce displayed in the Oval Office? With just months left in his term, Mr. Ob=
ama's first comments on the matter, in Europe last week, may have finally c=
leared up the truth of a tale that has persisted for more than seven years.=
 For conservatives in both America and Britain, the disappearance of the bu=
st from its place of honor soon after the end of George W. Bush's presidenc=
y was evidence of a liberal snub by Mr. Obama. In their view, he clearly di=
d not fully appreciate the greatness of the British prime minister, who ser=
ved during and after World War II. (The bust was replaced, White House offi=
cials said at the time, with one of Abraham Lincoln.)

USA TODAY // GREGORY KORTE

First Lady Michelle Obama gave a rare and impassioned defense of her husban=
d's legacy Saturday, saying he's risen above personal attacks and taken the=
 high road even as opponents have questioned his patriotism, his honesty, h=
is citizenship and his faith. "As I've walked this journey with Barack, I'v=
e gotten a pretty good look at what it means to rise above the fray, what i=
t means to set your eyes on the horizon, to devote your life to making thin=
gs better for those who will come after you," she told the graduating class=
 of Jackson State University, a historically black college in Mississippi. =
"I have seen how, no matter what kind of ugliness is going on at any partic=
ular moment, Barack always stays the course," she said. The commencement ad=
dress had echoes of a similar speech Mrs. Obama gave last year, at Tuskegee=
 University in Alabama, when she confessed that criticism of her - often dr=
enched in racial stereotypes - often caused her sleepless nights.

Former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton on Sunday called on the Obama =
administration to release the 28 redacted pages of a 2002 congressional inv=
estigation into the 9/11 terror attacks. In a radio interview with John Cat=
simatidis, the former Bush administration official said he had not read the=
 secret pages but believes they should be released to the public. "I think =
the thing to do is - because we could speculate for the next several hours =
on what these pages say - absent some possible compromise of U.S. sources a=
nd methods of intelligence-gathering, I'd just make all 28 pages public. Le=
t's see what's in there, and then we can talk about it," Bolton said. "I th=
ink its important to note that the Saudi government itself has said for 10 =
or 12 years now that they agree to make the pages public, so I don't know w=
hat the Obama administration's holdup is. I think the sooner we get them ou=

McAuliffe to GOP: 'Quit complaining' and earn ex-felons' vote<http://www.po=

POLITICO // NICK GASS

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe dismissed on Sunday the notion that his execu=
tive order restoring the voting rights of 206,000 ex-felons represents an e=
lection-year ploy to help elect a Democrat to the White House. His message =
for Republicans in an interview with ABC's "This Week": Complain less, camp=
aign more. McAuliffe's order signed last Friday reversed more than 150 year=
s of state law that stripped convicted felons who have served their time of=
 the right to vote, the majority of which are African-American and have tra=
ditionally represented a large voting bloc of the modern Democratic Party. =
As he did in Richmond late last week, when he declared that the law did not=
 overstep his constitutional authority, McAuliffe on Sunday said the restor=
ation would represent an opportunity for all politicians and parties to ear=
n the support of the previously disenfranchised group.

Russian aggression will be high on lawmakers' minds when the House Armed Se=

 Over the last two weeks, the Russians have buzzed a U.S. Navy destroyer, b=

and that's the main thing, to have a presence in the region and to show sup=

legislation to a Ted Cruz rally, handing them out to anyone who would liste=

Senator Mitch McConnell has a ready comeback for Democrats who keep chantin=

Democratic support. And he is not shy about boasting. "This week we have se=

that's back to work under the Republican majority," Mr. McConnell declared =
in a floor speech on Wednesday, minutes before passage of a bipartisan ener=

 and modernizing our energy policies respectively, and both bills take impo=

House Republicans plan to move a proposal that would restrain White House c=
ontrol over foreign policy planning, amid mounting complaints that the role=
s of the Pentagon and other national security agencies are being curtailed =
by West Wing micromanaging. House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry wi=
ll offer an amendment as soon as next week to the annual defense policy bil=
l that would slash the National Security Council staff to "well below" its =
estimated current level of 400, give Congress more oversight over the counc=
il and subject the president's national security adviser to the Senate conf=
irmation process, according to committee aides. The changes are a response =
to a litany of recent complaints about how closely the NSC controls decisio=
n making regarding foreign policy and military strategy that traditionally =
was coordinated by national security agencies. Former Obama administration =
Defense Secretaries Robert Gates and Leon Panetta have been particularly ou=
tspoken about their frustrations since leaving the Pentagon about the amoun=

During his ill-fated presidential run, Rand Paul tried to stretch his brand=
 of libertarianism to appeal to a broader audience. He talked tougher about=
 engaging the Islamic State, undercut diplomacy with Iran and called for cu=
tting domestic programs to pay for more defense spending. Now, nearly three=
 months after he pulled the plug on a presidential campaign that peaked at =
least a year too soon, Paul has resumed his role as the Senate's libertaria=
n-minded contrarian. And the 53-year-old eye doctor appears quite content, =
relieved of any need to soft-pedal his ideas for a national audience and re=
ady to settle in to the Senate for the long haul. In a recent interview in =
his Capitol office, adorned with magazine covers documenting the Kentucky R=
epublican's meteoric rise, a relaxed Paul lounged in a chair and spoke with=
 excitement about the prospect of being the Senate's leading libertarian vo=
ice on international policy and surveillance issues for another six years. =
He's favored to win reelection this fall and scoffed at criticisms leveled =
by his Democratic opponent that he's running a permanent presidential campa=

Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio is a relatively accessible fellow, but when a=
sked for an interview on the subject of the schisms in his Democratic Party=

ng serious problems on the Democratic side: deep divisions on policy and an=
 almost certain nominee, Mrs. Clinton, who if not for Donald J. Trump would=
 be the most unpopular presidential front-runner in recent times. The diffe=

between Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton in 2008. Then, there were modest dive=

NEW YORK TIMES // JESS BIDGOOD

Most years, the presidential primary here is a drive-by affair, with candid=
ates racing past the state like motorists taking the shortest route from Bo=
ston to New York. But this unpredictable election season has turned even Rh=
ode Island's late primary and paltry pile of delegates into a valued prize,=
 putting this small state into the primary spotlight before its vote Tuesda=
y. "For the first time in a very long time," Larry Berman, an aide to the s=
tate's House speaker, said merrily, "Rhode Island's primary actually matter=
s." Campaigns of yore would be forgiven for paying little attention to Rhod=
e Island, which has 33 Democratic delegates and just 19 on the Republican s=
ide. Charles Bullock, a professor of political science at the University of=
 Georgia, said Rhode Island tended to play a significant role in the primar=
y season only in close contests like the one in 1976 between Ronald Reagan =
and Gerald Ford, or in 2008, when Hillary Clinton was trying to make up gro=
und lost to Barack Obama.

Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton holds a big lead over =
rival Bernie Sanders in Pennsylvania just days before the state's April 26 =
primary, according to a new Wall Street Journal/Marist/NBC poll. Among like=
ly Democratic voters, Clinton has 55 percent support to Sanders's 40 percen=
t. She has over 60 percent support among African-Americans, voters over 45,=
 women and voters who identify as Democrats. But the Vermont senator contin=
ues to dominate among younger voters, with 60 percent of those under 45 sup=
porting him. Both candidates beat Republican front-runner Donald Trump in a=
 hypothetical general election match-up. Clinton leads the business mogul 5=
4 to 39 percent, while Sanders tops him 57 to 37 percent. The poll surveyed=
 734 likely Democratic primary voters from April 18 to 20. It has a margin =
of error of 3.6 percentage points.

Hillary Clinton toured black baptist churches in North Philadelphia on Sund=

spent the last few days crisscrossing Pennsylvania in search of support and=
 votes. There are five primary elections on Tuesday and candidates have bee=

at City Hall in Philadelphia. Sunday,Clinton visited two churches in Philad=
elphia. She visited Triumph Baptist Church and African Episcopal Church of =
St. Thomas. At both stops, she pledged to seek criminal justice reform and =
fight for tougher gun regulations before the largely African-American congr=

Making a final Connecticut appearance in front of 1,200 supporters before T=

A brief mention of Monica Lewinsky by a prominent Bernie Sanders supporter =
sparked controversy on the campaign trail this weekend, with Hillary Clinto=
n's team accusing her Democratic presidential rival of condoning "vitriol."=
 Actress Rosario Dawson, who has campaigned with Sanders on several occasio=
ns, brought up the former White House intern on Saturday during a Sanders r=
ally in Wilmington, Del., referencing the work that Lewinsky now does to co=
mbat cyberbullying. Dawson said she and other Sanders supporters were being=
 bullied by Clinton's allies. "We are literally under attack for not just s=
upporting the other candidate," Dawson said in remarks introducing Sanders =
to the crowd. "Now I'm with Monica Lewinsky with this. Bullying is bad. She=
 has actually dedicated her life now to talking about that. And now as a ca=

WASHINGTON POST // JOHN WAGNER

Bernie Sanders's path to the Democratic presidential nomination may have na=
rrowed considerably since his loss to Hillary Clinton in the New York prima=
ry, but he showed Sunday that he can still turn out big-time crowds. More t=
han 14,000 people gathered in a downtown park here for a Sanders rally on S=
unday night, according to park officials, just hours after more than 7,000 =
people streamed to an outdoor event in Providence, R.I. Connecticut and Rho=
de Island are among the five states that will hold primaries Tuesday, when =
Clinton is hoping to further tighten her grip on the party's nomination. Th=
e senator from Vermont took markedly different approaches regarding Clinton=
 at his two rallies. In Providence, he barely mentioned her name during his=
 hour-long stump speech -- a signal, some thought, that he might be dialing=
 back his criticism as his odds of prevailing grow longer.

The United States needs to get to the "root cause" of the 9/11 attacks, Ber=

enate legislation that would allow the families of terror victims the right=
 to sue foreign governments and entities in federal court, including Saudi =
Arabia. "I think there's a lot about Saudi Arabia that we don't fully under=
stand. And I want to get to the root cause of it," Sanders told Chuck Todd =
on NBC News' "Meet the Press." "The root of what Saudi Arabia has done." Re=
marking that there is "some evidence -- and we will have to ascertain wheth=
er it's accurate or not -- that money from Saudi Arabia actually funded a 9=
/11 attack," Sanders noted that Saudi money "is going all over the world" t=
o fund the austere Wahhabi form of Islam. "And I think that the full extent=
 of the role that Saudi Arabia plays in supporting extremism in this world =
is something that we should explore," Sanders said.

On Saturday, Bernie Sanders supporter Rosario Dawson said she stood with Mo=

with whom the husband of his Democratic rival infamously had an affair as p=
resident. "We are literally under attack - not just for supporting the othe=

oduced the senator, adding, "I'm with Monica Lewinsky on this ... bullying =
is bad." Dawson also called it a Clinton "campaign strategy." Asked on CNN'=
s "State of the Union" whether that was appropriate, Sanders instead talked=
 up the "great job" the "great actress" is doing for the campaign. "And she=
 has been a passionate fighter to see the voter turnout that we fight for, =
racial, economic environmental justice. What our job right now is to contra=
st our views compared to Secretary Clinton. That's what a campaign is about=

Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders in an interview broadcast Su=

quality, when the wealthy are getting wealthier - many of them pay an effec=
tive tax rate lower than working people," Sanders said on NBC's "Meet the P=

deral taxes. That's where you get the money. Somebody's making $20,000 a ye=
ar and they buy a bottle of soda, I don't think you charge them $0.30 more =
for that bottle of soda." Sanders said he "absolutely" agrees with the goal=

Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Sunday did not directly a=
nswer a question about whether it was appropriate for actress Rosario Dawso=

 job for us," Sanders said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." "I have no=
 idea in what context Rosario is talking about, but I would hope that all o=
f our people talk about the real issue." Sanders also said people should be=
 talking about climate change instead of his surrogate. "And, by the way, i=
t might be a good idea for all of us, including TV networks, to start talki=
ng about the planetary crisis of climate change," Sanders added. Dawson on =
Saturday took a swipe at Sanders's rival, Hillary Clinton, by mentioning Le=

THE HILL // REBECCA SAVRANSKY

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said on Sunday that if riv=
al Hillary Clinton secures the nomination, he'll have to look at her platfo=
rm before he commits to making an enthusiastic case for her. "That is total=
ly dependent on what the Clinton platform is and how she responds to the ne=
eds of millions of Americans who are sick and tired of establishment politi=
cs and establishment economics," Sanders said on ABC's "This Week" in respo=
nse to a question about whether he'd back her in the same way she pushed fo=
r President Obama in 2008. "You know, I can't snap my finger and tell peopl=
e what to do."

Sanders said he hopes that if Clinton is the nominee, she will put together=
 "the strongest progressive agenda." He noted he will also do everything he=
 can to make sure Republican front-runner Donald Trump or "some other right=
-wing Republican" does not become president. "We do not need more tax break=
s for billionaires, more cuts to Social Security, Medicare, more ignoring t=

Bernie Sanders says he is trailing Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presid=

opulist Vermont senator said on "Meet The Press" Sunday that he wouldn't tr=
ail front-runner Clinton by 275 pledged delegates - and 750 total delegates=
 - if more low-income voters showed up to the ballot box. "I mean, that's j=
ust a fact," Sanders said. "That's a sad reality of American society. And t=
hat's what we have to transform. "We have one - as you know - one of the lo=
west voter turnouts of any major country on Earth. We have done a good job =
bringing young people in. I think we have done - had some success with lowe=
r income people. But in America today - the last election in 2014, 80 perce=
nt of poor people did not vote. "Sanders has cited that statistic before as=
 his insurgent candidacy has taken hold with disaffected Democrats who want=
 someone with an ideology to Clinton's left. A Politifact examination found=
 the number to be an overestimation by anywhere from 10 to 15 points.

There is "almost the question as to why" cigarettes are legal in the United=

 tax on sugary drinks in Philadelphia, which would fund pre-kindergarten ed=
ucation, reiterating that it is a "totally regressive tax" that results in =
poorer people paying even more in taxes if they buy a bottle of soda. When =
moderator Chuck Todd asked him if he felt the same way about cigarette taxe=
s, Sanders said he did not. "Cigarette taxes are - there's a difference bet=
ween cigarettes and soda," the Vermont senator said. "I am aware of the obe=
sity problem in this country." Todd replied, "I don't think Michael Bloombe=
rg would agree with you on that one," referring to the former New York mayo=

C's income has slowed to a trickle and his campaign took in just $12.5 mill=
ion in March - less than half of Hillary Clinton's campaign haul and about =
a quarter of Sanders's total. Interviews with major Republican donors and f=

ort also raised eyebrows by saying of Trump, "the part he's been playing is=
 evolving."

But Trump will have to tread a fine line, as comments he made at the weeken=
d acknowledged. At a Saturday rally in Waterbury, Conn., Trump suggested th=
at he would never have reached his current position as the dominant GOP fro=
nt-runner had he "acted presidential" from the outset of his campaign. The =
key question is whether Trump can establish more civil relations with the R=
NC and set a more sober-minded tone in general - while also not disenchanti=
ng supporters who were drawn to the businessman as a brash voice unwilling =
to pay deference to the powers-that-be.

Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said Sunday during a camp=

 Tuesday. "Trump has millions of votes more by that time because you look T=
uesday, it looks like five. I don't know, but I believe in polls," he said =

 He said he expects to get to the 1,237 required delegates needed to secure=
 the nomination ahead of the Republican convention and will add to his dele=

said, while also calling the system unfair. In the five states that vote on=
 Tuesday - Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island -=
 Trump has a double digit lead, according to the RealClearPolitics average =

Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said Sunday he expects to=
 secure the Republican nomination on the first ballot. "I'm only interested=
 in the first ballot," he said during a rally in Hagerstown, Md. "I'm not i=
nterested in second, third, fourth, nineteenth because I'm really intereste=

adding he's going to win in states that other Republicans are not even goin=

alling it unfair. He criticized rival Ted Cruz for "bribing" delegates. "He=

 first ballot, because they're locked into me on the first ballot," he said=

Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump holds a double-digit lead=

The poll shows that Trump performs poorly among college graduates, only get=

 Republican women saying they support the businessman. Alternatively, 52 pe=

 who have children younger than 18 at home and have gone to the store at le=

Characterizing Donald Trump as a type of car or animal resulted in some fas=

 Newhouse and Omero wrote in a memo summarizing the results. "These Moms pr=

Hagerstown, Md., with a 5,000-person capacity. Maryland is one of five stat=
es along the Northeast Corridor that will vote Tuesday, an opportunity for =
Trump to widen his delegate lead over Cruz, a senator from Texas. After tea=
ring into Cruz as the worst liar he has encountered and accusing him of try=
ing to bribe delegates, Trump offered praise for his fallen rivals in the o=
nce 17-person GOP field. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whom Trump last month=
 declared "is not doing a great job," became a "great" governor. He dubbed =
Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) "a great guy" instead of "Little Marco." And he cal=
led Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) - whose cellphone number he once gave out=

States are a key concern, Ted Cruz should get your vote. More broadly, if y=
our concern is America's position in the Middle East, your vote should go t=
o Cruz." Abrams said Cruz is intelligent and has a good grasp on the danger=
s in both the Middle East and Israel. He also wrote that the Texas senator =
had a commitment to Israel's security. "While [GOP front-runner] Donald Tru=
mp is talking about extracting more from Israel for its defense, Cruz wants=

Ted Cruz dominated the race for delegate seats at weekend Republican meetin=

 that in most cases they will be required to vote for the businessman on a =
first ballot. But if Trump fails to win the nomination in the first round, =
those Cruz supporters could switch to the senator on subsequent ballots. Th=

THE RACISTS who rewrote Virginia's constitution in 1902 made no bones about=
 their objectives. Poll taxes, literacy tests and the disenfranchisement of=
 felons were all granted constitutional cover, the better, explained State =
Sen. Carter Glass (D), a key draftsman, "to eliminate the darkey as a polit=
ical factor in this State" and ensure "the complete supremacy of the white =
race in the affairs of government." With the stroke of a pen, Gov. Terry Mc=
Auliffe (D) did his best Friday to scrap the last vestige of that project: =
the ban on voting by ex-felons. Mr. McAuliffe, who as a candidate promised =
to expand on similar efforts by his predecessors, ordered that voting right=
s be automatically restored to more than 200,000 former inmates who have co=
mpleted their sentences, regardless of their offense. It's about time. For =
years, Virginia has been one of a dirty dozen states that has barred automa=
tic restoration of voting and other civil rights to ex-convicts. It is one =
of just four such states - the others are Florida, Iowa and Kentucky - that=
 erected the most onerous barriers by subjecting every felon, violent or no=

PRESIDENT OBAMA'S visit to Cuba last month laid down a marker. The presiden=

without any. The regime's answer has now been delivered at the just-conclud=

-day conference, held in Havana, ratified the old guard's hold on leadershi=
p. Mr. Castro, 84, was reelected as first secretary of the party, and the d=
elegates cheered a farewell speech from a frail Fidel Castro, 89. Party mem=

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">President Obama arrived Sunday in Germany, where h=
e will encounter a Europe struggling with terrorism, an anemic economy and =
an unprecedented migrant crisis that have provoked nationalism
 and xenophobia in some quarters of the continent. &#8220;It&#8217;s not my=
 place to tell Europe how to manage Europe,&#8221; Obama said in Bild Zeitu=
ng, a German newspaper, prior to his arrival. But the president has used hi=
s tour of Britain and Germany to provide some unusually
 frank advice to the Europeans on issues such as dealing with refugees, maj=
or trade deals and terrorism. In the United Kingdom, where Britons will go =
to the polls in June to vote on whether to remain in the European Union, Ob=
ama warned repeatedly &#8212; in an editorial,
 a news conference and a BBC interview &#8212; that a withdrawal from the b=

;ll send up to 250 additional military personnel to Syria to help fight the=
 Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), The Wall Street Journal
 reported Sunday. The move will expand the footprint of American forces ins=
ide the country. Obama recently signed off on a new deployment that would i=
ncrease the number of American troops operating in Syria to about 300, up f=
rom about 50. Obama is expected
 to announce the move Monday in Hannover, Germany, at the end of a weeklong=

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Barack Obama planned to pivot to Asia, escape the =
Middle East, reboot with Latin America and elevate Africa. Europe, he hoped=
, would take care of itself. No such luck. Europe is in
 crisis, many U.S. officials believe, and when Obama delivers a speech in H=
anover, Germany, on Monday, aides say he will be addressing the whole conti=
nent as it grapples with terrorism, nationalism, refugees and questions abo=
ut the European Union&#8217;s survival.
 It also marks a turnabout in Obama&#8217;s own thinking &#8212; amid grumb=
ling by many European diplomats that the president hasn&#8217;t given the c=
ontinent the attention it needs. Even some Obama aides acknowledge that Eur=
ope has sometimes been overshadowed by Obama&#8217;s other
 foreign priorities, like the Iran nuclear deal and relations with China. O=
bama&#8217;s trip is a way of &#8220;sending out a signal that he&#8217;s n=
ot indifferent to what&#8217;s happening in Europe,&#8221; Peter Wittig, Ge=

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The United States has opened a new line of combat =
against the Islamic State, directing the military&#8217;s six-year-old Cybe=
r Command for the first time to mount computer-network attacks
 that are now being used alongside more traditional weapons. The effort ref=
lects President Obama&#8217;s desire to bring many of the secret American c=
yberweapons that had been aimed elsewhere, notably at Iran, into the fight =
against the Islamic State &#8212; which has
 proved effective in using modern communications and encryption to recruit =
and carry out operations. The National Security Agency, which specializes i=
n electronic surveillance, has for years listened intensely to the militant=
s of the Islamic State, and those
 reports are often part of the president&#8217;s daily intelligence briefin=
g. But the N.S.A.&#8217;s military counterpart, Cyber Command, was focused =
largely on Russia, China, Iran and North Korea &#8212; where cyberattacks o=
n the United States most frequently originate &#8212; and
 had run virtually no operations against what has become the most dangerous=
 terrorist organization in the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 presidential elections, it&#8217;s always tough when we&#8217;re in the he=
at of campaigns,&#8221; Obama said during a joint news conference with Germ=

largest industrial technology trade fair and try to win
 support for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a f=
ree trade and investment agreement being negotiated between the U.S. and th=
e EU. There is opposition to the agreement in Germany, and thousands of pro=
testers swarmed the streets in Hanover
 on Saturday carrying signs that read: &quot;Yes We Can &#8212; Stop TTIP!&=

obal economic uncertainty, while critics worry it could put consumer protec=

.S. military personnel to Syria to help opposition forces battle the Islami=
c State, an administration official confirmed Sunday. Obama
 is expected to make the announcement Monday in a speech here as he complet=
es a week-long foreign trip. The U.S. personnel will not be engaged in dire=
ct combat but will advise the units and can help coordinate airstrikes by t=
he U.S.-led coalition, the official
 said. The 250 would join 50 U.S. advisers the White House had earlier auth=
orized for Syria, where they are helping a patchwork of Kurdish and Arab fi=
ghters battling the Islamic State in northeastern Syria. There is no timeli=
ne yet for deploying the new forces.
 The administration official asked not to be named because the announcement=
 has not yet been made. The information was first reported by The Wall Stre=
et Journal. The additional personnel for Syria follows last week's announce=
ment to send another 217 military
 personnel to Iraq, where U.S. forces are training and advising Iraqi force=
s.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 the president&#8217;s political and ideological soul mate on critical issu=

 U.S. suspends military exercises with South Korea. North
 Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong made the ultimatum in an exclusive int=
erview with The Associated Press Saturday hours after North Korea test-fire=
d a ballistic missile from a submarine. &quot;We don't take seriously a pro=
mise to halt&quot; nuclear tests, Obama said
 during a joint press conference in Hanover with German chancellor Angela M=
erkel. He said the U.S. would engage in &quot;serious conversations&quot; w=
ith North Korea if the country shows that it is serious about ending its nu=
clear program. &quot;What is clear is that North
 Korea continues to engage in continuous provocative behavior, that they ha=
ve been actively pursuing a nuclear program, an ability to launch nuclear w=
eapons,&quot; Obama said. &quot;And although more often than not they fail =
in many of these tests, they gain knowledge
 each time they engage in these tests.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">It has been, perhaps, one of the most enduring mys=
teries of President Obama&#8217;s tenure: What really happened to the bust =
of Winston Churchill that was once displayed in the Oval Office?
 With just months left in his term, Mr. Obama&#8217;s first comments on the=
 matter, in Europe last week, may have finally cleared up the truth of a ta=
le that has persisted for more than seven years. For conservatives in both =
America and Britain, the disappearance
 of the bust from its place of honor soon after the end of George W. Bush&#=
8217;s presidency was evidence of a liberal snub by Mr. Obama. In their vie=
w, he clearly did not fully appreciate the greatness of the British prime m=
inister, who served during and after World
 War II. (The bust was replaced, White House officials said at the time, wi=
th one of Abraham Lincoln.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 questioned his patriotism, his honesty, his citizenship and his faith. &qu=
ot;As I&#8217;ve walked this journey with Barack, I&#8217;ve gotten a prett=

our eyes on the horizon, to devote your life to making
 things better for those who will come after you,&quot; she told the gradua=
ting class of Jackson State University, a historically black college in Mis=
sissippi. &quot;I have seen how, no matter what kind of ugliness is going o=
n at any particular moment, Barack always
 stays the course,&quot; she said. The commencement address had echoes of a=
 similar speech Mrs. Obama gave last year, at Tuskegee University in Alabam=
a, when she confessed that criticism of her &#8212; often drenched in racia=
l stereotypes &#8212; often caused her sleepless
 nights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 a 2002 congressional investigation into the 9/11 terror
 attacks. In a radio interview with John Catsimatidis, the former Bush admi=

 should be released to the public. &#8220;I think the thing to do is &#8212=

 hours on what these pages say &#8212; absent some possible compromise of U=

28 pages public. Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s in there, and then we can tal=

 that the Saudi government itself has said for 10 or 12 years now that they=
 agree to make the pages public, so I don&#8217;t know what the Obama admin=

have traditionally represented a large voting bloc of the modern Democratic=
 Party. As he did in Richmond late last week, when he declared that the law=
 did not overstep his constitutional

 complaints that the roles of the Pentagon and other national

 its estimated current level of 400, give Congress more oversight over the =
council and subject the president&#8217;s national security adviser to the =
Senate confirmation process, according to committee aides. The changes are =
a response to a litany of recent complaints
 about how closely the NSC controls decision making regarding foreign polic=
y and military strategy that traditionally was coordinated by national secu=
rity agencies. Former Obama administration Defense Secretaries Robert Gates=
 and Leon Panetta have been particularly

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton'=
s campaign chair, John Podesta, said rival Bernie Sanders won't do well in =
the five Democratic contests on the East Coast on April
 26, ultimately helping the former secretary of State in her path to the pa=
rty's nomination. &quot;He's got to win, and he's got to win big, and we do=
n't think he can do that,&quot; Podesta said to radio host John Catsimatidi=
s in an interview Sunday. &quot;So we're looking
 forward to that. &quot;I think we're in very good shape to have her be the=
 first woman nominee to a major party ticket in this country,&quot; Podesta=
 added. &quot;I think we can have a really, really good day next Tuesday.&q=
uot; Five states vote Tuesday: Connecticut, Delaware,
 Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Polls show Clinton leading in all=
, and the states that offer the most delegates Tuesday are those in which s=
he has the biggest leads.&nbsp; In Maryland, which offers 118 delegates, Cl=
inton carries a 22-point lead over Sanders,
 according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls. And in Pennsylvania, wh=
ich has 210 delegates up for grabs, Clinton has a 16-point lead on average.

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Most years, the presidential primary here is a dri=
ve-by affair, with candidates racing past the state like motorists taking t=
he shortest route from Boston to New York. But this unpredictable
 election season has turned even Rhode Island&#8217;s late primary and palt=
ry pile of delegates into a valued prize, putting this small state into the=
 primary spotlight before its vote Tuesday. &#8220;For the first time in a =
very long time,&#8221; Larry Berman, an aide to the
 state&#8217;s House speaker, said merrily, &#8220;Rhode Island&#8217;s pri=
mary actually matters.&#8221; Campaigns of yore would be forgiven for payin=
g little attention to Rhode Island, which has 33 Democratic delegates and j=
ust 19 on the Republican side. Charles Bullock, a professor
 of political science at the University of Georgia, said Rhode Island tende=
d to play a significant role in the primary season only in close contests l=
ike the one in 1976 between Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford, or in 2008, when=
 Hillary Clinton was trying to make
 up ground lost to Barack Obama.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 can still turn out big-time crowds. More than 14,000 people gathered in a =
downtown park here for a Sanders rally on Sunday night, according to park o=
fficials, just hours after more than 7,000 people streamed to an outdoor ev=

 and Rhode Island are among the five states that will hold primaries Tuesda=

nomination. The senator from Vermont took markedly different approaches reg=

 Providence, he barely mentioned her name during his hour-long stump speech=
 -- a signal, some thought, that he might be dialing back his criticism as =
his odds of prevailing grow longer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Clinton platform is and how she responds to the needs of millions of Americ=

 in response to a question about whether he'd back her in the same way she =
pushed for President Obama in 2008. &quot;You know, I can't snap my finger =

 in the Democratic presidential primary &#8220;because poor people don&#821=
7;t vote.&#8221; When asked why he consistently lost contests in states wit=
h
 the highest income inequality gaps, the populist Vermont senator said on &=
#8220;Meet The Press&#8221; Sunday that he wouldn&#8217;t trail front-runne=
r Clinton by 275 pledged delegates &#8211; and 750 total delegates &#8211; =
if more low-income voters showed up to the ballot box. &#8220;I mean,
 that&#8217;s just a fact,&#8221; Sanders said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a sad r=
eality of American society. And that&#8217;s what we have to transform. &#8=
220;We have one &#8211; as you know &#8211; one of the lowest voter turnout=
s of any major country on Earth. We have done a good job bringing young peo=
ple in.
 I think we have done &#8211; had some success with lower income people. Bu=
t in America today &#8211; the last election in 2014, 80 percent of poor pe=
ople did not vote. &#8220;Sanders has cited that statistic before as his in=
surgent candidacy has taken hold with disaffected
 Democrats who want someone with an ideology to Clinton&#8217;s left. A Pol=
itifact examination found the number to be an overestimation by anywhere fr=
om 10 to 15 points.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

What we have found throughout this campaign is when voter

ass people come out in big numbers, we often win,&#8221; Sanders told a che=
ering crowd before a backdrop of a lake and the stand of Roman columns that=
 make up the Temple to Music pavilion.
 &#8220;When voter turnout is low, we don&#8217;t do well. I would hope on =

in the history of the state.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 cigarettes are legal in the United States, Bernie Sanders said in an inter=
view aired Sunday on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; The remark came as S=

a, which would fund pre-kindergarten education, reiterating that it is a &q=
uot;totally regressive tax&quot; that results in poorer people paying even =
more in taxes if they buy a bottle of soda.
 When moderator Chuck Todd asked him if he felt the same way about cigarett=
e taxes, Sanders said he did not. &quot;Cigarette taxes are &#8212; there's=
 a difference between cigarettes and soda,&quot; the Vermont senator said. =
&quot;I am aware of the obesity problem in this country.&quot;
 Todd replied, &quot;I don't think Michael Bloomberg would agree with you o=
n that one,&quot; referring to the former New York mayor's infamous effort =
to limit the size of sugary drinks sold in the city. (The state's highest c=
ourt in 2014 ruled that the city had overstepped
 its regulatory bounds by implementing the rule.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

idential nomination slip away, Senator Bernie Sanders and his allies are tr=
ying to use his popularity to expand his political influence,
 setting up an ideological struggle for the soul of the Democratic Party in=
 the post-Obama era. Aides to Mr. Sanders have been pressing party official=

 strong planks on issues like a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, breaking =
up Wall Street banks and banning natural gas &#8220;fracking.&#8221; Amid h=
is unexpectedly strong showing in the Democratic primaries, Mr. Sanders has=
 tapped his two-million-person donor list to
 raise money for liberal congressional candidates in New York, Nevada and W=
ashington State. And in the waning months of Barack Obama&#8217;s presidenc=

 housing secretary, Juli=E1n Castro, over his department&#8217;s sales of d=

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Can Donald Trump become best friends with the man =
he dismisses as &#8220;Lyin&#8217; &#8221; Ted Cruz? The Republican preside=
ntial front-runner suggested it could happen after a bruising primary at a
 Sunday rally in a packed airport hangar in Hagerstown, Md., with a 5,000-p=
erson capacity. Maryland is one of five states along the Northeast Corridor=
 that will vote Tuesday, an opportunity for Trump to widen his delegate lea=
d over Cruz, a senator from Texas.
 After tearing into Cruz as the worst liar he has encountered and accusing =
him of trying to bribe delegates, Trump offered praise for his fallen rival=
s in the once 17-person GOP field. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whom Trump =
last month declared &#8220;is not doing
 a great job,&#8221; became a &#8220;great&#8221; governor. He dubbed Sen. =
Marco Rubio (Fla.) &#8220;a great guy&#8221; instead of &#8220;Little Marco=

 should go to Cruz.&quot; Abrams said Cruz is intelligent
 and has a good grasp on the dangers in both the Middle East and Israel. He=
 also wrote that the Texas senator had a commitment to Israel's security. &=
quot;While [GOP front-runner] Donald Trump is talking about extracting more=
 from Israel for its defense, Cruz wants
 to beef up the missile defense programs like Iron Dome, David's Sling, and=
 Arrow that are crucial for Israel &#8212; and immensely valuable for the U=

 presidential nomination if the contest is decided on later ballots at the =
Republican National Convention. In some instances, Cruz supporters won dele=

 on a first ballot. But if Trump fails to win the nomination in the first r=

 still seems more focused on winning most of the remaining 15 contests thro=

ghts be automatically restored to
 more than 200,000 former inmates who have completed their sentences, regar=

 It is one of just four such states &#8212; the others are Florida, Iowa an=
