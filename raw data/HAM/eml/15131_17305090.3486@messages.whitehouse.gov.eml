*Subject:* in-town pool report #2 (Medal of Valor ceremony)



The East Room ceremony was open press, so please double-check transcript.=




POTUS entered the East Room at 11:26 AM with AG Loretta Lynch for Medal o=
f Valor ceremony honoring 13 public safety officers, including one recipi=
ent -- Robert Wilson III of the Philadelphia Police Department -- who rec=
eived the award posthumously.=20



[Please find a list of the awardees, plus a short bio (per the WH), at th=
e end of this report].=20



Room was packed with a mix of suits and officers in uniform. Among those =
in the crowd: U.S. Reps. Chris Collins of New York and Frederica Wilson o=
f Florida, as well as FBI Director James B. Comey.=20



Lynch opened event with sweeping thanks for the officers and the families=
/friends who support them. We are so grateful for your support and we are=
 really inspired by all that you have done to support our honorees. Becau=
se we know that so often its because of your sacrifices that they are rea=
lly able to serve.=20



On the awardees: I am so proud to count you as partners in the law and gu=
ardians of justice. And I congratulate you on this well-deserved honor, L=
ynch said.=20



POTUS took the podium right after and spoke of how officers responded ins=
tinctively to dangerous situations with no thought of recognition.=20



This is an award that none of them sought and if they could go back in ti=
me I suspect they would prefer that none of this had happened. As one of =
todays honorees said about his actions: I could have very well gone my wh=
ole career and not dealt with situation and been very happy with that, PO=
TUS said.=20



But we are so grateful they were there. Some on-duty. Others off-duty. Al=
l rising above and beyond the call of duty. All saving the lives of peopl=
e they didnt know.=20



If it had not been for their bravery, we likely would have lost a lot of =
people.=20



They stood up to dangerous individuals brandishing assault rifles, handgu=
ns and knives. One officer sustained multiple stab wounds while fighting =
off an assailant. Another enduring first degree burns to his arms and fac=
e while pulling an unconscious driver from a burning car on a freeway.=20=




On Wilson: He gave his life when two men opened fire at a video game stor=
e where Sgt. Wilson was buying his son a birthday present. To his family,=
 who is here, his grandmother Constance, his brother and sister -- please=
 know how deeply sorry we are for your loss, how grateful we are for Sgt.=
 Wilsons service.



Toward end of remarks, POTUS talked more broadly about LEOs and what Wash=
ington policymakers could do to help. He noted the more than 35 who have =
given their lives in the line of duty so far this year.=20



Not everyone will wear the medal that we give today but every day so many=
 of our public safety officers wear a badge of honor.=20



Said our words will be hollow if theyre not matched by deeds.



Promoted criminal justice reform in Congress. Mentioned he today signed a=
 package of bills to protect and honor our law enforcement officers, incl=
uding one that will help state and local departments buy more bulletproof=
 vests.=20



Once POTUS finished speech, he placed Medal of Valor (which has a purple =
ribbon) around the necks of each of the awardees. The exception was for t=
he family of Robert Wilson; his award was accepted by his grandmother Con=
stance (check spelling with WH staff). His acknowledgement earned the lou=
dest and longest applause. POTUS bowed his head, hugged and put his arm a=
round Constance.=20



POTUS exited room at 11:51 AM.=20



Heres a little background on the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor. Th=
e medal is the highest award a LEO can receive and its given to public sa=
fety officers who have displayed exceptional courage ... in an attempt to=
 save or protect human life, according to DoJ. Nominees are vetted and se=
lected by a Medal of Valor Review Board and the U.S. Attorney General. Th=
e award was authorized by the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act of=
 2001.=20



Per the White House, heres a list of the 13 recipients.=20



Note that three officers from Santa Monica were honored for responding to=
 the same incident and one recipient, Robert Wilson of the Philadelphia P=
olice Department, is receiving the award posthumously.=20
