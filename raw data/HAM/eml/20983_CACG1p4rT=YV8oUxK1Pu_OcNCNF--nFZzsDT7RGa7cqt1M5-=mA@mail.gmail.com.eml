Michel & Caroline,


Katherine and I would like to invite you to a dinner reception at our home
for 50 friends on June 8th with President Obama. We are excited to hear
from The President about the upcoming election and other critically
important topics. The dinner is in support of The DNC and we are asking for
a $10,000 contribution per person.


Our family hosted President Obama at one of his first fundraisers in New
York City in 2007 and we couldn=E2=80=99t be more pleased to be hosts again=
. I am
sure the President will return to NYC on behalf of the party's nominee in
the Fall, but I am told this will most probably be his last small NYC
dinner as President on behalf of himself. I really hope you can be with us.
