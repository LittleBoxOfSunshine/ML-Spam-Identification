Maine Voices: Legislators score a victory for those at risk of overdose and=
 those who love them

By overriding Gov. LePage's veto of a bill to expand Narcan access, Maine l=
awmakers demonstrate that no human life is disposable.

Last Friday was a victory for a woman named Cheryl.

On Jan. 6, 2010, Cheryl died of an opioid overdose on her kitchen floor. Sh=
e was 52.

Last Friday<http://www.pressherald.com/2016/04/29/legislators-unanimously-o=
verride-veto-of-added-maine-jail-funding/>, 161 Maine lawmakers =96 Democra=
ts, Republicans and independents =96 joined together to tell our governor t=
hat Cheryl was not an addict, but a wife, a mother, a grandmother, a daught=
er, a sister, a neighbor and a friend who happened to have suffered from a =
disease called addiction.

They told him she was a small-business owner who started her own nail salon=
, a volunteer at her church, a gourmet chef who loved to entertain and an a=
nimal lover who found joy in walking her dogs, even when she barely felt li=
ke getting out of bed. They told our governor that she had value, that her =
life was worth saving. They told him how much she still loved the world, an=
d that she still meant the world to the people who loved her.

I wonder every day what more my family could have done to save my mother=92=
s life. What if someone had checked on her 30 minutes sooner? What if my da=
d had quit his job to care for her? What if we=92d had a supply of Narcan i=
n the house?

And ever since Gov. LePage vetoed<http://www.pressherald.com/2016/04/20/lep=
age-vetoes-bill-aimed-at-increasing-access-to-heroin-anti-overdose-drug/> a=
 legislative proposal to make Narcan easier to obtain, I=92ve spent every d=
ay wondering how the governor of a state =96 a man who was elected to repre=
sent 1.3 million human beings =96 could suggest<http://www.maine.gov/tools/=
whatsnew/attach.php?id=3D676021&an=3D1> that my mother should have been lef=
t to die, as Narcan only would have extended her life =93until the next ove=
rdose.=94

It doesn=92t matter that my mother lived in Texas instead of Maine, because=
 it would be ridiculous to suggest that where you live determines the value=
 of your life. Nor does it matter that she died from prescription painkille=
rs rather than heroin, because it would be ridiculous to suggest that the f=
orm that your addiction takes has any bearing on your worth as a person.

So, too, it would be ridiculous to suggest that my mother=92s life was some=
how worth more than that of someone who fits the =93junkie=94 stereotype th=
e governor is so fond of disparaging. Dying at home with a bottle of pills =
by your side is no different than dying under a bridge with a needle in you=
r arm.

We should do something about the opioid epidemic not because it=92s affecti=
ng suburban middle-class white women who don=92t conform to the clich=E9s w=
e associate with heroin addicts. We should do something about the opioid ep=
idemic because no human life is disposable, and because we are all fundamen=
tally the same.

I don=92t think of last Friday=92s vote as a victory for my political party=
, as people of every political party struggle with addiction. Rather, it wa=
s a victory for my mother. It was a victory for every one of us who loves s=
omeone at risk of overdose. It was a victory for our state. And it was a vi=
ctory for humanity.
