utes
- But you people waited in line. They don't have that problem

- Talks about lobbying a University president to get Mike Leach a job

Need to be rough and smart
- Can't just be rough and not smart, can't be smart and not a little tough

Hitting Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham

ybe that's his excuse

Don't want my generals on TV

HRC will run $90 million in "women oriented" ads
- Would have no chance if she didn't play the women card
- Can't raise your voice to a woman
- Megyn Kelly comments: Didn't get a chance to finish my sentence. People h=
ave dirty minds
- We had fun on Howard Stern. The last thing in the world I wanted to do wa=
s [run for office]
- HRC's husband was biggest abuser of women in history of politics
- Married to a man who got impeached for lying about what happened to a wom=
an

In one day, trade balance will be equalized. One day

Iran Deal
- John Kerry is an idiot. He is grossly incompetent
- Persians are great negotiators

Vote by mail

e the house?
