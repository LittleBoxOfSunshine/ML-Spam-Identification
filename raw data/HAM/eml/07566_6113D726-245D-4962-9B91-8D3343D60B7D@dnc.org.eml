Take the first page. That's more generic. She edited the intro which doesn'=
t make sense for your purposes.

I=92m seriously tired and cannot add anything else.  Luis - None of this ha=

uld be comfortable with you using this for some narrative until Ryan and Ge=
off finalize it.  Hope the glaciers were worth it.

Hi all - Given the situation in Alaska, we needed to speed up the DWS Narra=
tive Project a bit.  What is a attached is an overall narrative and follows=
 with a list of topics, talking points, and clips that support DWS=92 narra=
tive.  I=92d encourage you all to read this because I for one am reminded e=
very day that even with all the bs clips we read, we have worked on a team =
that has done so much manful work.  At this point, I=92m going to turn this=
 project over to our Comms team to add/edit/whatever.  If you have any sugg=
estions for additional content please direct to them.  Thanks. - Kate
