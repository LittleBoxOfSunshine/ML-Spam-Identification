Just spoke to Shana. She's the one. She said she knows all the players on both sides and she has her marching orders from the senator. She already had Garret's number.  She also said that there are more of "us" than there are of "them" and the senator has been making calls all day since he spoke to you.  They are delighted that you are in Alaska.  Have fun and make sure your baby girl has a great time.   I don't have words for your so-called political shop.   Call Shana first!!!

She definitely wants to meet and talk with you, but she told me that she just spoke with the Mayor of Anchorage and that her understanding is the the Senator has assigned someone from his team- Shana Thoma to you for the day.   Assemblywoman Gray-Jackson is originally from Jersey. She is going to events during the day, but not the dinner. She said she's from Newark and she won't be bullied and she didn't want to have to curse anybody out. But, after talking to Chaka, she was at an event with the Mayor and told him about you coming, etc and he said that it was all worked out. So Garret, here are two numbers for you:
>> 
>> Assemblywoman Elvi Gray-Jackson 907- 230-0320. Asked that you please call her once DWS lands and gets situated. She would love to speak to her candidly about the events she attended today and provide some background.
