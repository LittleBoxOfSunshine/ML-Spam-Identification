THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release  May 15, 2016

REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

AT COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS=20

AT RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW JERSEY



Brunswick, New Jersey





1:04 P.M. EDT





 THE PRESIDENT: Hello Rutgers! (Applause.) R-U rah-rah! (Applause.) Thank=
 you so much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you, Presid=
ent Barchi, for that introduction. Let me congratulate my extraordinarily=
 worthy fellow honorary Scarlet Knights, Dr. Burnell and Bill Moyers.=20



Matthew, good job. (Applause.) If you are interested, we can talk after t=
his. (Applause.)=20



One of the perks of my job is honorary degrees. (Laughter.) But I have to=
 tell you, it impresses nobody in my house. (Laughter.) Now Malia and Sas=
ha just say, Okay, Dr. Dad, well see you later. Can we have some money? (=
Laughter.) **



To the Board of Governors; to Chairman Brown; to Lieutenant Governor Guad=
agno; Mayor Cahill; Mayor Wahler, members of Congress, Rutgers administra=
tors, faculty, staff, friends, and family -- thank you for the honor of j=
oining you for the 250th anniversary of this remarkable institution. (App=
lause.) But most of all, congratulations to the Class of 2016! (Applause.=
)=20

I come here for a simple reason -- to finally settle this pork roll vs. T=
aylor ham question. (Laughter and applause.) I'm just kidding. (Laughter.=
) Theres not much Im afraid to take on in my final year of office, but I =
know better than to get in the middle of that debate. (Laughter.)=20



The truth is, Rutgers, I came here because you asked. (Applause.) Now, it=
's true that a lot of schools invite me to their commencement every year.=
 But you are the first to launch a three-year campaign. (Laughter.) Email=
s, letters, tweets, YouTube videos. I even got three notes from the grand=
mother of your student body president. (Laughter.) And I have to say that=
 really sealed the deal. That was smart, because I have a soft spot for g=
randmas. (Laughter.)=20



So I'm here, off Exit 9, on the banks of the Old Raritan -- (applause) --=
 at the site of one of the original nine colonial colleges. (Applause.) W=
inners of the first-ever college football game. (Applause.) One of the ne=
west members of the Big Ten. (Applause.) Home of what I understand to be =
a Grease Truck for a Fat Sandwich. (Applause.) Mozzarella sticks and chic=
ken fingers on your cheesesteaks -- (applause.) Im sure Michelle would ap=
prove. (Laughter.)=20



But somehow, you have survived such death-defying acts. (Laughter.) You a=
lso survived the daily jockeying for buses, from Livingston to Busch, to =
Cook, to Douglass, and back again. (Applause.) I suspect that a few of yo=
u are trying to survive this afternoon, after a late night at Olde Queens=
. (Applause.) You know who you are. (Laughter.)=20



But, however you got here, you made it. You made it. Today, you join a lo=
ng line of Scarlet Knights whose energy and intellect have lifted this un=
iversity to heights its founders could not have imagined. Two hundred and=
 fifty years ago, when America was still just an idea, a charter from the=
 Royal Governor -- Ben Franklins son -- established Queens College. A few=
 years later, a handful of students gathered in a converted tavern for th=
e first class. And from that first class in a pub, Rutgers has evolved in=
to one of the finest research institutions in America. (Applause.)=20



This is a place where you 3D-print prosthetic hands for children, and dev=
ise rooftop wind arrays that can power entire office buildings with clean=
, renewable energy. Every day, tens of thousands of students come here, t=
o this intellectual melting pot, where ideas and cultures flow together a=
mong what might just be Americas most diverse student body. (Applause.) H=
ere in New Brunswick, you can debate philosophy with a classmate from Sou=
th Asia in one class, and then strike up a conversation on the EE Bus wit=
h a first-generation Latina student from Jersey City, before sitting down=
 for your psych group project with a veteran whos going to school on the =
Post-9/11 GI Bill. (Applause.)=20



America converges here. And in so many ways, the history of Rutgers mirro=
rs the evolution of America -- the course by which we became bigger, stro=
nger, and richer and more dynamic, and a more inclusive nation.=20



But Americas progress has never been smooth or steady. Progress doesnt tr=
avel in a straight line. It zigs and zags in fits and starts. Progress in=
 America has been hard and contentious, and sometimes bloody. It remains =
uneven and at times, for every two steps forward, it feels like we take o=
ne step back.=20



Now, for some of you, this may sound like your college career. (Laughter.=
) It sounds like mine, anyway. (Laughter.) Which makes sense, because mea=
sured against the whole of human history, America remains a very young na=
tion -- younger, even, than this university.



But progress is bumpy. It always has been. But because of dreamers and in=
novators and strivers and activists, progress has been this nations hallm=
ark. Im fond of quoting Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who said, The arc of=
 the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. (Applause.) It=
 bends towards justice. I believe that. But I also believe that the arc o=
f our nation, the arc of the world does not bend towards justice, or free=
dom, or equality, or prosperity on its own. It depends on us, on the choi=
ces we make, particularly at certain inflection points in history; partic=
ularly when big changes are happening and everything seems up for grabs.



And, Class of 2016, you are graduating at such an inflection point. Since=
 the start of this new millennium, youve already witnessed horrific terro=
rist attacks, and war, and a Great Recession. Youve seen economic and tec=
hnological and cultural shifts that are profoundly altering how we work a=
nd how we communicate, how we live, how we form families. The pace of cha=
nge is not subsiding; it is accelerating. And these changes offer not onl=
y great opportunity, but also great peril.=20



Fortunately, your generation has everything it takes to lead this country=
 toward a brighter future. Im confident that you can make the right choic=
es -- away from fear and division and paralysis, and toward cooperation a=
nd innovation and hope. (Applause.) Now, partly, Im confident because, on=
 average, youre smarter and better educated than my generation -- althoug=
h we probably had better penmanship -- (laughter) -- and were certainly b=
etter spellers. We did not have spell-check back in my day. Youre not onl=
y better educated, youve been more exposed to the world, more exposed to =
other cultures. Youre more diverse. Youre more environmentally conscious.=
 You have a healthy skepticism for conventional wisdom.=20



So youve got the tools to lead us. And precisely because I have so much c=
onfidence in you, Im not going to spend the remainder of my time telling =
you exactly how youre going to make the world better. Youll figure it out=
. Youll look at things with fresher eyes, unencumbered by the biases and =
blind spots and inertia and general crankiness of your parents and grandp=
arents and old heads like me. But I do have a couple of suggestions that =
you may find useful as you go out there and conquer the world.=20



Point number one: When you hear someone longing for the good old days, ta=
ke it with a grain of salt. (Laughter and applause.) Take it with a grain=
 of salt. We live in a great nation and we are rightly proud of our histo=
ry. We are beneficiaries of the labor and the grit and the courage of gen=
erations who came before. But I guess it's part of human nature, especial=
ly in times of change and uncertainty, to want to look backwards and long=
 for some imaginary past when everything worked, and the economy hummed, =
and all politicians were wise, and every kid was well-mannered, and Ameri=
ca pretty much did whatever it wanted around the world.=20



Guess what. It aint so. (Laughter.) The good old days werent that great. =
Yes, there have been some stretches in our history where the economy grew=
 much faster, or when government ran more smoothly. There were moments wh=
en, immediately after World War II, for example, or the end of the Cold W=
ar, when the world bent more easily to our will. But those are sporadic, =
those moments, those episodes. In fact, by almost every measure, America =
is better, and the world is better, than it was 50 years ago, or 30 years=
 ago, or even eight years ago. (Applause.)=20



And by the way, I'm not -- set aside 150 years ago, pre-Civil War -- ther=
es a whole bunch of stuff there we could talk about. Set aside life in th=
e 50s, when women and people of color were systematically excluded from b=
ig chunks of American life. Since I graduated, in 1983 -- which isn't tha=
t long ago -- (laughter) -- I'm just saying. Since I graduated, crime rat=
es, teenage pregnancy, the share of Americans living in poverty -- theyre=
 all down. The share of Americans with college educations have gone way u=
p. Our life expectancy has, as well. Blacks and Latinos have risen up the=
 ranks in business and politics. (Applause.) More women are in the workfo=
rce. (Applause.) Theyre earning more money -- although its long past time=
 that we passed laws to make sure that women are getting the same pay for=
 the same work as men. (Applause.)=20



Meanwhile, in the eight years since most of you started high school, were=
 also better off. You and your fellow graduates are entering the job mark=
et with better prospects than any time since 2007. Twenty million more Am=
ericans know the financial security of health insurance. Were less depend=
ent on foreign oil. Weve doubled the production of clean energy. We have =
cut the high school dropout rate. We've cut the deficit by two-thirds. Ma=
rriage equality is the law of the land. (Applause.)=20



And just as America is better, the world is better than when I graduated.=
 Since I graduated, an Iron Curtain fell, apartheid ended. Theres more de=
mocracy. We virtually eliminated certain diseases like polio. Weve cut ex=
treme poverty drastically. We've cut infant mortality by an enormous amou=
nt. (Applause.)=20

Now, I say all these things not to make you complacent. Weve got a bunch =
of big problems to solve. But I say it to point out that change has been =
a constant in our history. And the reason America is better is because we=
 didnt look backwards we didnt fear the future. We seized the future and =
made it our own. And thats exactly why its always been young people like =
you that have brought about big change -- because you don't fear the futu=
re.=20



That leads me to my second point: The world is more interconnected than e=
ver before, and its becoming more connected every day. Building walls won=
t change that. (Applause.)=20



Look, as President, my first responsibility is always the security and pr=
osperity of the United States. And as citizens, we all rightly put our co=
untry first. But if the past two decades have taught us anything, its tha=
t the biggest challenges we face cannot be solved in isolation. (Applause=
.) When overseas states start falling apart, they become breeding grounds=
 for terrorists and ideologies of nihilism and despair that ultimately ca=
n reach our shores. When developing countries dont have functioning healt=
h systems, epidemics like Zika or Ebola can spread and threaten Americans=
, too. And a wall won't stop that. (Applause.)=20



If we want to close loopholes that allow large corporations and wealthy i=
ndividuals to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, weve got to have th=
e cooperation of other countries in a global financial system to help enf=
orce financial laws. The point is, to help ourselves weve got to help oth=
ers -- (applause) -- not pull up the drawbridge and try to keep the world=
 out. (Applause.)=20



And engagement does not just mean deploying our military. There are times=
 where we must take military action to protect ourselves and our allies, =
and we are in awe of and we are grateful for the men and women who make u=
p the finest fighting force the world has ever known. (Applause.) But I w=
orry if we think that the entire burden of our engagement with the world =
is up to the 1 percent who serve in our military, and the rest of us can =
just sit back and do nothing. They can't shoulder the entire burden. And =
engagement means using all the levers of our national power, and rallying=
 the world to take on our shared challenges.=20



You look at something like trade, for example. We live in an age of globa=
l supply chains, and cargo ships that crisscross oceans, and online comme=
rce that can render borders obsolete. And a lot of folks have legitimate =
concerns with the way globalization has progressed -- that's one of the c=
hanges that's been taking place -- jobs shipped overseas, trade deals tha=
t sometimes put workers and businesses at a disadvantage. But the answer =
isnt to stop trading with other countries. In this global economy, thats =
not even possible. The answer is to do trade the right way, by negotiatin=
g with other countries so that they raise their labor standards and their=
 environmental standards; and we make sure they dont impose unfair tariff=
s on American goods or steal American intellectual property. Thats how we=
 make sure that international rules are consistent with our values -- inc=
luding human rights. And ultimately, that's how we help raise wages here =
in America. Thats how we help our workers compete on a level playing fiel=
d.=20



Building walls won't do that. (Applause.) It won't boost our economy, and=
 it wont enhance our security either. Isolating or disparaging Muslims, s=
uggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to enteri=
ng this country -- (applause) -- that is not just a betrayal of our value=
s -- (applause) -- that's not just a betrayal of who we are, it would ali=
enate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important =
partners in the fight against violent extremism. Suggesting that we can b=
uild an endless wall along our borders, and blame our challenges on immig=
rants -- that doesnt just run counter to our history as the worlds meltin=
g pot; it contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation and=
 our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers =
from every corner of the globe. That's how we became America. Why would w=
e want to stop it now? (Applause.)=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER: Four more years!



THE PRESIDENT: Can't do it. (Laughter.)=20



Which brings me to my third point: Facts, evidence, reason, logic, an und=
erstanding of science -- these are good things. (Applause.) These are qua=
lities you want in people making policy. These are qualities you want to =
continue to cultivate in yourselves as citizens. (Applause.) That might s=
eem obvious. (Laughter.) That's why we honor Bill Moyers or Dr. Burnell. =
We traditionally have valued those things. But if you were listening to t=
odays political debate, you might wonder where this strain of anti-intell=
ectualism came from. (Applause.) So, Class of 2016, let me be as clear as=
 I can be. In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. (Applause.=
) It's not cool to not know what you're talking about. (Applause.) That's=
 not keeping it real, or telling it like it is. (Laughter.) That's not ch=
allenging political correctness. That's just not knowing what you're talk=
ing about. (Applause.) And yet, we've become confused about this.=20



Look, our nations Founders -- Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson -- t=
hey were born of the Enlightenment. They sought to escape superstition, a=
nd sectarianism, and tribalism, and no-nothingness. (Applause.) They beli=
eved in rational thought and experimentation, and the capacity of informe=
d citizens to master our own fates. That is embedded in our constitutiona=
l design. That spirit informed our inventors and our explorers, the Ediso=
ns and the Wright Brothers, and the George Washington Carvers and the Gra=
ce Hoppers, and the Norman Borlaugs and the Steve Jobses. That's what bui=
lt this country.=20

=20

And today, in every phone in one of your pockets -- (laughter) -- we have=
 access to more information than at any time in human history, at a touch=
 of a button. But, ironically, the flood of information hasnt made us mor=
e discerning of the truth. In some ways, its just made us more confident =
in our ignorance. (Applause.) We assume whatever is on the web must be tr=
ue. We search for sites that just reinforce our own predispositions. Opin=
ions masquerade as facts. The wildest conspiracy theories are taken for g=
ospel.=20



Now, understand, I am sure youve learned during your years of college -- =
and if not, you will learn soon -- that there are a whole lot of folks wh=
o are book smart and have no common sense. (Applause.) That's the truth. =
Youll meet them if you haven't already. (Laughter.) So the fact that they=
ve got a fancy degree -- you got to talk to them to see whether they know=
 what theyre talking about. (Laughter.) Qualities like kindness and compa=
ssion, honesty, hard work -- they often matter more than technical skills=
 or know-how. (Applause.)=20



But when our leaders express a disdain for facts, when theyre not held ac=
countable for repeating falsehoods and just making stuff up, while actual=
 experts are dismissed as elitists, then weve got a problem. (Applause.)=20=




You know, it's interesting that if we get sick, we actually want to make =
sure the doctors have gone to medical school, they know what theyre talki=
ng about. (Applause.) If we get on a plane, we say we really want a pilot=
 to be able to pilot the plane. (Laughter.) And yet, in our public lives,=
 we certainly think, I don't want somebody whos done it before. (Laughter=
 and applause.) The rejection of facts, the rejection of reason and scien=
ce -- that is the path to decline. It calls to mind the words of Carl Sag=
an, who graduated high school here in New Jersey -- (applause) -- he said=
: We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth=
s of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than wha=
t feels good.=20



The debate around climate change is a perfect example of this. Now, I rec=
ognize it doesnt feel like the planet is warmer right now. (Laughter.) I =
understand. There was hail when I landed in Newark. (Laughter.) (The wind=
 starts blowing hard.) (Laughter.) But think about the climate change iss=
ue. Every day, there are officials in high office with responsibilities w=
ho mock the overwhelming consensus of the worlds scientists that human ac=
tivities and the release of carbon dioxide and methane and other substanc=
es are altering our climate in profound and dangerous ways.=20



A while back, you may have seen a United States senator trotted out a sno=
wball during a floor speech in the middle of winter as proof that the wor=
ld was not warming. (Laughter.) I mean, listen, climate change is not som=
ething subject to political spin. There is evidence. There are facts. We =
can see it happening right now. (Applause.) If we dont act, if we don't f=
ollow through on the progress we made in Paris, the progress we've been m=
aking here at home, your generation will feel the brunt of this catastrop=
he.=20



So its up to you to insist upon and shape an informed debate. Imagine if =
Benjamin Franklin had seen that senator with the snowball, what he would =
think. Imagine if your 5th grade science teacher had seen that. (Laughter=
.) Hed get a D. (Laughter.) And hes a senator! (Laughter.)



Look, I'm not suggesting that cold analysis and hard data are ultimately =
more important in life than passion, or faith, or love, or loyalty. I am =
suggesting that those highest expressions of our humanity can only flouri=
sh when our economy functions well, and proposed budgets add up, and our =
environment is protected. And to accomplish those things, to make collect=
ive decisions on behalf of a common good, we have to use our heads. We ha=
ve to agree that facts and evidence matter. And we got to hold our leader=
s and ourselves accountable to know what the heck theyre talking about. (=
Applause.)=20



All right. I only have two more points. I know it's getting cold and you =
guys have to graduate. (Laughter.) Point four: Have faith in democracy. L=
ook, I know its not always pretty. Really, I know. (Laughter.) I've been =
living it. But its how, bit by bit, generation by generation, we have mad=
e progress in this nation. That's how we banned child labor. That's how w=
e cleaned up our air and our water. That's how we passed programs like So=
cial Security and Medicare that lifted millions of seniors out of poverty=
. (Applause.)=20



None of these changes happened overnight. They didnt happen because some =
charismatic leader got everybody suddenly to agree on everything. It didn=
t happen because some massive political revolution occurred. It actually =
happened over the course of years of advocacy, and organizing, and allian=
ce-building, and deal-making, and the changing of public opinion. It happ=
ened because ordinary Americans who cared participated in the political p=
rocess.=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER: Because of you! (Applause.)=20



THE PRESIDENT: Well, that's nice. I mean, I helped, but -- (applause.)



Look, if you want to change this country for the better, you better start=
 participating. I'll give you an example on a lot of peoples minds right =
now -- and thats the growing inequality in our economy. Over much of the =
last century, weve unleashed the strongest economic engine the world has =
ever seen, but over the past few decades, our economy has become more and=
 more unequal. The top 10 percent of earners now take in half of all inco=
me in the U.S. In the past, it used to be a top CEO made 20 or 30 times t=
he income of the average worker. Today, its 300 times more. And wages are=
nt rising fast enough for millions of hardworking families.=20



Now, if we want to reverse those trends, there are a bunch of policies th=
at would make a real difference. We can raise the minimum wage. (Applause=
.) We can modernize our infrastructure. We can invest in early childhood =
education. We can make college more affordable. (Applause.) We can close =
tax loopholes on hedge fund managers and take that money and give tax bre=
aks to help families with child care or retirement. And if we did these t=
hings, then wed help to restore the sense that hard work is rewarded and =
we could build an economy that truly works for everybody. (Applause.)=20



Now, the reason some of these things have not happened, even though the m=
ajority of people approve of them, is really simple. It's not because I w=
asnt proposing them. It wasnt because the facts and the evidence showed t=
hey wouldn't work. It was because a huge chunk of Americans, especially y=
oung people, do not vote.=20

In 2014, voter turnout was the lowest since World War II. Fewer than one =
in five young people showed up to vote -- 2014. And the four who stayed h=
ome determined the course of this country just as much as the single one =
who voted. Because apathy has consequences. It determines who our Congres=
s is. It determines what policies they prioritize. It even, for example, =
determines whether a really highly qualified Supreme Court nominee receiv=
es the courtesy of a hearing and a vote in the United States Senate. (App=
lause.)=20



And, yes, big money in politics is a huge problem. We've got to reduce it=
s influence. Yes, special interests and lobbyists have disproportionate a=
ccess to the corridors of power. But, contrary to what we hear sometimes =
from both the left as well as the right, the system isnt as rigged as you=
 think, and it certainly is not as hopeless as you think. Politicians car=
e about being elected, and they especially care about being reelected. An=
d if you vote and you elect a majority that represents your views, you wi=
ll get what you want. And if you opt out, or stop paying attention, you w=
ont. Its that simple. (Applause.) It's not that complicated.=20



Now, one of the reasons that people dont vote is because they dont see th=
e changes they were looking for right away. Well, guess what -- none of t=
he great strides in our history happened right away. It took Thurgood Mar=
shall and the NAACP decades to win Brown v. Board of Education; and then =
another decade after that to secure the Civil Rights Act and the Voting R=
ights Act. (Applause.) And it took more time after that for it to start w=
orking. It took a proud daughter of New Jersey, Alice Paul, years of orga=
nizing marches and hunger strikes and protests, and drafting hundreds of =
pieces of legislation, and writing letters and giving speeches, and worki=
ng with congressional leaders before she and other suffragettes finally h=
elped win women the right to vote. (Applause.)=20



Each stage along the way required compromise. Sometimes you took half a l=
oaf. You forged allies. Sometimes you lost on an issue, and then you came=
 back to fight another day. Thats how democracy works. So youve got to be=
 committed to participating not just if you get immediate gratification, =
but you got to be a citizen full-time, all the time.=20



And if participation means voting, and it means compromise, and organizin=
g and advocacy, it also means listening to those who dont agree with you.=
 I know a couple years ago, folks on this campus got upset that Condoleez=
za Rice was supposed to speak at a commencement. Now, I don't think it's =
a secret that I disagree with many of the foreign policies of Dr. Rice an=
d the previous administration. But the notion that this community or the =
country would be better served by not hearing from a former Secretary of =
State, or shutting out what she had to say -- I believe thats misguided. =
(Applause.) I don't think that's how democracy works best, when we're not=
 even willing to listen to each other. (Applause.) I believe that's misgu=
ided.=20



If you disagree with somebody, bring them in -- (applause)=20

-- and ask them tough questions. Hold their feet to the fire. Make them d=
efend their positions. (Applause.) If somebody has got a bad or offensive=
 idea, prove it wrong. Engage it. Debate it. Stand up for what you believ=
e in. (Applause.) Don't be scared to take somebody on. Don't feel like yo=
u got to shut your ears off because you're too fragile and somebody might=
 offend your sensibilities. Go at them if theyre not making any sense. Us=
e your logic and reason and words. And by doing so, youll strengthen your=
 own position, and youll hone your arguments. And maybe youll learn somet=
hing and realize you don't know everything. And you may have a new unders=
tanding not only about what your opponents believe but maybe what you bel=
ieve. Either way, you win. And more importantly, our democracy wins. (App=
lause.)=20



So, anyway, all right. That's it, Class of 2016 -- (laughter) -- a few su=
ggestions on how you can change the world. Except maybe I've got one last=
 suggestion. (Applause.) Just one. And that is, gear yourself for the lon=
g haul. Whatever path you choose -- business, nonprofits, government, edu=
cation, health care, the arts -- whatever it is, you're going to have som=
e setbacks. You will deal occasionally with foolish people. You will be f=
rustrated. Youll have a boss that's not great. You wont always get everyt=
hing you want -- at least not as fast as you want it. So you have to stic=
k with it. You have to be persistent. And success, however small, however=
 incomplete, success is still success. I always tell my daughters, you kn=
ow, better is good. It may not be perfect, it may not be great, but it's =
good. That's how progress happens -- in societies and in our own lives.=20=




So dont lose hope if sometimes you hit a roadblock. Don't lose hope in th=
e face of naysayers. And certainly dont let resistance make you cynical. =
Cynicism is so easy, and cynics dont accomplish much. As a friend of mine=
 who happens to be from New Jersey, a guy named Bruce Springsteen, once s=
ang -- (applause) -- they spend their lives waiting for a moment that jus=
t dont come. Dont let that be you. Dont waste your time waiting.=20



If you doubt you can make a difference, look at the impact some of your f=
ellow graduates are already making. Look at what Matthew is doing. Look a=
t somebody like Yasmin Ramadan, who began organizing anti-bullying assemb=
lies when she was 10 years old to help kids handle bias and discriminatio=
n, and here at Rutgers, helped found the Muslim Public Relations Council =
to work with administrators and police to promote inclusion. (Applause.)=20=


Look at somebody like Madison Little, who grew up dealing with some healt=
h issues, and started wondering what his care would have been like if he =
lived someplace else, and so, here at Rutgers, he took charge of a studen=
t nonprofit and worked with folks in Australia and Cambodia and Uganda to=
 address the AIDS epidemic. Our generation has so much energy to adapt an=
d impact the world, he said. My peers give me a lot of hope that well ove=
rcome the obstacles we face in society.



That's you! Is it any wonder that I am optimistic? Throughout our history=
, a new generation of Americans has reached up and bent the arc of histor=
y in the direction of more freedom, and more opportunity, and more justic=
e. And, Class of 2016, it is your turn now -- (applause) -- to shape our =
nations destiny, as well as your own.=20



So get to work. Make sure the next 250 years are better than the last. (A=
pplause.)=20



Good luck. God bless you. God bless this country we love. Thank you. (App=
lause.)=20

 of joining you for the 250th anniversary of this remarkable institution.&n=
bsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But most of all, congratulations to the Class of 201=
6!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I come here for a simple =
reason -- to finally settle this pork roll vs. Taylor ham question.&nbsp; (=
Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; I'm just kidding.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; The=
re&#8217;s not much I&#8217;m afraid to take on in my final year of
 office, but I know better than to get in the middle of that debate.&nbsp; =
(Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The truth is, Rutgers, I =
came here because you asked.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Now, it's true that a =
lot of schools invite me to their commencement every year.&nbsp; But you ar=
e the first to launch a three-year campaign.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
 Emails, letters, tweets, YouTube videos.&nbsp; I even got three notes from=
 the grandmother of your student body president.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; An=
d I have to say that really sealed the deal.&nbsp; That was smart, because =
I have a soft spot for grandmas.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I'm here, off Exit 9, =

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But somehow, you have sur=
vived such death-defying acts.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You also survived th=
e daily jockeying for buses, from Livingston to Busch, to Cook, to Douglass=
, and back again. &nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp; I suspect that
 a few of you are trying to survive this afternoon, after a late night at O=
lde Queens.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; You know who you are.&nbsp; (Laughter.)=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But, however you got here=
, you made it.&nbsp; You made it.&nbsp; Today, you join a long line of Scar=
let Knights whose energy and intellect have lifted this university to heigh=
ts its founders could not have imagined.&nbsp; Two
 hundred and fifty years ago, when America was still just an idea, a charte=
r from the Royal Governor -- Ben Franklin&#8217;s son -- established Queen&=
#8217;s College.&nbsp; A few years later, a handful of students gathered in=
 a converted tavern for the first class.&nbsp; And from
 that first class in a pub, Rutgers has evolved into one of the finest rese=
arch institutions in America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This is a place where you=
 3D-print prosthetic hands for children, and devise rooftop wind arrays tha=
t can power entire office buildings with clean, renewable energy.&nbsp; Eve=
ry day, tens of thousands of students come
 here, to this intellectual melting pot, where ideas and cultures flow toge=
ther among what might just be America&#8217;s most diverse student body.&nb=
sp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Here in New Brunswick, you can debate philosophy with=
 a classmate from South Asia in one class, and then
 strike up a conversation on the EE Bus with a first-generation Latina stud=
ent from Jersey City, before sitting down for your psych group project with=
 a veteran who&#8217;s going to school on the Post-9/11 GI Bill.&nbsp; (App=
lause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">America converges here.&n=
bsp; And in so many ways, the history of Rutgers mirrors the evolution of A=
merica -- the course by which we became bigger, stronger, and richer and mo=
re dynamic, and a more inclusive nation.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But America&#8217;s progr=
ess has never been smooth or steady.&nbsp; Progress doesn&#8217;t travel in=
 a straight line.&nbsp; It zigs and zags in fits and starts.&nbsp; Progress=
 in America has been hard and contentious, and sometimes bloody.&nbsp;
 It remains uneven and at times, for every two steps forward, it feels like=
 we take one step back.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, for some of you, thi=
s may sound like your college career.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; It sounds lik=
e mine, anyway.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Which makes sense, because measured=
 against the whole of human history, America remains a very

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But progress is bumpy.&nb=
sp; It always has been.&nbsp; But because of dreamers and innovators and st=
rivers and activists, progress has been this nation&#8217;s hallmark.&nbsp;=
 I&#8217;m fond of quoting Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who said,
 &#8220;The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice=
.&#8221;&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It bends towards justice.&nbsp; I believe =
that.&nbsp; But I also believe that the arc of our nation, the arc of the w=
orld does not bend towards justice, or freedom, or equality, or
 prosperity on its own.&nbsp; It depends on us, on the choices we make, par=
ticularly at certain inflection points in history; particularly when big ch=
anges are happening and everything seems up for grabs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And, Class of 2016, you a=
re graduating at such an inflection point.&nbsp; Since the start of this ne=
w millennium, you&#8217;ve already witnessed horrific terrorist attacks, an=
d war, and a Great Recession.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve seen economic
 and technological and cultural shifts that are profoundly altering how we =
work and how we communicate, how we live, how we form families.&nbsp; The p=
ace of change is not subsiding; it is accelerating.&nbsp; And these changes=
 offer not only great opportunity, but also
 great peril. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Fortunately, your generat=
ion has everything it takes to lead this country toward a brighter future.&=
nbsp; I&#8217;m confident that you can make the right choices -- away from =
fear and division and paralysis, and toward cooperation
 and innovation and hope.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Now, partly, I&#8217;m co=
nfident because, on average, you&#8217;re smarter and better educated than =
my generation -- although we probably had better penmanship -- (laughter) -=
- and were certainly better spellers.&nbsp; We did not have
 spell-check back in my day.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not only better educated, y=
ou&#8217;ve been more exposed to the world, more exposed to other cultures.=
&nbsp; You&#8217;re more diverse.&nbsp; You&#8217;re more environmentally c=
onscious.&nbsp; You have a healthy skepticism for conventional wisdom.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So you&#8217;ve got the t=
ools to lead us.&nbsp; And precisely because I have so much confidence in y=
ou, I&#8217;m not going to spend the remainder of my time telling you exact=
ly how you&#8217;re going to make the world better.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll
 figure it out.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll look at things with fresher eyes, unencu=
mbered by the biases and blind spots and inertia and general crankiness of =
your parents and grandparents and old heads like me.&nbsp; But I do have a =
couple of suggestions that you may find useful as
 you go out there and conquer the world. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Point number one:&nbsp; W=
hen you hear someone longing for the &#8220;good old days,&#8221; take it w=
ith a grain of salt.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; Take it with a gr=
ain of salt.&nbsp; We live in a great nation and we are rightly proud
 of our history.&nbsp; We are beneficiaries of the labor and the grit and t=
he courage of generations who came before.&nbsp; But I guess it's part of h=
uman nature, especially in times of change and uncertainty, to want to look=
 backwards and long for some imaginary past
 when everything worked, and the economy hummed, and all politicians were w=
ise, and every kid was well-mannered, and America pretty much did whatever =
it wanted around the world.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Guess what.&nbsp; It ain&=
#8217;t so.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; The &#8220;good old days&#8221; weren&#=
8217;t that great.&nbsp; Yes, there have been some stretches in our history=
 where the economy grew much faster, or when government ran more smoothly.&=
nbsp; There
 were moments when, immediately after World War II, for example, or the end=
 of the Cold War, when the world bent more easily to our will.&nbsp; But th=
ose are sporadic, those moments, those episodes.&nbsp; In fact, by almost e=
very measure, America is better, and the world
 is better, than it was 50 years ago, or 30 years ago, or even eight years =
ago.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And by the way, I'm not -=
- set aside 150 years ago, pre-Civil War -- there&#8217;s a whole bunch of =
stuff there we could talk about.&nbsp; Set aside life in the &#8216;50s, wh=
en women and people of color were systematically excluded
 from big chunks of American life.&nbsp; Since I graduated, in 1983 -- whic=
h isn't that long ago -- (laughter) -- I'm just saying.&nbsp; Since I gradu=
ated, crime rates, teenage pregnancy, the share of Americans living in pove=
rty -- they&#8217;re all down.&nbsp; The share of Americans
 with college educations have gone way up.&nbsp; Our life expectancy has, a=
s well.&nbsp; Blacks and Latinos have risen up the ranks in business and po=
litics.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; More women are in the workforce.&nbsp; (App=
lause.)&nbsp; They&#8217;re earning more money -- although it&#8217;s long
 past time that we passed laws to make sure that women are getting the same=
 pay for the same work as men.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Meanwhile, in the eight y=
ears since most of you started high school, we&#8217;re also better off.&nb=
sp; You and your fellow graduates are entering the job market with better p=
rospects than any time since 2007.&nbsp; Twenty million
 more Americans know the financial security of health insurance.&nbsp; We&#=
8217;re less dependent on foreign oil.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve doubled the produc=
tion of clean energy.&nbsp; We have cut the high school dropout rate.&nbsp;=
 We've cut the deficit by two-thirds.&nbsp; Marriage equality is the
 law of the land.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And just as America is be=
tter, the world is better than when I graduated.&nbsp; Since I graduated, a=
n Iron Curtain fell, apartheid ended.&nbsp; There&#8217;s more democracy.&n=
bsp; We virtually eliminated certain diseases like polio.&nbsp;
 We&#8217;ve cut extreme poverty drastically.&nbsp; We've cut infant mortal=
ity by an enormous amount.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, I say all these thin=
gs not to make you complacent.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got a bunch of big problem=
s to solve.&nbsp; But I say it to point out that change has been a constant=
 in our history.&nbsp; And the reason America is better is
 because we didn&#8217;t look backwards we didn&#8217;t fear the future.&nb=
sp; We seized the future and made it our own.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s exactl=
y why it&#8217;s always been young people like you that have brought about =
big change -- because you don't fear the future.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That leads me to my secon=
d point:&nbsp; The world is more interconnected than ever before, and it&#8=
217;s becoming more connected every day.&nbsp; Building walls won&#8217;t c=
hange that.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Look, as President, my fi=
rst responsibility is always the security and prosperity of the United Stat=
es.&nbsp; And as citizens, we all rightly put our country first.&nbsp; But =
if the past two decades have taught us anything,
 it&#8217;s that the biggest challenges we face cannot be solved in isolati=
on.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; When overseas states start falling apart, they =
become breeding grounds for terrorists and ideologies of nihilism and despa=
ir that ultimately can reach our shores.&nbsp; When developing
 countries don&#8217;t have functioning health systems, epidemics like Zika=
 or Ebola can spread and threaten Americans, too.&nbsp; And a wall won't st=
op that. (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">If we want to close looph=
oles that allow large corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid paying =
their fair share of taxes, we&#8217;ve got to have the cooperation of other=
 countries in a global financial system to
 help enforce financial laws.&nbsp; The point is, to help ourselves we&#821=
7;ve got to help others -- (applause) -- not pull up the drawbridge and try=
 to keep the world out.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And engagement does not j=
ust mean deploying our military.&nbsp; There are times where we must take m=
ilitary action to protect ourselves and our allies, and we are in awe of an=
d we are grateful for the men and women who
 make up the finest fighting force the world has ever known.&nbsp; (Applaus=
e.)&nbsp; But I worry if we think that the entire burden of our engagement =
with the world is up to the 1 percent who serve in our military, and the re=
st of us can just sit back and do nothing.&nbsp;
 They can't shoulder the entire burden.&nbsp; And engagement means using al=
l the levers of our national power, and rallying the world to take on our s=
hared challenges.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">You look at something lik=
e trade, for example.&nbsp; We live in an age of global supply chains, and =
cargo ships that crisscross oceans, and online commerce that can render bor=
ders obsolete.&nbsp; And a lot of folks have legitimate
 concerns with the way globalization has progressed -- that's one of the ch=
anges that's been taking place -- jobs shipped overseas, trade deals that s=
ometimes put workers and businesses at a disadvantage.&nbsp; But the answer=
 isn&#8217;t to stop trading with other countries.&nbsp;
 In this global economy, that&#8217;s not even possible.&nbsp; The answer i=
s to do trade the right way, by negotiating with other countries so that th=
ey raise their labor standards and their environmental standards; and we ma=
ke sure they don&#8217;t impose unfair tariffs on
 American goods or steal American intellectual property.&nbsp; That&#8217;s=
 how we make sure that international rules are consistent with our values -=
- including human rights.&nbsp; And ultimately, that's how we help raise wa=
ges here in America.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how we help our workers
 compete on a level playing field.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Building walls won't do t=
hat. (Applause.)&nbsp; It won't boost our economy, and it won&#8217;t enhan=
ce our security either.&nbsp; Isolating or disparaging Muslims, suggesting =
that they should be treated differently when it comes
 to entering this country -- (applause) -- that is not just a betrayal of o=
ur values -- (applause) -- that's not just a betrayal of who we are, it wou=
ld alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most import=
ant partners in the fight against
 violent extremism.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suggesting that we can build an endless wal=
l along our borders, and blame our challenges on immigrants -- that doesn&#=
8217;t just run counter to our history as the world&#8217;s melting pot; it=
 contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation
 and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract striver=
s from every corner of the globe.&nbsp; That's how we became America.&nbsp;=
 Why would we want to stop it now?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 It's not cool to not know what you're talking about.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbs=

 It actually happened over the course of years of advocacy, and organizing,=
 and alliance-building, and deal-making, and the changing of public opinion=
.&nbsp; It happened because ordinary Americans who cared participated in th=
e political process.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Be=
cause of you!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well=
, that's nice.&nbsp; I mean, I helped, but -- (applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Look, if you want to chan=
ge this country for the better, you better start participating.&nbsp; I'll =
give you an example on a lot of people&#8217;s minds right now -- and that&=
#8217;s the growing inequality in our economy.&nbsp; Over
 much of the last century, we&#8217;ve unleashed the strongest economic eng=
ine the world has ever seen, but over the past few decades, our economy has=
 become more and more unequal.&nbsp; The top 10 percent of earners now take=
 in half of all income in the U.S.&nbsp; In the
 past, it used to be a top CEO made 20 or 30 times the income of the averag=
e worker.&nbsp; Today, it&#8217;s 300 times more.&nbsp; And wages aren&#821=
7;t rising fast enough for millions of hardworking families.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, if we want to revers=
e those trends, there are a bunch of policies that would make a real differ=
ence.&nbsp; We can raise the minimum wage.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We can m=
odernize our infrastructure. We can invest in early
 childhood education.&nbsp; We can make college more affordable.&nbsp; (App=
lause.)&nbsp; We can close tax loopholes on hedge fund managers and take th=
at money and give tax breaks to help families with child care or retirement=
.&nbsp; And if we did these things, then we&#8217;d help to
 restore the sense that hard work is rewarded and we could build an economy=
 that truly works for everybody.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, the reason some of t=
hese things have not happened, even though the majority of people approve o=
f them, is really simple. It's not because I wasn&#8217;t proposing them.&n=
bsp; It wasn&#8217;t because the facts and the evidence
 showed they wouldn't work.&nbsp; It was because a huge chunk of Americans,=
 especially young people, do not vote.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In 2014, voter turnout wa=
s the lowest since World War II.&nbsp; Fewer than one in five young people =
showed up to vote -- 2014.&nbsp; And the four who stayed home determined th=
e course of this country just as much as the single
 one who voted.&nbsp; Because apathy has consequences.&nbsp; It determines =
who our Congress is.&nbsp; It determines what policies they prioritize.&nbs=
p; It even, for example, determines whether a really highly qualified Supre=
me Court nominee receives the courtesy of a hearing
 and a vote in the United States Senate.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And, yes, big money in po=
litics is a huge problem.&nbsp; We've got to reduce its influence.&nbsp; Ye=
s, special interests and lobbyists have disproportionate access to the corr=
idors of power. But, contrary to what we hear
 sometimes from both the left as well as the right, the system isn&#8217;t =
as rigged as you think, and it certainly is not as hopeless as you think.&n=
bsp; Politicians care about being elected, and they especially care about b=
eing reelected.&nbsp; And if you vote and you elect
 a majority that represents your views, you will get what you want.&nbsp; A=
nd if you opt out, or stop paying attention, you won&#8217;t.&nbsp; It&#821=
7;s that simple. (Applause.)&nbsp; It's not that complicated.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, one of the reasons t=
hat people don&#8217;t vote is because they don&#8217;t see the changes the=
y were looking for right away.&nbsp; Well, guess what -- none of the great =
strides in our history happened right away.&nbsp; It took
 Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP decades to win Brown v. Board of Education=
; and then another decade after that to secure the Civil Rights Act and the=
 Voting Rights Act.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And it took more time after tha=
t for it to start working.&nbsp; It took a proud
 daughter of New Jersey, Alice Paul, years of organizing marches and hunger=
 strikes and protests, and drafting hundreds of pieces of legislation, and =
writing letters and giving speeches, and working with congressional leaders=
 before she and other suffragettes
 finally helped win women the right to vote.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; <o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Each stage along the way =
required compromise.&nbsp; Sometimes you took half a loaf.&nbsp; You forged=
 allies.&nbsp; Sometimes you lost on an issue, and then you came back to fi=
ght another day.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how democracy works.&nbsp; So you&#8217=
;ve
 got to be committed to participating not just if you get immediate gratifi=
cation, but you got to be a citizen full-time, all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=
sp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And if participation mean=
s voting, and it means compromise, and organizing and advocacy, it also mea=
ns listening to those who don&#8217;t agree with you.&nbsp; I know a couple=
 years ago, folks on this campus got upset that
 Condoleezza Rice was supposed to speak at a commencement.&nbsp; Now, I don=
't think it's a secret that I disagree with many of the foreign policies of=
 Dr. Rice and the previous administration.&nbsp; But the notion that this c=
ommunity or the country would be better served
 by not hearing from a former Secretary of State, or shutting out what she =
had to say -- I believe that&#8217;s misguided.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I d=
on't think that's how democracy works best, when we're not even willing to =
listen to each other.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I believe that's
 misguided.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" align=3D"center" style=3D"text-align:center"><o:p>&n=
bsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">If you disagree with some=
body, bring them in -- (applause)
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">-- and ask them tough questions.&nbsp; Hold their fe=
et to the fire.&nbsp; Make them defend their positions.&nbsp; (Applause.)&n=
bsp; If somebody has got a bad or offensive idea, prove it wrong.&nbsp; Eng=
age it.&nbsp; Debate it.&nbsp; Stand up for what you believe in.&nbsp; (App=
lause.)&nbsp;
 Don't be scared to take somebody on.&nbsp; Don't feel like you got to shut=
 your ears off because you're too fragile and somebody might offend your se=
nsibilities.&nbsp; Go at them if they&#8217;re not making any sense. Use yo=
ur logic and reason and words.&nbsp; And by doing so,
 you&#8217;ll strengthen your own position, and you&#8217;ll hone your argu=
ments.&nbsp; And maybe you&#8217;ll learn something and realize you don't k=
now everything.&nbsp; And you may have a new understanding not only about w=
hat your opponents believe but maybe what you believe.&nbsp; Either
 way, you win.&nbsp; And more importantly, our democracy wins.&nbsp; (Appla=
use.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, anyway, all right.&nb=
sp; That's it, Class of 2016 -- (laughter) -- a few suggestions on how you =
can change the world. Except maybe I've got one last suggestion.&nbsp; (App=
lause.)&nbsp; Just one.&nbsp; And that is, gear yourself
 for the long haul.&nbsp; Whatever path you choose -- business, nonprofits,=
 government, education, health care, the arts -- whatever it is, you're goi=
ng to have some setbacks.&nbsp; You will deal occasionally with foolish peo=
ple.&nbsp; You will be frustrated.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll have
 a boss that's not great.&nbsp; You won&#8217;t always get everything you w=
ant -- at least not as fast as you want it.&nbsp; So you have to stick with=
 it.&nbsp; You have to be persistent.&nbsp; And success, however small, how=
ever incomplete, success is still success.&nbsp; I always tell
 my daughters, you know, better is good.&nbsp; It may not be perfect, it ma=
y not be great, but it's good.&nbsp; That's how progress happens -- in soci=
eties and in our own lives.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So don&#8217;t lose hope =
if sometimes you hit a roadblock.&nbsp; Don't lose hope in the face of nays=
ayers.&nbsp; And certainly don&#8217;t let resistance make you cynical.&nbs=
p; Cynicism is so easy, and cynics don&#8217;t accomplish much.&nbsp; As a
 friend of mine who happens to be from New Jersey, a guy named Bruce Spring=
steen, once sang -- (applause) -- &#8220;they spend their lives waiting for=
 a moment that just don&#8217;t come.&#8221;&nbsp; Don&#8217;t let that be =
you.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t waste your time waiting.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">If you doubt you can make=
 a difference, look at the impact some of your fellow graduates are already=
 making.&nbsp; Look at what Matthew is doing.&nbsp; Look at somebody like Y=
asmin Ramadan, who began organizing anti-bullying
 assemblies when she was 10 years old to help kids handle bias and discrimi=
nation, and here at Rutgers, helped found the Muslim Public Relations Counc=
il to work with administrators and police to promote inclusion.&nbsp; (Appl=
ause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Look at somebody like Mad=
ison Little, who grew up dealing with some health issues, and started wonde=
ring what his care would have been like if he lived someplace else, and so,=
 here at Rutgers, he took charge of
 a student nonprofit and worked with folks in Australia and Cambodia and Ug=
anda to address the AIDS epidemic.&nbsp; &#8220;Our generation has so much =
energy to adapt and impact the world,&#8221; he said.&nbsp; &#8220;My peers=
 give me a lot of hope that we&#8217;ll overcome the obstacles we
 face in society.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That's you!&nbsp; Is it a=
ny wonder that I am optimistic?&nbsp; Throughout our history, a new generat=
ion of Americans has reached up and bent the arc of history in the directio=
n of more freedom, and more opportunity, and more
 justice.&nbsp; And, Class of 2016, it is your turn now -- (applause) -- to=
 shape our nation&#8217;s destiny, as well as your own.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So get to work.&nbsp; Mak=
e sure the next 250 years are better than the last.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Good luck.&nbsp; God bles=
