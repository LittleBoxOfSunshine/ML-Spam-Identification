THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

April 25, 2016

**

*Readout of the Presidents Meeting with British Prime Minister David Came=
ron, French President Franois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, =
and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi*



President Obama,British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Fr=
anois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Italian Prime Minist=
er Matteo Renzi met today for talks at Schloss Herrenhausen in Hannover, =
Germany. The conversation covered the most urgent issues on the trans-Atl=
antic agenda. The leaders agreed that the implications of irregular migra=
tion to Europe posed a severe challenge that needed to be addressed in a =
comprehensive and sustainable manner, reflecting the values that Europe a=
nd the United States share: this implies ongoing NATO and EU activities a=
s well as efforts to tackle the root causes of flight and migration.=20



On Syria, leaders shared the growing concern that the increasing violatio=
ns of the agreed Cessation of Hostilities by the regime and the continued=
 obstruction of humanitarian access undermine efforts to bring relief to =
the Syrian people. They called on all parties to respect the cessation, e=
nsure humanitarian access, and contribute to the success of the Geneva ta=
lks on political transition in line with the Geneva Communiqu. They also =
called on those with influence on the parties to the conflict to press th=
em to refrain from any actions that put the cessation and political talks=
 at risk.



On ISIL, leaders welcomed the Coalitions continued progress in Iraq and S=
yria and reiterated their full commitment to defeating the terrorist grou=
p.



On Libya, leaders welcomed the steps currently undertaken by the Presiden=
cy Council to establish a fully functional and effective government. Lead=
ers emphasized their full support for these efforts. With regard to the g=
rowing threat posed by ISIL and the destabilizing impact of criminal smug=
gling networks, they agreed on the strong and urgent need to support the =
Libyan people in growing the economy and building the capacity of the sec=
urity sector. This would help counter criminal smuggling networks and cou=
nter the threat posed by ISIL. They agreed that these efforts should be u=
ndertaken at the request of the Libyan government and be supported by the=
 international community. The leaders also urged NATO and the EU to draw =
on their experience in the Aegean to explore how they could work together=
 to address in an orderly and humane way migrant flows in the central Med=
iterranean.



On Ukraine, leaders reiterated their rejection of Russias occupation and =
attempted annexation of the Crimea. There was agreement that full impleme=
ntation of the Minsk agreements remained crucial. The leaders reiterated =
that sanctions against Russia would be lifted if the Minsk agreements wer=
e fully implemented.



Finally, the leaders discussed the importance of concluding an ambitious =
Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement, which would ex=
pand growth and create jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.
