*WASHINGTON, D.C.* =E2=80=93=E2=80=93 Democratic Legislative Campaign Commi=
ttee Executive Director Jessica Post kicked off the DLCC 2016 Caucus Staff =
Summit today with an overview of the committee's 2016 program and a call to=
 action for the campaign professionals gathered from across the country. Th=
e three-day training (April 27 =E2=80=93 29) assembles professional caucus =
staffers in the nation's capital to hone skills and reinforce best practice=
s in everything from hiring staff and messaging to budgeting and finance to=
 field and polling. One featured session provides a data-driven approach to=
 maximizing Democratic success down-ballot with Donald Trump at the top of =
the GOP ticket.

"The 2016 election cycle provides a unique opportunity for Democratic state=
 legislative candidates to win landmark victories in down-ballot races, and=
 this week's training is a key element of DLCC's path to state-level victor=
ies this fall," said Post. "Over the next three days, we'll deploy innovati=
ve new data tools, train staffers in field-tested campaign practices, and h=
one the skills required to execute successful caucus election programs.

"This year's Caucus Summit is our most data-driven training ever," Post con=
tinued. "Our focus on using data and digital resources to equip our state c=
aucus programs to run cutting-edge campaigns will deliver major legislative=
 gains in the fall. And because no election happens in a vacuum, we're usin=
g primary results and polling data to analyze the impact of Donald Trump's =
candidacy on down-ballot elections, and we're arming our caucuses with the =
tools to capitalize on the opportunities presented by a Trump ticket.

"The caucus staffers gathered here today are crucial to the future of the D=
emocratic Party. The successful programs they run and the chambers they ret=
urn to Democratic majorities this fall will advance progressive policy agen=
das that provide opportunity for middle-class Americans. The candidates the=
y elect will build the bench for future cycles' congressional, gubernatoria=
l, and presidential candidates. And the seats they win will move Democrats =
toward a successful round of post-2020 redistricting. The Caucus Summit is =
just one critical step in this fight, and I look forward to continuing our =
critical work with the staffers here and our partners in states across the =
country as we build for success in November."=20
