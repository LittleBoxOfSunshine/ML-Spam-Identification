Good Tuesday morning. GETTING THERE: Washington, Inc., goes #Ever Trump! - JUST POSTED as lead of Politico ... "Trump opponents scramble to get on board: The presumptive nominee makes direct, personal overtures to mend a divided party," by Eli Stokols: "Trump's anti-establishment campaign may be authoring just the latest chapter in a familiar Washington story, exposing how the nation's political class may be motivated less by principle than by proximity to power.

"But some consultants credit Trump's willingness to listen to conservative leaders since becoming the party's new standard-bearer, which has mollified some of their preexisting anxieties or at least provided political cover for them to temper their criticism and even begin to offer praise and, in some cases, their services." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c5e6475fd98ba0b9cd66e0cd38550c176201dc371f04a510b9d3f15350828b0e

 

SHOTS FIRED -- WashPost, bottom of A4, "Campaign turns nastier as Trump revives controversies around Bill Clinton," by Jose Del Real and Bob Costa: Trump posted "an incendiary Instagram video [with] voices of two women [Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey] who accused the former president of sexual assault ... Bill Clinton ... is shown smoking a cigar. ... [In a recent interview, Trump discussed] ... the suicide of former White House aide Vincent Foster ... 'It's the one thing with her, whether it's Whitewater or whether it's Vince or whether it's Benghazi. It's always a mess with Hillary.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c5e6475fd98ba0b98a0d4611b7ac48ad9ed3ab50a06af3a58f3fbade1c4fe290

ZEITGEIST - L.A. Times 2-col. lead, "Silicon Valley is united in opposition to Trump: Technology leaders, including Republicans, call his ideas a threat to their business," by Evan Halper in Redwood City, Calif. (online: "Trump has done the unthinkable: Unite Silicon Valley"): "The masters of [the innovation economy] complain that his ignorance about their work and its relationship to the global economy is horrifying. ...

"The grievances that innovation leaders have with Trump are almost too many to list. They are baffled by an immigration policy that they warn would be disastrous for their workforce. Trump's trade agenda, they say, threatens to tear apart global business relationships crucial to tech industry success. The candidate's threat to boycott Apple as it tussled with law enforcement over encryption technology will not soon be forgotten." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c5e6475fd98ba0b9c786b5d2c07dadfd74e01fca7a20eeb9842df05c2ff6dc37

ARTICLE OF THE DAY: David Brock and Roger Stone - N.Y. Times A1, lower right corner, "A Duel of Political Operatives," by Amy Chozick (online: "As Trump and Clinton Clash, 2 Operatives Duke It Out in Their Shadows"): "One takes a pint-size dog named Toby almost everywhere, smokes electronic cigarettes and wears his silver hair in a sweeping pompadour. The other has a portrait of Richard M. Nixon tattooed on his back, boasts that he owns more shoes than Imelda Marcos and traffics in conspiracy theories about the Kennedy assassination.

"The 2016 election ... features two central antagonists known for their colorful traits and devotion to the dark arts of politics: David Brock and Roger J. Stone Jr. ... On the wall of Mr. Stone's office in South Florida, which has an undisclosed address because of the death threats he said he had received, hangs a 'Spy vs. Spy' cartoon, which young staff members titled 'Brock-Stone' after the two battling operatives." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c5e6475fd98ba0b96d71fa0f5aa68aca04dff91141a9475d24ef6d7c43162bef

His remarks seemed almost to absolve Mr. Clinton, if not to exonerate him. ... He called Mr. Clinton 'the most gifted politician of the baby boomer generation.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c5e6475fd98ba0b923c8aa4e2719acba3c16e2db5609d42421dfdea514400517

It's getting harder to overlook," by Steve Shepard: "The latest averages from HuffPost Pollster give Clinton just a less-than-2-point advantage over Trump, while Sanders ... leads Trump by 10 points. ... Moreover, there's evidence that Clinton will face challenges in uniting Democrats the way Trump has brought Republicans together." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=24350ccb049769bd383ddd1b0ccd1b2e7c77badb81fe07967475b396c4c57d0a

POOL REPORT: "Bad weather didn't slow down Hillary Clinton's sold-out family fundraiser [this weekend at the Cleveland Park] home of former FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, long-time Obama friend and supporter and now a partner at The Carlyle Group, and his wife Rachel Goslins. About 300 children and 200 parents came to meet Clinton, who did an engaging and well-received Q&A with the kids that featured questions about immigration and education, and a request for advice from a 3rd-grade girl running for class treasurer.

"The reply from Secretary Clinton: believe in yourself, and have great bake sales. Past Obama administration officials Michael Fitzpatrick (former OMB, now at GE) and Miriam Sapiro (former USTR) were also co-chairs of the event. Co-hosts included Tom and Karin freedman, longtime Clinton advisers."

 

OBAMA IN HANOI - White House pool report by WashPost's David Nakamura: "Travel pool3/Obama Bourdain OTR ... Obama did an OTR with Anthony Bourdain down a narrow ramshackle alleyway ... A heavy rain created pools of muddy water in the ground as crowds of onlookers were scrunched to the sides of the road trying to keep under awnings to stay drive. Also the motorcade vehicles blocked most of the width of the road. The president met with Bourdain in a small complex at a bend in the road where his limo was parked. Your pool was led out to get a quick spray.

"Potus was in shirtsleeves and Bourdain dressed casually, they were apparently not eating per WH but doing an interview. They shook hands and Potus walked across the street to shake hands. It was pandemonium as the crowds shouted and reached for him and Secret Service tried to maintain order in the pelting rain. Your pooler was jostled and pushed back into a motorcade vehicle. After a couple minutes Potus turned and enters his limo and pool returned to press vans. By 1:30 pm we were rolling for airport."

<b>THOUGHT LEADERS -- Jamie Dimon writing in Black Enterprise, &quot;Minority Entrepreneurs: A Big Part of Detroit's Comeback&quot;:</b> &quot;Detroit was a train wreck in the making for 30 years. But there is nothing that symbolizes Detroit's comeback more than the city's entrepreneurial spirit. ... Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan recently told me that the most important thing we can do to boost the city's growth is support its minority entrepreneurs. I believe it is the job of institutions including banks, nonprofits, and government to collaborate and rise to this challenge by creating an inclusive environment where more people can fulfill their entrepreneurial dreams.&quot;
