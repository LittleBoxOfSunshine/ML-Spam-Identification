The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Ernest --

Over the next few months, Republicans are going to spend
hundreds of millions of dollars to elect their candidates. And we're
going to beat them the same way we always have -- by hitting the
pavement to talk with folks directly.

That's why the DNC is currently looking for Field Organizers to help
elect Democrats in key battleground states around the country.
Know someone who might be interested, Ernest?

http://my.democrats.org/2016-Field-Organizers

Field Organizers are the heart and soul of winning campaigns.
They're the people hitting the streets to talk with their neighbors,
establish relationships, and build the team of Democrats that is
dedicated to electing our candidates and making sure America
keeps moving forward. Together, our Field Organizers and their
volunteers will knock on every door, make sure every person who
wants to vote is registered, and get out every vote we'll need to
win on Election Day.

We bet that sounds like someone you know. If it does, please
forward this email to them and have them apply right away:

http://my.democrats.org/2016-Field-Organizers

Thank you for doing this, Ernest.

All the best,

Amy
