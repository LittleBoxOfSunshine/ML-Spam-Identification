Myth of the 'moderate' John Kasich:<http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2=
015/08/18/moderate-john-kasich-myth-column/31917851/>
As Ohio Senate minority leader, my job would be a lot easier if he actually=
 existed.

USA TODAY // Joe Schiavoni, Democratic Leader in the Ohio Senate

There has been no shortage of surprises in the Republican presidential race=
 so far. More startling than Donald Trump's lead in the polls<http://onpoli=
tics.usatoday.com/2015/08/18/poll-trump-retains-big-gop-lead-post-debate/>,=
 however, has been the nationwide characterization<http://www.nytimes.com/2=
015/08/14/us/politics/john-kasich-republican-primary-presidential-election.=
html> of Ohio's governor, John Kasich, as a "moderate" Republican.

Pundits and politicians alike have described Kasich as a thoughtful Republi=
can from a swing state who expanded Medicaid and attended a gay wedding.

As Minority Leader in the Ohio Senate, I can tell you my job would be a who=
le lot easier if John Kasich were actually a moderate.

Yes, Kasich did make the decision to expand Medicaid, and Democrats in Ohio=
 helped him do it. What you don't hear, though, is that Kasich refused<http=
://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/us/states-decline-to-set-up-exchanges-for-ins=
urance.html> to set up a state-run insurance exchange due to his opposition=
 to Obamacare - an exchange that could have been tailored to the specific n=
eeds of Ohioans.

Kasich's right-wing stances on healthcare have directly harmed women in our=
 state. AsThe New York Times explained<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/us=
/with-new-abortion-restrictions-ohio-walks-fine-line.html> in 2013, "Ohio h=
as become a laboratory for what anti-abortion leaders call the incremental =
strategy - passing a web of rules designed to push the hazy boundaries of S=
upreme Court guidelines without flagrantly violating them."

Seven of 16 Ohio abortion clinics<http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/05/0=
4/3654288/abortion-clinics-disappearing-ohio/> have closed since Kasich bec=
ame governor, and an eighth stopped providing abortions. These closures wer=
e the direct result of extreme anti-choice legislation he signed<http://www=
.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/30/ohio-abortion-restrictions-budget-bill_n_352=
6844.html> into law. among other things, he signed legislation that blocked=
 abortion providers from entering into emergency transfer agreements<http:/=
/www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/06/kasich_signs_budget_keeps_abor.ht=
ml> with public hospitals.

In this year's budget, Kasich proposed<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/p=
olitics/2015/06/01/proposal-cut-medicaid-coverage-pregnant-women/28304755/>=
 cutting Medicaid coverage for pregnant women and those diagnosed with brea=
st and cervical cancer if their income was between $16,000 and $23,000. His=
 suggestion would have disqualified around 3,000 women from Medicaid and co=
uld have left them without life-saving coverage.

His proposal was so outlandish his own party restored funding<http://www.ca=
ntonrep.com/article/20150614/OPINION/150619718> to those Ohioans.

Sadly, Kasich's constant attacks on women's health have come as Ohio contin=
ues<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/27/infant-mortality-declin=
ed-slightly-in-ohio-in-2013/> to have one of the highest infant mortality r=
ates in the nation. Despite this fact, Kasich's budgets limit funding for f=
amily planning groups to use on preventive care<http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/=
18/politics/states-abortion/> for working poor and middle class women, incl=
uding prenatal care. Not sure how this qualifies him to be labeled a "compa=
ssionate conservative<http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/07/politics/republican-deb=
ate-john-kasich-gop-ohio-home-field-advantage/>."

Kasich's less-than moderate values are also clear in the projects and servi=
ces he views as expendable that would have benefited families.

In his very first budget, Kasich flat out cut $1.8 billion<http://articles.=
chicagotribune.com/2013-01-31/news/sns-rt-usa-ohioschoolvouchersl1n0b10kb-2=
0130131_1_voucher-program-funds-for-public-schools-ohio-education-associati=
on> in funding for public schools across Ohio, leaving over 100<http://www.=
policymattersohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SchoolFinanceJan2012.pdf> =
K-12 school districts with crippling budget deficits, and forcing local sch=
ool districts to ask voters to back multi-million dollar emergency funding =
levies<http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/local/franklin-schools-moves-t=
oward-emergency-tax-levy/nc5TL/>.

All of this, while steering<http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/0=
2/gov_kasichs_budget_would_send_nearly_1_billion_to_charter_schools_how_is_=
your_district_affected_chart.html> hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars=
 into a scandal-ridden charter school system, which has seen failing grades=
<http://www.ohio.com/news/break-news/ohio-education-official-resigns-after-=
altering-charter-school-evaluations-1.609279> and has been called<http://ww=
w.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2015/07/20/what-ohio-gov-john-ka=
sich-is-doing-to-public-education-in-his-state/> "the most troubled in the =
country" - A move pushed by a charter-school operators who made the maximum=
 legal contribution<http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/10/0=
3/campaign-reports.html> to Kasich's political campaign along with his wife=
.

Kasich has given huge tax breaks<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/f=
eb/24/state-national-priorities-likely-themes-of-kasich-/?page=3Dall> to th=
e rich, while nearly half<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elect=
ions/2014/08/24/governors-race-ohio-households/14549515/> of Ohio families =
and my constituents are living paycheck to paycheck. His prioritization of =
trickle-down economics places him directly in line with the most conservati=
ve members of theRepublican Party.

Another example of Kasich's moderate myth is his stance on LGBT rights. Dur=
ing the Fox News debate<http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/08/06/gop_d=
ebate_john_kasich_was_gracious_and_humane_on_gay_marriage.html>, Kasich sai=
d he would treat a hypothetical LGBT child with unconditional love. He also=
 said he has attended a gay wedding. However, without the Supreme Court's m=
arriage decision, there would never have been a gay wedding in Ohio to atte=
nd. Kasich supported<http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/insight/2010/0=
9/26/division.html> an Ohio constitutional ban on gay marriage.

Kasich's administration actively opposed marriage equality until it was tol=
d to do otherwise by the Supreme Court. To this day, Kasich has refused to =
lead on LGBT issues, and there are places in Ohio where you can still be fi=
red for being gay<http://mic.com/articles/121496/one-map-shows-where-you-ca=
n-still-be-fired-for-being-gay-in-2015> because he said we should not worry=
<http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/06/john_kasich_very_disappoin=
ted_with.html> about the risk of that happening and has yet to take up the =
issue.

Regardless, you can still be denied a mortgage or service in a restaurant f=
or being gay. Kasich's willingness to attend a wedding does nothing to impr=
ove the lives of LGBT Ohioans that he could protect.

Had Kasich been a moderate, willing and able to work with both sides, he wo=
uld have considered the opinions of Ohio citizens and business leaders. Ins=
tead, Kasich has repeatedly shoved his own agenda through the legislature a=
nd signed bills in private<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/19/=
gov-kasich-signs-9-bills-more-measures-to-come/> in an attempt to avoid scr=
utiny and resistance.

John Kasich is no moderate. His words are just prettier packaging for the s=
ame right-wing agenda of the other GOP presidential candidates.

Sen. Joe Schiavoni is the minority leader of the Ohio Senate.

 News debate</a>, Kasich said he would treat a hypothetical LGBT child with=
 unconditional love. He also said he has attended a gay wedding. However, w=
ithout the Supreme Court&#8217;s marriage decision, there would never have =
been a gay wedding in Ohio to attend.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Ti=

and able to work with both sides, he would have considered the opinions of =
Ohio citizens and business leaders. Instead, Kasich has
 repeatedly shoved his own agenda through the legislature and signed bills&=
