Trump Pt 2

Tax plan cont.
- Has no illusions his plan will be the final plan. It's just a floor for where we start
- When it comes time to negotiate, less concerned for the rich than the middle class

Should we assume all your plans should not be taken at your plan, they're negotiable?
- It's called life. It's not my word. I put in a proposal
- Again saying he'd negotiate his plan
- Says businesses might pay a little bit more

Chuck presses on businesses paying more, Trump clarifies they might have to pay more than his proposal (but would still pay less than currently paying)

Minimum Wage, why the change?
- He's been traveling the country, doesn't know how people make it on $7.25. But he wants to let the states decide

Should the federal government set a floor?
- The states should decide

Which Trump should we believe on feelings towards HRC, the one who praised her in 2012 or the one from now?
- He's a businessman, he was not looking to get into fights with the secretary of state, he didn't want to get into fights with politicians
- Facts are HRC has not done a good job. But he was not looking  at it closely, he was a businessman

Why not release the tax returns that aren't involved in the audits
- Because it's a link. They're very long. Extremely complex

Will you do it before the election (release older tax returns)
- I'd like to

Do you pledge to do it before the election?
- Sure. If the audit is finished. I'll do it as fast as the audit is finished. He'd love to give the tax returns, but can't do it until he's finished with the audit.

Trump Pt 1

Wrapping up nomination:
- Knew he would do it, but didn't know he would do it this soon
- Dem system rigged, Bernie being treated very unfairly
- Republican system also rigged, he was only able to do it because he was winning by landslides.

Same-day voter registration, open primaries, would you support?
- Can expand the party that way, he's always done better when people could cross-over
- Won't actually say if he supports same-day voter registration

Want to see voting laws so it's easier to vote?
- Want to see voting laws so people that are citizens can vote, not just people that can walk off the streets or be undocumented immigrants to vote. You have to be a citizen to vote
- Claims it's not the law that you have to be a citizen to vote. You have places where people just walk it

Paul Ryan
- Doesn't think it hurts him at all. Would like Ryan's support, but if he doesn't get it then it's fine
- Claims Paul Ryan called him three weeks ago and was so supported, was blindsided. Then says he wasn't blindsided, says again he was blindsided
- Claims Ryan called him to congratulate him on NY
- Won't say whether Ryan should be chair of the convention if he won't endorse
- He's never going to get Romney's endorsement, Romney choked. Hitting Jeb!
- Trump says he never backed away from his pledge to back whoever the Republican nominee is. That's a binding pledge. Hitting Jeb and Lindsey Graham for signing that pledge and then breaking it. They're not honorable people

Romney
- He raised a lot of money for him. Ruined the carpets in his apartment having fundraisers for Romney. If Romney had used Trump in Florida, he would have won. Says every robocall or speech he made for Romney, Romney won that state in the primary. Again claiming he would have won Florida for Romney
- He helped Romney a lot. Claims he helped Romney win five states he was going to lose. Romney was ungrateful

Tax Plan
- No one knows more about taxes than him
- He came up with the biggest tax cut of any candidate, but now they have to negotiate
- He'll make sure the middle class gets good tax cuts. Thinks taxes will go up for the wealthy, and it should go up
- He put in a plan, it's a floor. But he doesn't think that will be the final plan
