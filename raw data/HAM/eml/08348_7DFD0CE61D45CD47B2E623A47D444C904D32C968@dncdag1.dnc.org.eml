Fairly standard answers and talking points.
A few somewhat new comments highlighted below.
Also, Trump saying that Hillary would only get 5% if she were a man is his =
most aggressive version of his "woman card" comments

Trump Election Night Speech From Trump Tower


Trump Remarks:

Hitting Kasich and Cruz pact
- In business, you go to jail for collusion

Going to Indiana tomorrow for a long stay
- Notes Bobby Knight endorsement

Thanks the media for covering him fairly lately
- Jokes: "For the last two hours"

Hitting Kasich
- Christie, Carson, Rubio did better but got out
- Stubborn guy

Built a great company with the help of my family

Talks about doing well in NY, and doing well in wide range of states

Cruz and Kasich hurt themselves with faulty deal
- Defaulted on deal before it began

Consequences for companies to leave
- Not going to happen anymore, and companies will stay

Q&A:

Veterans charitable donations?
- Most has been distributed
- Looking for some other worthy organizations to give the rest to

Consider yourself the presumptive nominee?
- Yes, I consider myself the presumptive nominee
- Cruz and Kasich should get out because they have no path
- We will beat Hillary

Results?
- 60%
- PA has been amazing. 17 outright. Moral obligation for others to support =
winner on first ballot
- All I care about is the first round.
- Cruz is buying people dinners, etc in preparation for 2nd ballot
- We will do great in Indiana. I was talking about Carrier Air Conditioning=
 before I knew Indiana would be important
- 17 opponents. You can't get 50% with so many people
- I'm really good at math.

Cruz VP short list?
- He's wasting his time
- He was holding a news conference. I thought he was announcing he was drop=
ping out
- We're not even thinking about that now (VP)
- Chris Christie is fantastic

"Playing a part?" More "Presidential?"
- Not playing a part
- Don't change quarterbacks in the Super Bowl
- May act differently, but my thought process will be the same

Foreign Policy speech tomorrow? Changing?
- Don't change what got you here
- Calls Twitter the "modern way of writing"
- I'm like a really smart person
- Knocked out one after another

Hillary Clinton
- Crooked Hillary
- Knows nothing about creating jobs, except for herself
- No strength or stamina
- I'm not a hateful person. I'm a person who loves people
- Will do far more than Hillary will for women
- Will do better for women on the military
- Sanders said she's not qualified. He said some things about her that are =
incrediably bad
- Sanders should run as an independent

Unifying the party?
- People are calling me to support who had said such horrible things

Foreign Policy speech?
- Will talk about my views
- Will include economics. NATO. Our allies can no longer take advantage of =
our country
- Military is depleted
- I will never change "Make America Great Again"

Laying out the Trump Doctrine?
- No. It won't be Trump Doctrine
- You have to be flexible. The world changes

Ceiling?
- We don't have a ceiling. 100%
- The ceiling was unfair. How do you hit 50% with 16 people
- Will win NY in the general
- The most conservative people in the GOP back Trump according to polls

Student Debt?
- Single biggest question I get
- They graduate and can't get a job. I will bring jobs back

Contrast with Clinton?
- Clinton is funded by Wall Street
- Only way Bernie isn't finish is if something happens with the emails
- Being protected by Democrats
- Will be easier to beat than GOP primary opponents

Nuclear. Biggest national security threat.
- Nuclear is single biggest security threat to our country
- Have to be vigilant on North Korea. Can't let them go much farther

Trump University lawsuit?
- Civil case. Will win easily

Unfavorable polling?
- Unfavorables have come down recently
- So many negative ads, but still won in landslides
- Largely the ads were false, a little truth to some perhaps

Cruz and Kasich?
- Hurting the party because they have no path
- Reince is a very good man
- If it goes to a second ballot and I'm ahead by 5 million votes, 500 deleg=
ates
- Kasich is one for 46
- GOP turnout up. Dems down

Immigration?
- I will stick with my feeling on immigration
- Record numbers pouring across the borders. Read that in a legitimate jour=
nal
- Want people to come in, but have to come in legally

Hillary Clinton?
- Only has the woman card
- If she were a man, she would only get 5%
- Women don't like her
