DNC Chair Statement on Today's Primaries



WASHINGTON - DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following s=
tatement on today's primaries in Kentucky and Oregon:



=93With two more Democratic primary contests closed tonight in Kentucky and=
 Oregon, it=92s once again clear that our voters are excited and enthusiast=
ic about the future of our party, about building on the last seven years of=
 progress, and ready to hold Donald Trump accountable for the damage he=92s=
 done as a candidate and the damage he=92s promising he would do as preside=
nt.



=93In just the last week, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee,=
 has backpedaled away from his own pledge to release his tax returns, vowed=
 to slash taxes for those at the top like himself, faced questions about pr=
etending to be his own publicist, refused to address his well-documented hi=
story of misogyny, insulted one of our country's most important allies, and=
 his campaign called their selection of a white supremacist delegate a =91d=
atabase error.=92 Every day it seems, the American people are discovering a=
 new example of his recklessness, lack of judgment and unstable temperament=
.  That's why Democrats will head into the general election energized, unde=
rstanding what's at stake and championing the values and priorities that ma=
tch those of the American people. As we move closer to our convention and t=
he general election, it's clearer than ever we must elect a Democrat as our=
 45th president."
