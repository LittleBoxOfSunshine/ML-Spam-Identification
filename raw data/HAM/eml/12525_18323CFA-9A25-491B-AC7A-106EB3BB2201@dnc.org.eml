Donald Trump is hiring his third campaign manager of a former rival, adding=
 another veteran political operative to help fight for the delegates needed=
 to clinch the nomination.

Ken McKay joins as a senior adviser working on the team led by Trump conven=
tion manager Paul Manafort, aides told Bloomberg on Monday. A formal announ=
cement was expected later Monday.

Their focus is on getting the upper hand on Senator Ted Cruz, who has been =
diminishing the power of Trump's victories by locking his own supporters in=
to national delegate slots at state conventions.

The new hire comes at a crucial moment, as Cruz and John Kasich form an all=
iance to prevent Trump<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-04-2=
5/cruz-and-kasich-cut-deal-to-try-and-stop-trump>, the front-runner, from g=
etting the necessary 1,237 delegates to win the Republican presidential nom=
ination by June 8.

Earlier in the presidential race, McKay served as campaign manager to New J=
ersey Governor Chris Christie, who dropped out and endorsed Trump in Februa=
ry. A week and a half ago, Trump picked up Rick Wiley, who managed Scott Wa=
lker=92s campaign before the Wisconsin governor left the race in September.=
 And in late March, he snagged Ed Brookover, who was Ben Carson=92s campaig=
n manager until the neurosurgeon dropped out.

McKay, a native of Rhode Island, ran gubernatorial races there for Donald C=
arcieri in 2002 and 2006, winning both. He was chief of staff at the Republ=
ican National Committee under Chairman Michael Steele from March 2009 to Ap=
ril 2010. He helped Florida Republican Rick Scott claim the governor=92s of=
fice in 2010, and served as political director at the Republican Governors =
Association under Christie=92s chairmanship in 2014 and 2015, helping usher=
 in a wave of GOP governors nationwide.

=93This is a serious strategist and tactician,=94 said Curt Anderson, who w=
as former presidential candidate Bobby Jindal=92s chief strategist but is n=
ow unaffiliated with any campaign. He has known McKay for about 15 years. =
=93This is not a guy who wastes his time going on cable TV and running his =
mouth. Trump hiring Ken McKay is a bad thing for the Ted Cruz campaign, I c=
an assure you of that.=94

Trump last week dominated the primary vote in home state of New York, picki=
ng up 90 delegates to Cruz's zero, while Cruz between March 22 and now has =
whisked up delegates in Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Maine, =
Utah and other states. Cruz lags Trump in the delegate count and is beyond =
the point where he could lock in the nomination with outright primary wins,=
 but has used the local convention process to scoop delegates in states tha=
t have already held primaries and caucuses.

On Sunday night, strategists for Cruz and Kasich announced an alliance mean=
t to thwart Trump in three more states: Cruz will stop competing in Oregon =
and New Mexico, clearing the path for Kasich, while Cruz will instead zoom =
in on Indiana, a more delegate-rich state where Cruz is within striking dis=
tance of Trump.

Trump in a statement late Sunday called the alliance "a horrible act of des=
peration from two campaigns who have horribly failed."

The next round of voting is Tuesday in Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware, Pen=
nsylvania and Rhode Island. Trump is expected to do well in all five.

In recent weeks, Trump has been on a hiring spree, collecting strategists s=
idelined as the GOP field winnowed from seventeen to three. While Trump con=
tinues to wield his anti-establishment hammer at rallies, saying he doesn't=
 want his fans to "fall asleep," his strategists have turned their attentio=
n to wooing Republicans turned off by his unpredictability in closed door m=
eetings. Last week, Trump dispatched Manafort, Wiley and Brookover to the R=
epublican National Committee's Spring meeting at an oceanside resort in Flo=
rida to court party insiders, some of whom had reluctantly settled on Cruz =
as their candidate of last resort.
