By Natasha Korecki (nkorecki@politico.com; @natashakorecki) with Manuela Tobias (mtobias@politico.com; @manuelatobiasm)  

Good Friday morning, Illinois. Today, Mayor Rahm Emanuel will meet one-on-one with TSA administrator Peter Neffenger. Emanuel will "reiterate the need to fix the unacceptable security lines," according to a City Hall statement. "Afterward, Emanuel will meet with airport and elected officials at O'Hare Airport to discuss the new federal resources that aim to reduce the wait times. These meetings come after the mayor and city officials helped secure additional resources from the federal government on Tuesday." 

On the court beat, a federal judge ordered former U.S. Rep. Dennis Hastert to begin serving his prison sentence in just four and a half weeks. 

And in state news, Gov. Bruce Rauner said he may be open to signing a bill that decriminalizes small amounts of pot. 

HASTERT TO THE HOOSEGOW -- "Hastert ordered to report to prison in June," by POLITICO's Josh Gerstein: "A federal judge has ordered former House Speaker Dennis Hastert to report to prison on June 22 to begin serving his 15-month sentence for violating a bank reporting law while paying out hush money to one of several men who accused him of committing sexual abuse several decades ago. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Durkin's order issued Thursday doesn't name the facility Hastert is being sent to, but he is expected to serve his time at a federal prison hospital in Rochester, Minn. Durkin blasted the former speaker as 'a serial child molester' at a hearing last month where one of Hastert's
 accusers confronted him about alleged sexual abuse while Hastert was a wrestling coach and teacher at a Yorkville, Ill. high school more than 35 years ago." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9142b4aa0afaa370653c308b1a9702cbded53f4f6937976ef11477d2683cb1ba 

RAUNER SIGNALS POT DECRIM POSSIBILITY -- The Associated Press: "Gov. Bruce Rauner says he may be comfortable with legislation to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana in Illinois. But the Republican stopped short of promising to sign the bill. The Illinois House gave the measure final approval Wednesday. Because it already has passed the Illinois Senate the next step is the governor's desk. The bill includes recommendations Rauner issued when he vetoed a decriminalization measure last year. Rauner says he has to review the bill but that if it includes what he recommended he'll 'probably be comfortable with it.' The governor made the comments Thursday. The bill would impose
 fines up to $200 for possession of 10 grams or less of marijuana but no jail time. It also sets a standard for what's considered too high to drive." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9142b4aa0afaa370c2fe7db0626f16dfa2bf70b903ade5c64d8fdf1214b6c698 

AUTOMATED VOTER REGISTRATION  -- From a release: "The Illinois State Senate on Thursday voted to pass SB250, a bill to create Automatic Voter Registration in Illinois. The bill now moves to the House, where more than 50 members have already signed on as cosponsors. Senate Bill 250, sponsored by State Sen. Andy Manar (D-Bunker Hill) and championed by State Rep. Carol Ammons (D-Champaign), and State Rep. Robyn Gabel (D-Evanston), reforms current registration laws so that whenever an eligible Illinois resident receives services at a designated state agency such as Drivers Services, Illinois Department of Human Services, or Illinois Department of Employment Security, he or she will be
 automatically registered to vote in the local jurisdiction unless they opt out. Registered voters will also be able to update their voter information when they interact with these agencies."

ILLINOIS' 39 TRUMP DELEGATES -- "Donald Trump's Illinois delegates a mix of the angry, eager, eccentric," by Chicago Tribune's Rick Pearson: "A couple of them started GoFundMe efforts for travel money. A few of them plan to bunk up as roommates. Only a handful has any history of political activism. And many of them said they believe the nation and its politics have become too politically correct. They are the 39 elected members of Illinois' Donald Trump delegation to the Republican National Convention - an eclectic, slightly organized group chosen across the state in the March 15 primary who found a common cause in the presumptive Republican presidential nominee." 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9142b4aa0afaa370d3b383523589d26a16e3dcc15d794db743bcfd3e6713bc54 

AFTER THE PROTESTS -- "LGBTQ-Friendly Affordable Housing Complex Proposed For Logan Square," by DNAinfo's Paul Biasco: "A 100 percent affordable, LGBTQ-friendly housing development is being proposed in Logan Square. Ald. Joe Moreno (1st) unveiled a plan to build the apartment project that will include 88 affordable housing units Thursday morning. The affordable units will be restricted to households earning up to 60 percent of the area median income. The project will be paid for with tax increment financing funds from the Milwaukee-Fullerton TIF district, CHA funds, tax credits and private financing, according to Moreno." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9142b4aa0afaa370aef0a643356fe524aad0494316b5268fe3ef1a14929ed881 

CHICAGO'S ECONOMIC RACIAL DIVIDE -- "Chicago near bottom for black employment, income equality," by Crain's Lisa Bertagnoli: "Chicago ranks 65th out of 70 metro areas for employment equality for blacks and 62nd out of 70 for income equality, according to the 40th annual State of Black America report, published yesterday by the National Urban League. Unemployment for blacks in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin area stands at 18.6 percent, compared with 5.8 percent for whites. Unemployment for blacks in the metro area that ranks first, Providence-Warwick, R.I., is 9.9 percent, compared with 6.8 percent for whites." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9142b4aa0afaa37064c4754ecf3ebdd5330684e0e0f14070530472ad419e48c8 

RULES SET DISPARITY IN MOTION -- "Chicago's Racist Housing Rules: How Early Laws Stalled Diversity," by DNAinfo's Linze Rice: "In West Ridge or Rogers Park, it's not uncommon to pass folks who hail from around the world on any given day. A stroll through Warren Park confirms it. A DNAinfo analysis of recent census data found that Rogers Park presently holds the distinction of being the city's most diverse neighborhood, with a roughly even spread of about one-third white, one-third black and one-third Hispanic residents. Yet the Far North Side is still predominately white." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c99a0c24377969113dfb8549ca7d30371422a5fc3753218f124731ca4f3f158c 

UNEMPLOYMENT UP. JOBS UP. -- "Illinois unemployment edges up again in April to 6.6 percent," by State Journal-Register: "The unemployment rate across Illinois again crept up in March even as the state added jobs. The Illinois Department of Employment Security said Thursday that the jobless rate hit 6.6 percent in April. That was up from 6.5 percent in March and came in spite of news that the state's job base grew by 5,400. 'April saw modest job growth, but more than half of this growth was experienced in temporary jobs or employment agencies,' IDES Director Jeff Mays said in the report. 'Additionally, though Illinois jobs saw a moderate increase over the last four months, the portion of
 full-time jobs in Illinois remains lower than it was before the recession began in 2007.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c99a0c243779691162009ed5c002f0627a73d0590a7fe2434d7a7412fc59a94f 

SAVINGS INABILITY KNOWS NO BOUNDS -- "Poll: Two-thirds of US would struggle to cover $1,000 crisis," by The Chicago Tribune: "Two-thirds of Americans would have difficulty coming up with the money to cover a $1,000 emergency, according to an exclusive poll released Thursday, a signal that despite years of recovery from the Great Recession, Americans' financial conditions remain precarious as ever. These financial difficulties span all income levels ... even for the country's wealthiest 20 percent - households making more than $100,000 a year - 38 percent say they would have at least some difficulty coming up with $1,000." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c99a0c2437796911f000b467b076a37e7a43e72fa96897e08fbfb3cae7383c26 

"Why Social Impact Bonds Are Seen As Gaining Traction," by The Bond Buyer: "The use of 'social impact bonds' as an alternative financing tool is on the rise and news that Chicago's first venture into the space will pay off for investors demonstrates the benefits, market participants said." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c99a0c243779691184a72def542d732ca39d83220f8784c8e75f4942ca2b2887 

NOT SHAKING IT -- "Protesters shout '16 shots' at Emanuel during antiviolence event," by Chicago Tribune's Bill Ruthhart: "Mayor Rahm Emanuel held a news conference Thursday afternoon in a South Side park to talk about the city's summer antiviolence program, but quickly found himself once again addressing the familiar theme of a lack of public trust in the Chicago Police Department. As the mayor began to discuss building community bonds to discourage ongoing gun violence in some neighborhoods, a pair of protesters interrupted, shouting '16 shots!' a reference to the 2014 police shooting of Laquan McDonald. Sixteen is the number of times Officer Jason Van Dyke, who's now charged with murder,
 shot the teenager." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c99a0c243779691118fcde1415c777a12f9496ce45b5a588d008c538606fb6b8 

NOT. GOOD. -- "Chicago's Pension-Fund Troubles Just Became $11.5 Billion Bigger," Bloomberg: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c99a0c2437796911aaca07ec78936ee2b68633b9ac0551bcd5717146614c6458  

CRIME REBATE -- "Alderman proposes $200 security camera rebate for homeowners," Chicago Sun-Times: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c99a0c2437796911e0a49dc480ec8e92b9cdb0f7dc2ae55fc804977a12f307fa  

THIS COULD BE A GOOD THING. SHHHHHHH -- "Mayor quietly informs Southwest Side of new school, addition," by Chicago Sun-Times' Fran Spielman and Lauren FitzPatrick: "Mayor Rahm Emanuel has quietly agreed to build a new school and a school addition to ease severe overcrowding on the Southwest Side but the good-news announcement was cloaked in secrecy. The decision to build a 16-classroom annex at Byrne Elementary, 5329 S. Oak Park, and a new school at 65th and Nottingham to replace Dore Elementary, 6108 S. Natoma, was unveiled at invitation-only meetings at the respective schools last Saturday ... City Hall may want to keep the lid on any expansion plans at a time when it's pleading for
 hundreds of millions of dollars in pension help from the General Assembly in the waning days of the spring session." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c99a0c2437796911bc993d9e2b7661cb97127cb380827de8f4fa8ab304399768 

REMOVED FROM PRINCIPAL POST, NOW LEADS PRINCIPAL GROUP -- "Troy LaRaviere, facing firing, wins principals' group election," by Chicago Sun-Times' Lauren FitzPatrick: "A Chicago Public Schools principal - who is a fierce critic of Mayor Rahm Emanuel - won an election Thursday to head a CPS principals' organization, despite being currently suspended without pay and facing possible firing. Ex-Blaine Elementary School Principal Troy LaRaviere won the election to be the president of Chicago Principals and Administrators Association in a rout of his opponent, retired Prosser Career Academy Principal Ken Hunter. LaRaviere won 69.1 percent of the votes, according to the association's website."

NOT A BAILOUT BUT 'RIGHTING A GRIEVOUS WRONG' -- "Commentary: Rauner's shameful agenda to strangle CPS," Howard Brookins Jr.: "Gov. Bruce Rauner's administration has spent nearly two years making false accusations on a whole host of issues, but its latest whopper about funding Chicago Public Schools sinks to a new low. Before anyone swallows the tales by Illinois Secretary of Education Beth Purvis, keep in mind that all the Rauner administration has to show for its tenure is making Illinois the only state in the country without a budget. ... To call for equal funding is not, as Purvis claims, a 'bailout.' In fact, given Illinois' separate and unequal funding of education, it is righting a
 grievous wrong that has been placed on a district in which 85 percent of students are African-American or Latino. This discrimination against Chicago schools, and other low-income and often minority students statewide, raises profound moral and legal questions." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c99a0c24377969118432b102b8a81850377dc096b5a48d82a7ae6830fbb704f5 

'SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUE OF OUR TIME' -- "Can we at least put politics aside for a school funding fix?" by Reboot Illinois' Matt Dietrich and Madeleine Doubek: "MADELEINE: I used to write about our messed up school funding in the 1990s, for goodness sakes, and it's barely gotten better since. I remember working on a project at the Daily Herald where we went to a downstate school and spent some time and then compared it to a school in the suburbs. It's past time to fix the formula. How can our state have a future when we're withholding huge sums of money from our state colleges and treating downstate and Chicago kids like they're children of a lesser God? This is the social justice issue of our
 time." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c36472d3965a05cccbeed3cb027a2f50bd325c4e8564304564293a21bb8f3356 

MAP RELIEF OR OVERPROMISE? -- "Illinois lawmakers send college tuition grant funding plan to Rauner," By The Associated Press: "Illinois Democrats have approved a measure to fully fund tuition grants for low-income students despite Republican concerns the state can't pay for its promises. The Senate approved the measure Thursday on a 39-15 vote. The bill goes to Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner next. The measure sponsored by Democratic leaders House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton would appropriate about $397 million to colleges and universities for tuition grants under the Monetary Award Program ... Republicans lawmakers cautioned against passing the proposal,
 saying Illinois doesn't have money to pay for the grants because there's no budget and the state is spending at a deficit." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c36472d3965a05cc87e3f9a3e0ceaaa5bea2c1142c0307a1829f61e1b5917e55 

4-YEAR WAGE FREEZE FOR TEACHERS AT SCHOOL FOR DEAF -- "Rauner administration says it reached contract agreement with teachers at School for the Deaf," by The State Journal-Register's Doug Finke: "The Rauner administration said Wednesday it has reached agreement on a new labor pact with about 50 teachers at the Illinois School for the Deaf in Jacksonville. The workers are represented by the Illinois Federation of Teachers Local 919. The administration said the IFT agreed to a four-year wage freeze, as well as accepting a plan for performance bonuses to workers who recommend cost-saving measures or who meet or exceed performance standards." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c36472d3965a05cc8a988d8a5a8645b1e009e2d7edb485193d786cdaddacf736 

TWO YEARS TOO LATE -- "Here's the secret report on sex allegations against ex-Treasurer Rutherford," by Crain's Greg Hinz: "We now know more about one of the oddest but most meaningful events in the 2014 race for Illinois governor: allegations of sexual harassment that torpedoed the candidacy of then-Illinois Treasurer Dan Rutherford for governor against then-businessman Bruce Rauner ... The report, by investigator Ron Braver, concludes there is 'no evidence' that former top Rutherford aide Edmund Michalowski was retaliated against for failing to acquiesce to alleged sexual advances, 'no supporting evidence' that he actually was sexually harassed and 'no evidence' that he was forced to do
 political work." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c36472d3965a05cc7cad3a053ffb1937d8a47657aa42437794dc2899e33b8c77 

IT'S BEAN GREAT -- "Cloud Gate ranked among nation's top landmarks," by ABC 7: "TripAdvisor ranked Millennium Park's Cloud Gate, better known as The Bean, among the nation's top landmarks for travelers. Cloud Gate came in at no. 11. The Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool in Washington D.C. took the no. 1 spot, followed by the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and Alcatraz, in the San Francisco Bay. Rounding out the top five were the USS Arizona Memorial in Honolulu and Grand Central Terminal in New York City." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c36472d3965a05cc0c8b0bf8db5daaee062f02f413e160cfccd1e884597a8abe 

MAKING MONEY 'WITHOUT MAKING THINGS' -- "Playing the suckers," by James Krohe Jr. in Illinois Times: "In Donald Trump and Bruce Rauner we have two deal-making millionaires who have convinced people that practices that weaken a healthy economy, from low taxes to lax regulation, can make a sick government healthy again. All that the businessperson-turned-candidate offers as a credential is her success at business, it being assumed that the traits that made her a success in private life would make her a success in public life as well. That's not far-fetched in cases of the company-building entrepreneur. But these days our private-sector heroes tend to be corporate managers or deal-makers or
 financiers who have found ways to make money without making things." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c36472d3965a05cc11636fab9237f65f44f5f1b74a619ef11fa7869825905a50 

SAYING FAREWELL -- "CBOE Chairman Bill Brodsky to exit board, company," by Crain's Lynne Marek: "CBOE Holdings Chairman Bill Brodsky plans to leave the company's board next year after having leadership roles at the Chicago Board Options Exchange parent since 1997. Brodsky, 72, announced his exit at the company's annual shareholder meeting in Chicago today, saying he wouldn't be a candidate for the board next year ... CBOE also said that it plans to 'review its leadership structure,' including considering the option to combine the roles of chairman and chief executive officer. Brodsky arrived at CBOE as the options exchange was on the cusp of an electronic trading revolution."

SEC FINES HARVEY MAYOR AFTER BOND DEAL -- "Mayor in Illinois Settles Muni Bond Fraud Charges," SEC: "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that the mayor of Harvey, Ill., has agreed to pay $10,000 and never participate in a municipal bond offering again in order to settle fraud charges. The SEC alleges that Eric J. Kellogg was connected to a series of fraudulent bond offerings by the city. Investors were told that their money would be used to develop and construct a Holiday Inn hotel in Harvey, but instead city officials diverted at least $1.7 million in bond proceeds to fund the city's payroll and other operational costs unrelated to the hotel project. According to the
 SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Mayor Kellogg exercised control over Harvey's operations and signed important offering documents the city used to offer and sell the bonds." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c36472d3965a05ccd5000df813dc4fa36e6130ce3a6c2044816654260c92b2bd 

DUCKWORTH V. KIRK 'UNCHARTERED WATERS' -- "Two disabled candidates locked in historic battle," by USA Today's Donovan Slack: "The race for the Illinois Senate seat once held by Barack Obama has drawn intense attention as one of the closest in the country. But it also marks a compelling milestone. Republican Sen. Mark Kirk suffered a massive stroke and is now often wheelchair-bound. His Democratic challenger, Rep. Tammy Duckworth, had her legs blown off while serving in Iraq. 'To have two candidates with disabilities run against each other is uncharted territory,' said Jennifer Duffy, Senate analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. 'What's in bounds, what's out of bounds, I think
 changes.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c36472d3965a05ccd959822c8d58fe08d2a48757f3c583fec203cb333877f9f7 

OPPONENT'S DREAM DATE -- "Trial Date Set in Suit Against Tammy Duckworth," by Roll Call's Eric Garcia: "A circuit judge presiding over a lawsuit involving Rep. Tammy Duckworth when she headed the Illinois Veterans Affairs Department set a trial date for August 15, which could disrupt her Senate campaign. Two women who worked at a veterans home in southern Illinois allege ethics violations. One claims she was fired in retaliation for complaining about their boss at the facility. Duckworth later reversed the decision. The other plaintiff says he was given a poor performance review which prevented a pay raise after she complained as well. Duckworth's campaign did not comment on the setting of
 a trial date." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c36472d3965a05cc7b9505d4ce76bcb849e69718431ac443491eaecbbeccf402 

BREAK IN GRISLY MURDER CASE -- "DNA, phone records lead to charges in Gage Park massacre: police," by Chicago Sun-Times' Frank Main, Andy Grimm and Michael Sneed: "DNA evidence and phone records put a 22-year-old Chicago man at the scene of a massacre of six Gage Park family members - an attack that started as a robbery, police said Thursday. The details came as police announced charges against that man, Diego Uribe, and his girlfriend, Jafeth Ramos, 19. Each is charged with six counts of first-degree murder for the slayings at the bungalow in the 5700 block of South California Avenue, authorities said. Uribe is a nephew to one of the victims, Maria Herminia Martinez. Both he and Ramos
 allegedly gave statements implicating themselves to authorities." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=8c2122db5868328a9424af9d356433215485729f823143125aadd2092489e586 

CRAZEY FOR BEYONCE -- "Beyonc&eacute; Prom Dress-Making Teen Chooses Chicago For Fashion Studies," by DNAinfo's Alex Nitkin: "All it took was Walmart, eBay and some explosive creativity for India Ross to turn herself into a fashion goddess. The high school senior from St. Louis attracted a national spotlight this week when she showed up to her senior prom in a homemade dress identical to one worn by Beyonc&eacute; at a fashion gala.

** A message from VoteVets Action Fund: Strong prevailing wage laws are like a minimum wage for skilled construction workers. Because veterans work in construction at higher rates than non-veterans, prevailing wage laws enable hundreds of thousands of veterans to put their battle-tested leadership and problem solving skills to work building our communities while providing a good life for their families. Unfortunately, in the last two years, at least eleven states (including Illinois) have considered repealing or weakening their prevailing wage laws, which would hurt our economy and drive thousands of veterans out of their jobs and into poverty. Our nation's heroes deserve better from our
 elected officials. Stand with veterans and sign our petition for the strong prevailing wage laws that help our veterans and their families. - http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9142b4aa0afaa370ad6344a5aefd524ffe07bae798abb172e018e055825bd5b4 **

What Works Denver -- THE MILE-HIGH MASS TRANSIT MIRACLE The newest installment ofPOLITICO Magazine's "What Works" series explores how Denver was able to do what many cities have tried and failed: build a rail system that is a model for 21st-century growth. While other major cities are making headlines for transit systems in decline, Denver is on a fast-track in the other direction. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=8c2122db5868328a81bc31887195c056736e20fc64f73e74d51d2074c6e6d1a0

U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Durkin's order issued Thursday doesn't name the facility Hastert is being sent to, but he is expected to serve his time at a federal prison hospital in Rochester, Minn.

</b> &quot;Gov. Bruce Rauner says he may be comfortable with legislation to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana in Illinois. But the Republican stopped short of promising to sign the bill. The Illinois House gave the measure final approval Wednesday. Because it already has passed the Illinois Senate the next step is the governor's desk. The bill includes recommendations Rauner issued when he vetoed a decriminalization measure last year. Rauner says he has to review the bill but that if it includes what he recommended he'll 'probably be comfortable with it.' The governor made the comments Thursday. The bill would impose fines up to $200 for possession of 10 grams or less
 of marijuana but no jail time. It also sets a standard for what's considered too high to drive.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9142b4aa0afaa370c2fe7db0626f16dfa2bf70b903ade5c64d8fdf1214b6c698" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1OCxKL1</a> </p><p><b>AUTOMATED VOTER REGISTRATION

</b>&quot;The unemployment rate across Illinois again crept up in March even as the state added jobs. The Illinois Department of Employment Security said Thursday that the jobless rate hit 6.6 percent in April. That was up from 6.5 percent in March and came in spite of news that the state's job base grew by 5,400. 'April saw modest job growth, but more than half of this growth was experienced in temporary jobs or employment agencies,' IDES Director Jeff Mays said in the report. 'Additionally, though Illinois jobs saw a moderate increase over the last four months, the portion of full-time jobs in Illinois remains lower than it was before the recession began in 2007.'&quot;

</b>&quot;Gov. Bruce Rauner's administration has spent nearly two years making false accusations on a whole host of issues, but its latest whopper about funding Chicago Public Schools sinks to a new low. Before anyone swallows the tales by Illinois Secretary of Education Beth Purvis, keep in mind that all the Rauner administration has to show for its tenure is making Illinois the only state in the country without a budget. ... To call for equal funding is not, as Purvis claims, a 'bailout.' In fact, given Illinois' separate and unequal funding of education, it is righting a grievous wrong that has been placed on a district in which 85 percent of students are African-American or Latino. This
 discrimination against Chicago schools, and other low-income and often minority students statewide, raises profound moral and legal questions.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c99a0c24377969118432b102b8a81850377dc096b5a48d82a7ae6830fbb704f5" target="_blank">http://trib.in/1OCx3RZ</a> </p><p><b>'SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUE OF OUR TIME' -- &quot;Can we at least put politics aside for a school funding fix?&quot; by Reboot Illinois' Matt Dietrich and Madeleine Doubek:

<b>MAKING MONEY 'WITHOUT MAKING THINGS' -- &quot;Playing the suckers,&quot; by James Krohe Jr. in Illinois Times:
</b> &quot;In Donald Trump and Bruce Rauner we have two deal-making millionaires who have convinced people that practices that weaken a healthy economy, from low taxes to lax regulation, can make a sick government healthy again. All that the businessperson-turned-candidate offers as a credential is her success at business, it being assumed that the traits that made her a success in private life would make her a success in public life as well. That's not far-fetched in cases of the company-building entrepreneur. But these days our private-sector heroes tend to be corporate managers or deal-makers or financiers who have found ways to make money without making things.&quot;

</b> &quot;CBOE Holdings Chairman Bill Brodsky plans to leave the company's board next year after having leadership roles at the Chicago Board Options Exchange parent since 1997. Brodsky, 72, announced his exit at the company's annual shareholder meeting in Chicago today, saying he wouldn't be a candidate for the board next year ... CBOE also said that it plans to 'review its leadership structure,' including considering the option to combine the roles of chairman and chief executive officer. Brodsky arrived at CBOE as the options exchange was on the cusp of an electronic trading revolution.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c36472d3965a05cc24e4be36b007236ddbbbc2d6f89b532281973e4e93f75b23" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1OCxFH9</a> </p>
<p><b>SEC FINES HARVEY MAYOR AFTER BOND DEAL -- &quot;Mayor in Illinois Settles Muni Bond Fraud Charges,&quot; SEC:
</b> &quot;The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that the mayor of Harvey, Ill., has agreed to pay $10,000 and never participate in a municipal bond offering again in order to settle fraud charges. The SEC alleges that Eric J. Kellogg was connected to a series of fraudulent bond offerings by the city. Investors were told that their money would be used to develop and construct a Holiday Inn hotel in Harvey, but instead city officials diverted at least $1.7 million in bond proceeds to fund the city's payroll and other operational costs unrelated to the hotel project. According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Mayor
 Kellogg exercised control over Harvey's operations and signed important offering documents the city used to offer and sell the bonds.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c36472d3965a05ccd5000df813dc4fa36e6130ce3a6c2044816654260c92b2bd" target="_blank">http://1.usa.gov/1OCxBac</a> </p><p><b>DUCKWORTH V. KIRK 'UNCHARTERED WATERS' -- &quot;Two disabled candidates locked in historic battle,&quot; by USA Today's Donovan Slack: 
</b>&quot;The race for the Illinois Senate seat once held by Barack Obama has drawn intense attention as one of the closest in the country. But it also marks a compelling milestone. Republican Sen. Mark Kirk suffered a massive stroke and is now often wheelchair-bound. His Democratic challenger, Rep. Tammy Duckworth, had her legs blown off while serving in Iraq. 'To have two candidates with disabilities run against each other is uncharted territory,' said Jennifer Duffy, Senate analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. 'What's in bounds, what's out of bounds, I think changes.'&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c36472d3965a05ccd959822c8d58fe08d2a48757f3c583fec203cb333877f9f7" target="_blank">http://usat.ly/1OCxPhI</a> </p><p>
<b>OPPONENT'S DREAM DATE -- &quot;Trial Date Set in Suit Against Tammy Duckworth,&quot; by Roll Call's Eric Garcia:
</b> &quot;A circuit judge presiding over a lawsuit involving Rep. Tammy Duckworth when she headed the Illinois Veterans Affairs Department set a trial date for August 15, which could disrupt her Senate campaign. Two women who worked at a veterans home in southern Illinois allege ethics violations. One claims she was fired in retaliation for complaining about their boss at the facility. Duckworth later reversed the decision. The other plaintiff says he was given a poor performance review which prevented a pay raise after she complained as well. Duckworth's campaign did not comment on the setting of a trial date.&quot;

</b>&quot;DNA evidence and phone records put a 22-year-old Chicago man at the scene of a massacre of six Gage Park family members - an attack that started as a robbery, police said Thursday. The details came as police announced charges against that man, Diego Uribe, and his girlfriend, Jafeth Ramos, 19. Each is charged with six counts of first-degree murder for the slayings at the bungalow in the 5700 block of South California Avenue, authorities said. Uribe is a nephew to one of the victims, Maria Herminia Martinez. Both he and Ramos allegedly gave statements implicating themselves to authorities.&quot;

The high school senior from St. Louis attracted a national spotlight this week when she showed up to her senior prom in a homemade dress identical to one worn by Beyonc&eacute; at a fashion gala. Ross spend hundreds of dollars and untold hours putting the outfit together, she told US Weekly. After some outlet and online shopping, she said, she hand-placed more than 2,000 individual crystals for a look worthy of the pop icon herself. As of Thursday, photos of Ross's project were trending nationally on Facebook and caught the attention of fashion magazines like

</b>Strong prevailing wage laws are like a minimum wage for skilled construction workers. Because veterans work in construction at higher rates than non-veterans, prevailing wage laws enable hundreds of thousands of veterans to put their battle-tested leadership and problem solving skills to work building our communities while providing a good life for their families. Unfortunately, in the last two years, at least eleven states (including Illinois) have considered repealing or weakening their prevailing wage laws, which would hurt our economy and drive thousands of veterans out of their jobs and into poverty. Our nation's heroes deserve better from our elected officials. Stand with
 veterans and sign our petition for the strong prevailing wage laws that help our veterans and their families. - <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9142b4aa0afaa370ad6344a5aefd524ffe07bae798abb172e018e055825bd5b4" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/24Kgd0c</a> **</p><p><b>READ more Illinois and Chicago news from</b> <b>POLITICO Illinois</b>: <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=8c2122db5868328a2388b3124ff8e0fa23318750466762a14e51d1125fccadcc" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1Ln6sIF </a><br> <br><b>What Works Denver -- <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=8c2122db5868328a81bc31887195c056736e20fc64f73e74d51d2074c6e6d1a0" target="_blank">THE MILE-HIGH MASS TRANSIT MIRACLE</a> The newest installment of<a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=8c2122db5868328a81bc31887195c056736e20fc64f73e74d51d2074c6e6d1a0" target="_blank">POLITICO Magazine's &quot;What Works&quot;
