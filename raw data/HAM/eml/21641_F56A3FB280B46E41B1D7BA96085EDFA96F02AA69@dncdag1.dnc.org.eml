Great book party.

You'll be at a good downtown hotel!

Plate so full, but happy to learn about National Park Stonewall designation.

Big hug!

Hi Andy,

Wasn't the book party for Jane Mayer wonderful? Added benefit to catch up with you there. 

First, would you help me be sure to have a ( relatively ) good room for the convention?

I will be hanging out with you and with Joe Andrew and Ann Andrew and with a few NYers like the Kovners and Hess-Kaplans. I don't want to be rooming far away and everyone advises (well, not everyone) that I ask you to assist!

And about Stonewall: TPL is doing all the work to bring this into the National Park Service. So exciting. 

Would you be interested in learning more?  Could be just an email from TPL or an in depth briefing about what it takes to make the first park for gay rights. 

I'd love to be engaged with you on the work, if it interests you. How could it not?! 

XoCaroline
