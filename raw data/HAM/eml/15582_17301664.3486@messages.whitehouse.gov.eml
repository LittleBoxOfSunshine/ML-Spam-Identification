For Immediate Release May 5, 2016





REMARKS BY THE FIRST LADY

AT JOINING FORCES FIFTH ANNIVERSARY EMPLOYMENT EVENT=20



State Dining Room



10:26 A.M. EDT





 MRS. OBAMA: Thank you all. (Applause.) Thanks so much. You all rest your=
selves. (Laughter.) Youve been working hard and, obviously, after this an=
nouncement, youll have a lot more work to do once youre rested. Welcome, =
welcome.



 We are so thrilled to have you all here at the White House today. Let me=
 start by thanking Kathleen for that just very sweet introduction. She di=
dnt share with me backstage the story about Sophia, so its like, youre go=
ing to wait and make me cry -- (laughter) -- right before I came out. (La=
ughter.)



 But the reason why we like to have folks like Kathleen share their stori=
es is that they are the best representatives of why Joining Forces means =
so much to me and Jill. When we talk about being in awe of these men and =
women, its stories like Kathleens and her familys, and there are millions=
 of people like her out there. So I want to thank Kathleen and her amazin=
g family for being my inspiration. Thank you all for your service and sac=
rifice. Were so grateful and we love you all. We love you to death.



 I also, of course, want to thank Jill, my dear, dear friend, who has bee=
n an amazing partner in this Joining Forces endeavor. But more importantl=
y, shes been a terrific friend to have over this interesting journey that=
 weve had together. So we made it to five years on Joining Forces. Lookin=
g back, we started talking about this backstage when Barack chose Joe to =
be his vice presidential candidate, and we both talked about the passion =
we had developed for our military -- her as a Blue Star mom and me as a r=
egular civilian who didnt have that connection. So to be able to celebrat=
e this milestone together with you today means the world. So thank you, J=
ill. Thank you so much. (Applause.)



 And, of course, I have to recognize our dear friend, Jeff, an Amazonian =
-- I like that -- (laughter) -- and all the Amazon team. Thank you, Jeff,=
 for your leadership, for making such an extraordinary commitment to our =
veterans and our military spouses today. You are setting the bar high, yo=
u are doing a phenomenal job. Your team is amazing, and you were smart en=
ough to hire Kathleen, so you must know what youre doing. (Laughter.) Tha=
nk you so much, Jeff, from Amazon, as well. (Applause.)



 Now, Im going to take just a moment on this fifth anniversary to embarra=
ss a couple of people. I want to give a special -- and theyre both lookin=
g down now. (Laughter.) Theyre like, oh, no, oh, no. First, I want to tha=
nk Andy Anderson. Andy, please stand up. Im sorry, youve got to stand up.=
 (Applause.) Andy is an Airforce Major and an actual rocket scientist. (L=
aughter.) Theres one right there. We always touch him and go, ah -- and w=
e didnt know they were that cute, too, rocket scientists. (Laughter.) But=
 he has been serving on our team as a White House Fellow, and Andy has do=
ne such outstanding work on not just this event but on so many others. I =
dont think people realize that all the work out of Joining Forces comes f=
rom a handful of people on Jills and my staff. And Andy is one of those f=
olks, and its just been a pleasure to have you and your family on our tea=
m.



 The second person Im going to embarrass is sitting right next to him. (L=
aughter.) Our Joining Forces Executive Director, Colonel Nicole Malachows=
ki, whose last day with us is tomorrow. So Nicole was the first female Th=
underbird pilot. She has flown 200 combat hours and received every award =
and recognition you can imagine. And she is as humble -- she is the total=
 opposite of all that. (Laughter.) I have to pull her up and get her to t=
alk. And shes a great mom, and I just have loved having you on our team. =
And our executive directors come and go -- we only get them for a year, a=
nd Nicole is leaving us, but I love you. You have done a phenomenal job, =
and I wish you all the best on the next phase of your journey. (Applause.=
)



 And finally, most of all, I want to thank all of you who are here today =
-- representatives from more than 50 outstanding companies and organizati=
ons all across America. You all range from small startups to multinationa=
l corporations. Youre leaders in so many different industries -- from aer=
ospace and telecom to financial services and tech. But all of you are her=
e today for one simple reason: Because you know that our veterans and mil=
itary spouses are some of the most dedicated, skilled, talented people in=
 this country. And I am just thrilled that all of you have pledged to hir=
e more than 110,000 of them, and train 60,000 of them. Thank you so much.=
 (Applause.)



 Youre preparing them for high-tech jobs in some of our fastest-growing i=
ndustries. And this is key. These jobs offer high salaries, opportunities=
 for advancement and, as youve heard, the flexibility to accommodate the =
demands of military life.=20



So these jobs are -- they mean more than just the number, because this is=
 real opportunity. These are precisely the kind of jobs we want for our v=
eterans and our spouses. And that's why since we launched Joining Forces =
back in 2011, we've been reaching out to the business leaders like all of=
 you and urging them to look to our military community for their employme=
nt needs.



 And year after year, companies have responded. And over the past five ye=
ars, through Joining Forces and great team members like Nicole and Andy, =
companies have hired or trained more than 1.2 million veterans and milita=
ry spouses. And during that same period, our veterans unemployment rate w=
as literally cut in half. (Applause.)=20



 And I want to be clear that companies didn't just make these commitments=
 because we asked them to or because it was the patriotic thing to do, th=
ough it is. As Jeff mentioned, they made these commitments because, time =
and again, they saw for themselves that our veterans and military spouses=
 are simply the best employees around. And they realized that training an=
d hiring these folks isnt just the right thing to do, its the smart thing=
 to do for their bottom lines.



 And that is especially true when it comes to tech jobs in industries. Th=
e fact is that we have the most technologically advanced armed forces in =
history. For years, some of the biggest technological innovations -- from=
 the Internet to GPS -- have come from the U.S. military.=20



 Right now more than 150,000 of our men and women in uniform are already =
doing tech jobs. Whether its the staff sergeant who repairs her battalion=
s communications equipment in the field to the technicians who maintain t=
he software on our fighter jets, to the countless folks working around th=
e clock to protect our networks from cyberattacks -- these people have do=
ne their jobs in some of the most challenging environments imaginable.



 So just think if they can set up wireless networks in Baghdad, or do sat=
ellite reconnaissance in the mountains of Afghanistan, I am pretty confid=
ent that they can handle whatever is happening in Silicon Valley, right? =
(Laughter.) But seriously, the bottom line here is simple. Right now so m=
any folks across our military are essentially already working in the tech=
 industry. They just happen to be wearing our countrys uniform while they=
're doing it. So when they decide to transition to civilian life and comp=
anies like yours decide to hire them, I know that you will be blown away =
by everything they have to offer.=20



 Just take Ryen Macababbad. Ryen is here. Where are you, Ryen? I saw you.=
 I know you're here. There you are. (Laughter.) Ryen, Im going to embarra=
ss you, too. She started her career in the Army maintaining systems for m=
ilitary intelligence. After completing Microsofts Software & Systems Acad=
emy, she got a job working on Microsofts cloud technology where she quick=
ly distinguished herself as one of the most talented and passionate emplo=
yees.=20



In an essay - this is a quote from you, Ryen -- she said, When Im relaxin=
g, I like to do things that interest me. Learning about different authent=
ication methods and different technologies that connect you to cloud serv=
ices - those are the things that I enjoy.



See that's passion. (Laughter.) I don't even know what that is. (Laughter=
.) And that's what she likes doing in her spare time. So Ryen is amazing.=




And then theres the story of Sarah Dutile whose husband is a Captain in t=
he Army. Sarah? Wheres Sarah? There you go, Sarah. Stand up. Let us see y=
ou. Sarah works as a talent acquisition operations manager at EMC. And ev=
en through multiple deployments and multiple moves across the country - M=
assachusetts, Virginia, Washington -- Im sure Im missing someplace youve =
lived -- EMC ensured that Sarah could keep her job. And she won five awar=
ds from her managers and was promoted to manage a team of her own.



 So it was worth it, right? Yes.=20



So folks like Ryen and Sarah dont just bring a host of hard skills to the=
 workplace, they also bring plenty of other qualities that are hard to te=
ach on the job. They have a relentless commitment to excellence. They kno=
w how to juggle multiple priorities, and meet tough deadlines, and lead d=
iverse teams. And when it comes to high-pressure situations, when the pre=
ssure is the highest, thats usually when our veterans and military spouse=
s are at their best.=20



And remember, they can bring these skills not just to tech jobs, but to c=
ountless other jobs - from HR to communications to project management. Wh=
atever job you're looking to fill, there are plenty of folks doing that j=
ob in the military right now who will be ready to succeed in your company=
 on day one. Flat out.=20



That's why you've all made these commitments today. So thank you for doin=
g your part. Thank you. But, of course, its going to take all of this. Th=
is isnt just your responsibility because even when companies are doing ev=
erything right, too often the realities of military life make it hard for=
 folks to take and keep the jobs that you've created.



For example, for too long veterans faced all kinds of barriers to applyin=
g their military training toward professional licenses and academic degre=
es. So while someone may have had years of training as an Army medic, for=
 example, hardly any of it would count toward a PA degree or an EMT certi=
fication. Theyd have to start from scratch, often repeating courses theyd=
 already taken.=20



Military spouses in careers like nursing, law, real estate, anything that=
 required professional licenses, faced their own set of challenges, becau=
se as their families moved from base to base to base -- as you've heard t=
hey often do -- they would have to apply for a new license in each new st=
ate, often paying hefty fees just to find work. But now, through Joining =
Forces, weve worked closely with governors and state legislators across t=
he country to address these issues.=20



And as of today, Im happy to report that all 50 states have taken action =
to help veterans get credit for their military training. And 49 out of 50=
 states have passed laws to help military spouses transfer their licenses=
 from state to state. That's a big deal. (Applause.) And we very much hop=
e that the one remaining state -- (laughter) -- the great state of New Yo=
rk --=20



AUDIENCE: Ooh --



MRS. OBAMA: Mmm -- (laughter) -- will pass legislation to help us solve t=
his problem nationwide. Let's get to 50, New York! Because laws like thes=
e arent just critical for the employment prospects of our veterans and mi=
litary spouses, they're also critical for the overall health of our milit=
ary.=20



Lets not forget that we still have about 200,000 servicemembers making th=
e transition to civilian life every single year, and their success and th=
eir struggles will have an impact on our military for decades to come. Se=
e, we have to remember, our military is an all-volunteer force. Everyone =
who wears our countrys uniform today does so by choice. And if we want ou=
r best and brightest young people to keep choosing to join our armed forc=
es, they need to see that their service will lead to successful careers -=
- either in the military, or in civilian life.=20



So that is truly our charge in the years ahead. And today, I want to call=
 on companies and organizations across America to follow the lead that yo=
u all are setting and truly commit to hiring and training our veterans an=
d military spouses. We have so many resources to help companies get start=
ed.=20



Through the Skillbridge Program at the Department of Defense, companies c=
an start training servicemembers six months before they leave the militar=
y so theyre ready to start full-time the minute they transition.=20



The Department of Labor runs a veterans job bank and offers all kinds of =
assistance that companies can access. And once our vets and military spou=
ses are on board, I hope that companies will take it to the next level, l=
ike Amazon is doing, by working to retain and promote them. Because the e=
nd goal here isnt just getting folks into entry-level jobs; its putting t=
hem on a career path where they can keep learning new skills, moving up t=
he ladder, and pulling others along with them.=20



Because our veterans and military spouses dont stop learning and serving =
when they hang up that uniform. They are eager to find their next mission=
 and use their training and talent to serve this country here at home. An=
d giving them that opportunity is the least we can do. And if anyone can =
make it happen, its all of you. You all are some of the most innovative, =
successful businesses in the history of this country. And you all are tru=
ly setting the standard on this issue. You're truly showing us whats poss=
ible.



So we need to keep up this momentum. And I will say this again and again =
and again: No matter who is in the White House next, this should absolute=
ly continue to be a national priority with national leadership coming fro=
m this building. And I know that if folks like you keep leading the way a=
nd inspiring others to follow your example, then we can absolutely give o=
ur veterans and military spouses the opportunities they deserve. And we c=
an finally serve them as well as they have served this country.



So I will end by once again by saying how grateful I am for everything yo=
u all have done and everything you will continue to do. And I look forwar=
d to continuing our work together in the months and, yes, the years ahead=
. So no matter where we are, Jill and I are going to be working to findin=
g a way to work with you guys and making sure that you get all the love a=
nd attention and support that you've earned, because we are certainly pro=
ud of you. We are certainly in awe of you. You make us better people.=20



So thank you all so much. Congratulations on this wonderful commitment. L=
et's get more people joining in. And God bless you all. Take care. (Appla=
use.)=20

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MRS. OBAMA:<a name=3D"_GoBa=
ck"></a>&nbsp; Thank you all.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp;=
 You all rest yourselves.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You&#8217;ve been working=
 hard and, obviously, after this announcement, you&#8217;ll have a lot more=
 work to do once you&#8217;re
 rested.&nbsp; Welcome, welcome.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are so thrilled to have =
you all here at the White House today.&nbsp; Let me start by thanking Kathl=
een for that just very sweet introduction.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t share wit=
h me backstage the story about Sophia, so it&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re goi=
ng to wait
 and make me cry -- (laughter) -- right before I came out.&nbsp; (Laughter.=
)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the reason why we like =
to have folks like Kathleen share their stories is that they are the best r=
epresentatives of why Joining Forces means so much to me and Jill.&nbsp; Wh=
en we talk about being in awe of these men and women, it&#8217;s
 stories like Kathleen&#8217;s and her family&#8217;s, and there are millio=
ns of people like her out there.&nbsp; So I want to thank Kathleen and her =
amazing family for being my inspiration.&nbsp; Thank you all for your servi=
ce and sacrifice.&nbsp; We&#8217;re so grateful and we love you all.&nbsp;
 We love you to death.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also, of course, want to =
thank Jill, my dear, dear friend, who has been an amazing partner in this J=
oining Forces endeavor. But more importantly, she&#8217;s been a terrific f=
riend to have over this interesting journey that we&#8217;ve had together.&=
nbsp;
 So we made it to five years on Joining Forces.&nbsp; Looking back, we star=
ted talking about this backstage when Barack chose Joe to be his vice presi=
dential candidate, and we both talked about the passion we had developed fo=
r our military -- her as a Blue Star
 mom and me as a regular civilian who didn&#8217;t have that connection.&nb=
sp; So to be able to celebrate this milestone together with you today means=
 the world.&nbsp; So thank you, Jill.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; (Appla=
use.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, of course, I have to r=
ecognize our dear friend, Jeff, an Amazonian -- I like that -- (laughter) -=
- and all the Amazon team.&nbsp; Thank you, Jeff, for your leadership, for =
making such an extraordinary commitment to our veterans and
 our military spouses today.&nbsp; You are setting the bar high, you are do=
ing a phenomenal job.&nbsp; Your team is amazing, and you were smart enough=
 to hire Kathleen, so you must know what you&#8217;re doing.&nbsp; (Laughte=
r.)&nbsp; Thank you so much, Jeff, from Amazon, as well.&nbsp;
 (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I&#8217;m going to tak=
e just a moment on this fifth anniversary to embarrass a couple of people.&=
nbsp; I want to give a special -- and they&#8217;re both looking down now.&=
nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; They&#8217;re like, oh, no, oh, no.&nbsp; First, I =
want to thank Andy
 Anderson.&nbsp; Andy, please stand up.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, you&#8217;ve=
 got to stand up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Andy is an Airforce Major and an =
actual rocket scientist.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; There&#8217;s one right th=
ere.&nbsp; We always touch him and go, ah -- and we didn&#8217;t know they =
were that cute,
 too, rocket scientists.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But he has been serving on=
 our team as a White House Fellow, and Andy has done such outstanding work =
on not just this event but on so many others.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think peo=
ple realize that all the work out of Joining Forces comes
 from a handful of people on Jill&#8217;s and my staff.&nbsp; And Andy is o=
ne of those folks, and it&#8217;s just been a pleasure to have you and your=
 family on our team.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second person I&#8217;m=
 going to embarrass is sitting right next to him.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; O=
ur Joining Forces Executive Director, Colonel Nicole Malachowski, whose las=
t day with us is tomorrow.&nbsp; So Nicole was the first female Thunderbird
 pilot.&nbsp; She has flown 200 combat hours and received every award and r=
ecognition you can imagine.&nbsp; And she is as humble -- she is the total =
opposite of all that.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I have to pull her up and get=
 her to talk.&nbsp; And she&#8217;s a great mom, and I just have
 loved having you on our team.&nbsp; And our executive directors come and g=
o -- we only get them for a year, and Nicole is leaving us, but I love you.=
&nbsp; You have done a phenomenal job, and I wish you all the best on the n=
ext phase of your journey.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally, most of all, I=
 want to thank all of you who are here today -- representatives from more t=
han 50 outstanding companies and organizations all across America.&nbsp; Yo=
u all range from small startups to multinational corporations.&nbsp;
 You&#8217;re leaders in so many different industries -- from aerospace and=
 telecom to financial services and tech.&nbsp; But all of you are here toda=
y for one simple reason:&nbsp; Because you know that our veterans and milit=
ary spouses are some of the most dedicated, skilled,
 talented people in this country.&nbsp; And I am just thrilled that all of =
you have pledged to hire more than 110,000 of them, and train 60,000 of the=
m.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#8217;re preparing them=
 for high-tech jobs in some of our fastest-growing industries.&nbsp; And th=
is is key.&nbsp; These jobs offer high salaries, opportunities for advancem=
ent and, as you&#8217;ve heard, the flexibility to accommodate the demands =
of
 military life.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So these jobs are -- they=
 mean more than just the number, because this is real opportunity.&nbsp; Th=
ese are precisely the kind of jobs we want for our veterans and our spouses=
.&nbsp; And that's why since we launched Joining
 Forces back in 2011, we've been reaching out to the business leaders like =
all of you and urging them to look to our military community for their empl=
oyment needs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And year after year, compan=
ies have responded.&nbsp; And over the past five years, through Joining For=
ces and great team members like Nicole and Andy, companies have hired or tr=
ained more than 1.2 million veterans and military spouses.&nbsp;
 And during that same period, our veterans&#8217; unemployment rate was lit=
erally cut in half.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to be clear that=
 companies didn't just make these commitments because we asked them to or b=
ecause it was the patriotic thing to do, though it is.&nbsp; As Jeff mentio=
ned, they made these commitments because, time and again, they
 saw for themselves that our veterans and military spouses are simply the b=
est employees around.&nbsp; And they realized that training and hiring thes=
e folks isn&#8217;t just the right thing to do, it&#8217;s the smart thing =
to do for their bottom lines.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is especially true=
 when it comes to tech jobs in industries.&nbsp; The fact is that we have t=
he most technologically advanced armed forces in history.&nbsp; For years, =
some of the biggest technological innovations -- from the Internet
 to GPS -- have come from the U.S. military.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now more than 150,000=
 of our men and women in uniform are already doing tech jobs.&nbsp; Whether=
 it&#8217;s the staff sergeant who repairs her battalion&#8217;s communicat=
ions equipment in the field to the technicians who maintain the software
 on our fighter jets, to the countless folks working around the clock to pr=
otect our networks from cyberattacks -- these people have done their jobs i=
n some of the most challenging environments imaginable.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So just think if they can s=
et up wireless networks in Baghdad, or do satellite reconnaissance in the m=
ountains of Afghanistan, I am pretty confident that they can handle whateve=
r is happening in Silicon Valley, right?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
 But seriously, the bottom line here is simple.&nbsp; Right now so many fol=
ks across our military are essentially already working in the tech industry=
.&nbsp; They just happen to be wearing our country&#8217;s uniform while th=
ey're doing it.&nbsp; So when they decide to transition
 to civilian life and companies like yours decide to hire them, I know that=
 you will be blown away by everything they have to offer.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just take Ryen Macababbad.&=
nbsp; Ryen is here.&nbsp; Where are you, Ryen?&nbsp; I saw you.&nbsp; I kno=
w you're here.&nbsp; There you are.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Ryen, I&#8217;m=
 going to embarrass you, too.&nbsp; She started her career in the Army main=
taining systems for military
 intelligence.&nbsp; After completing Microsoft&#8217;s Software &amp; Syst=
ems Academy, she got a job working on Microsoft&#8217;s cloud technology wh=
ere she quickly distinguished herself as one of the most talented and passi=
onate employees.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In an essay &#8211;- this=
 is a quote from you, Ryen -- she said, &#8220;When I&#8217;m relaxing, I l=
ike to do things that interest me.&nbsp; Learning about different authentic=
ation methods and different technologies that connect you to
 cloud services &#8211;- those are the things that I enjoy.&#8221;<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">See that's passion.&nbsp;=
 (Laughter.)&nbsp; I don't even know what that is.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; =
And that's what she likes doing in her spare time.&nbsp; So Ryen is amazing=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And then there&#8217;s th=
e story of Sarah Dutile whose husband is a Captain in the Army.&nbsp;&nbsp;=
 Sarah?&nbsp; Where&#8217;s Sarah?&nbsp; There you go, Sarah.&nbsp; Stand u=
p.&nbsp; Let us see you.&nbsp; Sarah works as a talent acquisition operatio=
ns manager
 at EMC.&nbsp; And even through multiple deployments and multiple moves acr=
oss the country &#8211;- Massachusetts, Virginia, Washington -- I&#8217;m s=
ure I&#8217;m missing someplace you&#8217;ve lived -- EMC ensured that Sara=
h could keep her job.&nbsp; And she won five awards from her managers
 and was promoted to manage a team of her own.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was worth it, right?&=
nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So folks like Ryen and Sa=
rah don&#8217;t just bring a host of hard skills to the workplace, they als=
o bring plenty of other qualities that are hard to teach on the job.&nbsp; =
They have a relentless commitment to excellence.&nbsp;
 They know how to juggle multiple priorities, and meet tough deadlines, and=
 lead diverse teams.&nbsp; And when it comes to high-pressure situations, w=
hen the pressure is the highest, that&#8217;s usually when our veterans and=
 military spouses are at their best.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And remember, they can br=
ing these skills not just to tech jobs, but to countless other jobs &#8211;=
- from HR to communications to project management.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever job=
 you're looking to fill, there are plenty of folks doing
 that job in the military right now who will be ready to succeed in your co=
mpany on day one.&nbsp; Flat out.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That's why you've all mad=
e these commitments today.&nbsp; So thank you for doing your part.&nbsp; Th=
ank you.&nbsp; But, of course, it&#8217;s going to take all of this.&nbsp; =
This isn&#8217;t just your responsibility because even when companies
 are doing everything right, too often the realities of military life make =
it hard for folks to take and keep the jobs that you've created.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">For example, for too long=
 veterans faced all kinds of barriers to applying their military training t=
oward professional licenses and academic degrees.&nbsp; So while someone ma=
y have had years of training as an Army medic,
 for example, hardly any of it would count toward a PA degree or an EMT cer=
tification.&nbsp; They&#8217;d have to start from scratch, often repeating =
courses they&#8217;d already taken.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Military spouses in caree=
rs like nursing, law, real estate, anything that required professional lice=
nses, faced their own set of challenges, because as their families moved fr=
om base to base to base -- as you've
 heard they often do -- they would have to apply for a new license in each =
new state, often paying hefty fees just to find work.&nbsp; But now, throug=
h Joining Forces, we&#8217;ve worked closely with governors and state legis=
lators across the country to address these
 issues.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And as of today, I&#8217;=
m happy to report that all 50 states have taken action to help veterans get=
 credit for their military training. &nbsp;And 49 out of 50 states have pas=
sed laws to help military spouses transfer their
 licenses from state to state.&nbsp; That's a big deal.&nbsp; (Applause.)&n=
bsp; And we very much hope that the one remaining state -- (laughter) -- th=
e great state of New York --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Ooh --<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Mmm -- =
(laughter) -- will pass legislation to help us solve this problem nationwid=
e. &nbsp;Let's get to 50, New York!&nbsp; Because laws like these aren&#821=
7;t just critical for the employment prospects of our veterans
 and military spouses, they're also critical for the overall health of our =
military.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Let&#8217;s not forget th=
at we still have about 200,000 servicemembers making the transition to civi=
lian life every single year, and their success and their struggles will hav=
e an impact on our military for decades to
 come.&nbsp; See, we have to remember, our military is an all-volunteer for=
ce.&nbsp; Everyone who wears our country&#8217;s uniform today does so by c=
hoice.&nbsp; And if we want our best and brightest young people to keep cho=
osing to join our armed forces, they need to see that
 their service will lead to successful careers -- either in the military, o=
r in civilian life.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that is truly our char=
ge in the years ahead.&nbsp; And today, I want to call on companies and org=
anizations across America to follow the lead that you all are setting and t=
ruly commit to hiring and training our veterans
 and military spouses.&nbsp; We have so many resources to help companies ge=
t started.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Through the Skillbridge P=
rogram at the Department of Defense, companies can start training serviceme=
mbers six months before they leave the military so they&#8217;re ready to s=
tart full-time the minute they transition.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The Department of Labor r=
uns a veterans&#8217; job bank and offers all kinds of assistance that comp=
anies can access.&nbsp; And once our vets and military spouses are on board=
, I hope that companies will take it to the next
 level, like Amazon is doing, by working to retain and promote them.&nbsp; =
Because the end goal here isn&#8217;t just getting folks into entry-level j=
obs; it&#8217;s putting them on a career path where they can keep learning =
new skills, moving up the ladder, and pulling others
 along with them.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Because our veterans and =
military spouses don&#8217;t stop learning and serving when they hang up th=
at uniform.&nbsp; They are eager to find their next mission and use their t=
raining and talent to serve this country here at
 home. &nbsp;And giving them that opportunity is the least we can do.&nbsp;=
 And if anyone can make it happen, it&#8217;s all of you.&nbsp; You all are=
 some of the most innovative, successful businesses in the history of this =
country. And you all are truly setting the standard on

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we need to keep up thi=
s momentum.&nbsp; And I will say this again and again and again: &nbsp;No m=
atter who is in the White House next, this should absolutely continue to be=
 a national priority with national leadership
 coming from this building.&nbsp; And I know that if folks like you keep le=
ading the way and inspiring others to follow your example, then we can abso=
lutely give our veterans and military spouses the opportunities they deserv=
e. &nbsp;And we can finally serve them as
 well as they have served this country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I will end by once aga=
in by saying how grateful I am for everything you all have done and everyth=
ing you will continue to do. &nbsp;And I look forward to continuing our wor=
k together in the months and, yes, the years
 ahead.&nbsp; So no matter where we are, Jill and I are going to be working=
 to finding a way to work with you guys and making sure that you get all th=
e love and attention and support that you've earned, because we are certain=
ly proud of you.&nbsp; We are certainly in
 awe of you.&nbsp; You make us better people.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So thank you all so much.=
&nbsp; Congratulations on this wonderful commitment.&nbsp; Let's get more p=
eople joining in.&nbsp; And God bless you all.&nbsp; Take care.&nbsp; (Appl=
