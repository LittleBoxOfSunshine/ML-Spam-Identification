BY NICHOLAS RICCARDI

SEP. 13, 2015 8:00 AM EDT

DENVER (AP) - Jeb Bush went to Detroit and talked about leveling the playin=
g field. Marco Rubio wrote a book about helping the working class. Rand Pau=
l is promising to expand the Republican Party beyond its traditional base.

Yet all three Republican presidential candidates have offered tax proposals=
 that would, for reasons such as nomination politics and tax rate realities=
, benefit overwhelmingly the wealthiest.

In doing so, they have drawn criticism from Democrats who call it proof tha=
t the GOP's eventual nominee will mainly try to help the rich.

Even some conservatives expressed concerns after Bush released his proposed=
 tax cut this past week. Then there was the analysis Thursday from the Wash=
ington-based Tax Foundation that concluded his plan would initially help th=
e top 1 percent of earners 10 times as much as it would those in the bottom=
 10 percent.

"Republicans should be countering the caricature of themselves as slavishly=
 devoted to the interests of rich people and corporations, not playing into=
 it," according to an editorial in the conservative National Review. The ma=
gazine nonetheless praised Bush's effort to reduce income and business tax =
rates.

The trio's tax plans do contain elements aimed directly at middle- and work=
ing-class voters. Rubio proposes to expand the child tax credit and Bush wa=
nts to double the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is designed to help the w=
orking poor.

But experts note that any broad income tax cut inevitably will benefit the =
rich more than anyone else, because they pay much more in federal income ta=
xes than the middle class or poor.

About 40 percent of the country does not pay federal income tax. The top 1 =
percent of earners pays about 35 percent of the income tax.

"It is a mechanical problem," said Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center=
, a joint project of the centrist Brookings Institute and left-leaning Urba=
n Institute.

"If you start from the place where any tax plan has got to cut tax rates, y=
ou start with a plan that is already regressive and it becomes challenging =
and complicated to ameliorate that."

Michael Strain of the conservative American Enterprise Institute said Repub=
licans have good reason to push for across-the-board cuts, despite the inev=
itable benefit to the wealthy.

"There's a genuine concern on the part of conservatives about economic grow=
th and having tax code that fosters economic growth because of a belief tha=
t you need a growing economy to help everyone in the country," Strain said.

John Cogan, a Stanford economist who served in the Reagan administration an=
d consulted on the Bush plan, argued that the tax reductions can help cure =
the inequality that critics contend they exacerbate. "Economic growth is ab=
solutely essential to reducing the degree of inequality," Cogan said.

That's how Bush, a former, Florida governor, has tried to sell his plan. On=
 Thursday, he brushed aside Democratic criticisms that the proposal was a g=
iveaway to his wealthy donors and could increase the deficit, under his own=
 supporters' estimates, by more than $3 trillion.

The U.S. must get back to "high, sustained economic growth," Bush said duri=
ng a CNN interview. "We need to boost people's spirits by giving them more =
money to be able to make decisions for themselves."

Bush's plan condenses seven different brackets to three - 28 percent for to=
p earners (who are now taxed at as high as a 39.6 percent rate), 25 percent=
 and 10 percent for families making up to $87,000.

He would drop the corporate rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. To help mid=
dle- and working-class families, he would double the standard deduction and=
 raise the Earned Income tax Credit.

Bush surprised observers by pledging to eliminate a tax break that benefits=
 investment managers - a small but symbolically potent change to a Wall Str=
eet benefit that comes weeks after rival Donald Trump called for such a mov=
e.

Florida Sen. Rubio wrote a book in December outlining proposals to help low=
-income and middle-class families.

In February he signed on to a sweeping tax proposal that does not cut top r=
ates as much as Bush's plan but does eliminate taxes on investment income. =
That would slash federal tax bills for many of the wealthiest in the countr=
y.

Paul, a Kentucky senator, followed with a proposal to drop the tax rate to =
14.5 percent across the board, which analysts argue may be an even bigger w=
indfall for the rich.

Conservative commentator Ramesh Ponnuru wrote in a column Thursday that the=
 GOP should look to cutting other levies, like the payroll tax, which fall =
the heaviest on lower- and middle-income laborers. He said the GOP tax cut =
plans might end up being compared to Mitt Romney's in 2012, which a majorit=
y of voters thought helped the rich, according to exit polls.
