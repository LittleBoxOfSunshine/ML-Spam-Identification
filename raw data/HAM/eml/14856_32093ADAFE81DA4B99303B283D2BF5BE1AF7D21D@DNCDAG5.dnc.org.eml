In celebration of Pride Month, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz publ=
ished the below op-ed in the Washington Blade:

There=92s never been more to celebrate at Pride<http://www.washingtonblade.=
com/2015/06/01/theres-never-been-more-to-celebrate-at-pride/>
WASHINGTON BLADE // DNC CHAIR REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ

Two years after the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act a=
s unconstitutional in United States v. Windsor, there has never been more t=
o celebrate during Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month.

Marriage equality now exists in D.C. and 37 states, including my home state=
 of Florida. I was honored to be joined at the president=92s State of the U=
nion Address by one of the extraordinary newlywed couples, my constituents,=
 who helped lead the fight to secure same-sex marriage in the Sunshine Stat=
e. Later this month, it will be my distinct privilege to officiate my first=
 wedding, and I am overjoyed to know that this same-sex couple can finally =
enjoy having their union recognized in the eyes of the law. To see the happ=
iness of many more couples, or the beautiful children they=92ve brought int=
o the world or adopted, is a poignant reminder that love is love and that t=
hese fights make a real difference in people=92s lives.

Under President Obama, we have put an end to the discriminatory =93Don=92t =
Ask, Don=92t Tell=94 policy that prevented gay and lesbian Americans from f=
reely and openly serving their country. Congressional Democrats have added =
LGBT protections to the Violence Against Women Act. And President Obama has=
 signed an executive order to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual ori=
entation or identity for federal contractors, extended key benefits to same=
-sex partners of federal employees and banned discrimination in federal wor=
kplaces based on gender identity.

The American public=92s support for same-sex marriage now reaches 60 percen=
t for the first time in history. And the referendum legalizing gay marriage=
 in Ireland is a historic victory that should be celebrated all over the wo=
rld.

Unfortunately, these fights are far from over. Recently, it was only after =
a strong national response that Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was forced to backt=
rack on his state=92s law that would have allowed businesses to discriminat=
e against the LGBT community. Many of the Republicans seeking their party=
=92s presidential nomination sided with Gov. Pence instead of the LGBT comm=
unity and the American people.

These Republican candidates want to take us backwards, undoing the progress=
 we=92ve fought so hard to secure. Jeb Bush has said that, =93the instituti=
on of marriage is under attack in our society.=94 Marco Rubio said one woul=
d need to have a =93ridiculous and absurd reading of the U.S. Constitution=
=94 to think same-sex couples have the right to marry. Rand Paul, the candi=
date who supposedly wants to broaden the GOP=92s appeal and outreach to you=
ng voters, said that same-sex marriage =93offends=94 him. Others, including=
 Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Bobby Jinda=
l, all oppose marriage equality.

There are many places around the world where people are still subjected to =
violence and discrimination based on who they are or who they love, particu=
larly for the transgender community. Even here at home, we=92ve failed to e=
nact protections like the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. In just a few =
weeks, the Supreme Court will issue a decision on whether same-sex couples =
have the right to marry nationwide.

This June, as we celebrate LGBT Pride Month, the LGBT community and its all=
ies are proud to look back on the victories we=92ve achieved, and rededicat=
e ourselves to the fights still ahead.
