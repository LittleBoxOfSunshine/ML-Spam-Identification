Friend --

For the past four decades, Democratic leadership in the
White House has made our country great by strengthening our
economy, producing jobs, and reducing our deficit.
Meanwhile, Republican administrations have been marked by
lowering taxes for the wealthiest among us and cutting vital
government programs and services that hardworking American
families rely on. That's just history.

So, yes -- the Republicans now have a presumptive nominee.
But the truth is, there really is nothing new about what the
Republican Party believes. They still deny that climate
change is real. They still want to take away a woman's right
to choose. And they still seek to repeal Obamacare and
reverse all of the progress we've made together.

So really, our decision in this election is pretty
easy: We can do everything we can to make sure our next
president is a Democrat who will keep our country moving
forward -- or we can let the Republicans put someone in
office who won't.

You can count on me to do whatever I can to help elect
Democrats up and down the ballot in November. Add your
name if I can count on you to do the same:
