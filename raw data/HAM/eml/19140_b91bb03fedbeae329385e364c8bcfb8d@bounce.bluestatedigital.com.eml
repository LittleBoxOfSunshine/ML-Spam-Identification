The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friend --

As of today, Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee.  The =
contrast between his values and the values our Democratic candidates =
defend every day could not be starker.  As women, we have a lot on the =
line.  It is crucial that we come together to push back on the backwards =
GOP rhetoric and make our voices heard this election cycle.

Please join me for a women's roundtable discussion this Friday, May 6th in =
Wilmington, Delaware.  This is your chance to ask me questions about what =
the DNC is doing to fight back and to strategize together about engaging =
women in the election this November. =20
