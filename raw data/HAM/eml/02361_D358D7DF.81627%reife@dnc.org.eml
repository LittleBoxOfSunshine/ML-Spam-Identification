This morning, the GOP=92s presumptive nominee for president, Donald Trump, =
is meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the H=

Whether it was going on TV to demand to see President Obama=92s birth certi=

migrants and minority groups, Donald Trump has been one of the loudest voic=

Now it=92s up to us to make that sure that=92s clear to the American people=

If you=92re committed to electing leaders who share our values and understa=

NAME, it=92s one thing to think about how Donald Trump would be a disaster =

Later today/just this morning, Trump will meet/met with Senator Mitch McCon=

 plan to defeat us in November.

<LINK>Bottom line, NAME: The Republican Party is coming together behind the=

NAME, this election is in full swing. If you=92re ready to make sure we bea=

Friend =96

Today, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul=
 Ryan are meeting with the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Don=
ald Trump.

Even as this happens, you=92re going to hear some Republicans say that divi=
ded their party as much as he=92s divided the country. Don=92t believe it, =
NAME.

The simple fact is that Donald Trump=92s rise is the natural conclusion to =
the anti-woman, anti-immigrant, anti-middle class policies that have animat=
ed the GOP for years. I just wish I could be a fly on the wall as Ryan and =
McConnell get ready to unify their party around their new standard-bearer.

But with Republicans coming together, we have to show that we're doing the =
same. So sign on today to let the GOP know there=92s no way we=92ll let Don=
ald Trump or his fellow Republicans win in November:

LINK

Thank you, NAME.

All the best,
