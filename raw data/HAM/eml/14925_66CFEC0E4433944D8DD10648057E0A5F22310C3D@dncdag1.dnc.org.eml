FACT CHECK: Republican Trickle-Down Tax Policies Fail the Middle Class



Mike Huckabee just repeated his support for the "Fair Tax," which would inc=
rease the tax burden on the middle class. The Republican candidates support=
 tax plans that disproportionately prop up the wealthy and powerful corpora=
tions instead of looking out for middle and working class Americans.



Republicans continue to push for the same failed tax policies the prioritiz=
e those at the very top.  These tired trickle-down policies that Americans =
continue to reject make it clear that Republicans will not fight for hardwo=
rking Americans.



HUCKABEE SUPPORTED THE FAIR TAX, WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE TAX BURDEN ON THE=
 MIDDLE CLASS



Huckabee Supported The "Fair Tax" Which Is A Consumption Tax. MIKE HUCKABEE=
: "One of the reasons that I'm so passionate about the fair tax, which is a=
 tax on consumption, not on income, capital gains, savings and inheritance,=
 is because it is the single most transformative thing we can do for the ec=
onomy." [Mornings With Maria, Fox Business, 7/31/15]



*         Americans For Fair Taxation Admitted That Those Earning Between $=
40,000 And $100,000 Would See Their Tax Burden Increase Under The Fair Tax.=
 "We found that including all the taxes that the FairTax would replace (inc=
ome, payroll, corporate and estate taxes), those earning less than $24,156 =
per year would benefit. AFT's Burton agreed that those earning more than $2=
00,000 would see their share of the overall tax burden decrease, admitting =
that 'probably those earning between $40[thousand] and $100,000' would see =
their percentage of the tax burden rise." [Factcheck.org, 5/31/07<http://ww=
w.factcheck.org/2007/05/unspinning-the-fairtax/>]



TRUMP SUPPORTED REGRESSIVE TAX POLICIES LIKE A FLAT TAX OR THE "FAIR TAX "



Trump Supported Replacing The Income Tax With Either A Flat Tax Or The "Fai=
r Tax" And Repealing The Corporate Income Tax. "Trump overcame his moral ob=
jections to the flat tax. On April 15, he told Fox News that he'd like to r=
eplace the income tax with 'either a fair tax' (i.e., a national sales tax)=
, 'a flat tax or certainly a simplified code.' He also proposes repealing t=
he corporate income tax because, he wrote in his 2011 book, it would 'creat=
e an unprecedented jobs boom.'" [Politico, 7/26/15<http://www.politico.com/=

*         Institute On Taxation And Economic Policy: Trump's Policies On Ta=
xes Would "Likely Sharply Increase The National Debt And Make The U.S. Tax =
System Substantially More Regressive By Both Cutting Taxes For The Rich And=
 Creating A Massive New Tax That Would Disproportionately Hurt Lower-Income=
 Americans." "Billionaire businessman, television personality and now presi=
dential candidate Donald Trump is the latest candidate to jump into the rac=
e. He has made a number of tax proposals. His more recent proposals, in con=
trast to ones he proposed back around the 2000 election, would likely sharp=
ly increase the national debt and make the U.S. tax system substantially mo=
re regressive by both cutting taxes for the rich and creating a massive new=
 tax that would disproportionately hurt lower-income Americans." [Institute=

JEB BUSH GAVE A BIG BOOST TO THE WEALTHIEST FLORIDIANS AT THE EXPENSE OF TH=

As Governor, Jeb Bush Pushed Through Tax Cuts For The Richest 5 Percent Of =
Floridians, While Disproportionately Hurting Middle-Class Homeowners By Shi=

jorities in both legislative chambers, Bush pushed through tax cuts for cor=
porations and wealthy investors-a group that made up, with rare exceptions,=
 the richest 5 percent of Floridians. At the same time, Bush's cuts to the =
state's tax base shifted much of the burden of paying for schools to locall=

ND PAUL: "You know, we are at a point where if you get too many people rece=
iving from government and too many people not paying taxes to support it, t=
hey're not really -- they don't have skin in the game. And I am afraid they=
 -- the system may slip away from us. And the president referred to this a =
couple of times. But he doesn't quite understand or acknowledged that when =
he says the rich need to pay their fair share, that 10 percent -- the top 1=
0 percent of wage earners pay 70 percent of the income tax. So if wants a m=
