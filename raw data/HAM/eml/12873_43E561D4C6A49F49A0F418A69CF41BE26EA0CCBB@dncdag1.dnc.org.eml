Looking back to when the Republican presidential primary kicked off in earn=
est last year, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said t=
hat he never expected Donald Trump to become the presumptive nominee but su=
ggested that the billionaire businessman=92s success is probably good for t=
he party.

=93You know what, I think something different and something new is probably=
 good for our party,=94 Priebus said Wednesday on CNN, a day after he tweet=
ed that Trump will be the presumptive nominee and called for unity against =
Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. =93Look, I don=92t think anyone pr=
edicted what happened. So, look, we=92re here. We=92re going to get behind =
the presumptive nominee.=94

Trump=92s decisive victory in Indiana on Tuesday effectively ended Ted Cruz=
=92s presidential campaign, knocking out the candidate best positioned to s=
top him from claiming the nomination at a contested convention if he fell s=
hort of accruing a majority of delegates before July.

Cruz=92s decision to bow out of the race was =93very gracious,=94 Priebus s=
aid. =93I was surprised, and it=92s a hard thing to do. I mean, he ran a ve=
ry, very serious operation. Just an incredible ground game. His delegate op=
eration was unbelievable, and I was surprised. But now, you know, you=92d h=
ave to say that it=92s pretty obvious that Donald Trump is going to get to =
1,237. But he=92s got to do it, though.=94
