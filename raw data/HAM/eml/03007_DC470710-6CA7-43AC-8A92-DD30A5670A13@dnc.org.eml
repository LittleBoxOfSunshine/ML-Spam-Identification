Subject: Thank you and one small request

HI Rachel,

Doug had a lovely time at the State Dinner last night and we are so gratefu=
l to you for securing the invitation for him.

Now, the request. Let me preface this by writing that when you and I do mee=
t in person, I hope you do not find me to be the enormous pain in the neck =
that I seem to be. I am merely trying to a job that sometimes has tiny poin=
ts of detail that get seemingly idiosyncratically sticky.

In the WH Press Release that went about with the list of attendees Doug is =
listed as Consultant. I had made the request - and I know you said no guara=
ntees, so I fully appreciate that - that he be listed as CEO & President, T=
he Public Interest Network.

https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/05/13/expected-attendees-t=
onights-nordic-state-dinner

The fact hat he was listed as Consultant (which is the title he prefers for=
 many of his personal political contributions, so is not entirely wrong), w=
as not well-received. His hope was that his title as CEO & President of The=
 Public Interest Network would signify to the many thousands of organizers =
and supporters of President Obama who work for TPIN would see this and feel=
 a bit of their own significance in it. Symbolic, if you will.

So=85do you think there is any chance of changing it on the WH PR? Even as =
a retroactive thing - assuming it requires only a few key strokes and defin=
itely doesn=92t need to be re-released to the papers, etc. - it would make =
a difference.

I have sent this request to the general Social Office email related to the =
event and you have been so incredibly generous already that I do not want t=
o take advantage of that, but any help or insight you might provide is appr=
eciated.

Thanks, sorry to bother you on a Saturday, etc.

Hope you=92re having a good weekend,
Courtney
