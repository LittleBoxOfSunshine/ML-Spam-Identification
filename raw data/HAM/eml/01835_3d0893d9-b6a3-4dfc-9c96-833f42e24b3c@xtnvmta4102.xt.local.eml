Former state Rep. Jon Keyser failed to qualify for the Republican Senate primary in Colorado, the state's chief elections official said Monday.

Keyser has been considered a leading candidate to take on Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet, after encouragement from top Republicans in Washington and Colorado as well as donors from around the country.

Keyser "submitted 16,067 petition signatures to the Secretary of State's office, which began a line-by-line review of the signatures," Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams said in a statement, which said Keyser fell 86 signatures short. "Of that 11,436 were deemed valid. His campaign has five days to protest the decision."
