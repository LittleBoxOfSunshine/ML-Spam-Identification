Mr. Bernie Sanders
U.S. Senator, Vermont
Washington, DC<x-apple-data-detectors://9/1>

Dear Senator Sanders:

First of all, thank you for participating in the Democratic town hall with =
Secretary Clinton that Fox News held in Detroit earlier this year. It was a=
 great success from our perspective and we hope from yours as well.

Secondly, we at Fox wanted to formally invite you to participate in the fin=
al presidential primary debate of the 2016 campaign.

Given that the race is still contested, and given that you, Secretary Clint=
on and the Democratic National Committee all publicly agreed to a final ser=
ies of debates - the last of which has not yet been held - we believe this =
final debate would be an excellent opportunity for you and Secretary Clinto=
n to "share Democrats' vision for the country," as DNC Chair Debbie Wasserm=
an Schultz put it when she sanctioned these final debates.

The Fox debate would be moderated by anchors Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier and Ch=
ris Wallace, the respected journalists who were widely praised - by Democra=
ts and Republicans alike - for their fair but rigorous questioning in a ser=
ies of GOP presidential primary debates dating back to August, the cycle's =
first debate. That same team is now poised to bring that same level of fair=
ness and rigor to the cycle's last debate.

Fox proposes that it be in California, the largest state in the union, sinc=
e there has not been a Democratic debate there this time around. As you kno=
w, this enormously important state will be holding its presidential primary=
 on June 7<x-apple-data-detectors://10>, the last day that any state will b=
e voting in the primaries.

Of course, that is just three weeks from today, which leaves very little ti=
me for delay. A prompt reply would be most welcome, given these tight time =
constraints. Again, this would be a DNC-sanctioned debate and, per the agre=
ement reached by the DNC and both candidates, would not be held on a weeken=
d. Fox stands ready to discuss specific dates and venues with you as soon a=
s possible. In fact, we'd love to begin that conversation today.

Democrats have not debated on Fox News for the last 12 years. By ending tha=
t dry spell, perhaps the party can bring some sense of closure to this long=
 and robust primary season. In the process, you and Secretary Clinton will =
reach a vast number of viewers - many of whom are certainly open to persuas=
ion - just as we pivot to the general election.

Thanks so much for considering this request. And please know that you are a=
lways welcome at Fox.

Sincerely,


Bill Sammon

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Dear Senator Sanders:<br>
<br>
First of all, thank you for participating in the Democratic town hall with =
Secretary Clinton that Fox News held in Detroit earlier this year. It was a=
 great success from our perspective and we hope from yours as well.<br>
<br>
Secondly, we at Fox wanted to formally invite you&nbsp;to participate in th=
e final presidential primary debate of the 2016 campaign.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Given that the race is still contested, and given th=
at you,&nbsp;Secretary Clinton&nbsp;and the Democratic National Committee a=
ll publicly agreed to a final series of debates &#8211; the last of which h=
as not yet been held &#8211; we believe this final debate
 would be an excellent opportunity for you and&nbsp;Secretary Clinton to &#=
8220;share Democrats&#8217; vision for the country,&#8221; as DNC Chair Deb=
bie Wasserman Schultz put it when she sanctioned these final debates.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The Fox debate would be moderated by anchors Megyn K=
elly, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, the respected journalists who were wide=
ly praised &#8211; by Democrats and Republicans alike &#8211; for their fai=
r but rigorous questioning in a series of GOP
 presidential primary debates dating back to August, the cycle&#8217;s firs=
t debate.&nbsp;That same team is now poised to bring that same level of fai=
rness and rigor to the cycle&#8217;s last debate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Fox proposes that it be in California, the largest s=
tate in the union, since there has not been a Democratic debate there this =
time around. As you know, this&nbsp;enormously important state will be hold=
ing its presidential primary&nbsp;<a href=3D"x-apple-data-detectors://10">o=
n
 June 7</a>, the last day that any state will be voting in the primaries.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Of course, that is just three weeks from today, whic=
h leaves very little time for delay. A prompt reply would be most welcome, =
given these tight time constraints. Again, this would be a DNC-sanctioned d=
ebate and, per the agreement reached
 by the DNC and both candidates, would not be held on a weekend. Fox stands=
 ready to discuss specific dates and venues with you as soon as possible. I=
n fact, we&#8217;d love to begin that conversation today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Democrats have not debated on Fox News for the last =
12 years.&nbsp;By ending that dry spell, perhaps the party can bring some s=
ense of closure to this long and robust primary season. In the process, you=
 and&nbsp;Secretary Clinton&nbsp;will reach a vast
 number of viewers &#8211; many of whom are certainly open to persuasion &#=
8211; just as we pivot to the general election.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Thanks so much for considering this request. And ple=
