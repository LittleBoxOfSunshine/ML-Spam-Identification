We have 6/2 - 6/4. Right now the only confirmed events are Knoxville and In=
dianapolis on 6/2 and 6/4, respectively. We've pitched South Carolina, DC, =
and Detroit. They've shot ALL of those down. Kate meanwhile wants us to tak=
e her to the money metropolises of Omaha and Jackson Hole.=20

This wouldn't be a huge problem except for the fact that they won't let us =
start building our other two events until we fill 6/3 ("so they can run tra=
ps on her schedule"). We would meet with them about this, but they're trave=
ling and don't want to schedule a call or meeting until next week.

Basically we need you to talk to Tracie about letting us start blasting out=
 Knoxville and Indianapolis. We also need them to be more flexible about wh=
ere we take her.=20
