Take a look and then we can throw a title on there. It's a little bland


Just last week, Trump proudly announced endorsements from two "tough guys<http://www.bustle.com/articles/157523-these-brand-new-donald-trump-endorsers-should-horrify-you>" - Mike Tyson and Bobby Knight - with a troubling history on the issue of rape. Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992 in Indiana, and Bobby Knight once said "I think if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it."

After days of touting the endorsement of Mike Tyson, turns out that But Donald Trump's misogynistic and backwards defense of Tyson and dismissive attitude towards the rape he was convicted for violence against women, specifically related to Mike Tyson, steam goes back decades<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-in-1992-tyson-told-me-women-who-put-him-in-jail?utm_term=.xyw16DXgq#.qqDEJxNgo>:

Trump controversially suggested in 1992 Tyson could pay the victim with money from a fight to avoid serving a jail sentence and as reported earlier this week by BuzzFeed News said in the early '90s that Tyson was "railroaded" in his case, and that the victim had willingly entered Tyson's room.

In another instance in late 1992, Trump discussed the case at length in an interview with Charlie Rose. The topic centered around a New York magazine profile in which Trump said his mother was angry at him for defending Tyson. In the piece, Trump said Tyson told him the victim "wanted it real bad."

Donald Trump thinks he can fool us into how presidential he is going to be, and how much he loves women - but the warped and backwards view of violence and rape is who Donald Trump has been for years.

Adding to the offensive rhetoric that has marred his campaign, Now, sexual violence advocates are livid<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rape-china_us_572714c7e4b0b49df6abad17> that Donald Trump has also been saying that China is going to "rape" America, Now, which has offended sexual violence advocates who are livid<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rape-china_us_572714c7e4b0b49df6abad17> over the use of word, and no doubt countless victims.

"When someone like Donald Trump uses a heinous crime like rape as a metaphor, it's an insult to all sexual assault victims and survivors," said DNC CEO Amy Dacey. "This is one more example that today's Republican Party simply doesn't respect women, including the . Republicans like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are showing no respect and dignity for those 300,000 victims<https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/frequency-of-sexual-assault> of sexual violence and rape each year - all the more reason why we can't have a Republican be the 45th president of the United States.."

Preventing violence against women has garnered widespread support among voters, but a majority of Republicans in Congress, including Trump's main competitor, Ted Cruz, still voted against the Violence Against Women Act in 2013. By contrast, Democrats have been committed to preventing violence against women and extending support to survivors.
