Statement by Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to Senator Sanders endo=
rsement of her primary campaign opponent

"I am so proud to serve the people of Florida's 23rd district and I am conf=
ident that they know that I am an effective fighter and advocate on their b=
ehalf in Congress.  Even though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent I =
remain, as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the Presidential Demo=
cratic primary. I look forward to working together with him for Democratic =
victories in the fall."
