Transcript:



*FRANCES RIVERA: *that was hillary clinton speaking to the
national hispanic christian leadership conference. and lobbing some not so
thinly veiled criticism at donald trump. i want to bring in antonio sabato
jr. how early did you know that donald trump was your guy and what drew you
to him?



*ANTONIO SABATO JR:* well, i knew from day one -- and i've been supporting
him for a very long time. i have this coin watch company out of
switzerland. trump, i have your next watch. i will bring it to you. it's a
gold coin watch that you as the next president of the united states should
wear.



*FRANCES RIVERA:* why should he wear it as the next president of the
united states?



*ANTONIO SABATO JR: *one, he doesn't like watches at the moment. i never
see him wearing a watch. but this guy is going to the leader of this
country. he's got to make this country great again. he's been saying the
right things. he's been saying a lot of things that people want to say but
they can't say. and he makes a lot of sense. so i support him.



*FRANCES RIVERA:* you say he's been saying the right things. but he's also
offended a whole lot of people. when you hear that -- and you said you
started supporting him from day one.



*ANTONIO SABATO JR:* i want to know who has he offended.



*FRANCES RIVERA:* we only have 30 minutes lest on this show. -- left on
this show.



*ANTONIO SABATO JR: *who has he offended?



*FRANCES RIVERA:* i cannot even begin to tell you. immigration.



*ANTONIO SABATO JR:* let's talk about immigration.



*FRANCES RIVERA: *it could go on and on and on.



*ANTONIO SABATO JR:* he's got a point in everything. we're talking about
illegal aliens coming in that are illegal. i came here legally from
the united states from italy. i'm legal right now. i'm an american
citizens. everyone's walking over the borders and coming
here illegally. it's an illegal issue.



*FRANCES RIVERA:* you're for the wall?



*ANTONIO SABATO JR: *we need a wall. do you have a wall at your house? i
do. i personally wouldn't want to open it for everyone to come in. there's
nothing there at all. everyone's just walking in. he's talking about
illegal aliens. he's not talking about all of the latinos. he's talking
about people who are coming here and committing a lot of crimes.



*FRANCES RIVERA:* you were in a position. you immigrated too. you may have
famtily outside. some of these families fleeing violence. out of fear, they
want to come here. you're also talking about families who may have to
be broken up who have to be sent back. for somebody who's been here and can
understand the better life this country offers, is there any part of you
that has sympathy for that and their families?



*ANTONIO SABATO JR:* of course there is sympathy. but if you've done
something illegally, you have to go back. we have laws in this country
and we have the best laws this country could possibly have, in the world
actually. there's a lot of people in line waiting so many years trying
to come here legally, what do you do about them?



*FRANCES RIVERA:* you're in nevada right now. a heavilyy lyily hispanic
state. donald trump has major business interests there. when you talk to
people, is there that some of your fans find out you're a trump supporter
and kind of turn on you because of that at all? what are you hearing from
them?



*ANTONIO SABATO JR:* i actually have a lot of support. i have a lot of
spoertupport for people that want donald trump to be the next president. at
the end of the day, i'm goingdoing this because i believe he will be the
next president of the united states and he will be a really good one. i
can't wait to see him in this january at the white house.



*FRANCES RIVERA:* the scenario that his nomination is contested and there's
another candidate, would you accept another candidate?



*ANTONIO SABATO JR:* who's there?



*FRANCES RIVERA:* whoever that may be.



*ANTONIO SABATO JR:* i don't think it's going to be contested. i think
donald trump will be the next runner up and he will go against hillary
clinton and the best is yet to come. he's the only guy.



*FRANCES RIVERA:* if your only guy loses in the general election =E2=80=93



*ANTONIO SABATO JR:* he won't lose. he's our next president. he will be
there in january.



*FRANCES RIVERA:* tell me the number one reason why you are convinced?



*ANTONIO SABATO JR:* i just know it, man. we've been through a lot of crazy
stuff in the last seven years and we need the opposite. donald trump is the
opposite of that. the people want donald trump to be the next president of
the united states. you go to the rallies of hillary and bernie and you see
two people -- no, no, no. bernie sanders, there are thousands and
thousands, people wrapping around blocks. i've seen 30,000 people. hillary
clinton cannot even get half of 30,000 people. that's a lot.
