Good read, particularly this section.

These are small-picture people. Instead of accepting the plain facts that C=
linton won the caucus and out-hustled Sanders at the state convention, they=
 want to talk about arcane rules being imposed, whether chairs were really =
thrown and if anyone should make a fuss out of chalk on walls and sidewalks=
 (even if the messages were hateful).

These are people who think it=92s fine to scream obscenities at a sitting U=
.S. senator, Barbara Boxer, believe it=92s part of their First Amendment ri=
ghts to call a state party chair corrupt and who insist they are cheated ou=
t of something that was never theirs. If this is the Sanders revolution, gi=
ve me the Establishment.

Sanders had a chance Tuesday to apologize to Lange, to concede his supporte=
rs were out of hand, to try to calm his troops stirred up by local troublem=
akers. That would have been leadership.

Ralston Reports: Dems need unity, but they're getting mutiny<http://www.rgj=

yre-getting-mutiny-nevada-democratic-convention-hillary-clinton-bernie-sand=

Jon Ralston

All things considered, I=92d rather not be in Philadelphia.

And by late July, I=92d bet a lot of other Democrats will be saying the sam=
e about the national convention as the ongoing, roiling fratricide in Nevad=
a threatens to be a harbinger of trouble to come in the City of Brotherly L=
ove.

Judging from the intensity of the feelings, and with a minority of Bernie S=
anders supporters unwilling to accept reality, Philadelphia could be the ve=
nue where Donald Trump becomes the favorite to become the next president.

It=92s not so much what will happen on the floor there, even if it mirrors =
the raucous mindlessness and rampant vulgarity we saw Saturday in Las Vegas=
. It=92s what happens afterwards and toward November, if the Berniebots=92 =
revolting threats of physical harm to state Chairwoman Roberta Lange<https:=
//www.ralstonreports.com/blog/sample-voicemails-left-state-democratic-chair=
woman-roberta-lange> and their conspiracy-theorizing and revisionist histor=
y takes hold of a significant number of voters.


In swing states, that is. Like =85 Nevada.

This comes as many Democrats believe they have a dream general election can=
didate to run against, a man who has achieved a miraculous upside-down show=
ing with almost every demographic and who practices the politics of subtrac=
tion better than anyone. With Hillary Clinton planning a replay of Harry Re=
id 2010 =96 I=92m manifestly unpopular, people really don=92t like me and I=
 have so many negatives that it=92s all about YOU =96 Trump is the perfect =
target for a unified Democratic Party. Now about that unity =85

What happened at the Paris Hotel was worse than any New Year;s Eve bacchana=
l on the Las Vegas Strip, but just as uncontrollable: It was a group of del=
egates, stirred up by Sanders operatives, determined that the deck was stac=
ked against them and they were going to be cheated.

The kindling had been lit long before they arrived at that ballroom =96 by =
Sanders and his team. They sued the state party over meaningless and basele=
ss nonsense, quickly thrown out by a judge. And even after Reid persuaded S=
anders to put out a unity statement on the eve of the convention, his suppo=
rters =96 or a core of them =96 didn=92t care. They had one goal in mind: d=
isruption.

The Vermont senator here and elsewhere has tapped into a real anger in the =
grassroots, but he started a wildfire he cannot control. Nor, according to =
a defiant statement<https://berniesanders.com/press-release/statement-nevad=
a/> he put out Tuesday, does he have any intention of doing so.


I won=92t bore you with the minutiae of what happened at the convention =96=
 it was an exaggerated version of the usual meaningless squabbles over rule=
s, bylaws and credentials. The simple story is this: Sanders lost to Clinto=
n by 5 percentage points in the Feb. 20 caucus and has been working to reve=
rse it ever since. He pushed more delegates to the county conventions a few=
 weeks ago but his team was out-organized by Clinton=92s Nevada contingent =
on Saturday.

Team Sanders left almost 500 delegate spots unfilled at the Paris, allowing=
 Clinton to reassert the caucus results. Sanders lost, plain and simple; th=
e rest is white noise (like yelling the loudest for a voice vote) and sour =
grapes (like complaining an election you lost was stolen<http://www.rgj.com=
/story/news/politics/2016/02/20/nevada-democratic-caucuses-whats-happening-=
now-reno-and-vegas/80615512/>).

Yes, Reid controls the state party and the chairwoman. And, yes, Reid wants=
 Clinton to win and did even before he officially endorsed her, all the whi=
le being as fair to Sanders as he could before he helped her in the caucus.

But even Reid did not know how many delegates would show up for either side=
 at the Paris; he and his team knew the Sandersistas planned to destabilize=
 the event and they wanted to try to control it.

Even if the Sanders folks were right on every complaint and won every vote =
they lost =96 and they weren=92t and couldn=92t =96 maybe the senator would=
 have picked up a few delegates. But he didn=92t. He lost.

And the reaction to the vanquishing was akin to the petulant mewling of a b=
aby who had been pampered until the moment he first was told no, wailing wi=
th no purpose other than to be loud, And just like an infant, the Sanders f=
olks wanted it to be all about them.


This is an M.O that comes from the top: We are pure; you are not. You are w=
ith us or you are corrupt Establishment criminals. If you challenge us, we =
will call you names, bully you, threaten you.

This is not all Bernie Sanders supporters. In fact, it=92s a minority; many=
 truly believe in the cause, in income inequality destroying the fabric of =
America, in universal health care being a universal right, in all of it. Fi=
ne.

But there were no great policy debates on the floor of that convention; the=
y weren=92t even debating emails servers or Wall Street transcripts. This w=
as raw fury, nasty enough this weekend in Las Vegas to disrupt a convention=
 in the name of =85 what? What is the endgame here?

Take over a state party that may be the best in America? Stop Hillary Clint=
on from winning the nomination? Make a lot of noise, eat a lot of pizza and=
 look down on everyone?

These are small-picture people. Instead of accepting the plain facts that C=
linton won the caucus and out-hustled Sanders at the state convention, they=
 want to talk about arcane rules being imposed, whether chairs were really =
thrown and if anyone should make a fuss out of chalk on walls and sidewalks=
 (even if the messages were hateful).

These are people who think it=92s fine to scream obscenities at a sitting U=
.S. senator, Barbara Boxer, believe it=92s part of their First Amendment ri=
ghts to call a state party chair corrupt and who insist they are cheated ou=
t of something that was never theirs. If this is the Sanders revolution, gi=
ve me the Establishment.

Sanders had a chance Tuesday to apologize to Lange, to concede his supporte=
rs were out of hand, to try to calm his troops stirred up by local troublem=
akers. That would have been leadership.

Instead, he behaved like a =96 dare I say it? =96 Establishment politician,=
 more concerned about, as another Clinton once said, maintaining his viabil=
ity in the political system. I seriously doubt he can put out the fire he h=
as set.

All things considered, my guess is there won=92t be much brotherly Democrat=
ic love in Philadelphia.
