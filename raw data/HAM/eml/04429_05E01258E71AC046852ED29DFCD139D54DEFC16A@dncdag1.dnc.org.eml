DNC Statement

On December 18, 2015, the Democratic National Committee and Bernie 2016 app=
eared in United States District Court on Bernie 2016's indication that it w=
ould be seeking an injunction in the breach of contract action it filed aga=
inst the DNC earlier that day. The Sanders campaign alleged that the DNC wr=
ongfully terminated its access to the party-administered voter file system,=
 VoteBuilder, following DNC's discovery that Sanders campaign personnel had=
 discovered a flaw in system security and had accessed Clinton campaign pro=
prietary score data.

The parties proceeded in the course of the hearing to settle the immediate =
issue before the Court. The DNC agreed to restore access to VoteBuilder by =
the next day, and the campaign agreed to cooperate in an independent invest=
igation of the data breach.  The Sanders campaign also agreed as part of th=
is investigation to assume a share of the costs of the investigation.

The DNC and the Sanders campaign agreed on the retention of CrowdStrike to =
conduct the investigation. Over a five-week period and the commitment to th=
e work of 128 hours, CrowdStrike examined user activity within VoteBuilder =
by three Democratic Presidential campaigns: Hillary for America, Bernie 201=
6, and O'Malley for President.  Additionally, CrowdStrike conducted a foren=
sic examination of two systems belonging to the Bernie 2016 campaign. The i=
nvestigation sought to first identify whether any campaigns' users accessed=
 data via the VoteBuilder system in an unauthorized fashion and then determ=
ine the nature of any unauthorized access that did occur.

The cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has concluded the independent investigat=
ion agreed to by the DNC and Bernie 2016.  It identified evidence of unauth=
orized access via four user accounts from the Bernie 2016 campaign.  All un=
authorized access occurred during a one-hour period from 10:41 to 11:42 EST=
 on December 16, 2015.

During that time, the four users conducted 25 searches using proprietary Hi=
llary for America score data across 11 states.  All of the results of these=
 searches were saved within the VoteBuilder system, with the exception of o=
ne instance where a user exported a statistical summary of a search using H=
FA scoring in New Hampshire.

CrowdStrike found no evidence of unauthorized access by the Hillary for Ame=
rica or O'Malley for President campaigns.

Today, the Sanders campaign also voluntarily dismissed the breach of contra=
ct action pending against the DNC.
