Excerpts from Congressional Press Call on the GOP Autopsy and Donald Trump =
as the Presumptive Republican Presidential Nominee


WASHINGTON - Today, House Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra, Rep. Judy Chu (Ch=
air of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus), Rep. Andre Carson =
(Vice Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus) and Jason Rae (DNC Youth Cou=
ncil chair) hosted a press call discussing the Republican Party's vitriolic=
 and divisive rhetoric on women and communities of color, as demonstrated b=
y the GOP frontrunner and presumptive nominee Donald Trump.


This week marks the three year anniversary of the Republican National Commi=
ttee's "Growth and Opportunity Project," also known as the GOP Autopsy Repo=
rt, following their 2012 election losses. In an effort to win future electi=
ons, the RNC vowed to be more inclusive and to take steps to show respect f=
or the rights of immigrants, women and minorities. Instead of embracing the=
 Autopsy's recommendations, Republicans continued to spew divisive rhetoric=
 and support damaging policies, all of which have contributed to the rise o=
f Donald Trump.


Here are some excerpts from the press call, as prepared for delivery:


House Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra:


Republicans running for the highest office of the land today are preaching =
anger and bitterness, working to exclude entire communities of Americans fr=
om their 2016 visions.


Senator Ted Cruz has said undocumented immigrants should "absolutely" be de=
ported. He stressed this to a man in Iowa, who questioned his immigration p=
olicy.


Governor John Kasich has mocked granting citizenship to undocumented immigr=
ants and likened it to cutting a line at a concert. He said and I quote, "I=
 don't favor citizenship because, as I teach my kids, you don't jump the li=
ne to get into a Taylor Swift concert."


Donald Trump has claimed that Mexican immigrants are quote "bringing drugs =
and they are bringing crime, they're rapists." And he has called for a "big=
 beautiful wall" that would rip families who have worked hard in our countr=
y for years apart.


Rep. Judy Chu, Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus:


At a campaign rally in Iowa, Donald Trump mocked Asians using a fake, broke=
n-English accent. Both he and Jeb Bush have referred to the children of imm=
igrants as "anchor babies." Carly Fiorina resorted to stereotyping an entir=
e culture for political gain by saying<http://time.com/3897081/carly-fiorin=
a-china-innovation/>, "The Chinese can take a test, but what they can't do =
is innovate. They are not terribly imaginative. They're not entrepreneurial=
."


The autopsy recommended that Republicans get on board with immigration refo=
rm. But instead of immigration reform, Ted Cruz proposed deporting<http://w=
ww.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/22/ted-cruz-says-hed-deport-all-illega=
l-immigrants-us/> all 12 million undocumented immigrants currently in the U=
S (including children and DREAMers) and an end to birthright citizenship. A=
ll of the candidates have said they would get rid of DACA and DAPA.

All of the GOP presidential candidates oppose safe and legal abortion and/o=
r want to defund Planned Parenthood, an organization that a large number of=
 women across the country depend on for essential health services. John Kas=
ich actually defunded Planned Parenthood in his state last month.


Rep. Andre Carson, Vice Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus:


We shouldn't be surprised that Donald Trump's vicious campaign tactics have=
 vaulted him to the top of the Republican primary field. By inciting violen=
ce at his rallies, encouraging the crowd to beat up a Black Lives Matter pr=
otester, and waffling on whether or not to denounce the KKK, Trump knows ex=
actly what he's doing, and it's shameful.


There are certainly no moderates in the GOP field. Senator Cruz once bragge=
d that his first political contribution was to the late Senator Jesse Helms=
, a strident opponent of civil rights legislation. He also led the fight at=
 as Texas Solicitor General to limit voter registration efforts in communit=
ies of color, vigorously defending a discriminatory law against a civil rig=
hts lawsuit.


Governor Kasich relaxed the time limit on food stamps in predominately whit=
e communities while keeping the limits in place for struggling communities =
of color, and he doubled-down on Mitt Romney's offensive comments to the NA=
ACP about African-Americans voting for Democrats because they want - quote =
"free stuff" - end quote.


Jason Rae, (DNC Youth Council chair):


Ted Cruz stands with Kim Davis in discriminating against LGBT Americans and=
 has called the Supreme Court's marriage equality decision "utterly lawless=
", "illegitimate", "contrary to the Constitution", and "among the darkest h=
ours of our nation."


On the court's marriage equality decision, [Donald Trump] has said, "if I'm=
 elected, I would be very strong in putting certain judges on the bench tha=
t I think maybe could change things."


Make no mistake: the party of Trump is still the party of intolerance and d=
iscrimination. And young voters are still rolling their eyes.
