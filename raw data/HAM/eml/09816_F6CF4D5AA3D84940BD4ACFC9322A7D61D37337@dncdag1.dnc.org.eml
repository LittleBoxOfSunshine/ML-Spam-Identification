DONALD TRUMP ROUNDUP

TRUMP DENIED DATING A MODEL, CALLING HER A "F**KING THIRD-RATE HOOKER": "Zd=

ex-girlfriends. He couldn't stop talking about Ivana (his first wife) and M=

and that she looks like shit since she cut her hair off. He just loves to t=
alk about which women are in love with him and always calling him. He loves=
 to talk about how women are chasing him all the time, which doesn't make a=
 girl feel special on a date. The other thing he talks about is what a grea=
t lover he is. He said to me, "Once you made love to me, you'll never be ab=
le to make love to anybody else."'... Trump said that he could not have pos=
sibly gone out with Zdrok because 'she looks like a fucking third-rate hook=

In Contrast With Trump's Claims, Record Setting Republican Turnout Came Fro=
m Already Reliable Republican Voters. "Donald Trump likes to say he has cre=
ated a political movement that has drawn 'millions and millions' of new vot=
ers into the Republican Party. 'It's the biggest thing happening in politic=
s,' Trump has said. 'All over the world, they're talking about it,' he's br=
agged. But a Politico analysis of the early 2016 voting data show that, so =
far, it's just not true. While Trump's insurgent candidacy has spurred reco=
rd-setting Republican primary turnout in state after state, the early stati=
stics show that the vast majority of those voters aren't actually new to vo=
ting or to the Republican Party, but rather they are reliable past voters i=
n general elections. They are only casting ballots in a Republican primary =
for the first time. It is a distinction with profound consequences for the =
fall campaign. If Trump isn't bringing the promised wave of new voters into=
 the GOP, it's far less likely the Manhattan businessman can transform a 20=
16 Electoral College map that begins tilted against the Republican Party. A=
nd whether Trump's voters are truly new is a question of urgent interest bo=
th to GOP operatives and Hillary Clinton and her allies, who have dispatche=
d their top analytics experts to find the answer." [Politico Magazine, 5/17=

New York once, standing in line. We were all shaking hands. That was the on=
ly time I met her. I read that story that I was calling her or something. I=

=B7         Trump Denied Having Any Romantic Interest In Princess Diana Des=

s Diana despite once claiming he could have 'nailed' her. The billionaire h=
as been accused of becoming infatuated with the royal after she split up wi=
th Prince Charles, believing he had a 'shot' at romancing her. He also said=
 she 'was crazy' but he 'could have slept with her' anyway. During the 1990=
s, Trump was a regular guest on controversial DJ Howard Stern's radio show,=
 where the pair would often discuss the attractiveness of women. Audio of o=
ne live radio interview, shock jock Howard Stern asked him 'People think it=
's egotistical of you to say you could've gotten with Lady Di?' He went on:=
 'You could've gotten her, right? You could've nailed her', to which Trump =
replied: 'I think I could have'.  During that conversation, he told Stern h=
e believes he could have slept with her and described her as having 'superm=
odel beauty.' While in a different appearance on the show in 2000 he said s=
he was crazy, but added they were 'minor details' and he still would have s=
lept with her without hesitation. He added: 'She had the height, she had th=
e beauty, she had the skin.' He also said that she had written to him to th=
ank him for a 'favour' - but refused to say what that was.  Today he denied=
 he had any romantic interest in her and denied there was any flirtation or=
 affair." [Daily Mail, 5/17/16<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3594=

Trump Boasted About "The Apprentice" TV Ratings: "It's The Biggest Thing NB=
C Has Had Since "Friends." "While all the above might have a certain ring o=
f familiarity to anyone who has followed the future GOP standard-bearer's T=
witter feed, campaign rallies, and debate performances, Trump was at pains =
to deny, in his phone call with Hayden, that he had even met the woman, let=
 alone dated her. He begged Hayden not to go with the story, but, alas, the=
 real estate and casino mogul-who was starring in NBC's The Apprentice, the=
n in its first season-was less than persuasive. 'Donald Trump wasn't paying=
 my bills,' Hayden told The Daily Beast.... Judging by Trump's liberal use =
of curse words and otherwise coarse misogynistic language in his pleadings =
with Hayden to not publish the interview with Zdrok, he was also-at least b=
y the na=EFve standards of a simpler time-less than presidential. 'I don't =
even know who the hell she is,' Trump insisted to Hayden, after boasting ab=
out the ratings of his reality television show. 'It's the biggest thing [NB=

he took a stand about things. I don't know what his motivation was when the=
 Central Park jogger was killed. He took out an ad in the I think it was th=
e Times--She wasn't killed. She was raped and left for dead. He took out an=
 ad calling for the death penalty. I'm not sure what that was about. Maybe =
he thought that that was a good thing for us to have the death penalty or m=
aybe he took advantage of a PR situation. I can't say. He used to walk arou=

How could he-- I can't believe that he wants to be president. It's beyond m=

decree. There are three branches of government and they work off each other=
 and he's not going to be able to tell Congress, 'I want this law.' You sug=

Conservative Activists Were Studying Party Rules And Speaking With Republic=

"The top ranks of the Republican Party may be coalescing around Donald Trum=

 stop him at the party's convention in July. Angered by Trump's shifting vi=
ews on taxes, the minimum wage, national security and how little he discuss=
es social issues, conservatives across the country are studying the party r=
ule book for last-ditch moves they could make when the convention begins in=
 Cleveland. Veteran Republican campaign operatives familiar with convention=
 planning are offering to educate delegates on how they can act as free age=
nts, even if the Republican National Committee insists that delegates adher=
e to the results of their state primary. Some even talk about convening som=
ewhere other than the convention site... As Unruh suggests, however, there =
is no de facto leader - just lots of ideas floating around websites and con=
servative blogs. The convention rumblings come at the same time that some R=
epublican elites, including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, are sear=
ching for someone to mount a third-party challenge to Trump. Erick Erickson=
, a popular conservative blogger and radio talk show host from Atlanta, war=

 only a frontrunner for one of the most sexist things that he's ever uttere=
d, but also that's ever aired on broadcast television. First, an admission.=
 We missed Sunday night's episode of Celebrity Apprentice: All-Stars, a sho=
w so silly that we normally have a season pass set to watch it, due to DVR =

ackson, Bret Michaels and former Playboy Playmate Brande Roderick were in t=

to the brainless triumvirate of Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump and Piers Morgan=
. Bret explains to his eventual executioners that, at one point, Brande 'go=
t down on her knees and passionately said, 'I want to do this.'' The innuen=
do was too thick for a goon like Donald Trump to let the statement simply s=
lide. 'Excuse me, you DROPPED to your knees?', Trump directs towards Brande=
. 'Yes,' Brande responds. It's at this point that you can see the wheels of=
 Trump's dirty mind turning, verrrrrrry slowly yet very surely. A full six =
seconds, which is an ETERNITY of time in the rapid-paced world of reality t=
elevision editing, expire before Trump responds, 'It must be a pretty pictu=
re. You dropping to your knees.' Um, WHAT?!?! Did he REALLY just verbalize =
his desire to see Brande drop to her knees to give him a BJ, on a show that=
 is not only broadcast on television, but on NETWORK television? A show tha=
t, mind you, is run through a gamut of producers and censors, and one that =
apparently no one had the cajones to step up and say, 'You know, this is a =
bit that's best left on the cutting room floor'? Yes, yes he did." [VH1, 3/=

Trump, In A 2004 Phone Interview With Chaunce Hayden, Denied Having Dated F=

to have met her, and that she was unattractive to date. In a public-spirite=
d exercise in gossip archeology, D-list celebrity interviewer and former 'H=

 2004 interview with Hayden, published in his now-defunct magazine Stepping=
 Out, was less than charitable about her close encounter with the man who w=

 about himself. He loves himself! The first thing he says to me on our date=
 is that he's taller and better looking than what he looks like in pictures=

Former Bush Speechwriter Noam Neusner Said The Republican Party Has Lost Th=
e Opportunity To Win Over Jewish Voters Because "Largely Because Trump Is J=
ust Anathema To Many Jews, Including Jewish Conservatives." "Republicans ha=
d thought that after eight years of rancor between the Obama administration=
 and the Israeli government, 2016 would be the year American Jews began to =
abandon the Democratic Party. But the conservatives who worked for years to=
 win over Jewish voters now say Donald Trump is driving them away. 'Without=
 question, I think there were probably more Jews willing to jump over to th=
e Republican aisle, precisely because of the Iran deal and the Republican P=
arty's staunch opposition to it,' said Noam Neusner, a former speechwriter =
for George W. Bush who also served as a Bush White House Jewish liaison and=
 worked for Jeb Bush. 'But I don't think the opportunity exists anymore, la=
rgely because Trump is just anathema to many Jews, including Jewish conserv=
atives.'" [Politico, 5/16/16<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-t=

Jewish Voters Were Concerned About Trump Because He Was Slow To Condemn His=
 Extremist Supporters Including The Ku Klux Klan. "No one interviewed by PO=
LITICO accused Trump of anti-Semitism, but multiple people pointed to his m=
ost extreme supporters - and his unwillingness, at times, to condemn them -=
 as sources of concern for Jewish voters across the political spectrum. Tru=
mp has also faced criticism for being slow to condemn the Ku Klux Klan. Ask=
ed whether all of that should give Jewish voters pause, Greenblatt replied,=
 'yeah,' noting the anti-Semitic online abuse from self-described Trump sup=
porters that a journalist (who is also a POLITICO magazine writer) faced af=
ter writing a profile of Melania Trump that the candidate's wife criticized=
. Trump refused to condemn the vitriol from those supporters when asked abo=
ut it directly on CNN. 'The kind of anti-Semitic invective they used was so=
 frightening,' Greenblatt said. 'To his credit, Mr. Trump, after we did a s=
tatement, ... he called out anti-Semitism, which was great. We'd like to se=
e him speak out in loud and clear and unambiguous ways against all forms of=
 prejudice with the same level of energy he brings to the campaign trail.' =
Michael Goldfarb, who co-founded the conservative Emergency Committee for I=
srael, said that while Trump's more moderate stances on some domestic issue=
s might appeal to typically liberal Jewish voters, his reluctance to distan=
ce himself from his most bigoted supporters is disqualifying in many Jewish=
 circles. 'He's a squish on the social issues and a squish on the fiscal is=
sues, so he solves some of the problems the party has typically had bringin=
g liberal Jews into the fold,' Goldfarb said. 'On the other hand, his most =
rabid supporters enjoy photoshopping Jewish reporters into concentration ca=
mp scenes and ranting about Jewish control of the media and the banks, so i=
t probably ends up a wash. Trump's energized the anti-Semites and he shows =
no interest in disabusing them of the idea that he's their man. ... Until a=
nd unless he does, he probably underperforms with the Jews.'" [Politico, 5/=

Head Of Zionist Organization Of America: "Trump Has Not Been Consistent In =
His Showing Of Support For Israel." "Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, conver=
ted to Judaism and is raising an observant Jewish family, and her husband, =
Jared Kushner, is also influential in some corners of the Jewish community.=
 And there are signs Trump is interested in doing some Jewish outreach. Fri=
edman plans to help him on that front, and Morton Klein, the head of the Zi=
onist Organization of America, said he had a meeting at Trump Tower last mo=
nth with Jason Greenblatt, a lawyer who works for Trump and whom Trump rece=
ntly said is an adviser on Israel. 'Trump has not been consistent in his sh=
owing of support for Israel, though lately that's begun to change,' Klein s=
aid, noting his confab with Jason Greenblatt, who is also Orthodox, and cal=
ling it a good meeting and a positive step forward. Klein has close ties to=
 Adelson, the Republican megadonor who is perhaps the most prominent Jewish=
 Republican to back Trump. Klein said he shared some details of his Trump T=
ower conversation with donors, though declined to name them. But Trump did =
confirm, to the Adelson-owned paper Israel Hayom, that he is planning to vi=
sit the country 'soon.'" [Politico, 5/16/16<http://www.politico.com/story/2=

Many Republican Jewish Coalition Members And Jewish Republican Donors Plann=
ed To Sit Out The Presidential Race Rather Than Backing Trump. "Some member=
s of the influential Republican Jewish Coalition board, most significantly =
Adelson, have said - with varying degrees of reluctance - that they will su=
pport Trump as the nominee. The organization released a brief statement con=
gratulating Trump, before quickly pivoting to criticizing Hillary Clinton a=
nd adding: 'Along with the Presidential race, the RJC will be working hard =
to hold on to our majorities in the Senate and the House. It is critical th=
at these majorities be preserved.' But plenty of other RJC board members ar=
e planning to stay out of the presidential altogether, focusing instead onl=
y on down-ballot races, and many in the Jewish Republican donor community s=
ee any overtures to them - fellow members of Trump's party - as too little,=
 too late. Paul Singer, a very prominent GOP megadonor who often gives to p=
ro-Israel and Republican causes, has made it clear that he could not back T=
rump or Clinton. Meantime, the prominent Jewish Republican donor interviewe=
d by POLITICO expressed unwillingness to give not just to Trump, but to any=
 Republicans supporting the nominee. 'It causes me to question support of R=
epublicans more broadly, particularly ones willing to fall in line with thi=
s candidate simply because he's the party's candidate,' this source said." =

a more realist view of international affairs, which has long been the baili=

"The New York Times owes Donald Trump and Rowanne Brewer Lane an apology ov=

the piece in interviews Monday morning. The ex-model and former Trump girlf=

story the way she told it but didn't. 'Look, it's a very high bar,' Cohen, =

to end up in litigation. The truth is that The New York Times owes both Ms.=
 Brewer and they owe Donald Trump an apology and they need to do a retracti=

year. A spokesperson for The Times told POLITICO in a statement Monday that=
 'Ms. Brewer Lane was quoted fairly, accurately and at length. The story pr=

After An Interview At Trump Tower With Reporters From The Economist, Trump =
Took The Reporters To The Industrial And Commercial Bank Of China Office In=
 An Attempt To Support His Claim He Would Have A Good Relationship With Chi=
na As President. "To assuage fears that this tough talk on trade might enra=
ge the Chinese, Trump likes to reel off another fact: the Industrial and Co=
mmercial Bank of China (ICBC), a state-owned behemoth, is his tenant in Tru=
mp Tower, the slightly fusty, brass-and-pink-marble temple to 1980s style o=
n Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.  In our conversation last August, Trump raised=
 his landlord-tenant relations with ICBC a bit bashfully, saying that he wa=
s making this point strictly off the record. This May was different. I was =
at the Trump Tower with a colleague from The Economist's Washington bureau,=
 who was writing a cover story about Trump and had secured a meeting. At th=
e end of our 90-minute interview in his office on the 26th floor, Trump ann=
ounced that he wanted his guests to see his Chinese tenants for themselves.=
 Sweeping out of his office, past a counter on which stood scale models of =
his private aircraft, he led the way to a waiting lift, trailed by the hulk=
ing, earpiece-wearing Secret Service agents who now guard him in his capaci=
ty as a presidential candidate. The lift, operated by an attendant in tailc=
oat and striped trousers, stopped at the 18th floor and the doors opened to=
 reveal the ICBC's reception area. 'Oh, guys, maybe you stay in the elevato=
r,' Trump murmured to the agents, solicitously avoiding a federal invasion =
of Chinese property. At first the reception desk was empty, but by chance a=
 Chinese banker wandered in. He stopped, and gaped. 'Hello... Mr Trump,' he=
 managed after some time, then offered brief words of encouragement for the=
 presidential primary in Indiana, which was being held on that day (and whi=
ch was to prove decisive, driving both remaining Republican rivals from the=
 race). 'It's going to be a good night,' Trump assured his tenant, before s=
tating that ICBC loves being in such a beautiful building. After some final=
 smiles and nods of awkwardness, Trump stepped back into the lift. When the=
 doors closed, he offered his take. 'You see,' he beamed. 'All the things I=
 say about China, but when it came time to renew the lease they were happy =
to stay.  It's all about respect,' he concluded, jaw jutting. Despite his i=
ntentions, the moment proved nothing and revealed less about how a Presiden=
t Trump would fare with China's steel-spined leaders. The tycoon-turned-pol=
itician has a habit of making foreign policy sound like a series of commerc=
ial real-estate transactions." [The Economist, 5/16/16<https://www.1843maga=

women was the talk of the morning shows and looked set to dominate the news=
 cycle for days. But by the time the morning shows were over, Trump had mud=
died the narrative. Now the Times, too, was on the defensive. For the umpte=
enth time this campaign cycle, Trump seemingly succeeded in shifting scruti=
ny away from himself and back onto the media. He does so by capitalizing on=
 any uncertainty in the reporting and then aggressively calling attention t=
o it. In this instance, Trump's opening was former girlfriend Rowanne Brewe=
r Lane, who appeared on Fox News and accused the Times of spinning her word=
s. Trump was watching. He went to great lengths to alert others to the inte=

Trump Said Transgender Individuals Should Be Protected Under The Law, But A=
lso Vowed To Rescind The Only Federal Policy Currently Aimed At Providing T=
hese Protections. "Trans people are 'a very, very small portion of the popu=
lation, but as I said, you have to protect everybody, including small porti=
ons of the population,' Trump told the Post. But he added that it should be=
 left to the states, most of which he said would 'make the right decisions.=
' So he would rescind the Obama administration's guidelines telling federal=
ly funded schools to respect the rights of trans people, including their ri=
ght to use a bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. In other word=
s, Trump thinks trans people should be protected by the law, but he wants t=
o take away the only federal policy clearly doing just that in public schoo=
ls. Pressed on this incoherent position, he invoked the old mantra of 'stat=
es' rights.' As a concept, leaving something to the states makes sense if t=
here's something local and state governments can do better than the federal=
 government, or if it would be too burdensome or unwieldy for the federal g=
overnment to get involved. A good example of that: fire departments. There'=
s really no reason to think a federal fire department would be particularly=
 more effective in a big city or county than a local one. (Obviously, some =
exceptions may apply with wildfires and in sparsely populated or low-income=
 areas.) Discrimination in schools is not one of those issues. The history =
and current experience make that very clear." [Vox, 5/17/16<http://www.vox.=

ting Republican Turnout Came From Already Reliable Republican Voters.</b> &=
#8220;Donald Trump likes to say he has created a political movement that ha=
s drawn &#8216;millions and millions&#8217; of new voters
 into the Republican Party. &#8216;It&#8217;s the biggest thing happening i=
n politics,&#8217; Trump has said. &#8216;All over the world, they&#8217;re=
 talking about it,&#8217; he's bragged. But a Politico analysis of the earl=
y 2016 voting data show that, so far, it&#8217;s just not true. While Trump=
&#8217;s
 insurgent candidacy has spurred record-setting Republican primary turnout =
in state after state, the early statistics show that the vast majority of t=
hose voters aren&#8217;t actually new to voting or to the Republican Party,=
 but rather they are reliable past voters
 in general elections. They are only casting ballots in a Republican primar=
y for the first time. It is a distinction with profound consequences for th=
e fall campaign. If Trump isn&#8217;t bringing the promised wave of new vot=
ers into the GOP, it&#8217;s far less likely
 the Manhattan businessman can transform a 2016 Electoral College map that =
begins tilted against the Republican Party. And whether Trump&#8217;s voter=
s are truly new is a question of urgent interest both to GOP operatives and=
 Hillary Clinton and her allies, who have
 dispatched their top analytics experts to find the answer.&#8221; [Politic=

 an admission. We missed Sunday night&#8217;s episode of
 Celebrity Apprentice: All-Stars, a show so silly that we normally have a s=
eason pass set to watch it, due to DVR overload. The scene, which you can w=
atch video of above, was this: LaToya Jackson, Bret Michaels and former Pla=
yboy Playmate Brande Roderick were
 in the boardroom, presenting their arguments as to why they shouldn&#8217;=
t be fired to the brainless triumvirate of Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump and P=
iers Morgan. Bret explains to his eventual executioners that, at one point,=
 Brande &#8216;got down on her knees and passionately
 said, &#8217;I want to do this.'&#8217; The innuendo was too thick for a g=

</b> &#8220;Victoria Zdrok claimed Donald Trump was a narcissist who wore t=

 Playboy Playmate and Penthouse Pet who, in a 2004 interview with Hayden, p=
ublished in his now-defunct magazine Stepping Out, was less than charitable=

 extreme supporters &#8212; and his unwillingness, at times, to condemn the=
m &#8212; as sources of concern for Jewish voters across the political spec=

ist (who is also a POLITICO magazine writer) faced after writing a profile =
of Melania Trump that the candidate&#8217;s wife criticized.
 Trump refused to condemn the vitriol from those supporters when asked abou=

 &#8220;He cracked campaign reporters&#8217; code. And if they don&#8217;t =
want to get rolled again in the general election, journalists
 have to change tactics. Early in this campaign season, Sunday morning netw=
ork news hosts granted Trump the special prerogative of phoning in for inte=
rviews, off camera, making it impossible to know, in real time, if he was c=
onsulting notes or advisers during
 interviews. And because of an early polling lead based in large measure on=
 his near-universal name recognition, Trump was center-stage getting most o=
f the air time during every GOP primary debate. In those debates, and in in=
terviews, Trump regularly runs circles
 around interviewers because they pare their follow-up questions down to a =
minimum, or none at all. After 30-plus years in the media spotlight, he kno=
ws how to wait out an interviewer, offering noncommittal soundbites and inc=
oherent rejoinders until he hears
 the phrase, &#8216;let&#8217;s move on.&#8217; He takes advantage of the s=
lipshod, shallow techniques journalism has made routine, particularly on TV=

From <u>
The Economist</u>, Trump Took The Reporters To The Industrial And Commercia=
l Bank Of China Office In An Attempt To Support His Claim He Would Have A G=
ood Relationship With China As President.</b> &#8220;To assuage fears that =
this tough talk on trade might enrage
 the Chinese, Trump likes to reel off another fact: the Industrial and Comm=
ercial Bank of China (ICBC), a state-owned behemoth, is his tenant in Trump=
 Tower, the slightly fusty, brass-and-pink-marble temple to 1980s style on =
Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.&nbsp; In our
 conversation last August, Trump raised his landlord-tenant relations with =
ICBC a bit bashfully, saying that he was making this point strictly off the=
 record. This May was different. I was at the Trump Tower with a colleague =
from The Economist&#8217;s Washington
 bureau, who was writing a cover story about Trump and had secured a meetin=
g. At the end of our 90-minute interview in his office on the 26th floor, T=
rump announced that he wanted his guests to see his Chinese tenants for the=
mselves. Sweeping out of his office,
 past a counter on which stood scale models of his private aircraft, he led=
 the way to a waiting lift, trailed by the hulking, earpiece-wearing Secret=
 Service agents who now guard him in his capacity as a presidential candida=
te. The lift, operated by an attendant
 in tailcoat and striped trousers, stopped at the 18th floor and the doors =
opened to reveal the ICBC&#8217;s reception area. &#8216;Oh, guys, maybe yo=
u stay in the elevator,&#8217; Trump murmured to the agents, solicitously a=
voiding a federal invasion of Chinese property. At
 first the reception desk was empty, but by chance a Chinese banker wandere=
d in. He stopped, and gaped. &#8216;Hello&#8230; Mr Trump,&#8217; he manage=
d after some time, then offered brief words of encouragement for the presid=
ential primary in Indiana, which was being held on
 that day (and which was to prove decisive, driving both remaining Republic=
an rivals from the race). &#8216;It&#8217;s going to be a good night,&#8217=
; Trump assured his tenant, before stating that ICBC loves being in such a =
beautiful building. After some final smiles and nods
 of awkwardness, Trump stepped back into the lift. When the doors closed, h=
e offered his take. &#8216;You see,&#8217; he beamed. &#8216;All the things=
 I say about China, but when it came time to renew the lease they were happ=
y to stay.&nbsp; It&#8217;s all about respect,&#8217; he concluded,
 jaw jutting. Despite his intentions, the moment proved nothing and reveale=
d less about how a President Trump would fare with China&#8217;s steel-spin=
ed leaders. The tycoon-turned-politician has a habit of making foreign poli=
cy sound like a series of commercial real-estate

 &#8220;Donald Trump woke up Monday staring down the barrel of a terrible n=

ominate the news cycle for days. But by the time the
 morning shows were over, Trump had muddied the narrative. Now the Times, t=
oo, was on the defensive. For the umpteenth time this campaign cycle, Trump=
 seemingly succeeded in shifting scrutiny away from himself and back onto t=
he media. He does so by capitalizing
 on any uncertainty in the reporting and then aggressively calling attentio=
n to it. In this instance, Trump's opening was former girlfriend Rowanne Br=
ewer Lane, who appeared on Fox News and accused the Times of spinning her w=
ords. Trump was watching. He went
 to great lengths to alert others to the interview -- even calling CNN's &#=

 had seen it. As it turned out, they had; the producers had already been ta=

 comments onto the newscast. But for the producers, the call was surreal. P=
residential candidates don't typically call up television control rooms. Bu=
t Trump is known to act like a TV producer (and his own publicist). The &#8=

 call urged him to come on the air for an interview, but he declined. He re=

 but as I said, you have to protect everybody, including small portions of =
the population,&#8217; Trump told the Post. But he added that it should be =
left to the states, most of which he said would &#8216;make the right decis=

 guidelines telling federally funded schools to respect the rights of trans=
 people, including their right to use a bathroom that aligns with their gen=
der identity. In other words, Trump thinks trans people should be protected=
 by the law, but he wants to take
 away the only federal policy clearly doing just that in public schools. Pr=
essed on this incoherent position, he invoked the old mantra of &#8216;stat=
es' rights.&#8217; As a concept, leaving something to the states makes sens=
e if there's something local and state governments
 can do better than the federal government, or if it would be too burdensom=
e or unwieldy for the federal government to get involved. A good example of=
 that: fire departments. There's really no reason to think a federal fire d=
epartment would be particularly
 more effective in a big city or county than a local one. (Obviously, some =
exceptions may apply with wildfires and in sparsely populated or low-income=
 areas.) Discrimination in schools is not one of those issues. The history =

 very clear.&#8221; [Vox, <a href=3D"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/17/11689500/=
