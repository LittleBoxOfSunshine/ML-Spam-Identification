Voting Rights Lose in North Carolina<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/opinion/voting-rights-lose-in-north-carolina.html?ref=topics>

NEW YORK TIMES // EDITORIAL BOARD

Late Monday, a federal district judge upheld<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/us/politics/federal-judge-upholds-north-carolina-voter-id-law.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news> one of the most regressive and restrictive voting laws in the country - a 2013 North Carolina law<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/08/12/north-carolina-governor-signs-extensive-voter-id-law/> that eliminated same-day voter registration and preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds; cut back on early voting by a week; barred counting votes cast outside voters' home precincts; and required voters to show identification at the polls. State lawmakers said these changes were necessary to reduce fraud and inefficiency in elections - though there is no evidence of voter fraud to combat or inefficiency to cure. The Justice Department, the American Civil Liberties Union, the N.A.A.C.P. and the Advancement Project, among others, sued on the grounds that the law illegally discriminates against minority voters.



Restoring sanity to the debate over transgender bathroom use<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/restoring-sanity-to-the-debate-over-transgender-bathroom-use/2016/04/26/5e646bc6-0807-11e6-a12f-ea5aed7958dc_story.html>

WASHINGTON POST // EDITORIAL BOARD

"I DIDN'T ask to be this way. All I want to do is be a normal child and use the restroom in peace." That's what 16-year-old Grimm told<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/opinion/for-transgender-americans-legal-battles-over-restrooms.html?_r=0>the Gloucester County (Va.) School Board last year as it debated whether to bar the transgender student from using the boys' restrooms. His appeal for personal dignity didn't seem to matter. Nor did the fact that he had been using the boys' bathrooms without incident until some adults in the community got riled up about the issue. So a federal appellate ruling<https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/federal-appeals-court-sides-with-trangender-teen-says-bathroom-case-can-go-forward/2016/04/19/6a873b88-f76b-11e5-9804-537defcc3cf6_story.html> in his favor was a welcome development that will help to advance protections for the rights of transgender people.
