Thanks. Trying to see if can make that timing work. What is the difference between cohost and guest levels?

Jonathan,

I hope you are well. I want to personally invite you to our upcoming event with President Obama  on the evening of June 8th. We will be advertising this event more publicly in the coming days, but I wanted to make sure you were among the first to know. Ken Lerer and Katherine Sailer are hosting what promises to be an intimate evening with remarks from the President and the chance to ask any questions you may have. We are expecting no more than 60 guests and each person will have the opportunity for a photo with the President.

We'd love to see you there if you are available. I've included the invitation for your reference and you can RSVP here<https://finance.democrats.org/page/contribute/NYDinnerJun8>. Please let me know if you have any questions about the event. I hope we'll see you in June!

Best,
Dan
