Trump on Hannity at 10pm

(2 parts)
(Eric Trump on with Donald Trump in part 2)

Part 1

Cruz/Kasich alliance?
- "Well, it=92s collusion. In business you go to jail for that. But it's co=
llusion=94
- Kasich is doing terribly. 1 for 42.
- Beating them both by millions of votes

If mathematically impossible to win, should a candidate get out?
- They are doing worse than some other people who gotout
- Carson did a lot better. He was really tough.
- 90% of the people are against Kasich. 82% are against Cruz

Pennsylvania voting system?
- It's done so the bosses can pick people
- Fortunately in PA, you have a great head of the party, so it will be fair
- In PA, they have a moral obligation for the delegates to support whoever =
has the popular vote

You fall short of 1,237 and it goes to the contested convention and you get=
 denied. What happens?
- The millions of people that voted for me are not going to be happy
- It's going to be disasterous
- How can we go to the 2nd ballot when I'm ahead by millions of votes

GW poll showing you within margin error of Clinton?
- I think I will do great against Hillary
- I haven't focused on Hillary yet, except for 3 months ago
- She can't be the nominee. She can't escape the email situation
- Kasich will drop like a rock when he faces negative ads

Big endorsement in Indiana?
- I have a lot of respect for Gov. Pence, but I think he will remain neutra=
l
- Bobby Knight is the gold standard

Part 2

Cruz/Kasich alliance?
- Eric says he doesn't see it as a positive for the others
- Eric agrees that the party is coordinating against Donald Trump

Illegal Immigration at a record rate. Opening up routes for ISIS through Me=
xico?
- If I didn't bring up illegal immigration, nobody would be talking about i=
t
- Obama is grossly incompetent. He wants this to happen, and nobody knows w=
hy. Perhaps he knows why
- Border patrol endorsed me. I'm not sure they're even supposed to do that

20% of families don't have a single family member with a job. Are we being =
lied to (on unemployment numbers)?
- Real number is probably closer to 20%
- I can stop jobs from leaving the country

206,000 felons being allowed to vote in VA?
- VA is a very close state
- When you allow 200,000 serious criminals who will vote Democrat, it will =
throw off the balance

At the end of process, will party come together?
- Eric: He did that in business and he will do it as president
- Donald: I have no doubt about it
- Donald: Cruz and Kasich combined have far fewer votes. They have failed a=
s candidates
