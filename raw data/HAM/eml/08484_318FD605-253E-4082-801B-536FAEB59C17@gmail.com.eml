Bernie Sanders faces a =E2=80=98then what=E2=80=99 problem
05/19/16 08:53 AM=E2=80=94UPDATED 05/19/16 08:55 AM

By Steve Benen
It=E2=80=99s safe to say May hasn=E2=80=99t gone quite as well as Bernie San=
ders and his supporters had hoped. He needed landslide victories in several p=
rimaries, and he came up short. After steadily gaining on Hillary Clinton in=
 national Democratic polls for months, the senator has seen his support slip=
 in recent weeks. In Nevada, Sanders=E2=80=99 supporters caused a near-riot a=
t the state Democratic convention, based on allegations of party wrongdoing t=
hat have struggled to withstand scrutiny.
=20
Sanders=E2=80=99 candidacy has had some highs and some lows, but all things c=
onsidered, this hasn=E2=80=99t exactly been a month to remember. For his leg=
ions of supporters, it=E2=80=99s no doubt discouraging.
=20
The race for the Democratic nomination, however, still has about a month to g=
o, and the New York Times reports that Team Sanders isn=E2=80=99t backing do=
wn, delegate arithmetic notwithstanding.
Defiant and determined to transform the Democratic Party, Senator Bernie San=
ders is opening a two-month phase of his presidential campaign aimed at infl=
icting a heavy blow on Hillary Clinton in California and amassing enough lev=
erage to advance his agenda at the convention in July =E2=80=93 or even wres=
t the nomination from her.
It=E2=80=99s at this point when Sanders and campaign operation start to run i=
nto a =E2=80=9Cthen what?=E2=80=9D problem.
=20
According to the Times=E2=80=99 piece, for example, Team Sanders believes it=
 may yet win the California primary, where polls show him trailing, which mi=
ght have =E2=80=9Ca psychological impact=E2=80=9D on Democrats. OK, but then=
 what? If the idea is that Democratic insiders will ignore the will of the v=
oters and the delegate count because of one primary result, awarding Sanders=
 the nomination despite his second-place finish, there=E2=80=99s no reason t=
o believe such a scenario is plausible.
=20
The same article said Team Sanders is willing to hurt Clinton, on purpose, e=
ven as the general-election phase gets underway. OK, but then what? There=E2=
=80=99s still no reason to believe this will prompt party officials to overr=
ide the primary and caucus results.
=20
A Sanders supporter told the Times, =E2=80=9CWe want to have progressive val=
ues and socialism on the convention=E2=80=99s agenda.=E2=80=9D OK, but then w=
hat? It=E2=80=99s not clear how, exactly, one puts =E2=80=9Csocialism=E2=80=9D=
 on the =E2=80=9Cagenda,=E2=80=9D but even if that were possible, what happe=
ns afterwards?
=20
Tad Devine, a top Sanders strategist, told the Washington Post=E2=80=99s Gre=
g Sargent yesterday that the Sanders campaign may ask for some changes among=
 convention committee assignments. OK, but then what? What are the practical=
 effects of changing which Democrats sit on which convention committees, and=
 why should a second-place candidate dictate convention committees=E2=80=99 m=
embership?
=20
There are rumors about Sanders supporters preparing for civil disobedience a=
nd organized disruptions at the Democratic convention itself. OK, but then w=
hat? History has shown that convention protests, even intra-party protests, c=
an lead to meaningful change, but even if progressive activists literally st=
arted fires on the convention floor, in a display of violent catharsis, how d=
oes that bring Sanders and his allies any closer to their goals?
=20
The Times article added this key paragraph:
[Sanders=E2=80=99] newly resolute attitude is also the cumulative result of m=
onths of anger at the national Democratic Party over a debate schedule that h=
is campaign said favored Mrs. Clinton; a fund-raising arrangement between th=
e party and the Clinton campaign; the appointment of fierce Clinton partisan=
s as leaders of important convention committees; and the party=E2=80=99s reb=
uke of Mr. Sanders on Tuesday for not clearly condemning a melee at the Neva=
da Democratic convention on Saturday.
It=E2=80=99s worth noting, however, that the national Democratic Party agree=
d to expand the debate schedule, and it offered Sanders literally the identi=
cal fundraising arrangement it struck with the Clinton campaign. Democratic o=
fficials also worked to make sure Sanders appeared on the New Hampshire and D=
.C. primary ballots, even after procedural and legal questions arose surroun=
ding his eligibility =E2=80=93 steps the DNC wouldn=E2=80=99t have taken if i=
t were trying to rig the process against him.
=20
There=E2=80=99s still time to avoid scenarios that could prove costly in the=
 fall, but not a lot of time. Sanders believes, accurately, that he has some=
 leverage: if he=E2=80=99s not satisfied with how the process unfolds in the=
 coming weeks, the senator can sabotage the party=E2=80=99s ticket and elect=
 President Trump. What=E2=80=99s less clear is what he=E2=80=99ll demand in e=
xchange for his supp
