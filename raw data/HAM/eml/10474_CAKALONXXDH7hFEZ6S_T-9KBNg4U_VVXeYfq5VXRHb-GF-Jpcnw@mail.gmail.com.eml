Hi Luis and Mark,

Ryan Banfill referred me to you both for a story I'm working on regarding
DNC matters. If you want to respond to my questions above, that would be
greatly appreciated. Wanted to make sure I reach out to you guys about the
story and get your perspective about how the party can unite after the
recent fallout from the Nevada convention, the back-and-forth with the
Sanders campaign and also the calls for the chairwoman to step down from
her post. Feel free to send something along, thanks!

Best,
Lisa Hagen
