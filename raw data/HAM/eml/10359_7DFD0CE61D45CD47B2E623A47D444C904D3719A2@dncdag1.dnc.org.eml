Bernie Sanders

Concerns that you are damaging Clinton's chances?
- We disagree on many legitimate issues
- Minimum wage, war in Iraq, etc.
- Not all of my supporters go to these fancy fundraisers
- Democratic leadership needs to open up the process to bring these people =
in

Your comments about pledged vs super delegates?
- "absurd" that I have 46% of pledged delegates, but only 7% of super deleg=
ates
- Bad for the process that most super delegates backed HRC before anyone el=
se entered race

Has coverage of you been as critical as of Trump and Clinton?
- Just look at the TV ads run against me in 2006
- "Good chance" HRC can beat Trump
- But I am a stronger general election candidate because of appeal to indep=
endents

Should candidate with most pledged delegates at end of process be the nomin=
ee?
- I am good at arithmetic
- We will try to get most pledged delegates. California is the big one
- Super delegates should take an objective look at who is strongest for gen=
eral. We have the energy, young people

Asks again, should candidate with most pledged delegates at end of process =
be the Democratic nominee?
- Not a fan of super delegates, but their job is to take a strong look
- Maybe we should get rid of super delegates going forward
- Super delegates supported Clinton before other candidates entered. That's=
 called an anointment

Should the party do away with super delegates?
- Should take a serious look
- Current process is undemocratic
- Need serious change, to what extent, I don't know
- Democratic platform needs to address income inequality, corporate greed

Your campaign's accusations that DWS not neutral. Who are you supporting in=
 her
- "Clearly I favor her opponent. His views are a lot closer to mine"
- If elected president, DWS would not be reappointed to chair the DNC
