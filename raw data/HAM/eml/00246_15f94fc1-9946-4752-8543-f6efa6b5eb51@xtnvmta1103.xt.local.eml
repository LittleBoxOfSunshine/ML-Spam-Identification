GLENN THRUSH, "5 takeaways from the night that made Trump nominee": "Trump has a stranglehold on about half of the 25 percent to 30 percent of (white) Americans who vote in Republican primaries. The rest of the nation, well, he's still pissing lots of them off - and the smarter political types in his orbit fret about his unprecedentedly high disapproval ratings. His longtime war consigliore Roger Stone likens Trump to Ronald Reagan ...

"The Clintons are terrified about Trump - who conspicuously lunched with their fact-challenged-biographer Ed Klein to preview the knee-capping he intends to deliver this fall. But his capacity to savage himself shouldn't be underestimated." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=df5c9d4a6aa13c478a0cdf3bce0de2d83b2f6dbe8dae9549868601cd13420af1

--"As Trump wins, Clinton exploring how to win over Republicans," by AP's Lisa Lerer and Catherine Lucey: "Democrats caution their effort to win over Clinton Republicans - or Hilla-cans, perhaps - is in its earliest stages, but could grow to include ads and other outreach targeted in particular at suburban women in battleground states. Already ... a number of Republicans have privately told Clinton and her team they plan to break party ranks and support her." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=df5c9d4a6aa13c47f2351288dde610ff0c4463cfc4d97f3ae6c727570352ea33

 

BEING THERE -- "Trump's moment of triumph," by Ben Schreckinger in Manhattan: Last night "brought a flood of emotion to senior campaign staff - Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski, Deputy Campaign Manager Michael Glassner, Social Media Director Dan Scavino and adviser Stephen Miller - who huddled in the front of the podium to watch Cruz concede on a television set up on the side of the press pen and warmly embraced in the minutes between the Texas senator's remarks and their boss's.

 

"No stranger to reveling in his successes, Trump used his victory speech to make amends with party leaders he has more often mocked and threatened. 'All my life, I've been in competitions, different competitions, whether its sports or business,' he said. 'I have to tell you that I have met some of the most incredible competitors that I've ever competed against right here in the Republican Party.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=df5c9d4a6aa13c47d759af8c31692b25cad194c7962a7b06c966d2929a81b703

 

TICK-TOCK - "Inside Cruz's Crumbling Campaign: He sold himself as trustworthy. Rivals made sure voters didn't buy it," by Katie Glueck and Shane Goldmacher: "After constructing his campaign around a conservative base and religious right ... the race in April turned to the more secular northeast. Cruz would lose not just the next six states but every county in them. ... [A]s the 2016 field narrowed, it was the 'Lyin' Ted' label that increasing stuck to Cruz, just as Trump's 'low energy' moniker clung mercilessly to Bush. And it deeply irked Cruz, a detail-oriented lawyer who parses his words as closely as any politician." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=df5c9d4a6aa13c47c7f96582c126994d2683ddceefe1888aeb924c5fa50331ca

... Neil King (@NKingofDC): "Carly Fiorina has done what few have done before, which is to lose twice in the same election" ... Tim Miller (@Timodc): "I have a lot more respect for people who have come around to the truth about Trump than those who have begun to rationalize why he's swell" ... @MarkSalter55: "the GOP is going to nominate for President a guy who reads the National Enquirer and thinks it's on the level. I'm with her" ... Charlie Mahtesian (@PoliticoCharlie): "In about a decade's time, Indiana went from a state that elected Dick Lugar & Evan Bayh to one that preferred Donald Trump & Bernie Sanders."

Over the last two weeks, Clinton has been quietly accelerating her swing-state operation, organizing what amounts to a shadow general election campaign at the same time she is fending off a rival who insists he'll continue to fight until the Democratic convention in July."http://politi.co/26Sik0q

 

UNDERSTANDING TRUMP -- NATE SILVER, "The Mythology Of Trump's 'Working Class' Support": "It's been extremely common for news accounts to portray Donald Trump's candidacy as a 'working-class' rebellion against Republican elites. ... As compared with most Americans, Trump's voters are better off. The median household income of a Trump voter so far in the primaries is about $72,000, based on estimates derived from exit polls and Census Bureau data. That's lower than the $91,000 median for Kasich voters.

"But it's well above the national median household income of about $56,000. It's also higher than the median income for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters, which is around $61,000 for both." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=df5c9d4a6aa13c47dcc251a881d9a64f6f464d2261424837f4cfa7f1b0447f75

 

MYRA ADAMS in National Review, "A Trump-Gingrich Ticket: Brilliant or Crazy?": "Over the last three months, Trump watchers have noticed that ... Newt Gingrich has been consistently advocating on Trump's behalf in the media, on Capitol Hill, among K Street power brokers, and on social media. In fact, Gingrich has morphed into Trump's unofficial ambassador for GOP peace and unity, while also seeking converts in hostile territory. Gingrich is the most recognized and respected member of the GOP establishment who is defending the insurgent candidate ... [I]t has become apparent that Gingrich is waging an active campaign to become Donald Trump's running mate."

As iTunes sales stagnate and rival Spotify continues to draw in new subscribers, Apple is attempting to reclaim its dominance in music. ...

But there's no denying that Broadway burns brighter - and more multihued - because of Lin-Manuel Miranda's groundbreaking musical.

"As these Tony nominations attest, 'Hamilton' has ushered in a new age of multiculturalism on Broadway ... History has arrived, laggard as usual but unmistakable. ... 'Shuffle Along, or the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed,' adapter-director George C. Wolfe's snazzy update of the trailblazing 1921 African American blockbuster that seduced Broadway with syncopation, racked up an impressive 10 nominations." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=df5c9d4a6aa13c47507aaf5777792b80a0fa8009ae1f577b2289916211463404

PLAYBOOK METRO SECTION -- "DC celebrates another year of record-breaking tourist crowds," by AP's Ben Nuckols: "More than 19 million U.S. tourists visited Washington in 2015, an increase of 1 million over the previous year and a record for the nation's capital." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=df5c9d4a6aa13c47e7cde73c02e0e439fc915fe00c0aa22e934e172a57f8d2c6

OUT AND ABOUT IN S.F.: "Brigade just christened our new SF HQ with a breakfast roundtable with members of the House New Dems and local startup execs.

FIRST LOOK -- LEWIS BLACK will be host ("Roastmaster") of the roast of James Carville on June 23 at the Kennedy Center. Paul Begala, Tucker Carlson, Mary Matalin, Luke Russert, Rev. Al Sharpton, and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, will also help roast Carville, with video appearances by Bill Maher and Karl Rove. Carville will also have the chance to respond and get the last laugh. Black, who's planning to re-watch "The War Room" as he prepares for the roast, told Daniel that he got connected to the event because he's long known a Carville/Matalin friend, Victoria Clarke, because he used to go out with her sister.

--About Carville's marriage with Mary Matalin: "I think it's certainly a tribute to [the fact] that love triumphs over all. It's like a Shakespeare play."

--About how Larry Wilmore did on Saturday night: "It doesn't matter what Larry did. It doesn't matter what Stephen Colbert did. What matters is the two most miserable places to perform as a comic are the Congressional correspondents' dinner and the White House Correspondents' dinner. It's nothing but a thankless task and you can't say no. ... And then what is profoundly beyond my comprehension, and I have to say sickens me, ... is to watch people sit there who have no clue as to what comedy is and comment on a person's comedy.

"It's disgusting. They analyze it. It's beyond belief. ... It's not a fun room to play. Playing in front of people who live in Washington, that whole group of insiders, is intolerable because of the arrogance they bring when you're doing your comedy in that room. ... I'm not going to judge Larry on it. He doesn't deserve to be judged on it. They should thank him for showing up. ... They should thank any comic who f***ing shows up. It enrages me."

 

--About Obama's performance: "It was very good. ... If he wants to be a comic, I'll quit being the headliner and I'll open for him."

--About 2016: "The election cycle ... began in 1942 apparently. ... My job as a comic is to be more insane than what I'm seeing and this time they're really testing me."
