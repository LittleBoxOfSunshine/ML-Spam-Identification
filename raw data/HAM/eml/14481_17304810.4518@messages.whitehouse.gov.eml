THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Vice President



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 14, 2016



*Remarks of Dr. Jill Biden at Northern Virginia Community College Commenc=
ement Ceremony as Prepared for Delivery*



Jiffy Lube Live

Bristow, Virginia



Hello, NOVA!



This is a special night for me. This will be my final commencement addres=
s as Second Lady, and what an honor to do it at the college that means th=
e most to me. Thank you to President Ralls and the Board of Trustees.



Congratulations, graduates, you did it! On behalf of President Obama, the=
 First Lady and the Vice President, my husband Joe  we are all so proud o=
f you. Graduating from college is an extraordinary achievement. Cherish t=
his moment. Yes, its an individual accomplishment. But, its also a team e=
ffort. So, lets thank your teachers, your friends and your families.



You never know where life will take you. I grew up in Philly. After I mar=
ried Joe, I lived in Delaware for most of my life. I raised our children =
and taught full-time at another community college. Then, in 2008, Joe was=
 asked to be President Obamas running mate. And when we won, everything c=
hanged.



I started receiving emails from someone at NOVA. He would write, Jill, yo=
u have to keep teaching. Please consider us. We know you would love it he=
re! Well, Dean Jimmy McClellan, thank you for all those emails. Thank you=
 for your encouragement, and for all of your support during the last 8 ye=
ars. Truly, I wouldnt be here tonight without you.



When I took Jimmy up on his offer to visit the Alexandria campus, I immed=
iately fell in love. It felt like home. Joe and I had just moved into the=
 Vice Presidents Residence at the Naval Observatory in DC. And I was give=
n a new office in the White House. It has marble floors and columns, a fi=
replace, and large windows that over-look the National Mall.=20



Then of course, I have my cubicle at NOVA. But, like all the other teache=
rs, my cubicle is filled with family photos, crayon drawings from my gran=
dchildren, notes from my students. Its a place that feels most like me.



Its been an honor to serve our country but I knew at the time that if I w=
anted to stay true to myself, I had to keep teaching. Because teaching is=
 not just what I do; its who I am.=20



All of the teachers here today understand that. We take this responsibili=
ty home with us every single night. Teaching doesnt end when you walk out=
 of the classroom. Were invested in you  our students and your future. We=
 cajole. We counsel. We mentor. We do whatever it takes to make that conn=
ection with our students; to give them the confidence they need to succee=
d in school and beyond.



As a lifelong educator, I couldnt leave that behind. I couldnt just move =
to Washington and only live Joes life. So, ever since then, Ive pretty mu=
ch been living a double life.



One moment, Im taping a live interview at 7:15 AM in the Blue Room at the=
 White House for the TODAY Show talking about President Obamas State of t=
he Union address and his continued support of community colleges. And the=
n the next moment, at 8:00 AM, Im in class at NOVA teaching English Comp =
111.



Many of my students dont know I have two jobs. For example, at the end of=
 one semester, about a year ago, a student of mine came running into my c=
lassroom and said, Dr. B I saw you on the television last night with Firs=
t Lady Michelle Obama. My student said to her mother, Mom! Mom! Thats my =
English teacher! And her mother said, Thats not your teacher, thats the S=
econd Lady. They may not know that Im married to the Vice President, but =
my students know that my first priority is to them.



And Ive loved being part of this Administration. Ive tried to use my posi=
tion to make a difference for military families, for women and girls arou=
nd the world, and for teachers and community colleges and their students.=




As a community college educator, I feel like I was in the right place at =
the right. The Obama-Biden administration has lifted up community college=
s, recognizes their value and the importance of investing in them. Its be=
en the opportunity of a lifetime. Its been an incredible journey.



But when Im at NOVA, Im home. Im one of you. A member of the faculty. You=
r English teacher. Im part of the NOVA community. And Ive learned as much=
 from my students  from all of you  as I have from traveling around the w=
orld. So, youre probably thinking, as Second Lady shes met famous people =
like the Queen, stayed in exotic palaces and dined with world leaders.=20=




But every step of the way, Ive been inspired by the strength and courage =
of ordinary people across our country doing extraordinary things  just li=
ke you, the students at NOVA. What you are doing is emblematic of America=
s very best traditions  hard work, self-improvement, asking for only one =
thing: opportunity.



Just as America has progressed over the years, so too has NOVA. This is N=
OVAs 50th anniversary. The first class to graduate from NOVA had 82 stude=
nts. Ten were women. And they received degrees in eight different fields.=
 Tonight, over 7,600 students will receive their college diploma. Fifty f=
ive percent are women. You have earned degrees in 60 fields of study. And=
 half of you will transfer to a four-year college within a year.



When I started teaching 30 years ago, community college students were typ=
ically seen as non-traditional. But today, with more than half of our nat=
ions college students attending community colleges, with so many of you w=
orking full time, supporting families, and still attending school, non-tr=
aditional has become the new traditional.



You are single parents who come to school in the evening, weary from a lo=
ng day, yet eager to create a brighter future for your children. You are =
workers, who have gone as far as you can in your jobs, coming back to sch=
ool to get the skills you need to reach the next level. And, several of t=
onights graduates are veterans.=20



As a military mom, I am always inspired by the strength, resilience and p=
ride of our veterans. I know you have the skills, discipline and leadersh=
ip to succeed in anything you put your mind to. You are among the best ou=
r nation has to offer. Thank you, to all of the veteran graduates here to=
night, for your service to our country.



Now, most commencement speakers give graduates advice on what to expect w=
hen they graduate and enter the real world. But most of you already live =
in the real world. The average age of a community college student is 28 y=
ears old. And one of my students was 83. Regardless of circumstances, you=
 show up. You work hard. And, I am profoundly moved by your determination=
 to learn, and by your quest to make a better life for yourselves.



So, as I was thinking about what to say to all of you tonight, rather tha=
n give you advice on how to succeed in life, I gave myself an assignment.=
 Every semester in my class, I assign an essay to my students using the t=
itle, This I Believe. I first heard about it on National Public Radio. I =
ask them to tell me their core beliefs. Something they would be willing t=
o stand up for; to speak for; to fight for.



Tonight, Id like to share with you my own essay about what I believe.



This I believe: I have long said that community colleges are Americas bes=
t kept secret, but I believe its time for that to change. I believe we ne=
ed to celebrate community colleges  and their students  for who they real=
ly are: innovative, inspiring and essential. Not just celebrate, but supp=
ort.



But this, too, I believe: Too many hardworking Americans still have to wo=
rry about whether college is affordable. For millions of people across th=
e country, community college is the single best path to opportunity  to a=
chieving their dreams  whether that means earning a four-year degree or f=
inding a rewarding career.

This I believe: The more than 1,100 community colleges nationwide are not=
 just the key to a brighter future for their students, they are the backb=
one of Americas postsecondary education and training system  and one of t=
he keys to a more prosperous economic future. Thats why I also believe  a=
s does President Obama  that community college should be free for all res=
ponsible students.



This I believe: With the education that you have received here at NOVA, t=
here is literally no limit to how high you can go. Community college grad=
uates have gone on to become successful CEOs, journalists, Hollywood dire=
ctors, even astronauts.



Finally, this I believe: a community college education can truly change p=
eoples lives. And community college graduates  including every single one=
 of you  can change the world.



I believe in you. Always believe in yourselves.



Congratulations, graduates!

&nbsp; On behalf of President Obama, the First Lady and the Vice President,=
 my husband Joe &#8212; we are all so proud of you.&nbsp; Graduating from
 college is an extraordinary achievement.&nbsp; Cherish this moment.&nbsp; =
Yes, it&#8217;s an individual accomplishment.&nbsp; But, it&#8217;s also a =

.&nbsp; I grew up in Philly.&nbsp; After I married Joe, I lived in Delaware=
 for most of my life.&nbsp; I raised our children and taught full-time
 at another community college.&nbsp; Then, in 2008, Joe was asked to be Pre=
sident Obama&#8217;s running mate.&nbsp; And when we won, everything change=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=

 at NOVA.&nbsp; He would write, &#8220;Jill, you have to keep teaching. Ple=
ase consider us. We know you would love it here!&#8221;&nbsp; Well, Dean Ji=
mmy

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=

sit the Alexandria campus, I immediately fell in love.&nbsp; It felt like h=
ome.&nbsp; Joe and I had just moved into the Vice President&#8217;s Residen=

&nbsp; Teaching doesn&#8217;t end when you walk out of the classroom.&nbsp;=
 We&#8217;re
 invested in you &#8212; our students and your future.&nbsp; We cajole.&nbs=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">As a lifelong educator, I couldn&#8217;=
t leave that behind.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t just move to Washington and onl=
y live Joe&#8217;s life.&nbsp; So, ever since then, I&#8217;ve pretty much =
been living a double

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">One moment, I&#8217;m taping a live int=
erview at 7:15 AM in the Blue Room at the White House for the TODAY Show ta=
lking about President Obama&#8217;s State of the Union address and his
 continued support of community colleges. &nbsp;And then the next moment, a=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Many of my students don&#8217;t know I =
have two jobs.&nbsp; For example, at the end of one semester, about a year =
ago, a student of mine came running into my classroom and said, &#8220;Dr.
 B I saw you on the television last night with First Lady Michelle Obama.&#=
8221; &nbsp;My student said to her mother, &#8220;Mom! Mom!&nbsp; That&#821=
7;s my English teacher!&#8221; &nbsp;And her mother said, &#8220;That&#8217=
;s not your teacher, that&#8217;s the Second Lady.&#8221; &nbsp;They may no=
t know that I&#8217;m married to
 the Vice President, but my students know that my first priority is to them=
.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">And I&#8217;ve loved being part of this=
 Administration.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve tried to use my position to make a differ=
ence for military families, for women and girls around the world, and for
 teachers and community colleges and their students.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">As a community college educator, I feel=
 like I was in the right place at the right.&nbsp; The Obama-Biden administ=
ration has lifted up community colleges, recognizes their value
 and the importance of investing in them.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been the opportu=
nity of a lifetime.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been an incredible journey.<o:p></o:p>=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=

English teacher.&nbsp; I&#8217;m part of the NOVA community. &nbsp;And I&#8=
217;ve learned as much from my students
 &#8212; from all of you &#8212; as I have from traveling around the world.=
 &nbsp;So, you&#8217;re probably thinking, as Second Lady she&#8217;s met f=
amous people like the Queen, stayed in exotic palaces and dined with world =
leaders.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=

een inspired by the strength and courage of ordinary people across our coun=
try doing extraordinary things &#8212; just like you, the students at
 NOVA.&nbsp; What you are doing is emblematic of America&#8217;s very best =
traditions &#8212; hard work, self-improvement, asking for only one thing: =
opportunity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Just as America has progressed over the=
 years, so too has NOVA.&nbsp; This is NOVA&#8217;s 50th anniversary. &nbsp=
;The first class to graduate from NOVA had 82 students.&nbsp; Ten were wome=
n.&nbsp;
 And they received degrees in eight different fields.&nbsp; Tonight, over 7=
,600 students will receive their college diploma.&nbsp; Fifty five percent =
are women.&nbsp; You have earned degrees in 60 fields of study.&nbsp; And h=
alf of you will transfer to a four-year college within
 a year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">When I started teaching 30 years ago, c=
ommunity college students were typically seen as &#8220;non-traditional.&#8=
221;&nbsp; But today, with more than half of our nation&#8217;s college stu=
dents
 attending community colleges, with so many of you working full time, suppo=
rting families, and still attending school, non-traditional has become the =
new traditional.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=

ol in the evening, weary from a long day, yet eager to create a brighter fu=
ture for your children.&nbsp; You are workers, who have gone
 as far as you can in your jobs, coming back to school to get the skills yo=
u need to reach the next level.&nbsp; And, several of tonight&#8217;s gradu=
ates are veterans.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">As a military mom, I am always inspired=
 by the strength, resilience and pride of our veterans.&nbsp; I know you ha=
ve the skills, discipline and leadership to succeed in anything
 you put your mind to.&nbsp; You are among the best our nation has to offer=
.&nbsp; Thank you, to all of the veteran graduates here tonight, for your s=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Now, most commencement speakers give gr=
aduates advice on what to expect when they graduate and enter the real worl=
d.&nbsp; But most of you already live in the real world.&nbsp; The
 average age of a community college student is 28 years old.&nbsp; And one =
of my students was 83.&nbsp; Regardless of circumstances, you show up.&nbsp=
; You work hard.&nbsp; And, I am profoundly moved by your determination to =
learn, and by your quest to make a better life for yourselves.<o:p></o:p></=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">So, as I was thinking about what to say=
 to all of you tonight, rather than give you advice on how to succeed in li=
fe, I gave myself an assignment.&nbsp; Every semester in my class,
 I assign an essay to my students using the title, &#8220;This I Believe.&#=
8221;&nbsp; I first heard about it on National Public Radio.&nbsp; I ask th=
em to tell me their core beliefs.&nbsp; Something they would be willing to =
stand up for; to speak for; to fight for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Tonight, I&#8217;d like to share with y=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">This I believe: I have long said that c=
ommunity colleges are America&#8217;s best kept secret, but I believe it&#8=
217;s time for that to change.&nbsp; I believe we need to celebrate communi=
ty
 colleges &#8212; and their students &#8212; for who they really are: innov=
ative, inspiring and essential.&nbsp; Not just celebrate, but support.<o:p>=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">But this, too, I believe: Too many hard=
working Americans still have to worry about whether college is affordable.&=
nbsp; For millions of people across the country, community college
 is the single best path to opportunity &#8212; to achieving their dreams &=
#8212; whether that means earning a four-year degree or finding a rewarding=
 career.<br>
<br>
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">This I believe: The more than 1,100 com=
munity colleges nationwide are not just the key to a brighter future for th=
eir students, they are the backbone of America&#8217;s postsecondary
 education and training system &#8212; and one of the keys to a more prospe=
rous economic future.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I also believe &#8212; as does=
 President Obama &#8212; that community college should be free for all resp=
onsible students.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">This I believe: With the education that=
 you have received here at NOVA, there is literally no limit to how high yo=
u can go.&nbsp; Community college graduates have gone on to become
 successful CEO&#8217;s, journalists, Hollywood directors, even astronauts.=
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Finally, this I believe: a community co=
llege education can truly change people&#8217;s lives.&nbsp; And community =
college graduates &#8212; including every single one of you &#8212; can cha=
nge
 the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
