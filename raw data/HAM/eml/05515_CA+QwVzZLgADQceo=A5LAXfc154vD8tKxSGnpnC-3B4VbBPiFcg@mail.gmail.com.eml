*=E2=80=8BWhat We Learned About Donald Trump This Week*

For the most part, Donald Trump has made his lifetime of hateful language,
divisive rhetoric, and efforts to scam the taxpayers an open book. But that
doesn't mean we can't still learn new things about Donald. This week, for
instance, we learned quite a bit: at least twice he paid zero dollars in
federal income taxes; he made $150,000 off of a program meant to help small
businesses impacted by 9/11; his efforts to skirt property taxes end up
costing cities and local governments; he cheered on the housing crisis; key
U.S. allies protest his proposed Muslim ban; and he just can't shake those
troubling delegate problems. See below for a few of the things we here at
Hillary for America learned this week about Donald Trump:


*At Least Twice Trump Has Paid ZERO DOLLARS In Taxes*
Last week, Donald Trump said his tax rate was "none of your business."
Today, we learned he twice paid literally nothing in federal taxes. Trump
has leaned so hard on his bogus audit excuse in his current refusal to
release his returns, we can only imagine he has something to hide...

*Washington Post: Trump once revealed his income tax returns. They showed
he didn=E2=80=99t pay a cent.
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-income-tax-returns-once-bec=
ame-public-they-showed-he-didnt-pay-a-cent/2016/05/20/ffa2f63c-1b7c-11e6-b6=
e0-c53b7ef63b45_story.html>*
The last time information from Donald Trump=E2=80=99s income-tax returns wa=
s made
public, the bottom line was striking: He had paid the federal government $0
in income taxes. The disclosure, in a 1981 report by New Jersey gambling
regulators, revealed that the wealthy Manhattan investor had for at least
two years in the late 1970s taken advantage of a tax-code provision popular
with developers that allowed him to report negative income.

*Trump Got $150K From A 9/11 Recovery Program Meant for Small Businesses*
Donald Trump loves to brag about his business acumen. In New York, he put
it to use by collecting $150,000 from a program intended to help small
businesses recover after 9/11.


*NY Daily News: Donald Trump took advantage of program designed to help
small businesses after 9/11 =E2=80=94 one of many times he=E2=80=99s used p=
ublic funds for
private gain
<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-9-11-funds-program-n=
et-150g-payday-article-1.2641951>*
Donald Trump made a pretty penny off a program to help small businesses
hurt by 9/11, one of many times where The Donald took advantage of
government programs to save or make money off the taxpayer. The
self-proclaimed billionaire, who has so far refused to release his tax
returns, was one of many wealthy individuals and businesses who used a
loophole in a program intended to help smaller companies in lower Manhattan
recover after the Sept. 11 tragedy. Trump got $150,000 for his swanky
property at 40 Wall Street.

*Trump's **Efforts To Cut His Tax Bill Come At The Taxpayers' Expense*
Often, it seems like the only thing Donald Trump loves more than making a
deal (and his Muslim ban) is finding ways to avoid paying his fair share.
If localities and cities, and as a result their taxpayers, have to make up
the difference, that's no problem for Donald.

*ABC: The Only Time Donald Trump Undersells: Tax Time
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/time-donald-trump-undersells-tax-time/story=
?id=3D39133709>*
When Trump struck a deal with New York City to build the Grand Hyatt Hotel,
it required that his partnership team return a portion of the hotel profits
to the city. But a 1989 audit found that his ownership team =E2=80=9Cunders=
tated
its net profit=E2=80=9D by more than $5 million and deprived the city of it=
s nearly
$3 million in unreported proceeds. ... =E2=80=9CHe cheated the city of a
substantial amount of money,=E2=80=9D Burstein told ABC News. =E2=80=9CThis=
 wasn't just a
good business deal. This wasn't just business thinking. This was
manipulation ... It was an example of extraordinary flim-flammery.=E2=80=9D


*Fortune: How Donald Trump's Golf Game Leaves Local Governments in the
Rough
<http://fortune.com/2016/05/17/donald-trump-golf-taxes-mar-a-lago-national-=
golf-day/>*
When local governments try to tax Trump on his golf properties, he
incredulously turns out his pockets, often claiming that his courses are
worth far less than the estimates on his nomination filings. Trump and his
subsidiaries have employed this tactic with at least six of his U.S.
courses ... The tactic has been seen as a means to put his own interests
way in front of the communities he does business in.

*Trump Cheered On The Housing Crisis*
No explanation needed.

*CNN: Donald Trump in 2006: I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/19/politics/donald-trump-2006-hopes-real-estate=
-market-crashes/index.html>*
Two years before the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of
Americans lost their homes, Donald Trump said he was hoping for a crash. "I
sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy,"
Trump said in a 2006 audiobook from Trump University, answering a question
about "gloomy predictions that the real estate market is heading for a
spectacular crash."


*U.S. Allies Aren't Impressed With Trump's Muslim Ban*
Donald Trump has stood by his call for a "total and complete" ban
on Muslims entering the United States. As reported by the Associated Press,
Trump's proposal "led to a petition signed by half a million people
demanding that Parliament hold a debate on whether he should be banned"
from entering the UK.


*Washington Post: Trump says he expects poor relationship with UK leader
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/trump-says-he-expects-poor-rel=
ationship-with-uk-leader/2016/05/16/7c5b2158-1b3d-11e6-82c2-a7dcb313287d_st=
ory.html>*
U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump says he may have a poor
relationship with Prime Minister David Cameron in light of the British
leader=E2=80=99s criticism of Trump=E2=80=99s call for all Muslims to be te=
mporarily banned
from entering the United States. ...Cameron has refused to retract comments
describing Trump=E2=80=99s proposed Muslim ban as =E2=80=9Cdivisive, stupid=
 and wrong.=E2=80=9D

*Trump Just Can't Shake Those Troubling Delegate Problems*
Despite ridding himself of one white nationalist delegate in California
last week, white nationlist leaders claim more of their members are
representing Trump as delegates. Meanwhile, in Maryland, a Trump delegate
was indicted on federal child pornography and weapons charges.

*Huffington Post: Trump Delegate Indicted On Child Pornography, Explosives,
Machine Gun Charges
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-delegate-caleb-bailey-fed=
eral-charges_us_573dfc91e4b0aee7b8e951af>*
A Donald Trump delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention has been
indicted in Maryland on federal charges that include using a minor to make
child pornography, illegal possession of a machine gun and illegal
transport of explosives. ... Bailey is listed by the Maryland Secretary of
State as a delegate who will vote for Trump, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee.

*Mother Jones: White Nationalist Party Claims More of Its Members Are Now
Trump Delegates
<http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/white-nationalists-trump-deleg=
ates>*
On May 10, Los Angeles attorney William Johnson resigned as a delegate for
Donald Trump to the Republican National Convention after Mother Jones
reported that Johnson is the leader of the white nationalist American
Freedom Party. The Trump campaign, which selected Johnson as one of its
California delegates, blamed his inclusion on a "database error." But white
nationalist leaders, including one who has contributed to an online hate
forum, are now claiming that other members of their movement have become
delegates for Trump.
