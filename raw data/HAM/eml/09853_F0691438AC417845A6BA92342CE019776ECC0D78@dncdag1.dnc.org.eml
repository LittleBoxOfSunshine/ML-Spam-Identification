You have said that Trump is a loose cannon and that he is dangerous. Are yo=
u suggesting that he is not of sound mind?

- Being a loose cannon means saying that other nations should go ahead and =
acquire nukes for themselves when that is the last thing we need in the wor=
ld today.
- Being a loose cannon is saying we should pull out of NATO.
- Saying he is a loose cannon focuses on statements he made about torture, =
killing terrorists families.

What do you take away from the Republican race now that it's over?

- The Republicans themselves are raising questions about their presumptive =
nominee because they do understand how hard the job of being president is.

What are some of the hard questions you think Trump should be asked now?

- What is his claim that Americans don't need a wage increase based on?
- What does it mean that climate change is based on a Chinese hoax?
- What does it mean that women should be punished for having an abortion? H=
ow would he go about that?
- How would you round up 11 million people and deport them?

Do details and specifics matter? Or do voters just want what they want?

- She has put out specific plans saying how she would pay for them. She has=
 more votes than Trump or Sanders, so there is clearly a constituency out t=
here for people
that care about solutions to problems.

Is this going to be a very ugly race?

- She will not run an ugly race, she will run based on issues.
- She is running for her vision of what our country can be, not against Tru=
mp.

Will there be Republicans for Hillary?

- Reaching out to voters who want a candidate that is running a campaign ba=
sed on issues.
- She has had a lot of Republicans who have reached out to her over the las=
t week as something they would be interested in.

In 2008, you could have kept going but you knew Obama was going to win so y=
ou got out of the way. Should Senator Sanders do the same thing?

- She was much closer to Obama in 2008 than Bernie is to her now.
- He has to make his own mind up but she was happy to hear him say that he =
will work 7 days a way to make sure Trump is not the president.
- They have a lot of the same goals and hopes to unify around them.

What can you tell us about the state of the server investigation?

- The FBI has not reached out to her yet.
- She is more than ready to talk to anyone at any time.

What do you say to voters worried about the investigation?

- This is a security inquiry, she always took classified materials seriousl=
y.
- There was never any material labeled classified that was sent or received=
 by her.
- She learned it was a mistake to keep the private server.

Panel 3: Jennifer Rubin, Russel Moore, Leslie Sanchez, Matt Schlapp

Jennifer, you wrote that this week was the "worst week in the GOP's existen=
ce." Why?

Rubin: The GOP is about to come apart and the lines aren't necessarily ideo=
logical. Fundamentally, the problem with Trump is not ideological. It is fu=
ndamentally an issue of character. They see how he treats women, foreigners=
, his meanness, his lack of personal self control.

Schlapp: The HRC brigade is going to run on morality and character, which i=
s an awfully tough lane for them. Is he better or worse philosophically tha=
n HRC? Trump is clearly, for conservatives, the better choice.

Rubin: He is unfit for the office. He believes we should sprinkle nukes aro=
und Europe and the far east. He believes we don't have to stand by the sove=
reign debt of the US.

Why isn't it fine for Trump to tell Paul Ryan that he got more votes than a=
nyone and now you have to deal with it?

Sanchez: To some extend that is a fair point. Trump's campaign doesn't comm=
unicate with the party and doesn't have a real infrastructure.

Where do you think Trump fits in to the culture?

Moore: One of the key aspects of conservatism is to say that character and =
virtue matters. But now we have a Republican Party that seems ready to surr=
ender the culture wars. You now have conservatives that used to say charact=
er matters but now are not willing to say anything when we have this realit=
y TV, moral sewage coming through all over our culture.

Schlapp: there are a lot of Republicans that have grown discouraged on the =
Republican strategy over those cultural issues. But the fact is there are v=
oters yelling at Washington that they are fed up with them and we need a ne=
w direction.

On the Supreme Court -

Rubin: We don't have any idea what kind of justice Trump would support - lo=
ok at the people he surrounds himself with. He is completely unreliable and=
 unpredictable. It is not simply one seat, there may be others, and do you =
really trust this man to chose anything? I think it is a completely pipe dr=
eam to think he is going to chose conservatives to the Court.

Panel 2: Ruth Marcus, Ben Domenech, Amy Walter, and Jonathan Martin

Are we going to have unity by the end of the week after Ryan meets with Tru=
mp?

Martin: It's possible but Trump is making it harder on Ryan. Trump is provi=
ng he is unable to make the pivot that some of his staff said would happen =
for the general. He will not change his agenda to satisfy Paul Ryan - the v=
oters said they wanted Trump and their agendas are completely different.

What does the map look like in a general election? Does Trump put new state=
s in play?

Walter: Cook Political has HRC starting with 304 electoral votes. She will =
be able to cement diversifying states like Virginia, North Carolina, and sh=
e can hold on to the rustbelt states. There are not enough white working cl=
ass voters to win the presidency for Trump.

What do you think about a third party run? Is there anything in that?

Marcus: No, I don't think so. It's good therapy for people in the Republica=
n Party but the practical realities of getting on the ballot just don't mak=
e sense. A third party run would also help HRC.

If I am a Republican running in a purple state that Obama won, what am I go=
ing to do?

Domenech: they have not really figured out the answer yet. Might argue that=
 they have to be elected as a check to whatever Trump or HRC would do.

Panel 1: Ruth Marcus, Ben Domenech, Amy Walter, and Jonathan Martin

Where are we this week?

Martin: unless something really crazy happens at the convention, this is no=
w Trump's party.

Paul Ryan is not ready to embrace the nominee of the party but Reince is ur=
ging everyone to come together. Is there a genuine break in this party?

Walter: There is a genuine break in this party and it won't look the same i=
n 2017 as it does today. Break in ideology, tone, style that has been brewi=
ng for a long time. Trump did not invent it but he walked into a room full =
of gasoline and threw a match on it.

Marcus: This was an extraordinary week for the Republican Party. Republican=
s are watching three out of the last four guys they voted for for president=
 saying they cannot support Trump and the fourth looked not too happy sayin=
g he would be for the nominee.

Martin: Republicans that have already endorsed Trump have to be feeling a l=
ittle uneasy about it after the week that Trump just had - with so many Rep=
ublicans coming out against him.

[shows clip of Trump saying HRC is playing the women card, the women get it=
 better than men do] HRC says she is not going to run a negative campaign a=
gainst Trump, but he is certainly running one against her.

Walter: She doesn't have to run a negative campaign, she is going to have a=
 lot of people doing it for her.

Marcus: Trump is making his standing with women worse by the day. Crooked H=
illary might work but saying she is not qualified and only there because sh=
e is a woman is insulting not just to HRC but to woman in general.

Domenech: the real question is whether Trump is even interested in unifying=
 the party.

<div><font size=3D"2">Marcus: This was an extraordinary week for the&nbsp;R=
epublican&nbsp;Party. Republicans are watching three out of the last four g=
uys they voted for for president saying they cannot support Trump and the f=
ourth looked not too happy saying he would be
 for the nominee.&nbsp;</font></div>

<div><font size=3D"2">Martin: Republicans that have already endorsed Trump =
have to be feeling a little uneasy about it after the week that Trump just =
had - with so many Republicans coming out against him.</font></div>
