Any way we can get this Debbie Wasserman Schultz ask into the Nordic Dinner=
 Friday?  Here's her rationale/bio for this invite (no guest). She says he =
is a major supporter and helped us a lot on the Iran vote.

orida State politics and policy on behalf of the Democratic Party since 197=
5.  A Field Director for Jimmy Carter in Eastern Pennsylvania in the 1976 c=
ampaign, Mr. Berger went on to work for the Carter administration in the De=
partment of Transportation.  During the Clinton administration, Mr. Berger =
had positions with the Small Business Advisory Council, the Environmental F=
inance Advisory Board and as Chairman of the Board of Sallie Mae.  At Salle=
 Mae, Mr. Berger led the efforts to privatize the government sponsored ente=
rprise.  Mr. Berger also served as the Chair of the Federal Victory Fund fo=
r the DNC for the 2000 Presidential election.  He was also one of the lead =
lawyers representing Vice President Gore and Senator Joe Lieberman in the c=

d Victory Fund for Kerry-Edwards and was a significant contributor to the f=
inancial and election protection efforts in both Obama-Biden campaigns.  He=
 is amongst the national leaders in Secretary Clinton's fundraising efforts=
 and is serving as an advisor for environmental outreach for her campaign. =
 On a State level, Mr. Berger has served as the Florida Democratic Party's =
