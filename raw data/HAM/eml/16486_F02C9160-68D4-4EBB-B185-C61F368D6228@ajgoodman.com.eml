Dear A.J.,

President Obama is headlining a roundtable fundraiser in the DC area on Wedn=
esday, May 18th benefitting the DNC. =20

The Goldbergs attended a roundtable over a year ago.  The format is exactly t=
he same.  Up to 25 guests seated "roundtable style" with briefing from a top=
 Democratic official preceded or followed by one hour discussion with the Pr=
esident.  A candid photo is taken with the President and each guest as he en=
ters the room and greets guests walking around the "table" as he proceeds to=
 his seat.

The money goes to our crucial build for the election this year, with focus o=
n the presidential and down ballot opportunities.  This involves constantly u=
pdating and providing our voter file to state parties and Democratic candida=
tes, running an aggressive press/media program, preparing for legal challeng=
es and voting irregularities and funding our convention obligations. =20

The presidential election year is by far our biggest budget obligation out o=
f the four year cycle since the last presidential election.

Would the Goldbergs be interested in hosting the event at their Maryland hom=
e on May 18th?  We are asking any hosts to commit to put together/raise half=
 of the event goal.  This would involve about $350,000 in host commitment. =20=


As you know, individual donors can contribute up to $334,000 to the DNC in a=
 single calendar year.

After their previous gifts this year via HVF, they can each give up to $300,=
600 directly to the DNC. This benefits the eventual presidential nominee in a=
 major way.

We don't have exact timing yet that day.  We hope to hear from the White Hou=
se very shortly on exact start time for the event.

Let me know if you need further information. Very sorry for the short notice=
.  If it is possible to have an answer by earlier tomorrow, that is very hel=
pful.  Thanks to them for any consideration!

All the best,

Andrew
