Dear Supporter, 

Dear Supporter, 

Yesterday was the final day of the 70th Colorado legislative session.

During their 120 days at the Capitol, Democrats built an agenda to protect our Colorado way of life. We proposed 5 bills fighting for women who do the same job as a man. We sought to close corporate offshore-tax loopholes and bring millions back into our classrooms. We fought for more affordable student loans with the Middle Class College Savings Act and lowered the high cost of housing through first-time homebuyer savings accounts.

None of these bills made it to the Governor's desk because the GOP-controlled Senate killed every one. That's why majorities are so critical and it's why we will fight from now until November to prevent GOP obstructionism from defeating these bills next year.

At the helm for all of it was Speaker of the House Dickey Lee Hullinghorst. She has done an incredible amount of work for Colorado during her 8 years in the legislature. She spent the last 2 years as Speaker and was critical in pushing through progressive legislation in the face of a Republican-controlled Senate.

Where Speaker Hullinghorst showed poise and statesmanship, the GOP exhibited cowardice. They were bullied by the Koch Brother-funded group Americans for Prosperity into voting against a bill that was backed by civic and business organizations from all across the political spectrum which would fix a glitch preventing the state from making critical investments in our roads and schools.

Will you help fight GOP extremism and obstruction with a $25, $50 or $100 donation today?

Colorado is losing a truly spectacular public servant with Speaker Hullinghorst having overseen her last day of the legislative session, but her impact on the well-being of our state will be felt for years to come.


Thank you, Madam Speaker.

And thank you, for your support and commitment to keeping Democrats in control of the Speaker's gavel for the 71st legislative session.
