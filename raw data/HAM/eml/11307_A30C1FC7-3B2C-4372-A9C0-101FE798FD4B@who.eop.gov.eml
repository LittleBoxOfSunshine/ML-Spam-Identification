you could confirm that U.S. officials are believing this is a bomb.

re and I don't have an intelligence assessment to share at this point.
>=20

ering if -- I know that at the beginning of the administration the Presiden=
t really stressed the importance of not including lobbyists coming into the=
 administration -- there were some exceptions.  But does he feel the same w=
ay about it when -- does he have the same concern when officials leave the =
administration?  That when they become lobbyists, do they need to sign up a=
nd be transparent about that disclosure?
>=20
>   MR. EARNEST:  Well, Susan, I don't have the details in front of me, but=
 I know that some of the restrictions that the President put in place on hi=
s first day in office didn't just apply to individuals who might be conside=
ring employment in the federal government during the Obama administration; =
there were also commitments that incoming administration officials had to m=
ake about limiting their lobbying activities after leaving government.  And=
 so there are prohibitions, or at least limitations, that apply to former O=
bama administration officials.

>=20
> MR. EARNEST:  Yes, there is -- as part of the out-boarding process, you'r=
e reminded of the commitments that you've made on the way in that would lim=
it your job prospects on the way out.  And look, many people have raised co=
ncerns about how historically there's been a revolving door between the fed=
eral government and K Street.  And the President's efforts, again, that he =
initiated on his first day in office were to close that revolving door, bot=
h in terms of the impact it has on people seeking to enter the government, =
but also based on restrictions that individuals committed to on their way o=
ut.
>=20

>=20
> Q    Sure.  Luis Miranda left the White House.  He went to the ** Group. =
 He did, from what I understand, engage in contacting the White House on th=
at issue repeatedly, and from what I understand there's no lobbying disclos=
ure records to show for that.  I have written about this, but we've talked =
about a lot -- there's been a lot of discussion about the Iran narrative th=
is week, but there hasn't been a lot of discussion about the -- and the tim=
eline -- and there hasn't been a lot of discussion about the Cuba timeline =
and what -- the transparency on those negotiations.  That's why I'm asking.
>=20
> MR. EARNEST:  Okay.  Well, look, we can take a look and see if we can pro=
vide you some additional information.  It sounds like -- I'm not sure that =
any of that disclosure would apply to the administration, but we can take a=
 look.

>=20

Cuba issue to have had some level of surprise on that issue?  Or I mean, is=
 it the President's right and the White House's right to -- and the State D=
epartment -- to engage in diplomacy behind the scenes before announcing a m=
ajor initiative like trying to normalize relations with Cuba or another cou=
ntry?
>=20
> MR. EARNEST:  Yes, I think that's entirely appropriate.  And that certain=
ly has applied to other diplomatic breakthroughs that have been -- that the=
 United States has benefitted from in just the last couple of years.  And w=
hen we were negotiating to secure the release of Americans who were being u=
njustly held in Iran, that was not something that we discussed extensively =
in the past.  When the United States was working behind the scenes with Chi=
na to get them to make some significant commitments to fight carbon polluti=
on in their country, that I think -- the results of those negotiations I th=
ink were a surprise to many in the public, but the United States enjoyed si=
gnificant benefits as a result.
