Hi Jordan- thanks for reaching out. What time is the event? It looks like, =
timing-wise, it would be possible for her to do the 31st but before I can c=
ommit her, I need some traps on it.

Is there any more info you can give me about the event? Thanks so much!

Best,
Sri

Hey Sri,

We are putting together a Democratic Lawyers Council reception in NYC with =
Robbie Kaplan hosting and Gloria Allred featured as the special guest. The =
ever would take place the evening of Tuesday, May 31st. Per Tina and Kaplan=
's conversation below, Tina is happy to join if we can work out the timing.

Happy to put her on a flight out of NYC the evening of the 31st or first th=
ing on the 1st. Please let us know at your earliest convenience if this is =
feasible. It is a women's issues and civil rights focused event, so Tina's =
participation would be pivotal to the event's success.

Thanks and we Look forwarding to hearing from you.
