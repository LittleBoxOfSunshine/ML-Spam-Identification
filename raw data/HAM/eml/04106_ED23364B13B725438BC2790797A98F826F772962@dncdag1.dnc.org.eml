Trump Denied Dating Model, Called Her a =91F**king Third-Rate Hooker=92<htt=
p://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/16/trump-denies-dating-model-cal=
led-her-a-f-king-third-rate-hooker.html?via=3Dtwitter_page>
Victoria Zdrok claimed Donald Trump was a narcissist who wore too much hair=
spray. He claimed never to have met her, and that she was unattractive to d=
ate.

In a public-spirited exercise in gossip archeology, D-list celebrity interv=
iewer and former =91Howard Stern Show<http://www.thedailybeast.com/content/=
dailybeast/topics/howard-stern.html>=92 regular Chaunce Hayden, the publish=
er of Metropolis Nights magazine<http://metnights.com/>, has rediscovered a=
 12-year-old recording of his phone call with Donald Trump<http://www.theda=
ilybeast.com/content/dailybeast/topics/donald-trump.html>concerning a Playb=
oy and Penthouse model Trump claimed never to have dated.

While Hayden has previously marketed his chat with The Donald to various an=
d sundry web sites over the years (Radar Online and Gawker included), it is=
 well worth taking out of mothballs now that the reality show billionaire i=
s the presumptive Republican nominee with a shot at being elected president=
 of the United States.

The model in question is Victoria Zdrok<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victo=
ria_Zdrok>, 43, a Ukranian-born former Playboy Playmate and Penthouse Pet w=
ho, in a 2004 interview with Hayden, published in his now-defunct magazine =
Stepping Out, was less than charitable about her close encounter with the m=
an who will likely face former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton<http://ww=
w.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/topics/hillary-clinton.html> in 2016=
 general election.

In the interview, Zdrok claimed Trump had called Playboy to get a date with=
 her, and they =93ended up going out four times.=94 She said she had gotten=
 a call from Playboy Promotions saying Trump was =93looking for a new girl =
for his ad campaign for one of his casinos in Atlantic City=85It turns out =
he was never actually looking for a model. He was just trying to pick me up=
.=94

=93First of all, he=92s really arrogant,=94 Zdrok told Hayden. =93He=92s re=
ally into himself! On a date all he does is talk about himself. He loves hi=
mself! The first thing he says to me on our date is that he=92s taller and =
better looking than what he looks like in pictures, and that people don=92t=
 realize it. He said, =91People don=92t realize how handsome I am!=92 He ac=
tually loves himself! I never met a more narcissistic person than Donald.

=93You feel just like a piece of jewelry when you=92re with him. For him it=
=92s all about looks, appearances, and signing autographs. He just loves it=
.=94(Zdrok didn=92t respond to an email from The Daily Beast; neither did T=
rump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks.)

While all the above might have a certain ring of familiarity to anyone who =
has followed the future GOP standard-bearer=92s Twitter feed, campaign rall=
ies, and debate performances, Trump was at pains to deny, in his phone call=
 with Hayden, that he had even met the woman, let alone dated her.

He begged Hayden not to go with the story, but, alas, the real estate and c=
asino mogul=97who was starring in NBC=92s The Apprentice, then in its first=
 season=97was less than persuasive.

=93Donald Trump wasn=92t paying my bills,=94 Hayden told The Daily Beast.

Zdrok also told Hayden that all Trump did on their dates was =93talk about =
his ex-girlfriends. He couldn=92t stop talking about Ivana (his first wife)=
 and Marla [Maples, his second wife] and how skinny and horrible Marla look=
s now and that she looks like shit since she cut her hair off.

=93He just loves to talk about which women are in love with him and always =
calling him. He loves to talk about how women are chasing him all the time,=
 which doesn=92t make a girl feel special on a date. The other thing he tal=
ks about is what a great lover he is. He said to me, =91Once you made love =
to me, you=92ll never be able to make love to anybody else.=92=94

Zdrok, who told Hayden she had not slept with Trump (she did not want to be=
 =93another notch on his belt=94), accused him of being racist.

=93He would always talk about this one girl, a supermodel, and how he would=
 give her the best orgasms of her life. And how she misses him so much. He =
told me he really likes this girl but he would never go out with her becaus=
e he found out she was half-black and that would be bad for his reputation.=
 I thought that was very racist.

=93He didn=92t like that she was some weird ethnic mix so he wouldn=92t go =
out with her publicly, but that he really missed her and she was wonderful =
in bed. He needed somebody more mainstream.=94

(Many pieces have surmised that the supermodel in question was Kara Young, =
who Trump dated in 2001<http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/d=
onald-trump-former-flames-2015287/46496>.)

Judging by Trump=92s liberal use of curse words and otherwise coarse misogy=
nistic language in his pleadings with Hayden to not publish the interview w=
ith Zdrok, he was also=97at least by the na=EFve standards of a simpler tim=
e=97less than presidential.

=93I don=92t even know who the hell she is,=94 Trump insisted to Hayden, af=
ter boasting about the ratings of his reality television show. =93It=92s th=
e biggest thing [NBC has] had sinceFriends.=94

In an assertion that, more than a decade later, is unlikely to help his can=
didacy with Republican women in the suburbs, but will probably have negligi=
ble impact on his ardent supporters, Trump said that he could not have poss=
ibly gone out with Zdrok because =93she looks like a fucking third-rate hoo=
ker. Gimme a break. I never took her out. She=92s full of shit. Chaunce, lo=
ok, I have good taste in women. Take a look at her picture. It=92s all bull=
shit. I never took her out.=94

It was =93bullshit, total bullshit=94 that he was considering Zdrok for an =
advertising campaign, Trump added. =93I use models, not Playboy people for =
that.=94

Trump claimed in the call that Zdrok would call his office =93ten different=
 times, like five years ago,=94 asking that he take her out. =93I never too=
k her out, and based on that picture I would never take her out. She=92s no=
t even attractive, she=92s not a good-looking girl=85 Who the hell wants a =
Penthouse Pet? Penthouse is gone, it=92s bankrupt, it=92s over.=94

Being a 35-year-old Penthouse Pet was =93pretty pathetic=94 according to Tr=
ump.

Ever since The Apprentice had become successful had women claiming to be ex=
-girlfriends materialized, he said.

=93Two of them I did date, they said nice things about me,=94 Trump said, r=
estating again that Zdrok=92s claim was =93total bullshit.=94 While it woul=
d be easier not to make a big deal out of it, Trump said, claims like Zdrok=
=92s were =93just so fucking false I don=92t like them to get away with thi=
s crap.=94

As for Zdrok, she also claimed to have been up close and personal with Trum=
p=92s famous, shape- and color-shifting thatch of hair.

=93His orange hair was very odd,=94 she said. =93He uses so much hair spray=
. I would never dream of touching it. But he doesn=92t care. He really thin=
ks he=92s one of the most handsome people on earth. He really does.

=93After four dates I stopped going out with him. I just said, =91I=92ll ca=
ll you back=92 and never did. So he moved on. I just couldn=92t take hearin=
g about him talk about himself. He=92s so condescending. There=92s no roman=
ce. It=92s all about him.=94
