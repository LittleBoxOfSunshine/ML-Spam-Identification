Hi Erik,
Hello Erik I have a question and I was hoping you could point me in the rig=
ht direction. When Captain Sullenberger first met President Obama, the Pres=
ident offered Sully a =C2=A0chance to tour Air Force One. In the craziness =
that ensued in the next few years in our lives after the landing on the Hud=
son we never followed up to make that happen.
And now in the blink of an eye 7 years has passed. And I don't know if you =
have seen it in the news but Clint Eastwood with Warner Bros Films, is doin=
g a movie based on Sully's life and his first book Highest Duty. The film i=
s set to premier in the US on Sept 7. So as a surprise to Sully I was going=
 to try to get the tour of Air Force One set up at some point to celebrate =
the movie. I don't know how many more times Air Force One might be in the S=
an Francisco Bay Area? And of course Sully is in DC frequently as he does w=
ork on Capitol Hill regarding aviation safety.
To clarify we just want to tour the airplane not with the President.
I have a variety of White House staffer names that we have collected over t=
he years but not sure where to start with a request like this? =C2=A0
Thank you very much for any assistance you might have in moving this along.
And boy oh boy is this shaping up to be one wild election year!! Sadly very=
 scary really.
All the best, =C2=A0Lorrie Sullenberger
