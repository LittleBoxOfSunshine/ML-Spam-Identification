Sample Trump Op-Ed


Divisive, Reckless and Dangerous: The Trump-Ryan Agenda is a Recipe for Dis=
aster
(Key Issues: Taxes, Economy, Women's Health, Immigration)

Donald Trump's recklessness would hurt our economy, diminish our standing i=
n the world, make our communities less safe, and leave the working families=
 of [State] behind. He is divisive, dangerous, and he lacks the judgment an=
d temperament to be president.

In states with Republican state leadership: Here in the state of [XXX], we =
already know the damage Republican leadership can do. Governor [XXX], and/o=
r the Republican-led legislature have implemented more of the same backward=
s policies from the Republican playbook. (state-specific examples) We need =
Democratic leadership to carry us forward.

In states with Democratic state leadership: Here in the state of [XXX], Gov=
ernor [XXX], and/or the Democratic-led legislature have fought for policies=
 that have expanded opportunity, protected civil rights and helped working =
families prosper. (state-specific examples)

What Trump is promising is an even more reckless version of the disastrous =
policies that what we already know we can expect from the GOP. For years th=
e Republican Party has elevated extreme voices, using divisive campaigns th=
at sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain. And despite his be=
st attempts at portraying himself as an independent outsider with new ideas=
, he has embraced the same disastrous, failed policies that today's top GOP=
 leaders, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, have long fought for.

A Trump presidency would advance Ryan's policies, erase the real economic p=
rogress of the last seven years under President Obama, hurt working familie=
s, turn back the clock on women's health, and deepen divisions on immigrati=
on reform.

Both Trump and Ryan would block an increase in the minimum wage. Both have =
vowed to defund or shutdown Planned Parenthood. Trump has made absurd claim=
s about building a "great wall" on our southern border, while Ryan has vote=
d repeatedly for building a border wall. Both have vowed to repeal the Affo=
rdable Care Act, which would jeopardize health care for 20 million American=
s. And both men have proposed tax plans that would overwhelmingly benefit t=
he rich and slash the top income tax rate to 25 percent.

Trump's tax plan would cost the country $9.5 trillion to implement - more t=
han any other Republican plan proposed - while violating his own pledge to =
eliminate the national debt.

This week as Trump and Ryan meet at RNC headquarters, presumably in an atte=
mpt to repair the damage of their vicious primary, it's a stark reminded re=
minder that the Trump-Ryan agenda is a real threat, and that if we allow it=
 to take hold over the next four years it would come at a severe cost for t=
he vast majority of Americans.


A Trump presidency would only drag us backwards. His campaign has already d=
amaged America's relationships across the globe, and at the same time his d=
ivisive rhetoric has made our communities at home less safe. His record of =
denigrating women has only gotten worse throughout this campaign., and at t=
he same time that his divisive rhetoric has made our communities less safe.=
 His business record is riddled with embarrassing failures that make it cle=
ar the American people can't afford to let him get anywhere near the White =
House. --> Just a suggested ed here - thought it sounded strange to link hi=
s comments denigrating women to also making our communities less safe. Seem=
ed to fit better in the previous sentence.

When the last Republican president left office, our economy was losing 800,=
000 jobs a month. The Trump-Ryan agenda is offering more of the same, or wo=
rse, and the American people cannot afford to let Trump bully his way into =
the Oval Office.

We need to elect more Democratic leadership from the top of the ticket down=
 to build on the progress of the last seven years under President Obama - w=
ith 74 straight months of private-sector job growth, the longest streak on =
record, and over 14 million new jobs created. Republicans couldn't unite ag=
ainst Trump and failed to stand up to him during their primary because they=
 were playing to the same extreme base of their party. Democrats will be un=
ited and hold Donald Trump accountable every day until Election Day on Nove=
mber 8th.
