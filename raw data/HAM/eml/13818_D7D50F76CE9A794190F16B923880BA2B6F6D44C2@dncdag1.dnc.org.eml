Donald Trump=92s Strange World View<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/opini=
on/donald-trump-to-world-im-willing-to-walk.html>

By THE EDITORIAL BOARD<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorial=
board.html>APRIL 27, 2016


After landslide Republican primary victories, Donald Trump delivered a spee=
ch on Wednesday<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/us/politics/donald-trump-=
foreign-policy-speech.html> in Washington intended to clarify his foreign p=
olicy positions. That was needed, because his views on America=92s role in =
the world have until now been expressed in tweets, interviews and remarks a=
t rallies that have alarmed nearly every foreign ally of the United States.

No one=92s fears are likely to be allayed by this speech, which was clearly=
 worked up by his new campaign advisers and read from a teleprompter. It di=
d not exhibit much grasp of the complexity of the world, understanding of t=
he balance or exercise of power, or even a careful reading of history.

When one has a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And when one=92s exper=
ience is limited to real estate deals, everything looks like a lease negoti=
ation. Hearing Mr. Trump describe his approach to foreign relations, one im=
agines a group of nations sitting at a table with him at its head, rather l=
ike a scene from =93The Apprentice,=94 demanding more money, more troops an=
d policy changes in exchange for American protection, trade and friendship.=
 And if he doesn=92t get what he wants? =93In negotiation, you must be will=
ing to walk,=94 Mr. Trump said.

This unilateral approach makes for good television, but this is the real wo=
rld, in which other nations have agendas, too. Mr. Trump says he is =93goin=
g to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of wh=
ich are at risk from radical Islamic violence.=94 But how will he gain coop=
eration for his =93unpredictable=94 war on the Islamic State while =93tempo=
rarily=94 banning Muslims from entering this country, and forcing those liv=
ing here to register themselves?
How does one =93apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea,=
=94 while slapping a trade-killing tariff on Chinese imports? It=92s correc=
t that many of our NATO allies aren=92t paying their agreed share of its co=
sts =97 but what happens to the United States=92 overseas bases if we =93wa=
lk?=94
While trumpeting America=92s role in winning World War II and the Cold War,=
 Mr. Trump simultaneously pronounced that =93America First,=94 the 1930s is=
olationist theme that he quoted without attribution, =93will be the major a=
nd overriding theme of my administration.=94 He did not bother to square th=
at with his vow not to =93hesitate to deploy military force when there is n=
o alternative.=94 He condemned =93nation building,=94 but said he aims to b=
uild =93regional stability,=94 without explaining the difference.
Mr. Trump decried a shrinking American military and the deterioration of th=
e nuclear arsenal. But he did not say how he would further build up the mil=
itary =97 which has a budget this year of nearly $600 billion =97 while cut=
ting government spending, which he also wants to do. And he seem to be igno=
rant of the sweeping $1 trillion effort to revitalize the nuclear force tha=
t is already underway.
Mr. Trump repeatedly states outright falsehoods, often based on wrong assum=
ptions. He=92s been refuted before on his claim that the Islamic State is m=
aking =93millions of dollars a week=94 by selling Libyan oil. There is zero=
 evidence of that. The nuclear deal with the United States and other major =
powers has not made Iran a =93great power,=94 nor has Tehran violated the c=
onditions of that pact, as Mr. Trump has said.
Mr. Trump says he knows how to negotiate, and to him that seems to mean put=
ting forward maximal positions that he can then walk back. That won=92t wor=
k in foreign policy. Mr. Trump did not display any willingness to learn or =
to correct his past errors. For someone who claims he is ready to lead the =
free world, that is inexcusable.
