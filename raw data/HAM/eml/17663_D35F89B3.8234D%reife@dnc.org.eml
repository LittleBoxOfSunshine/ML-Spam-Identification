Hey Scott =8B It looks like there the constituent groups for both of those
sends are empty, which is why you=B9re seeing that =B3failed=B2 message. I=
=B9m
guessing that means there was an issue with the data files when they were
updated into BSD.=20

If you go to=20
https://finance.democrats.org/modules/constituent/admin/upload_status.php
you should see a list of your most recent uploads and option to download a
file that should show what errors there were.

You=B9ll need to reupload the files into those groups, and then if you clic=
k
the =B3reset=B2 button you should be able to send the emails once that is
done.=20

Let me know if you still run into any issues.
