STATE Democrats Slam Trump-Ryan Economic Plan During Event Held Earlier Today

Earlier today, STATE Democratic Chair Firstname Lastname, joined by STATE Senator Firstname Lastname and others, held a press conference to discuss the negative effects that the Trump-Ryan economic plan would have on our state's economy and how it would leave behind hard-working STATE families.

Donald Trump's economic policies have been exposed as reckless and dangerous. His comments over the last few days outline an agenda that would undermine the role of the United States as a major economic power and potentially threaten the global financial system. But Trump's dangerous ideas are just an even more reckless version extension of the already misguided stances that Paul Ryan and the Republicans in Congress have been pushing for years. Both Ryan and Trump have pushed for tax cuts that overwhelmingly favor those at the top and would force hard-working middle class families to pick up the pieces. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly threatened to destroy the United States' credit rating, which would have a devastating impact on the U.S. economy.

"Donald Trump's reckless tax policies and his suggestion that we should play chicken with the country's finances are lifted directly from the same old failed Republican playbook.," said Firstname Lastname, chair of the STATE Democratic Party.

"Trump can ignore reality and crown himself the king of debt, but it's clear that his economic ideas, and those of his fellow Republicans are simply bankrupt. The American people and our economy can't afford a disastrous Trump presidency," said STATE Senator Firstname Lastname.

"Donald Trump's plan to give our hard-earned tax money away to those at the top means there are fewer resources available to make sure our kids can attend quality schools," said Firstname Lastname, whose children attend elementary school children in CITY and would be harmed by the Trump-Ryan education plans. "We need a president and a Congress who puts the needs of working families and kids first instead of coddling those at the top with more tax breaks."

Over 50 anti-Trump demonstrators held signs at the press conference that said "Reject the Trump-Ryan Agenda." Photos are available here: www.LINK.url<http://www.LINK.url>

The message of the press conference was clear: Donald Trump can't hide from the GOP's obsession with trickle-down economics. Yesterday, Trump tried to dismiss concerns about his reckless tax plan, which would reward those at the top<http://www.npr.org/2015/12/22/460743371/analysis-trump-tax-plan-boosts-the-rich-could-be-a-drag-on-the-economy> by slashing the top income tax rate to 25 percent from 39.6 percent.

In reality, such a move would give<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-why-trump-s-flip-flop-taxes-matters-n570431> Trump and those in the "an average tax cut of more than $1.3 million (versus $2,700 for those in the middle class)." Trump also plans to substantially<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform> reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, going even beyond the reckless plan put forth by Republican Speaker Paul Ryan.

Optional:

That's not all Trump has in common with Ryan. Paul Ryan also said that Planned Parenthood shouldn't get a "red cent<http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/01/politics/paul-ryan-planned-parenthood/index.html>" in funding. Trump, of course, supported shutting down<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/donald-trump-government-shutdown-planned-parenthood-120981.html> the government to defund Planned Parenthood.

When it comes to immigration, we all know that Trump would build a wall<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/us/politics/donald-trump-runs-for-president-this-time-for-real-he-says.html> on the Mexican border; Paul Ryan has said that he supports such a wall and has voted for building one "repeatedly<http://www.hughhewitt.com/paul-ryans-way-forward-renewing-american-idea/>."
