Friend --

Over the next few months, Republicans are going to spend hundreds of millio=
ns of dollars to elect their candidates. And we=92re going to beat them the=
 same way we always have -- by hitting the pavement to talk with folks dire=
ctly.

<LINK>That's why the DNC is currently looking Field Organizers to help elec=
t Democrats in key battlegrounds states around the country. Interested, NAM=
E? [ALT FOR FORWARDERS: KNOW SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED, NAME?]<LINK>

Field Organizers are the heart and soul of winning campaigns. They=92re the=
 people hitting the streets to talk with their neighbors, create personal c=
onnections, and build the team of Democrats that is dedicated to electing o=
ur candidates and making sure America keeps moving forward. Together, our F=
ield Organizers and their volunteers will knock on every door, make sure ev=
ery person who wants to vote is registered, and get out every vote we=92ll =
need to win on Election Day.

DIRECT ASK:
If that sounds like you, then we need you on our team! Apply to be a field =
organizer right now:

LINK

FORWARD ASK:
We bet that sounds like someone you know. If it does, please forward this e=
mail to them and have them apply right away:

Thank you for doing this, NAME.

All the best,

Amy

Democratic National Committee
