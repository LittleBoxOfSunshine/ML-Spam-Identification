Vox =96 Matthew Yglesias

Now that Donald Trump has secured his place as the Republican Party's presi=
dential nominee, the fact that his statements on matters of public policy o=
ften don't make sense will be taken much more seriously. The latest example=
 came during yesterday's interview between Trump and CNN's Wolf Blitzer in =
which, among other things, Blitzer asked Trump about Puerto Rico.

You can read our explainer on the Puerto Rico situation here, but the long =
and short of it is that Puerto Rico owes a ton of money and, due to populat=
ion loss, it can't pay. Under normal circumstances, a city or county or bus=
iness in this situation would file for bankruptcy to reduce its debt burden=
, but the existing bankruptcy code doesn't let Puerto Rico do this. The Whi=
te House and many congressional Democrats have proposed creating a bankrupt=
cy process for Puerto Rico, but Republicans =97 at the behest of distressed=
 debt funds that bought up Puerto Rican bonds =97 have blocked it.

Here's Blitzer trying to ask Trump if he agrees the bankruptcy law should c=
hange:

WOLF BLITZER: They're prevented from using the bankruptcy laws, Puerto Rico=
, as opposed to all the US states. You've used those bankruptcy laws over t=
he years.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm the king =97 I understand. By the way =97

WOLF BLITZER: Should Puerto Rico have an opportunity to use the bankruptcy =
laws?

DONALD TRUMP: As a very successful person I would buy companies, throw them=
 in a chapter, bankrupt it, negotiate =97 I would do great deals, I didn't =
use them for myself, I used them as a businessperson. Many of the top peopl=
e in my category use the laws. I know more about debt than practically anyb=
ody, I love debt. I also love reducing debt, and I know how to do it better=
 than anybody. I will tell you with Puerto Rico they have too much debt. Yo=
u can't just restructure; you have to use the laws, cut the debt way down, =
and get back to business, because they can't survive with the kind of debt =
they have. I would not bail out if I were =97 if I were in that position I =
wouldn't bail them out.

WOLF BLITZER: Would you let them have a bankruptcy option?

DONALD TRUMP: They're going to have no choice. if they're not going to pay =
the bill they're not going to pay the interest on the bonds =97

WOLF BLITZER: They can't.

DONALD TRUMP: They can't. You can't =97 you know, the expression you can't =
take it out of the grave if they don't have it. Whether they officially dec=
lare or not, but ultimately what they have to do is cut the debt way down. =
They're never going to pay that debt off, they have to cut it way down, and=
 the United States is going to be in that position very soon because they h=
ave too much debt.

Trump is so busy here being defensive about his business record that he's n=
ot understanding what the question is. He seems to think that Puerto Rico l=
egally can file for bankruptcy and the problem is they haven't done so, and=
 that what they need is a smarter leader/negotiator at the helm who can cle=
an up the balance sheet the way he would have in one of his real estate dea=
ls.

But the whole political issue is that a) Puerto Rico can't do this, legally=
 speaking, and b) the political party that Trump leads is blocking the Obam=
a administration from changing the law. But Trump has no idea what's going =
on and doesn't seem to be listening to Blitzer's questions.

It's easy to go numb to these kinds of things, roll your eyes at pedantic c=
overage, and say Trump's success so far shows voters don't care about small=
 details like whether or not the president has any idea what he's talking a=
bout.

But the fact of the matter is that very few people vote in primaries at all=
, and lots of people don't pay much attention to early campaign coverage. T=
he fact that Trump repeatedly shows up to interviews totally unprepared to =
discuss the issues of the day in an informed manner and proceeds to wing it=
 in an inconsistent and ideologically unpredictable way is important, and p=
eople need to keep hearing about it.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">DONALD TRUMP: As a very successful person I would bu=
y companies, throw them in a chapter, bankrupt it, negotiate =97 I would do=
 great deals, I didn't use them for myself, I used them as a businessperson=
. Many of the top people in my category
 use the laws. I know more about debt than practically anybody, I love debt=
. I also love reducing debt, and I know how to do it better than anybody. I=
 will tell you with Puerto Rico they have too much debt. You can't just res=
tructure; you have to use the laws,
 cut the debt way down, and get back to business, because they can't surviv=
e with the kind of debt they have. I would not bail out if I were =97 if I =
were in that position I wouldn't bail them out.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">WOLF BLITZER: Would you let them have a bankruptcy o=
ption?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">DONALD TRUMP: They're going to have no choice. if th=
ey're not going to pay the bill they're not going to pay the interest on th=
e bonds =97<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">WOLF BLITZER: They can't.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">DONALD TRUMP: They can't. You can't =97 you know, th=
e expression you can't take it out of the grave if they don't have it. Whet=
her they officially declare or not, but ultimately what they have to do is =
cut the debt way down. They're never
 going to pay that debt off, they have to cut it way down, and the United S=
tates is going to be in that position very soon because they have too much =
debt.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Trump is so busy here being defensive about his busi=
ness record that he's not understanding what the question is. He seems to t=
hink that Puerto Rico legally can file for bankruptcy and the problem is th=
ey haven't done so, and that what
 they need is a smarter leader/negotiator at the helm who can clean up the =
balance sheet the way he would have in one of his real estate deals.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">But the whole political issue is that a) Puerto Rico=
 can't do this, legally speaking, and b) the political party that Trump lea=
ds is blocking the Obama administration from changing the law. But Trump ha=
s no idea what's going on and doesn't
 seem to be listening to Blitzer's questions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">It's easy to go numb to these kinds of things, roll =
your eyes at pedantic coverage, and say Trump's success so far shows voters=
 don't care about small details like whether or not the president has any i=
dea what he's talking about.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">But the fact of the matter is that very few people v=
ote in primaries at all, and lots of people don't pay much attention to ear=
ly campaign coverage. The fact that Trump repeatedly shows up to interviews=
 totally unprepared to discuss the
 issues of the day in an informed manner and proceeds to wing it in an inco=
nsistent and ideologically unpredictable way is important, and people need =
to keep hearing about it.<o:p></o:p></p>
