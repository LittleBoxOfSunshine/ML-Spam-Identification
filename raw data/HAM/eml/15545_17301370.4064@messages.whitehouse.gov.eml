Subject: Travel Pool Report #8 -- Snyder booed

The speech here at the high school is technically open press, but we just=
 witnessed a pretty amazing moment, so your pooler wanted to pass it alon=
g.

Gov. Rick Snyder just came up to the podium to address the crowd of about=
 1,000 people in this gymnasium. He was instantly and loudly booed by the=
 entire crowd when his name was announced and as he came to the podium.

The crowd refused to quiet down for several moments, even as Snyder tried=
 to speak.

Snyder started by saying: "Let me begin by saying I understand why you ar=
e angry and frustrated. I want to come here today to apologize."

He could hardly get the words out over the boos and jeers. Your pooler co=
uldnt pick out specific chants or slogans, but just a general, angry loud=
, sound

The crowd got even angrier when Snyder said "we have a short-term water c=
risis" even as he continued that "we have a longer term issue about build=
ing a stronger city of Flint."

Snyder continued that "You didn't create this problem. Government failed =
you." Several people in the audience yelled "You failed us." Snyder conti=
nued that "I will apologize and work hard to fix that."

Snyder thanked POTUS for coming to Flint and thanked him for sending "out=
standign people" to the city over the last several months.

"I want to thank you for coming here today. This is an important moment t=
o show how we can work together," Snyder said.

There was another eruption of loud boos when Snyder said: "Thank you for =
the opportunity to come share a few thoughts with you today."

He left the stage quickly.
