THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 23, 2016

**

*FACT SHEET: United States-Vietnam Relations*



Relations between the United States and Vietnam are at a historic high fo=
llowing the establishment of the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership i=
n 2013 and the celebration of 20 years of diplomatic relations in 2015. T=
he Presidents visit to Vietnam builds on this positive momentum to cement=
 the progress of the last few years and propel our bilateral relationship=
 to the next level.=20



Engagement with Southeast Asia has been a central pillar of the U.S. Reba=
lance to Asia. The return on this investment is clearly evident in our re=
lations with Vietnam, where we have significantly increased trade and inv=
estment and expanded cooperation across the board.



*Our economic ties are strong and growing quickly. *Trade between our cou=
ntries has nearly tripled in the last seven years, and now tops $45 billi=
on. U.S. exports to Vietnam increased by 23 percent in 2015, the largest =
increase of our top 50 trade partners, and only one of two markets with d=
ouble-digit growth. At the same time, the United States remained Vietnams=
 largest export market, growing 24 percent year-on-year.=20



Economic ties between our countries are poised to expand even further wit=
h the implementation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, wh=
ich will hold nearly 40 percent of the worlds GDP accountable to the high=
est labor, environmental, and intellectual property rights standards of a=
ny previous trade agreement, while leveling the playing field for workers=
 and businesses. The United States is committed to helping Vietnam contin=
ue on its path of economic reforms, including efforts required to fully i=
mplement its commitments under the TPP through technical assistance. Thes=
e reforms will include work to ensure freedom of association, including i=
ndependent unions, and other internationally recognized labor rights; pro=
tection and enforcement of intellectual property; and environmental prote=
ction and sustainable growth.



U.S. investment in Vietnam has grown significantly over the past seven ye=
ars to nearly $1.5 billion. Through the recently-launched U.S.-ASEAN Conn=
ect initiative we are working with all ASEAN members, including Vietnam, =
to foster the policy environments that promote ASEAN economic integration=
, increase trade and investment, assist the development of clean energy a=
nd energy connectivity, and spur sustainable, innovation-led economic gro=
wth.



We are working with Vietnam toward a successful 2017 APEC host year and e=
nsuring that APEC continues to be an incubator for new ideas that spur in=
clusive economic growth, promote sustainable development, and advance tra=
de liberalization.=20



*We have expanded security cooperation. *We have expanded cooperation on =
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, including through the Pacifi=
c Partnership and Pacific Angel engagements and joint humanitarian traini=
ng exercises. The United States is strengthening security cooperation wit=
h Vietnam, including helping the government build its maritime security c=
apabilities, by providing more than $45.7 million since FY 2014 through t=
he State Departments Foreign Military Financing and law enforcement capac=
ity building programs. Additional assistance is provided through the Depa=
rtment of Defenses Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and Maritime Secu=
rity Initiative (MSI) funding, a regional initiative for which the Depart=
ment of Defense has committed $425 million over five years. At Vietnams r=
equest, we are pursuing providing 18 MetalShark 45-foot patrol boats, as =
well as training and maritime law enforcement equipment to the countrys C=
oast Guard. Our Navies are working more closely together to ensure mariti=
me security and safety.



The United States is supporting Vietnams efforts to contribute to UN peac=
ekeeping operations by assisting in the development of a peacekeeping tra=
ining center near Hanoi, as well as providing medical equipment to suppor=
t Vietnams UN pledge of a deployable Level II hospital.



We are working together to prevent North Koreas proliferation activities =
and to fully implement UNSCR 2270.



*U.S.-Vietnam people-to-people ties are stronger than ever. *Nearly 19,00=
0 Vietnamese now study in the United States -- 40 percent more than in 20=
09. Over 80,000 Vietnamese visited the United States in 2015, and many th=
ousands of Americans visited Vietnam. The new Fulbright University Vietna=
m (FUV), which opens in Ho Chi Minh City later this year, will help bring=
 world-class, independent education to Vietnam and deepen the ties betwee=
n our peoples. Over 13,000 Vietnamese are members of the Young Southeast =
Asia Leaders Initiative (YSEALI), more than any other ASEAN country excep=
t Indonesia. We are also connecting American universities with Vietnamese=
 higher education institutions to improve the quality of higher education=
 in Vietnam. The United States and Vietnam signed a Peace Corps country a=
greement during the Presidents visit.



*We have deepened cooperation on humanitarian and war legacy issues*. Vie=
tnam has provided critical assistance to our efforts to account for U.S. =
personnel missing in action from the war. We also continue to work with t=
he Vietnamese government to identify the remains of Vietnamese personnel =
lost during that period. The United States has contributed over $92 milli=
on since 1993 to address the threats posed by unexploded ordnances (UXO).=
 The United States has invested nearly $90 million in dioxin remediation =
at the Danang airport, a project that will finish next year. We have also=
 funded an environmental assessment at Bien Hoa airbase.=20



*We have expanded cooperation on regional and global challenges*. Vietnam=
 is a key partner on climate change, sustainable development, nuclear and=
 radioactive source security, advancing the Global Health Security Agenda=
, and wildlife trafficking. Vietnam is taking critical steps on climate c=
hange, including committing to join the Paris Agreement this year, develo=
ping plans to implement their climate targets, and the governments call t=
o review coal-fired power generation and move towards natural gas. The Un=
ited States has invested over $40 million since 2011 to help mitigate the=
 impacts of climate change in Vietnam, one of most vulnerable countries i=
n the world to its effects. We are helping Vietnam reduce greenhouse gas =
emissions from the agriculture, forestry, and energy sectors and building=
 resilience for communities in the Mekong River and Red River Deltas and =
along the coast of Vietnam. We are partnering with Vietnam to build capac=
ity to prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats, including thro=
ugh Vietnams five-year roadmap to achieve the targets of the Global Healt=
h Security Agenda and our joint effort to undertake and share external as=
sessments of capability.



We also work with Vietnam as part of the Lower Mekong Initiative (LMI) to=
 develop a regional approach to sustainable environmental management and =
strengthen capacity to manage shared water resources. We recently respond=
ed to Vietnams ongoing historic drought with a natural disaster declarati=
on and $50,000 for immediate assistance to those most affected. The Unite=
d States has provided $5 million to support Vietnams efforts to counter w=
ildlife trafficking, particularly strengthening law enforcement, and redu=
cing demand for illegal wildlife products. The United States and Vietnam =
have expanded cooperation in combating transnational crime, including thr=
ough the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to strengthen effective=
 border management in Vietnam through the establishment of border liaison=
 offices.



*We are actively promoting respect for human rights and religious freedom=
. *The United States supports a strong, prosperous, and independent Vietn=
am that promotes respect for human rights, open space for civil society, =
and the rule of law. The Vietnamese governments commitment to protect fun=
damental human rights is a crucial aspect of our bilateral relationship a=
nd continued progress in that area will enable the Vietnamese people and =
the U.S.-Vietnam partnership to reach its fullest potential.=20



During the April 25-26 annual U.S.-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue, the Uni=
ted States called on Vietnam to release all prisoners of conscience and c=
ease harassment of individuals exercising their fundamental freedoms, inc=
luding those relating to expression, assembly, and religion. Our two coun=
tries have increased cooperation on disability rights and the rights of L=
GBT persons in the UN Human Rights Council. We also welcome Vietnams rati=
fication in 2015 of the UN Convention Against Torture and the UN Conventi=
on on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and will continue to urge =
their full implementation.=20



The Vietnamese government has pledged to institute legal reforms to bring=
 Vietnams laws into compliance with its international commitments and its=
 2013 constitution, which contains a new dedicated chapter on human right=
s. We are also supporting legal education in Vietnam by working with Viet=
namese law schools through the United Nations Development Programme. We c=
ontinue to explore ways that the United States can work with Vietnam to s=
upport both legal reform and the rule of law, including through a new Let=
ter of Agreement on Law Enforcement andCriminal Justice Sector Assistance=
. U.S. and Vietnamese officials and academic experts also have increased =
exchanges of best practices on key laws, including the Law on Religion an=
d Belief and the Law on Association. USAIDs economic engagement with Viet=
nam supports strengthening the rule of law and raises standards in key ar=
eas. Working with Vietnam to ensure it meets the high standards of the TP=
P agreement offers an unprecedented opportunity to make progress on labor=
 rights.



*The U.S.-Vietnam relationship is poised for progress. *In the years ahea=
d, we look forward to working with the new Vietnamese government to stren=
gthen our cooperation on the increasingly wide range of shared interests =
between our countries and deepen the bonds between our peoples.
