This month, we celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month by marking the impo=
rtant contributions that Jews have made to American life.<br>
<br>
From a young age,&nbsp;<b>my parents taught me</b> that a central tenet of =
our faith is tikkun olam =E2=80=93 &nbsp;repairing the world. <b>As active =
citizens and as Jews, they helped me understand that we have a responsibili=
ty to advocate for others and on behalf of justice and righteousness.</b><b=
r>
<br>
This year's theme - <b>Jewish contributions to</b> education - builds upon =
that legacy of tikkun olam. <b>Jewish Americans have been contribution to e=
ducation throughout our history.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;We know that education can =
be the silver bullet for parents who want to give their children a better l=
ife or a chance to escape the cycle of poverty. Education is also our best =
defense against bigotry and ignorance in society. By fighting for a better =
education for all Americans, we can do our part to repair our country and t=
he world.<br>
<br>
There's a reason why two-thirds of Jews identify with the Democratic Party:=
 because the Democratic Party's values are in sync with the values of the J=
ewish community, like tzedakah, or charity, gemilut hasadim, the gift of lo=
ving kindness, and the cause of social justice. This Jewish American Herita=
ge Month, I'm proud to call myself a Democrat because I know that we are no=
t only advancing the causes of our party but of the Jewish faith.<br>
