For everyone to count, we must count everyone<http://www.sun-sentinel.com/o=
pinion/commentary/fl-viewpoint-count-1207-20151204-story.html>

by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz for the Sun Sentinel

In March of this year I joined a pilgrimage to Selma, Ala., to commemorate =
the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, a pivotal moment that led to greater=
 understanding of the need to protect the rights of every American. It led =
to President Lyndon Johnson<http://www.sun-sentinel.com/topic/politics-gove=
rnment/government/presidents-of-the-united-states/lyndon-b.-johnson-PEHST00=
0117-topic.html>signing the Voting Rights Act<http://www.sun-sentinel.com/t=
opic/politics-government/government/voting-rights-act-of-1965-EVGAP00065-to=
pic.html> in 1965 to ensure the voting rights guaranteed by the 13th and 15=
th amendments would be protected and enforced.

Two years ago the Voting Rights Act was effectively gutted, and now, the sa=
me organization that led that legal attack is at it again. On Dec. 8, the S=
upreme Court will hear oral arguments in Evenwel v. Abbott, a case that thr=
eatens political representation for some of our country's most vulnerable =
=97 our nation's children. When the plaintiff's lawyers address the bench t=
hey will argue states must exclude large segments of their populations when=
 drawing legislative districts simply because they cannot vote.

Imagine what it would mean if we applied that kind of exclusion in other ar=
eas. What would it mean for school districts if school children weren't cou=
nted for purposes of government funding? What if we pretended countless oth=
ers were ignored when allocating transportation dollars for the maintenance=
 of roads and bridges?

No government can close its eyes to large portions of the people it is supp=
osed to represent. No democracy can work if government officials aren't acc=
ountable to the people in their districts, whether they vote or not.

That's why the Democratic National Committee filed an amicus or "friend of =
the court" brief in this case. We are joining hands with other concerned ci=
tizens and civil rights organizations to stand up for our belief that Ameri=
cans, regardless of their age, where they live, or if they're currently abl=
e to vote, deserve political representation.

The Children's Defense Fund noted in its own brief that leaving out 23 perc=
ent of the American population who are children would result in those child=
ren and their families having "less access to critical resources, including=
 quality education, health care, and services supporting children living at=
 or below the poverty line."

While Sue Evenwel, the plaintiff, is a member of the Texas Republican Party=
, her position is so extreme that the Republican governor of Texas is the d=
efendant who opposes her.

Take a minute to consider: If Evenwel has her way, a full 30 percent of Afr=
ican-Americans would be left out of our democracy for purposes of represent=
ation. The same holds true for one-third of Native Americans, 45 percent of=
 Asian Americans and a majority, 55 percent, of Hispanics.

The Democratic Party will continue to work diligently to shed light on this=
 egregious attack on our democracy.

I was among the countless Americans moved to tears, smiles and chills by th=
e sight of President Obama and Congressman John Lewis<http://www.sun-sentin=
el.com/topic/politics-government/government/john-lewis-PEPLT003911-topic.ht=
ml> walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge a few months ago. The steps tak=
en half a century ago in the struggle for equality and the blood men and wo=
men like Lewis left on that bridge, paved the way for equal representation,=
 and the idea that any child could grow up to be president. Removing a chil=
d's voice today would have an equally significant impact going forward.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz<http://www.sun-sentinel.com/topic/politics-governm=
ent/government/debbie-wasserman-schultz-PEPLT005868-topic.html> represents =
Florida's 23rd congressional district and serves as the chairwoman of the D=
emocratic National Committee.
