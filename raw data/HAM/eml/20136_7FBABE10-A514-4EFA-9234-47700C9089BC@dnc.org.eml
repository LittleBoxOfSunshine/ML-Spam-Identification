Well that is a pickle for you.  It seems silly to me to try and force something that would be less than successful just because that weekend works in their time.

I would just tell them the truth and explain what is happening. Did we request that weekend or did they give it to us? Can we go anywhere else in the country.    Ask Clayton about Nebraska and Wyoming. I think if we can be proactive in helping them cross off this list it would help when we give them bad news.

Hey there! Just wanted to give you an update on this. DWS wants to go to VA June 2-4 but Sen Kaine has his annual retreat that weekend and everyone is coming up to NOVA for it.

I burned through two hosts today since they're going up here for the retreat. Ive got a few more to try tomorrow but it's likely that they'll be coming up for the retreat too. Just bad timing.

I still think a VA swing is a good idea but that particular weekend just doesn't seem to make sense. We're going to raise a lot less $ than we otherwise could. The alternative is to try and get a few meetings but I think that's just as likely to go poorly. Folks just won't be around or responsive.

I'd like to go back to her team and suggest we go a different time but I'm having flashbacks to Kate's reaction on Hawaii.

Thoughts on what you'd like me to do? Thanks!
