TOLEDO BLADE // TOM TROY

The chairmen of the Ohio and Indiana Democratic parties today blasted Ohio =
Gov. John Kasich for his continuing absence from Ohio and for his withdrawa=
l from campaigning in Indiana for the Republican presidential nomination.

Ohio Democratic Chairman David Pepper said Mr. Kasich should disclose the c=
ost of the state troopers assigned to provide him with protection, and said=
 revealing that information would not endanger him.

=93Not only is John Kasich not reimbursing taxpayers for the hundreds of th=
ousands of dollars, he=92s not even coming clean with how much he=92s spend=
ing,=94 Mr. Pepper said.

The fact-checking organization PolitiFact.com said the cost of Gov. Kasich=
=92s security on the campaign trail through March 2 was $475,976.

The Kasich campaign has refused to disclose details about his security.

The governor=92s official spokesman in Columbus and his campaign spokesman =
did not immediately responded to emails from The Blade about the issue.

=93We=92ve been watching the governor traipse all over the country, talking=
 to voters, holding town halls, eating all kinds of things. He=92s been gon=
e 195 days and counting outside Ohio. Ohio has a lot of big issues and he h=
as not been here to here to address them,=94 Mr. Pepper said.

He said Mr. Kasich has become =93a lame duck a lot sooner than you normally=
 would see in a second term.=94

John Zody, the Indiana chairman, said Mr. Kasich=92s statements are confusi=
ng because he won=92t campaign for their votes, though he has kept a date f=
or a fund-raiser.

=93He's happy to ask Hoosiers for money, but not for votes," Mr. Zody said.

Mr. Kasich and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas announced on Sunday night that they w=
ould split their efforts in Indiana, Oregon, and New Mexico with the goal o=
f preventing Donald Trump from getting to the 1,237 delegates needed to win=
 on the first ballot at the convention. Under the plan, Mr. Kasich canceled=
 his campaign appearances in Indiana and Mr. Cruz is to stay out of Oregon =
and New Mexico.

Flailing Cruz-Kasich alliance puzzles Indiana politicos<http://www.talkmedi=

TALK MEDIA NEWS // WASHINGTON DESK

The shaky alliance between Republican presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz=
 (R-Texas) and Ohio Governor John Kasich has left Indiana officials from bo=
th parties baffled.

The joint-campaign strategy announced Sunday evening is centered on Kasich =
declining to campaign in Indiana in exchange for Cruz staying out of Oregon=
 and New Mexico.

The two candidates=92 goal is to allow the other to perform in the respecti=
ve states in order to prevent GOP front-runner Donald Trump from attaining =
the 1,237 delegates needed to capture the Republican nomination.

=93I have a lot of questions,=94 Indiana State Representative Mike Karickho=
ff, a Kasich for America Indiana Co-Chair, told the Kokomo Tribune on Monda=
y.

Karickhoff said he was in the campaign=92s conference call detailing the de=
cision, but that it only lasted 10 minutes.

Indiana Democratic party chair John Zody accused Kasich of =93confusing Hoo=
sier voters,=94 noting during a conference call with reporters Tuesday that=
 Kasich is cancelling a campaign appearance but still attending a closed-do=
or fundraiser in the state.

=93He=92s happy to ask Hoosiers for their money, just not for their votes,=
=94 Zody said.

The terms of the alliance seem to be confusing to the candidates=92 themsel=
ves.

While Cruz=92 campaign manager Jeff Roe said he was hopeful =93allies of bo=
th campaigns would follow our lead=94 in order to clear the fields in the r=
espective states, Kasich said Monday that Indiana voters should still suppo=
rt him.

=93I=92ve never told them not to vote for me,=94 Kasich said during a campa=
ign stop in Pennsylvania the morning after the deal was announced. =93They =
ought to vote for me.=94

Adding to the confusion, a top representative for Kasich=92s campaign in In=
diana gave contradictory statements on whether Kasich was still seeking vot=
es.

=93Kasich is asking his supporters in Indiana to vote for Cruz so Trump doe=
s not win Indiana,=94 Jim Brainard, mayor of Carmel, Indiana and a state co=
-chair for Kasich=92s campaign, told the Indianapolis Star Monday.

However, in a statement given to Bloomberg, Brainard said that he would not=
 specifically urge Kasich supporters to back Cruz.

=93Voters are smart, and they=92ll figure out what they need to do,=94 Brai=
nard said.
