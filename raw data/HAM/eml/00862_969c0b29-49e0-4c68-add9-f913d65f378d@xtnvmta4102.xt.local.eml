JetBlue also has Federal Hill Group on its payroll.

MCGIVERN ON SENTENCING REFORM: Tim McGivern is joining the fight for criminal justice reform. The longtime AT&T lobbyist - and close associate of Paul Ryan - now at Ogilvy Government Relations will lobby on the Sentencing Reform Act, Recidivism Risk Reduction Act and Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act for advocacy group the U.S. Justice Action Network. McGivern still represents AT&T and also lobbies for the Cellular Telecom & Internet Association, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, Pfizer and Verizon. This year, the U.S. Justice Action Network also hired Republic Consulting and Monument Policy Group. 

INTERNATIONAL: Cypress Advocacy is lobbying for the Turkish Institute for Progress on U.S.-Turkey immigration and education issues. The team includes Managing Director Mike Haywood [former legislative assistant for former Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.)], Director Steve Pavlick [former staffer to former Sen. George Allen (R-Va.) and the NRSC] and Principal Jim Freeman (former senior legislative director for the National Association of Realtors). The institute also has Mercury in its corner. Among other things, the organization, formed last year, tries to influence states and school districts to not teach the 1915 Armenian massacres as a genocide.

MACK THE KNIFE: Former Rep. Connie Mack, lobbying against the Puerto Rico debt deal on behalf of bondholders, ticked off House leadership by circulating a list of conservative voices opposing the bill - except many of the names on the list refuted that claim, POLITICO's Colin Wilhelm reports. The National Taxpayers Union, the Republican Study Committee, the Heritage Foundation, multiple members of Congress and conservative pundit George Will all denied they're against the legislation, as Mack claimed.

- "The deceptive efforts to mislead on Puerto Rico have backfired," said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan.

- Mack's email "kind of struck me as odd at best and desperate at worst," said Ryan Ellis, a Republican consultant contracting for the lobbying firm Akin Gump.

- "It's unfortunate that a former member of Congress would put himself in a situation to spread dishonest information," said Javier Ortiz, executive director of the Puerto Rico Economic Recovery Initiative, another group backing the legislation. 

GRAIN STORAGE? The recently formed Direct Selling Caucus introduced its first bill, the Anti-Pyramid Promotional Scheme Act of 2016 (H.R. 5230). Sponsor and caucus chair Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who sold books with Southwestern Company to put herself through college, says the bill will help distinguish legitimate businesses from pyramid schemes. But critics such as the League of United Latin American Citizens say the bill seeks to define pyramid schemes narrowly to undermine the FTC's efforts to stop pyramid schemes. American Continental Group lobbies for the Direct Selling Association, which represents controversial multi-level marketing companies such as Herbalife.

MERGER MAYHEM: A wave of consolidation in the agriculture sector is raising concerns of anti-competitive practices by farmers and legislators, reports Jacob Bunge for The Wall Street Journal. Bayer's bid for Monsanto will put a majority of the corn-seed and pesticide market in the hands of three companies. President of the National Farmers Union Roger Johnson and director of biotechnology at the National Corn Growers Association Nathan Fields plan to bolster efforts in making their case before lawmakers.

 Lincoln Policy Group. Bayer's include Greenberg Traurig and Gephardt Group.

WHOSE CAMPAIGN IS IT ANYWAY?

David Balto, an antitrust lawyer who is organizing the campaign on behalf of hospitals and unions, says the funding isn't relevant. The group has also hired the Smoot Tewes Group, 270 Strategies, Strategies 360, Graff Public Solutions, and Remington Road Group.
