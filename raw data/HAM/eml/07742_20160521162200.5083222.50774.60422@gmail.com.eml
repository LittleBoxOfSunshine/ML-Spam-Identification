Why not release it monday morning and make the first available interview Cu=
mmings and the Chair on the Andrea Mitchell show. If you do it earlier, the=
 Bernie people will go on TV. I think if the names leak earlier that is fin=
e. We dont have to confirm and can say it is being announced on monday. Thi=
s way Sanders doesn't get the jump on criticism.=20
