For the next few months, you're gonna hear a whole lot about red states and=

We've got to use every moment between now and November 8th to reach as many=
 voters as we can -- from Maine to Hawaii. That means we need to get organi=
zed everywhere, right now.

So I'm calling on you to help out the only folks who are committed to elect=
ing Democrats up and down the ballot in all 50 states by pitching in $10 or=
 more before the DNC's end-of-May deadline.

Thank you, NAME. I really appreciate your support.

Subject: Three things

Friend --

This election comes down to three simple things:

1. We've got to elect a Democratic president. We just have to -- because we=
've seen who the alternative is.

2. Because we know that no president can do everything alone, we have to ge=
t more Democrats in Congress who will work with them. And this year, we hav=
e a great opportunity to take back our majority in the Senate and make seri=
ous gains in the House.

3. There are so many important decisions that are being made in our stateho=
uses, from funding for women's health services to protecting the rights of =
our LGBT neighbors. So we've got to elect Democratic governors and legislat=
ors in STATE and all across the country.

NAME, the Democratic National Committee is the only official Democratic Par=
ty organization that is committed to all three -- to electing Democrats in =
every state at every level of office.

So before the deadline at the end of this month, I'm asking you to support =
them with a donation of $10 or more. Can you step up?

LINK

Thanks, NAME.

Joe
