Perry on Trump Endorsement: "We Let Bygones be Bygones"<https://www.texastribune.org/2016/05/06/perry-defends-trump-endorsement/>

*         by Patrick Svitek<https://www.texastribune.org/about/staff/patrick-svitek/>

Former Gov. Rick Perry<http://www.texastribune.org/directory/rick-perry/> on Friday defended his endorsement of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee whom Perry once called a "cancer on conservatism."
Speaking with reporters in Austin, Perry said his previous remarks assailing Trump were part of a heated process that ultimately leads to the Republican Party unifying behind its nominee.
"We are competitors, and so the rhetoric is in the heat of battle. It's in the chaos of a presidential bid," Perry said, also noting his criticism of Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign. "If no one doesn't understand that, then they don't understand how our process of elections work. We compete and then we let bygones by bygones."
Perry also acknowledged he was respecting the will of the voters, saying the nominating process has led to Trump. "There seems to me to be comfort with Donald Trump in the Republican Party at this point in time," Perry said.
A day earlier, Perry enthusiastically endorsed Trump<https://www.texastribune.org/2016/05/05/perry-endorses-trump-president/> in an interview with CNN, a remarkable about face for a former candidate who was the first in the GOP field to sound the alarm about the billionaire's candidacy. After dropping out, Perry went on to endorse U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz<http://www.texastribune.org/directory/ted-cruz/> of Texas, whose exit from the race Tuesday set in motion Trump's rise to presumptive nominee.
"We are competitors, and so the rhetoric is in the heat of battle. It's in the chaos of a presidential bid. "- Former Gov. Rick Perry

Asked whether he'd advise Cruz to support Trump, Perry replied that Cruz "has the intellect and the character to make the right decision on his timetable."
"I think anybody who's ever been through one of these things before, there's a little bit of raw feelings," Perry said. "It takes just a little bit of time to get over some of it, and I certainly am willing and Donald Trump is willing to give those competitors the time to think this through, but at the end of the day, we're going to support the Republican nominee."
In his interview with CNN, Perry expressed some openness to serving as Trump's running mate. He did so again Friday, not ruling out the possibility.
"I will entertain helping my country," Perry said. "I have no idea what that might detail, what that form may be in."
Perry spoke with reporters following the unveiling of his official portrait Friday morning at the Texas Capitol. Earlier Friday morning, Trump thanked Perry on Twitter for his endorsement, which called Trump "one of the most talented people who has ever run for the president I have ever seen."
Despite the praise, Perry told reporters it has been a while since he has checked in with his former rival. "We haven't had a conversation in probably six months," Perry said.

RICK PERRY SAID DONALD TRUMP'S RHETORIC WAS "DAMAGING TO OUR PARTY, AND MOST IMPORTANT, DAMAGING TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"

Perry: "What Mr. Trump Is Offering Is Not Conservatism, It Is Trump-Ism - A Toxic Mix Of Demagoguery And Nonsense." "Gov. Rick Perry today released the following statement regarding Donald Trump's ongoing comments about Governor Perry and border security: 'Donald Trump continues to demonstrate his fundamental misunderstanding of border security. Make no mistake - border security is a federal responsibility, but when I met with President Obama last year and it became clear he would not act, I told him if he would not secure the border, Texas would. Rather than thanking Texas for stepping into a gap it shouldn't have to fill, Mr. Trump has made clear that he believes the states should fend for themselves on border security. Not only is this wrong, it perpetuates the same failed policies that have left our southern border porous and vulnerable. I have a message for my fellow Republicans and the independents who will be voting in the primary process: what Mr. Trump is offering is not conservatism, it is Trump-ism - a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense." [Perry for President, 7/16/15<https://rickperry.org/donald-trump-border-security-comments>]

Perry Said Donald Trump's Rhetoric Was "Damaging To Our Party, And Most Important, Damaging To The United States Of America." "And I've been honest about our party's shortcomings - including my own - in engaging all Americans in our conversations about the future of this nation. But we can't do that if we're pitting black against white against brown; rich against poor; women against men. Playing identity politics takes a page right out of the Democrats' playbook, and we Republicans are better than that.That's why rhetoric such as the kind employed by Donald Trump is damaging - it's damaging to our party, and most important, damaging to the United States of America. I believe strongly that Mr. Trump's philosophy is not conservatism, but rather a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense." [Rick Perry, National Review, 7/20/15<http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421364/rick-perry-says-trumps-mccain-smear-disqualifies-him>]

Perry: Trump Does Not "Represent The Republican Party That I Represent." "PERRY: ... competent -- well, listen, he doesn't reflect the Republican Party from my position. I mean, when he said what he said about immigrants in this country and used very inflammatory language, when he said what he said about veterans in this country and people who have gotten captured -- I don't know about anybody else. I'll speak for myself. He didn't represent the Republican Party that I represent." [Hannity, Fox News, 7/20/15]

RICK PERRY HAS CALLED DONALD TRUMP "UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF

Perry Had "No Confidence" That Donald Trump Could Adeptly Lead The Armed Forces. "As a veteran and the son of a veteran, I find Mr. Trump's brand of vitriol particularly offensive, and I have no confidence that he could adeptly lead our nation's armed forces. His comments over the weekend should completely and immediately disqualify him from seeking our nation's highest office." [Rick Perry, National Review, 7/20/15<http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421364/rick-perry-says-trumps-mccain-smear-disqualifies-him>]

Perry: Donald Trump's Comments On Veterans "Make Him Unfit To Be Commander-In-Chief." "Donald Trump should apologize immediately for attacking Senator McCain and all veterans who have protected and served our country. As a veteran and an American, I respect Sen. McCain because he volunteered to serve his country. I cannot say the same of Mr. Trump. His comments have reached a new low in American politics. His attack on veterans make him unfit to be Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces, and he should immediately withdraw from the race for President." [Perry for President, Press Release, 7/18/15<https://rickperry.org/gov-perry-donald-trumps-comments-make-him-unfit-to-be-commander-in-chief>]

Perry Said Trump's Comments About John McCain's War Record Were Past Offensive To "Those Of Us Who Have Worn The Uniform Of This Country." "PERRY: But I want to go back to this issue about saying that John McCain is not a war hero and that he doesn't like to be around people who were captured. That is offensive. I mean, it's past offensive, Sean, to those of us who have worn the uniform of this country. Sam Johnson, who I served in the Texas legislature with, spent over seven years in that POW camp. To offend those individuals -- but to offend their families and to offend those that went through this period of time, it's just -- from my perspective, Donald Trump does not have the character, nor does he have the temperament to be the commander-in-chief of our military forces. I'm just stunned." [Hannity, Fox News, 7/20/15]

Perry: Donald Trump's "Absurdity Reached A New Low" When He Insulted Sen. John McCain. "Mr. Trump's absurdity reached a new low over the weekend, when he spit in the eye of every American prisoner of war, particularly Senator John McCain. But frankly, we should expect no better from a man who couldn't be bothered to answer the call to serve his nation when it needed him most." [Rick Perry, National Review, 7/20/15<http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421364/rick-perry-says-trumps-mccain-smear-disqualifies-him>]

 Perry and border security: &#8216;Donald Trump continues to demonstrate his fundamental misunderstanding of border security. Make no mistake &#8211; border security is a federal responsibility, but when I met with President Obama last year and it became clear he would
 not act, I told him if he would not secure the border, Texas would. Rather than thanking Texas for stepping into a gap it shouldn&#8217;t have to fill, Mr. Trump has made clear that he believes the states should fend for themselves on border security. Not only is
 this wrong, it perpetuates the same failed policies that have left our southern border porous and vulnerable. I have a message for my fellow Republicans and the independents who will be voting in the primary process: what Mr. Trump is offering is not conservatism,
 it is Trump-ism &#8211; a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense.&#8221; [Perry for President,

 our conversations about the future of this nation. But we can&#8217;t do that if we&#8217;re pitting black against white against brown; rich against poor; women against men. Playing identity politics takes a page right out of the Democrats&#8217; playbook, and we Republicans
 are better than that.That&#8217;s why rhetoric such as the kind employed by Donald Trump is damaging &#8212; it&#8217;s damaging to our party, and most important, damaging to the United States of America. I believe strongly that Mr. Trump&#8217;s philosophy is not conservatism, but
