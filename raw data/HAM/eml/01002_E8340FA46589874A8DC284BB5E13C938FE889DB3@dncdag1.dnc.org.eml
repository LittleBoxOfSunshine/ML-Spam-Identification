Hope all is well.

I am trying to track down a donor photo from President Obama's visit to Atl=
anta on March 29th during the clutch before his speech on addiction. The ph=
oto is of donors Javarro Edwards and his wife Tiffany Cochran Edwards with =
POTUS and if you could please help me find a digital copy of the picture th=
at would be a huge help.

Photo of them is attached.

Thank you!
