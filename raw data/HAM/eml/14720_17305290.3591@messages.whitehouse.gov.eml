THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release May 16, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20





1:07 P.M. EDT





 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Hope you all had a wonderful wee=
kend. I do not have any announcements to begin, so we can go straight to =
questions.=20



 Kathleen, do you want to start?



 Q Sure. I'm going to start with the Supreme Court decision or non-decisi=
on on the contraceptive agreement. I'm wondering if you view this move as=
 a clear result of the vacancy on the Court, and if you have any thoughts=
 on whether or not you think the Court is intentionally dodging contentio=
us issues at this point.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that we obviously were pleased=
 with the announcement from the Supreme Court today. It will allow millio=
ns of women across the country to continue to get the health care coverag=
e that they need. So this obviously is an outcome that we are pleased to =
see.



 Our concerns about the continued vacancy on the Supreme Court persist. I=
n this case, based on, again, the announcement from the Supreme Court, it=
's not obvious that an additional justice would have yielded a different =
result, but I haven't heard anybody make the argument that leaving the Su=
preme Court of the United States short-staffed is somehow good for the co=
untry. The argument that we've heard from Republicans is that they don't =
want to confirm another of President Obamas nominees to the Supreme Court=
, and they have made that declaration based solely on partisan reasons. A=
nd many Republicans are having a tough time explaining to their constitue=
nts why they refuse to do their job simply because the Republican leader =
in the Senate has requested that they do so.



 There are Presidents in both parties that made a strong case for the Sen=
ate fulfilling their constitutional duty. And it was President Reagan who=
 observed that a protracted vacancy on the Supreme Court didnt serve the =
American people well. And President Obama has made exactly the same case.=




 Q And as for the substance of the issue, are you confident that the admi=
nistration and these groups can come to some sort of compromise at this p=
oint? Do you think theres a compromise to be had?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is true is the administration has put fo=
rward an accommodation that ensures that women, nationwide, have access t=
o health care, including contraceptive coverage -- without pay, I might a=
dd -- while also protecting religious liberty. And we were pleased to ann=
ounce this accommodation and to demonstrate that we were committed to bot=
h principles.



 Now, whats also true is there may be another process that plays out, bec=
ause ultimately that was the announcement that's been remanded to lower c=
ourts. And we'll obviously continue to engage in the process. But we obvi=
ously are pleased that the announcement today from the Supreme Court prot=
ects the ability of millions of women nationwide to continue to get acces=
s to their health care.



 Q Okay. And switching topics. On Libya, the announcement out of Vienna t=
hat the U.S. is backing the decision to lift the embargo and start arming=
 the government there. I'm wondering if -- obviously this has been a deci=
sion that the U.S. was reluctant to make because of the concerns of these=
 weapons falling into wrong hands, so I'm wondering if you could speak to=
 why you're confident now that the government there can control some of t=
hese arms at this point.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think my understanding of the way that this process=
 is working is that Government of National Accord that the international =
community has come to rally around is now in a position to make a specifi=
c request of weapons that they would like to see provided to forces in Li=
bya that are fighting ISIL and securing the country. And the United Natio=
ns will review that request and determine whether or not that is a reques=
t that can be agreed to in a way that doesnt exacerbate our concerns that=
 those weapons could fall into the wrong hands.



 So this is the beginning of the process, not the end of it. But it is an=
 indication that the international community is coming together in suppor=
t of the Government of National Accord in Libya thats seeking to bring so=
me long-sought political stability to that country. Libya has encountered=
 some significant challenges.=20



They had an authoritarian dictator that ruled that country for more than =
four decades that eroded almost all of the remaining institutions that ty=
pically are needed to govern a country. And it means that the Government =
of National Accord is essentially having to come in from the bottom up an=
d start building the infrastructure of a government to rule a country tha=
ts got a significant economy, particularly based on the natural resources=
 that they can sell on the global market, and a populace that has been di=
vided along tribal lines for a long time.



So this is a difficult challenge. And its important for the international=
 community to come together in support of this Government of National Acc=
ord so that the Libyan people can finally have the kind of government tha=
t reflects their preferences.



Q But as a sign of -- a vote of confidence in this government, should we =
expect that then, particularly in the campaign against ISIS, that the U.S=
. and the coalition will start to be more engaged in Libya? Should we exp=
ect more Special Operations or airstrikes, or is this sort of the first s=
tep towards an increased involvement in Libya on that front?



MR. EARNEST: Ultimately, our goal would be to build up the capacity of th=
e Government of National Accord so they could begin doing this work of fi=
ghting ISIL and securing their own country themselves. That ultimately is=
 the goal, so that the United States and the rest of the international co=
mmunity doesnt have to come in and fight this fight for them.



But, as I mentioned, they are doing some very basic work that -- to sort =
of build up the institutions of that country. And its going to require a =
lot of broader international support in order for them to succeed in that=
 effort.



So the United States has already taken military strikes against ISIL targ=
ets in Libya, and when necessary, to take additional strikes to protect t=
he American people, we wont hesitate to do so. So back in November, as a =
result of a U.S. military airstrike, there was -- the leading ISIL figure=
 in Libya was killed. There was another strike that was carried out earli=
er this year that removed a number of ISIL fighters from the battlefield.=
 These are fighters who we were concerned were prepared to go out and car=
ry out a large-scale operation.



So weve used -- the President has ordered military action in Libya agains=
t ISIL targets in the past, and that continues to be an option. But that =
is not a substitute for building the capacity of a central government in =
Libya that can begin to secure that country and begin to take the fight t=
o ISIL in that country.



Tim.



Q Just a quick one on the House invitation for Ben Rhodes to appear tomor=
row. Theres been suggestions that he may not appear. Could you tell us de=
finitively if he will not appear tomorrow?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, the answers that you heard from me before are sti=
ll operative here. The truth is, it is Republicans in Congress who critic=
ized the Iran deal, who have got a lot to explain when it comes to saying=
 things about the Iran deal that didnt turn out to be true. And if they w=
ant to hold a hearing to determine whether or not Republicans were just w=
rong and badly misinformed, or if they were purposefully lying to the Ame=
rican people, then they can do that. There obviously would be ample time =
-- at least they should set aside ample time, because there are any numbe=
r of witnesses, including individuals who serve on the committee, who cou=
ld provide some significant insight.



I think whats true is, Tim, that previous administrations have been fairl=
y skeptical of these kinds of efforts, particularly because this isnt a w=
hole lot more than just a three-ring circus that Republicans are looking =
to organize up there. And so I dont have an answer for you. Were going to=
 continue to review the letter, but I think you can sense the not-so-thin=
ly-veiled skepticism about this whole exercise that Im displaying here.



Q But to be clear, hes not going?



MR. EARNEST: I dont have a definitive answer for you. I dont have a defin=
itive answer for you. Anything else?



Q Mr. Trump is saying that hes unlikely to have a good relationship with =
Britains David Cameron. Does this have any -- does this jeopardize the re=
lationship the United States has with Britain?



MR. EARNEST: Well, again, Ill let the individual presidential candidates =
express their own views about what they hope to do to strengthen our alli=
ances around the world.



 President Obama, obviously, over the course of his tenure in office has =
invested deeply in our alliances around the world because of the importan=
t benefits those alliances bring to the American people, both in terms of=
 economic security but also when it comes to our national security. And t=
he President has invested deeply in the special relationship that the Uni=
ted States and the UK have enjoyed for centuries, and the President certa=
inly believes that thats an alliance thats worthy of an investment.



 Q Yesterday at Rutgers, we saw the President criticize policies of a cer=
tain Republican, one by one.



 MR. EARNEST: Youre talking about Jim Inhofe?



 Q No, not that one.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Oh, okay. Well, he was the only one that was specifically m=
entioned in the speech.



 Q On Mr. Trumps policies, is this kind of a signal that were going to se=
e the President open up a little bit more?



 MR. EARNEST: Mr. Trump wasnt mentioned in the speech, though, Tim. (Laug=
hter.) Mr. Inhofe was, though.=20



 Q Right. Is it likely well see --=20



 MR. EARNEST: I think that what Im trying to illustrate here is that this=
 is a -- the concerns that President Obama raised were not new but are co=
ncerns that extend broadly throughout the Republican Party. The President=
 talked a lot about the continued insistence by Republicans to deny the f=
act of climate change in the face of overwhelming evidence and already-ob=
served impacts. Republicans continue to deny that this is even taking pla=
ce, and the President highlighted the example of Senator Inhofe, in the m=
iddle of winter, bringing a snowball to the floor of the United States Se=
nate, and suggesting that somehow this confirmed his denial of science. E=
ven years later, its difficult to explain exactly what he was trying to i=
llustrate.



 Its not that difficult, however, to make clear what the President was tr=
ying to illustrate, which is that our country has long benefitted from po=
litical leaders that are not seeking to deny evidence and facts and scien=
ce in order to advance a political agenda, but actually to focus on evide=
nce and science and facts to make an argument about improving the country=
 and moving the country forward and living up to the values that we have =
long fought for.=20



 These are not new arguments that President Obama has made. For example, =
the President talked about the fact that, The biggest challenges we face =
cannot be solved in isolation. I know that many of your colleagues, Tim, =
suggested that that might have been a shot at one presidential candidate =
or another. The truth is, that sounds like just a few more words for yes,=
 we can. And I think whats important for people to understand about the P=
residents speech is these are values that he fought for as a candidate fo=
r President and that he has spent the last seven and a half years fightin=
g for in office. This has been his approach to problem-solving. Its been =
his approach to leading the country. Its been his approach to leading the=
 world. And the country and the world are better off for it.



 Q Just one more on the speech yesterday. While he didnt mention Trumps n=
ame, he did go after the wall policy and he did go after the temporary ba=
n on Muslims. And Im curious whether we might hear more from the Presiden=
t on Mr. Trumps treatment of women.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, Tim, there are a variety of Republican candida=
tes and a variety of Republican officeholders who have suggested that a r=
eligious test should be imposed on individuals seeking to enter the Unite=
d States. And for the reasons that the President outlined in the speech, =
that is inconsistent with our values and its inconsistent with a smart st=
rategy to destroy ISIL. So, again, this is not an argument about one pres=
idential candidate; this is an argument about many leaders in a political=
 party that have eschewed evidence because it is inconvenient to the poli=
tical argument that they want to make.



 Thats particularly dangerous when youre talking about something like the=
 national security of the United States and the danger that the Republica=
n strategy poses to our efforts to coordinate with Muslims in America and=
 Muslims around the world to fight ISIL. Those are some of our most impor=
tant partners. And to alienate them is unwise, to put it mildly.



 Michelle.



 Q Thanks, Josh. You mentioned being satisfied with this ACA decision, th=
e status quo is intact. But isnt this disappointing that its going back a=
nd, at the very least, will probably lead to a compromise that is less th=
an what you originally would have liked to have seen?



 MR. EARNEST: No, we were gratified by the ruling today. And this announc=
ement does ensure that millions of women across the country can continue =
to have access to their health care. And it is a reflection of something =
that we have long believed, which is that it is possible to prioritize bo=
th access to health care for everybody while protecting the religious lib=
erty of every American. Thats what we sought to do, and we obviously are =
pleased that this is something that will continue to remain in effect.



 Q Things could change at the lower court level, though. And I mean, in t=
erms of trying to find a compromise, that could morph in a way that you m=
ight not agree with, right?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I dont know how the process is going to play o=
ut so well see.



 Q Okay. And seeing how this was the result of an evenly divided Court, a=
nd looking at how this could have gone another way if the President had a=
 nominee that was accepted prior to this, so do you expect this to just s=
olidify opposition to taking up Garland? And I mean, in a sense, Republic=
ans could see this as the status quo working for them in some ways. Do yo=
u feel like thats a possibility?



 MR. EARNEST: I have no idea what Republicans will conclude. The truth is=
, all the Democrats and at least a couple of the Republicans have conclud=
ed that Chief Judge Garland, the most experienced Supreme Court nominee i=
n American history when you consider his 19 years of service on the feder=
al bench, is somebody who is deserving of a fair hearing and a yes-or-no =
vote. Its even Republicans who have described him as a consensus nominee.=




 And I did take note of something that Leader McConnell said last week th=
at in some ways I think actually makes the case as strongly as anything t=
hat Ive been able to come up with. Senator McConnell, speaking on the flo=
or of the House of -- or Im sorry, of the United States Senate -- and thi=
s is not something that we had to dig into the archives on and find on C-=
SPAN from three decades ago but rather something that he said last week. =
Senator McConnell: We are going to give the Senate every opportunity to d=
o the basic work of government this year, he said. Some have said that be=
cause it is an election year we cant do much. I would like to remind ever=
yone that we have had a regularly scheduled election in this country ever=
y two years since 1788 right on time. I heard some people say we cant do =
it because we have an election next year, and others have said we cant do=
 whatever it is because we have an election this year. We have elections =
in this year right on time, and that is not an excuse not to do our work.=
 I think Senator McConnell said it quite well.=20



Q Okay. Now that we have sort of the fruits, were seeing this happen now =
that we only have eight people on the Supreme Court. So how big of a conc=
ern is it that were going to see this happen again and again?



MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it is unclear exactly what role the pro=
tracted vacancy on the Supreme Court had on this -- the outcome here, in =
part because the announcement reflected the unanimous view of the justice=
s. Now, would they have been able to cobble together a different agreemen=
t if Justice Scalia were still alive and serving on the bench, or if Chie=
f Judge Garland had been confirmed as he should be to the Supreme Court? =
Its very unclear exactly what the difference would be.



I think what is undeniable, though, is that even Republicans have failed =
to make any sort of coherent case that the American people are better ser=
ved by having a vacancy on the Supreme Court. That flies in the face of c=
ertainly the argument that President Obama has made. It also flies in the=
 face of the argument that President Reagan has made.=20



So thats the challenge that were seeking to overcome. And the truth is I =
think this is the -- this underscores the discomfort, the obvious discomf=
ort, that Republican senators have shown in trying to defend their positi=
on. The fact is, theres no good justification for allowing this vacancy t=
o persist. And it is simply a result of Republican senators refusing to d=
o their job, and refusing to do their job at the specific request of Lead=
er McConnell.



So again, Im not exactly sure exactly what the broader Republican aim is,=
 particularly when you consider the views of most Republican senators abo=
ut both presidential candidates. But thats something for them to explain.=




Q Okay. And speaking of presidential candidates, Bill Clinton as economic=
 czar for Hillary Clinton -- is that a good thing for Democrats?



MR. EARNEST: Well, again, Democrats will have to decide. Ultimately this =
will factor in, Im sure, into the decision that some Democrats will have =
to make in terms of choosing a nominee. I think what I can just say gener=
ally is I think those of you who remember -- and I think -- believe at le=
ast some of you in here covered the 2012 Democratic convention down in Ch=
arlotte -- you may remember a speech that former President Clinton delive=
red on national television in which he articulated an economic strategy a=
nd an economic vision entirely consistent with what President Obama has f=
ought for in his seven and a half years in office.=20



And I think the results speak for themselves. They certainly spoke volume=
s in evaluating President Clintons legacy. They also speak volumes about =
the progress that weve made in this country over the last seven and a hal=
f years of President Obamas tenure in office, even -- again, after all, L=
eader McConnell himself said it best when he acknowledged that our countr=
y was better off -- is better off now than we were when President Obama t=
ook office. And a lot of that is because of the economic strategy that Pr=
esident Obama has pursued to grow our economy from the middle out, to be =
focused on the middle class, to be focused on job creation, and to be foc=
used on the future of our economy that will be critical to our long-term =
success.



Chris.



Q Josh, in the aftermath of the administrations initiatives last week on =
transgender rights, one issue that remains is the ban prohibiting transge=
nder people from serving openly in the armed services. Last week, Secreta=
ry Carter said the issue was complicated, which was detailed in a Washing=
ton Post report over the weekend on agreements on lifting that ban. Shoul=
dnt the White House apply the same standard on the Pentagon for transgend=
er access as it has done for education, health care and bathroom use?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, I think that we have long acknowledged, even on=
 issues that are relevant to the LGBT community, that ensuring the effect=
ive implementation of policies at the Department of Defense has higher st=
akes than it may in other government agencies.=20



Were talking about our basic national security. And what the Secretary of=
 Defense has concluded -- and the President agrees -- is that qualified A=
merican citizens should not be denied an opportunity to serve their count=
ry just because of who they are or who they love. Our national security i=
s enhanced when we can draw upon the skills and expertise and patriotism =
of every American.=20



And thats part of what motivated Secretary Carter to conduct this review =
and seek the smooth implementation of a policy that would allow transgend=
er Americans -- again, who meet the relevant qualifications -- to serve o=
ur country. But the smooth and effective implementation of this policy is=
 not insignificant. And what Secretary Carter and the other services are =
conscientiously moving forward to do is to figure out the best way to set=
tle on a policy and implement it effectively and as expeditiously as poss=
ible. And that's what they continue to work on.



 Q Last week you said that the President was regularly updated on the dev=
elopments of the joint guidance for schools on transgender students. Is t=
he President receiving the same kind of updates with regards to the milit=
ary service guidance?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President does have a regular opportunity to meet=
 with the Secretary of Defense in the Oval Office when they both happen t=
o be in town. It happens once or twice a week -- I'm sorry -- once a week=
 or once every two weeks. And the President is updated on a range of issu=
es that Secretary Carter is focused on. I'm not going to read out the det=
ails of every conversation that they have, but it's fair for you to assum=
e that in those conversations the President is kept apprized as necessary=
 of the progress of this review.



 Q One such meeting is going to take place this afternoon, according to t=
he Presidents schedule. Will the President, during this meeting, call on =
the Secretary to move forward with the conclusion of this review?



 MR. EARNEST: No, the President -- again, I'm not going to walk through t=
he agenda for their meeting, but the President continues to have confiden=
ce that the Department of Defense is handling this review as conscientiou=
sly as they should.



 Olivier.



 Q Josh, is the President proud of his Syria policy?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, I think the President is certainly pleased t=
hat the Syria policy that he has put forward -- and hes confident that th=
e Syria policy that he has put forward and pursued has advanced the natio=
nal security interest of the United States. What is also true is that we'=
ve seen terrible violence in Syria; it's an awful humanitarian situation =
and it's a genuine human tragedy. And it's a dangerous place and it's a p=
lace that poses a heightened risk to the United States and to our allies =
and interests around the world.=20



 That's why the President and his team have spent so much time focused on=
 how to confront that risk, how to counter that risk, and how to work wit=
h the international community to ultimately destroy ISIL. But there is no=
 denying that what has happened in Syria has changed millions of lives, a=
nd not for the better. And that's a testament to the failed political lea=
dership of Bashar al-Assad. It's a testament to the way that the politica=
l chaos in that country has propagated so much violence, not just in Syri=
a but throughout the region. And people fleeing that violence have gone t=
o far-flung countries around the world in a way that has been genuinely d=
estabilizing to some of the countries where theyve sought refuge.



 So the long-term consequences of whats been happening in Syria are serio=
us, but the President does believe that the way that he has handled this =
situation is entirely consistent with our national security interest.



 Q So when Ben Rhodes tells Syria activists we are not proud of our Syria=
 policy -- is that a fair characterization of how the White House views i=
ts own policy?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, again, I can't speak to any of that conversa=
tion. I wasnt there for that conversation, so I don't really know the con=
text in which it came up. But I think the description that I have just pu=
t forward of the situation in Syria and the way that the President has fo=
cused on our interests in that situation are consistent with the way that=
 Ben views that situation.



 Q And at the risk of giving everybody whiplash, in the GQ interview, the=
 President was asked, Have you ever said, give me the JFK assassination f=
iles, I want to read them, give me all the secret stuff, and the Presiden=
t says, I got to tell you, it's a little disappointing. People always ask=
 me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff goi=
ng on that's top secret isn't nearly as exciting as youd expect. Why not =
make it public?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't looked at the documents, so it's unclear to=
 me exactly what the equities might be. So maybe at the next news confere=
nce you can have the opportunity to ask the President that yourself -- wh=
ich would be interesting. (Laughter.)=20



 Byron.



 Q Josh, Reuters is reporting that the U.S. is planning to make some chan=
ges in boosting investment and trade in its sanctions regime against Burm=
a -- Myanmar. Can you explain what those changes might be and why theyre =
being implemented?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have any announcements about our sanctions against =
Burma at this point. Obviously those are maintained by the Treasury Depar=
tment. But we'll keep you posted if we have any changes to announce.



 Ron.



 Q Judge Garlands schedule this week -- can you give us some detail?



 MR. EARNEST: Judge Garland -- Chief Judge Garland is heading back up to =
Capitol Hill where he'll have a series of meetings this week. He'll be me=
eting tomorrow with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. On Wednesday, he'l=
l have a meeting with Senator Hirono of Hawaii and Senator Udall and Sena=
tor Murphy. And on Thursday, hell meet with Senators Merkley and Heinrich=
. So that is another six senators -- all Democrats this week.



 Q No Republicans?=20



 MR. EARNEST: At this point, no, Im not aware of any meetings that he has=
 coming up with Republicans this week.=20



 Q Has there been any response to the questionnaire that was handed in la=
st week?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we did make note of the fact that this is a question =
that was a questionnaire that was accepted by Republicans and I believe p=
osted on the committee website. So I think its an indication that at leas=
t the American public now has access to even more evidence to illustrate =
why the President has chosen Chief Judge Garland to assume the important =
responsibility of serving a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.



 Q We have a team thats been doing some reporting about the number of Ame=
ricans who are involved in ISIS, trying to join, being recruited, so on a=
nd so forth. Im wondering, how big a problem does the administration see =
this as -- Americans -- I think the number is about 250 -- who have tried=
 to join. There are a few dozen who have made it to Iraq and Syria. How s=
erious is that part of the problem?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, when weve talked about our counter-ISIL strategy=
, weve talked a lot about the military aspect of that strategy, particula=
rly as its focused on taking ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria off the ba=
ttlefield. And that obviously is an important priority.



 But another key priority in which the administration has deeply invested=
 is countering violent extremism and countering the efforts of ISIL to ra=
dicalize vulnerable populations around the world, including inside the Un=
ited States. And weve worked diligently with community leaders across the=
 country, include in the Muslim community, to counter the strategy that w=
e know ISIL has, which is to recruit people from around the world to do o=
ne of two things -- to either carry out attacks where they are or travel =
to Iraq and Syria and take up arms in that region of the world.



 So this is an issue that we take quite seriously. The good news is that =
when you consider the success that ISIL has had thus far in radicalizing =
Americans to their cause, that the percentage of people -- based on the s=
izeable population of the United States -- is much lower than it has been=
 in other countries. But thats not a coincidence. Thats a product of hard=
 work, and we remain vigilant in countering those efforts because we unde=
rstand the potential negative consequences of failing in that effort.



 Q I understand there are investigations going on in just about every sta=
te. Does that sound about right?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldnt have anything to say about any ongoing inve=
stigations. You can always check with the FBI about that.=20



 Q And have you been able to develop a sense of who are the most -- is th=
ere a group, a region, a category of people who you think are most vulner=
able to this? And is there any more specifics about what youre doing, or =
what law enforcement is doing, or what anyone is doing, for that matter, =
to try and combat this particular -- is the phenomenon getting smaller, b=
igger? Just trying to get a bit more about just how big a problem this is=
.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I think as even your networks reporting shows th=
at theres -- the people from all walks of life are potentially vulnerable=
 to this kind of radicalization; that its not focused on just one region =
of the country or on one specific community. And in some ways, thats what=
 makes them so dangerous. This is a pretty amorphous effort that they hav=
e undertaken. Obviously they are able to use social media to interact wit=
h the world and that poses some significant challenges.



 Our countering violent extremism efforts are actually based over at the =
Department of Homeland Security, and they are focused on understanding th=
e way that ISIL has used social media in particular to try to recruit peo=
ple. We have worked hard to lift up the voices in the Muslim community th=
at can effectively counter the radical ideology thats being propagated by=
 ISIL extremists. But we can certainly get you a more comprehensive rundo=
wn from the Department of Homeland Security about what theyve done to cou=
nter these efforts.



 Margaret.



 Q I wanted to ask you about a development out of the Treasury Department=
 today that certainly had some coordination with the White House in one o=
f the implications for White House policy. The Treasury Department had di=
sclosed that Saudi Arabia now holds $116 billion in U.S. debt. And Im won=
dering, is it now going to be going forward -- the governments policy to =
release the Saudi data rather than keep it secret, as it had been for a f=
ew decades? And do you have a handle on whether that is the full extent o=
f Saudi Arabias treasury holdings? There had been a New York Times report=
 that there was something like $750 billion in play that the Saudis were =
going to pull back if that bill went forward. Part three of my one-subjec=
t question is whats the state of play now with that legislation? Are you =
working actively to try to head this bill off? Is there actually a veto t=
hreat out there now? Whats the state of that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, for the technical aspects of the report from Treasury=
 in terms of what their disclosure schedule is moving forward, Id encoura=
ge you to check with them.



 Q But thats a shift in policy. I mean, you --



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the Department of Treasure has indicated that=
 that was the case. And those of you who follow these reports closely not=
iced the difference. So Im not suggesting that somehow that there hasnt b=
een a change in policy, but for how that policy will be implemented movin=
g forward I encourage you to check with the Treasury Department.



 I havent seen the latest legislative proposal from Congress as it relate=
s to Saudi Arabia, but obviously the concerns that we have with the way t=
hat it was written when it was presented last month are still significant=
 and I know that there has been some talk on Capitol Hill about potential=
ly revising that legislation, but I dont know where that effort stands at=
 this point.



 Q Can you speak to the question of whether that $116 billion is comprehe=
nsive, or are you referring that to Treasury?



 MR. EARNEST: I encourage you to check with Treasury on that as well.



 Q Can I toss out a Vietnam question?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Sure.



 Q Can you talk a little bit from the podium about how the President want=
s to mark the legacy of the Vietnam War when he goes and about this idea =
of him being at war longer than any other U.S. President -- largely becau=
se of issues that he inherited -- how he will address that broader topic =
in Vietnam particularly --



 MR. EARNEST: Well, last week, the Presidents National Security Advisor h=
ad an opportunity to meet with Vietnam War-era veterans and veterans serv=
ice organizations to talk about the Presidents trip. And its impossible f=
or any American President to go to Vietnam without acknowledging the hist=
ory between our two countries.



 The truth is, theres a whole generation of Americans that proudly served=
 this country in Vietnam. And I think the mistake that most Americans if =
not all Americans acknowledge that was made in this country at that time =
is that there was a tendency to allow political concerns with American fo=
reign policy to interfere with showing respect and gratitude to fellow Am=
ericans who had put themselves in great peril to serve the country.=20



 And I think this President, like many Americans, is determined to make s=
ure that that never happens again. And so I think you can anticipate that=
 on his trip, the President will acknowledge that history but will do so =
with the courageous service of hundreds of thousands of patriotic America=
ns in mind.



 Andrew.



 Q Josh, do you have a reaction to the Venezuelan President Nicolas Madur=
os declaration of a state of emergency?



 MR. EARNEST: I didnt see that announcement from President Maduro. Obviou=
sly the reporting, particularly just over the last couple of days about t=
he situation in Venezuela is breathtaking. The conditions for the Venezue=
lan population are terrible. And obviously we continue to be quite concer=
ned about the wellbeing of the people of Venezuela. And we stand with the=
 international community in expressing that concern. But the solution to =
these challenges will require the inclusion of all interested parties. An=
d now is the time for leaders to listen to diverse Venezuelan voices and =
work together peacefully to try to find solutions.=20



 And the failure to do that only puts hundreds of thousands if not millio=
ns of Venezuelans at risk of further suffering.



 April.



 Q Josh, I want to ask a couple of questions on two different subjects. O=
ne, ACA. With the months that you have remaining here at the White House,=
 what are the lessons learned when it comes to ACA? I mean, you had the r=
uling today and then also last week you had another one about subsidizing=
 insurance or subsidizing co-pays for some of the people who wanted it. S=
o what are some of the lessons learned?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think certainly one of the lessons that weve seen f=
rom Republican critics of the bill is that theyre going to stop at nothin=
g to try to tear this bill down. But I continue to be confident that they=
re going to continue to fail. And as it relates to the district court rul=
ing that we saw last week, its unfortunate that Republicans have even res=
orted to getting taxpayers to foot the bill for their political efforts. =
Thats disappointing and I dont think even some Americans who might be ske=
ptical of the impact of the Affordable Care Act I dont think would apprec=
iate that their taxpayer funds are being used in this way.



 So we continue to have a lot of confidence in the power of the legal arg=
uments that weve been making for some time. I think at this point the Jus=
tice Department has built up a pretty effective track record for our succ=
ess in protecting the Affordable Care Act so that millions of Americans c=
an get access to the health care that theyve long been denied. Thats a le=
gacy that President Obama is quite proud of.



 Q So the President himself -- early on, critics were saying things neede=
d to change, and the President said he welcomed ideas about how to tweak =
it. Looking back, what are some of the areas beyond the Supreme Court iss=
ues -- or maybe even with the Supreme Court rulings -- that you would twe=
ak in these waning months? And also, is there a fear that once this admin=
istration is over, number 45 comes in, that things could be different for=
 ACA?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, were quite proud of the record of the =
ACA. Every single month since President Obama signed that bill into law, =
our economy has created private-sector jobs. Thats a pretty good track re=
cord, particularly when you consider that Republicans, even six years lat=
er, try to describe that bill as a job-killer. At some point, somebody is=
 going to call them out for, again, either being wrong or lying. But ther=
e will be ample time for that, as well.



The legacy of the Affordable Care Act is 20 million more people now have =
access to health care that didnt before, thanks to the Affordable Care Ac=
t. The growth in health care costs is lower than its ever been in the his=
tory of tracking that measurement; thats more than 50 years now.=20



So weve made a lot of important -- to say nothing of the benefits that mi=
llions of Americans who had health insurance before the Affordable Care A=
ct now enjoy because of the patient protections that are included in that=
 legislation. No one in America can be discriminated against because they=
 have a preexisting condition. Every child, every young adult in America =
is eligible to stay on their parents health insurance until they turn 26 =
because of the Affordable Care Act.=20



A whole range of preventative services are now available to Americans for=
 free because of the Affordable Care Act. Thats quite a legacy. And that =
includes millions of Americans that think that theyre unaffected by the A=
ffordable Care Act because they havent had to go and purchase insurance t=
hrough the exchanges, but yet they benefit in ways that have a profound i=
mpact on their familys budget and on their health.



So this is a piece of legislation that the President remains intensely pr=
oud of. And the legacy of this legislation is a stronger economy and a co=
untry full of citizens whose health prospects are enhanced because of thi=
s bill.



Q And with that issue of high deductibles for some of these insured -- is=
 that anything that could be tweaked or looked at or viewed through a mic=
roscope? Because some people have complained about higher deductibles thr=
ough this process.



MR. EARNEST: Again, April, this is an argument that weve been making for =
six years. The health insurance market is a lot better for private citize=
ns now than it was before the Affordable Care Act. Thats just a fact. And=
 I know thats a fact that Republicans like to deny, but its the truth.



Q And my last question. Theres this increased interest in Roswell. Youre =
doing your dance at the podium about it. Is there a such thing? Are you -=
- look at you, youre drinking so youre trying to think. (Laughter.) Is th=
ere a such thing -- are you keeping quiet because of security concerns? I=
 mean, are we to think that there might be life beyond here? I mean -- se=
riously. I mean, you need to answer this.



MR. EARNEST: Ill just say, April, there are some questions that even the =
White House Press Secretary doesnt have answers to, and this is one of th=
em.



Q Youre not going to get off easy like that.



MR. EARNEST: Okay. Well, you keep trying.=20



Kevin.



Q Thanks, Josh. I want to follow up on the question about Ben Rhodes and =
the possibility of making him available for Congressman Chaffetz. To just=
 clarify, if nothing else, is it your opinion that his appearance would b=
e, if nothing else, instructive, if not enlightening?



MR. EARNEST: Well, we have all of the available evidence thats necessary =
to evaluate who was telling the truth on the Iran deal and who wasnt. The=
re are members of the committee who are not telling the truth on the Iran=
 deal.



So again, if they want to hold a hearing, and they think it would be usef=
ul to get to the bottom of why they were so wrong about the Iran deal, th=
en theyre welcome to do that. They can start by swearing in Ken Buck, Con=
gressman from Colorado, I believe.



Q You mentioned Tom Cotton, and hes going to do it.



MR. EARNEST: Well, yes, hes going to have a lot to say. I think hes going=
 to get some pretty tough questions about all the things that he said abo=
ut the Iran deal that didnt turn out to be true.



Q Absolutely.



MR. EARNEST: Everything that Ben Rhodes said about the Iran deal did turn=
 out to be true.



Q So then wouldnt it be at least instructive, if not enlightening, to hav=
e him go ahead and testify?



MR. EARNEST: So you think that its going to be a fair deal for people who=
 lied about the Iran deal to question the people who told the truth? I do=
nt think thats a very American approach to these kinds of things.



Q But I thought you suggested on Thursday that it would be a good idea to=
 get to the bottom of it, and Im suggesting that I think, based on what y=
ouve reported -- and Ive heard you talk about this at length in some deta=
il -- it would seem to help to get to the bottom of it if Ben Rhodes were=
 part of the conversation. Would you agree?



MR. EARNEST: Again, Ben Rhodes is the person who told the truth about the=
 Iran deal, and its Republicans who are either badly misinformed or outri=
ght lying about the Iran deal. And so if they want to explore that, they =
are welcome to do that. I dont really understand why getting to the botto=
m of who lied about the Iran deal requires somebody who told the truth ab=
out the Iran deal to participate. Lets just swear the liars under oath an=
d lets see what they have to say for themselves. Maybe they can explain w=
hy they were so wrong about Irans willingness to live up to the commitmen=
ts that they made in the context of the Iran deal. Maybe they can explain=
 why they said that Iran would never agree to the Iran deal in the first =
place, even though they did. Maybe they can explain why our international=
 inspectors have been able to verify Irans compliance with the deal. Mayb=
e they can explain why they said Iran, in the case of Steve Scalise, woul=
d get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief as a result of =
the Iran deal.=20



Theyve been wrong on just about every measure. So if they want to talk ab=
out that, and they want to come clean to the American people about what w=
as going on when they werent telling the truth about the Iran deal, then =
theyre welcome to do that. I dont think that the person who told the trut=
h about the Iran deal needs to be a part of it.



Q Just a quick clarification. Youre not suggesting that Senator Cotton sh=
ould lie, right?



MR. EARNEST: I am suggesting that what he said about the Iran deal did no=
t turn out to be true. And so was he wildly misinformed, or was he not te=
lling the truth? Maybe hell answer the committee.



Q You think its the latter --=20



MR. EARNEST: I dont know. I dont know. But the fact is he, time and time =
again, presented a wide range of information about the Iran deal that was=
nt true. And thats not just a conjecture, thas something that we know as =
a fact. Im just looking for the actual quotes here, because I dont want t=
o -- I want to make sure we get this right.=20



He said -- this is Senator Tom Cotton on Meet the Press. So theres televi=
sion footage of all of this. He said that This deal gives them $150 billi=
on of sanctions relief. Not true. He was wrong about that. He said It put=
s them on the path to be a nuclear-weapon state in eight to 10 years. Not=
 true. In fact, we will be able to verify over the course of the next 10 =
years and beyond that they are not advancing toward a nuclear weapon. And=
 because this deal went through, they are farther away from having access=
 to a nuclear weapon than theyve been in about eight to 10 years.



Q I understand. Im not trying to re-litigate the conversation. Im just wo=
ndering if there would be more clarity if a guy of Ben Rhodess informatio=
n and knowledge -- intimate knowledge of the details, if that wouldnt be =
helpful. And if it would be, why not make him available?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess part of the reason is that there are administr=
ation officials who, on countless occasions, have traveled up to Capitol =
Hill to participate in hearings about the Iran deal. There have been lite=
rally dozens of congressional engagements about the Iran deal since Janua=
ry of 2015. The most recent example of this -- you have actually the pers=
on whos in charge of implementing the Iran deal under Secretary of State =
Tom Shannon, who appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, =
and he appeared there solely to discuss Iran and the Iran deal.=20



And, in fact, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held an open hearing wi=
th the coordinator from the Department of State on this question back in =
February. I guess my point is -- and I guess the other metric here that I=
 think is relevant is that the administration has provided classified bri=
efings or appeared at open hearings to discuss the Iran deal more than 30=
 times in just the last 18 months. So if it were a matter of just one hea=
ring that would convince Republicans to stop lying or to at least start t=
elling the truth when it comes to the Iran deal, then presumably that wou=
ld have happened in one of the first 30 or so meetings that we had with t=
hem. I'm not sure the 31st hearing in 18 months is going to get them to s=
traighten up and act right.



 Q Last one. Can you give me an accurate number of detainees at Gitmo? I'=
ve asked you I think once a week for the last five weeks, and previously =
you were super specific -- you said there were 98, or 104. But lately you=
ve been sort of kicking the can a bit, saying, I'm not sure, I'll get bac=
k to you. No one has gotten back to me. Can you give me a specific number=
 of detainees? And if you have any announcements about potential transfer=
s that are --



 MR. EARNEST: Somebody will get back to you today, I assure you of that. =
I'm not really sure why that hasnt happened.



 Q Thank you.



 Q -- those numbers are surprising --=20



 MR. EARNEST: I will. It's not a surprising number. And I think that's th=
e other part of this. Every time theres a transfer we announce it publicl=
y. So if theres a change to that number since the last time that we spoke=
, that's something that you would have seen because we do make an affirma=
tive public announcement every time that that happens. But I will make su=
re somebody follows up with you today to give you the specific remaining =
count.



 Bill.



 Q The chair of the House Appropriations Committee has introduced a bill =
for $622 million to fund Zika. It's all out of existing money and it come=
s with the statement again that the administration has failed to answer -=
- repeatedly failed to answer questions about where and how the money wou=
ld be spent. Is it enough money? And are there questions you haven't answ=
ered?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, not that I'm aware of, because I do continue -- while=
 sometimes I don't have the Gitmo guidance that Kevin is looking for, I h=
ave made a habit of bringing this with me. This is the letter that was se=
nt by the White House to congressional leaders on February 22nd, detailin=
g exactly how our $1.9 billion appropriations request should be used to p=
rotect the American people from the Zika virus.=20



 Here we are, almost three months later, and we hear that some House Repu=
blicans have gotten around to considering a piece of legislation that is =
only about a third of what our public health professionals say is necessa=
ry to do everything possible to protect the American people.=20



 Q Well, theres been some money spent already, right?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, not because Congress did anything. There have =
been some funds that have been reprogrammed by the Centers for Disease Co=
ntrol and a couple of other health care-related agencies that have been d=
evoted to this effort. But that is essentially the bureaucratic equivalen=
t of digging through the sofa cushions to try to come up with the necessa=
ry money. So the truth is our public health professionals shouldnt be red=
uced to doing that when it comes to something as critically important as =
protecting the American people from the Zika virus.



 I mean, the thing that I will say is that at some point this summer -- a=
nd we're probably not that far off from it -- theres going to be widespre=
ad public reporting about the threat of the Zika virus, and there will be=
 questions, I'm confident, in this room by all of you, wondering why the =
federal government didnt more effectively plan to protect the American pe=
ople from the Zika virus. And my answer then will be, we've been trying. =
The President held a meeting on this back in January. The President made =
clear the first week in February that we were going to have a specific re=
quest for funding. The administration put forward that specific request j=
ust a couple of weeks later in the form of the letter that I just held up=
. And we've not seen Republicans act.=20



 And I don't really know what the explanation is for that. I wasnt really=
 aware of the fact that there was a partisan difference about the need to=
 protect the American people from Zika virus.=20



 Q The chairman is saying you still haven't provided full accounting of j=
ustification for the request. And given the lack of complete information,=
 independent determinations on necessary funding levels have not been mad=
e. Any future funding now has to wait, he says, until the fiscal year 201=
7.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't think that's going to be a satisfactor=
y explanation to the American people when they see that pregnant women an=
d babies across this country are at extreme risk because of the Zika viru=
s. The truth is our public health professionals have had many conversatio=
ns with members of Congress about what exactly is needed. There are count=
less letters that have gone back and forth, including the first one that =
I just held up from February 22, 2016. So if there was something in that =
February 22nd letter that Republicans in Congress didnt understand, why d=
idnt they pick up the phone on February 23rd and ask about it? Waiting a =
day to deal with an emergency situation seems like -- I guess it's a legi=
timate question.=20



 But here we are, three months later, and Republicans are making bureaucr=
atic excuses about why they are not dealing with what our public health p=
rofessionals say is a genuine emergency. And heres the thing. It's not ju=
st scientists and it's not just Democrats at the White House who have rai=
sed these concerns. I began my briefing one day last week by reading a le=
tter from the bipartisan group of governors all across the country who ar=
e deeply concerned by congressional inaction and Republican obstruction t=
o needed Zika virus funding. And we haven't gotten it, and the American p=
eople I think are rightly concerned about it.



 Look, is it going to require the onset of that emergency before Republic=
ans act? I sure hope not, but that's the direction it seems to be trendin=
g.

 Q Josh, in terms of the nationwide guidance on transgender students that=
 the administration put out last week, you and others have described it a=
s a response to school administrators on the state and local level who we=
re asking for clarification. And I assume there was some consultation wit=
h those officials. I was interested into what extent the administration, =
the Education and the Justice Departments consulted with top state electe=
d officials in forming that guidance, whether anything was done on that f=
ront.



 MR. EARNEST: I think I'd refer you, actually, to my colleagues in the De=
partment of Education and they can talk about the sense of outreach that =
they did to develop this policy guidance.=20



 Again, the thing that I would just point you to is that the way that we =
can tell there was extensive outreach is that the guidance that was produ=
ced included essentially case studies of the way schools all across the c=
ountry have dealt with this particular challenge. So those ideas didnt ju=
st materialize, they were a result from intensive consultations by the De=
partment of Education to educators and community leaders all across the c=
ountry.=20



 But for the details of those conversations, I'd refer you to the Departm=
ent of Education. Maybe they can provide you some more information about =
who exactly they consulted.=20



 Jordan.



 Q The President has now been at war longer than any U.S. President in hi=
story. Does the President or the White House have any reaction to that un=
expected element of his legacy?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not sure I would describe it as unexpected=
. I think those who listen carefully to the Presidents arguments as a can=
didate for President understood that he believed that the United States h=
ad been distracted by the 2003 invasion of Iraq and had not been sufficie=
ntly focused on going after al Qaeda. And that's why President Obama ramp=
ed up the commitment that the United States made to decimating core al Qa=
eda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. And that was a mission that was carried =
out under very difficult circumstances by courageous members of our armed=
 forces. And they succeeded in decimating core al Qaeda in that region of=
 the world.



 But what we also knew was likely to happen is that the threat from al Qa=
eda elements around the world was likely to be more diffuse. And we do co=
ntinue to be concerned about dangerous al Qaeda elements in other countri=
es. The dangers that they pose is different than the danger that was pose=
d by core al Qaeda, but they are dangerous nonetheless. And the President=
 has been vigilant about countering those extremist organizations, orderi=
ng the military to take action against them -- to take military action ag=
ainst them, all in the name of trying to protect the American people.=20



 And the success that our country has had in fighting core al Qaeda and i=
n protecting the American people and in intensifying our ability to work =
with our allies around the world to do that is an important part of Presi=
dent Obamas legacy.=20



 Julie.



 Q Thanks. I just want to follow up on Juliets question about the transge=
nder guidance, as well. You said last week that this was not a direct res=
ponse to what happened in North Carolina and the legislation there. Can y=
ou talk about whether you think that influenced the process at all? In ot=
her words, were you hearing from more educators, more folks who had been =
following this issue because of the public debate over that law, and some=
 of your own Cabinet members were actually coming out and saying that the=
re was a risk of North Carolina endangering its own funding?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, theres no denying that the scrutiny around this issue=
 was increased dramatically after states like North Carolina took the ste=
ps that they took. I know that there was a referendum that was considered=
 by voters in the city of Houston, I believe last fall, around a similar =
question. So theres no denying that in the last several months there has =
been increased public awareness of dealing with this issue.



 So what precise impact that had on the process, again, I think I'd refer=
 you to the Department of Education, because ultimately they were the one=
s who were formulating this policy guidance and they were on the receivin=
g end of people seeking the guidance. But I'll just go back to where I st=
arted, which is that theres no denying that there has been a significant =
uptick in public consideration of these kinds of questions, and that incl=
uded a broader public consideration of what kinds of policy responses wer=
e available to school administrators and local elected officials.=20



 So that is a challenge that many of those school administrators are deal=
ing with across the country, and the desire on the part of the Department=
 of Education was to empower those school administrators with more inform=
ation and more good ideas about what steps they can take to protect the s=
afety and dignity of every student at their school. That ultimately is th=
e goal of administrators who are seeking to nurture an inclusive environm=
ent where their students can learn and get the best possible education. A=
nd the Department of Education is obviously fully supportive of that goal=
, and that's what motivated them to share this guidance last week.



 Q To your knowledge, there wasnt any effort by the White House to say, w=
e know this policy was under consideration, now it's time to move forward=
 with it? Because there have been activists who have been asking for this=
 for quite a long time.



 MR. EARNEST: There have been. But, look, this is a policy process that w=
as the responsibility of the Department of Education. They obviously had =
to work closely with the Department of Justice because there were importa=
nt legal questions that were raised. And as youd expect, the White House =
was not just aware of these policy deliberations, but in the loop as deci=
sions were being made to ensure that the guidance reflected the President=
s values and the Presidents preferences.



 Q You're obviously aware that this issue has created a lot of discussion=
 around the country. Over the weekend, you heard some praise for the admi=
nistration; you heard a lot of outrage as well. Is the White House concer=
ned that youve given the Republican base a campaign issue here?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not surprised to hear -- or I was not surprised to see =
that there were Republican politicians who were seeking to use this as a =
political tool. And I think this goes to the core not just of what we wer=
e talking about in this room on Friday, but it goes in part to what the P=
resident was talking about in his commencement address at Rutgers on Sund=
ay, and that is simply this: People who serve in government have a respon=
sibility to look out for the best interests of the American people and to=
 ensure that our values are reflected in the way the country is governed.=
 And too often, theres a tendency on the part of politicians to cynically=
 use these kinds of decisions to score political points and to slice and =
dice the electorate. And thats unfortunate.



The truth is school administrators across the country are dealing with an=
 actual dilemma that has consequences for the safety and dignity of every=
 student at their school. So when the response from politicians is just t=
o use rhetoric thats aimed at scoring political points, that doesnt prote=
ct any students safety or dignity. What those school administrators need =
is practical advice. They need the legal interpretations. They need good =
ideas that have been used by school administrators around the country to =
address this challenge. And thats exactly what was provided by the Depart=
ment of Education, and they did that in spite of the cynical political ga=
mesmanship of a lot of Republican politicians across the country.



Q You mentioned the issue of safety. Can you explain why the administrati=
on moved relatively quickly on this issue, which carries the potential lo=
ss of federal funding, when, in contrast, on the issue of sanctuary citie=
s, the administration, for eight years, has not threatened to take away a=
 citys federal funding for harboring dangerous illegal immigrants?



MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think, as -- again, as we pointed out and dis=
cussed on Friday, there were requests for this kind of guidance that had =
been coming to the Department of Education for more than a year. And so I=
 think that there were many school administrators who had been waiting a =
long time and urging the Department of Education to provide this guidance=
. I think they would have liked to have seen it arrive even more quickly =
than it did.



Look, its hard to keep track of the various proposals around sanctuary ci=
ties that have been put forward by Republicans. But the truth is, and the=
 irony about this, is that its Republicans who blocked comprehensive immi=
gration reform legislation. So its a little rich for Republicans to block=
 the solution and then blame the President for not punishing cities who a=
re dealing with the problem.=20



So, again, I think that actually is maybe even a better example of Republ=
icans eschewing common-sense solutions because it might interfere with th=
eir ability to deliver a persuasive political message. And again, I think=
 thats relevant to a lot of what the President had to talk about in Rutge=
rs yesterday.



Q Groups of people like the Little Sisters of the Poor are saying that th=
e return of the case to the 11th Circuit Court from the Supreme Court act=
ually strikes down several of the key decisions it had made that hurt the=
ir case, and there isnt really precedent for the Supreme Court to do such=
 a thing. So how can you say that youre gratified by the ruling?



MR. EARNEST: The announcement from the Supreme Court today ensures that m=
illions of American women all across the country will continue to enjoy t=
he health care coverage that they have sought. And were pleased about tha=
t because we care about making sure that women have access to the health =
care that they want.=20



We also care about making sure that were protecting the religious liberty=
 of all Americans. And we believe thats exactly the appropriate balance t=
hat our policy has struck. And we were pleased to see that the Supreme Co=
urt didnt strike that down. And that has preserved womens access to healt=
h care and its preserved the protections for religious liberty that this =
administration has prioritized.



Q Womens groups are saying that now they have to wait. So the decision is=
nt really final. Now theyre going to have to wait for more -- for that he=
alth care.



MR. EARNEST: I acknowledge that, but while were waiting, millions of Amer=
ican women all across the country will continue to enjoy the access to th=
e health care that they and their doctors determine that they need.



Q And lastly, the federal judge declared that the Obama administration wa=
s unconstitutionally spending money to subsidize health insurers without =
obtaining an appropriation from Congress. Then hospital insurer stocks dr=
opped -- the unanticipated costs of providing health care to customers on=
 the states online exchange has prompted large insurers to seek rate incr=
eases. United Healthcare pulled out of Maryland. So wouldnt you say there=
s a negative trend happening with the law?



MR. EARNEST: No. I think that the positive trends are undeniable. Every s=
ingle month since President Obama signed that bill into law, our economy =
has created private sector jobs. That happens to be the longest streak of=
 private sector job growth in American history.=20



Weve seen 20 million more Americans get access to health care because of =
the Affordable Care Act. No longer can a single American be discriminated=
 against because they have a preexisting condition because of the Afforda=
ble Care Act. Every young adult up through age 25 is able to stay on thei=
r parents health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. Women cant=
 be discriminated against just because theyre women because of the Afford=
able Care Act. And millions of people across the country have access to a=
 health insurance market that forces insurance companies to compete for t=
heir business, and that has led to better health care available at better=
 costs for people who don't get their health insurance through their empl=
oyer.



 All of these are important positive benefits that are a direct result an=
d part of the design of the Affordable Care Act.=20

 The last statistic Ill share in some ways is the most important one, tha=
t we've actually seen the growth in health care costs held to the lowest =
level on record because of the Affordable Care Act. And keeping those cos=
ts -- or that growth in costs low has a positive impact on our economy, h=
as a positive impact on the bottom line of businesses large and small.=20=




It has a positive impact on the deficit -- all things that are important =
to this economy. And that's part of why the President made this issue a p=
riority -- not just because of the moral question about whether or not ha=
ving access to health care is a right. The President believes that it is,=
 that every American is entitled to access to quality health care, but al=
so because resolving this problem in the right way can be good for our ec=
onomy and yield important economic benefits.



 And after six years, its undeniable that that's been the case. And that =
hasnt stopped -- as I mentioned earlier, that hasnt stopped Republicans f=
rom resorting to all sorts of wild strategies to try to undermine the bil=
l.



 I suspect the reason they're trying to undermine the bill is because the=
y all opposed it. So its a pretty cynical view on their -- a pretty cynic=
al tactic on their part to try to undermine a bill that they opposed. May=
be that helps them justify why they opposed it, is if they can find a way=
 to tear that law down and say, see, we told you it wouldnt work.



 But the truth is they've been unsuccessful in that effort. There have be=
en previous occasions where people have gotten excited and hope that, oh,=
 well, maybe this will finally be the legal death blow to the Affordable =
Care Act. They've been wrong every single time. And as it relates to this=
 specific case, Im confident they're going to be wrong again.



 Sarah, Ill give you the last one.



 Q Thanks, Josh. At the beginning, you suggested that the press too narro=
wly interpreted the Presidents comments yesterday in hearing them as bein=
g about Trump. You said they're about the Republicans more generally. At =
the same time, we've seen a lot of coverage kind of suggesting a lot of w=
ays that Trump doesn't fit with GOP orthodoxy. So could you just articula=
te kind of the key areas where the White House sees Trump and the GOP as =
being in lockstep?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Ill let you guys talk about Mr. Trumps campaign. We'r=
e going to be focused on what the President believes is important for the=
 American people to consider as they head to the ballot box in November. =
And the Presidents opportunity to make that case in public will become mo=
re frequent when we actually are in the general election stage of the cam=
paign. We're getting close to that, but we're not there yet.



 But the President will have an ample opportunity to weigh in and make hi=
s case that the President who succeeds him is a President who is committe=
d to building on all of the success that we've enjoyed over the last seve=
n years.



 Q Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee at this point. Why not use his na=
me? And once he really -- assuming he does ultimately, officially have th=
at title of nominee, will we hear the President speak about him by name, =
or in a more specific way?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, as you pointed out, the President has on occasion spo=
ken directly about his candidacy or some of this statements on the stump.=
 And I suspect the President will do that again in the future.



 But just in terms of people trying to understand exactly the message tha=
t the President was delivering to the Class of 2016 at Rutgers, its impor=
tant for them to understand the broader argument that the President was m=
aking. This is central to not just his presidency over the last seven yea=
rs, but also central to the promise of his candidacy back in 2007 and 200=
8.



 And I think theres a remarkable consistency to the Presidents advocacy f=
or these kinds of issues and a remarkable consistency to the Presidents a=
rguments. And I think its important for that not to be lost in the swirl =
of the ongoing presidential campaign.=20



 Q Last question. Theres been consistent discussion among Republicans dow=
n ballot about whether they should or could run against Trump or distance=
 themselves from Trump. The way the Republican Party is right now, can pe=
ople down ballot, or especially in the Senate do that authentically?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I would just note the difficulty that many ca=
ndidates have encountered in trying to do that. I know at least one candi=
date tried to draw a distinction between supporting a candidate and endor=
sing a candidate. If that's the best they're going to be able to do, then=
 I wish them luck.



 Thanks, everybody.=20

<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Good aft=
ernoon, everybody.&nbsp; Hope you all had a wonderful weekend.&nbsp; I do n=
ot have any announcements to begin, so we can go straight to questions.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen, do you want to st=
art?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&n=
bsp; I'm going to start with the Supreme Court decision or non-decision on =
the contraceptive agreement.&nbsp; I'm wondering if you view this move as a=
 clear result of the vacancy on the Court, and if you have any thoughts on =
whether
 or not you think the Court is intentionally dodging contentious issues at =
this point.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, le=
t me start by saying that we obviously were pleased with the announcement f=
rom the Supreme Court today. It will allow millions of women across the cou=
ntry to continue to get the health care coverage that they
 need.&nbsp; So this obviously is an outcome that we are pleased to see.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our concerns about the cont=
inued vacancy on the Supreme Court persist.&nbsp; In this case, based on, a=
gain, the announcement from the Supreme Court, it's not obvious that an add=
itional justice would have yielded a different result, but
 I haven't heard anybody make the argument that leaving the Supreme Court o=
f the United States short-staffed is somehow good for the country. The argu=
ment that we've heard from Republicans is that they don't want to confirm a=
nother of President Obama&#8217;s nominees
 to the Supreme Court, and they have made that declaration based solely on =
partisan reasons.&nbsp; And many Republicans are having a tough time explai=
ning to their constituents why they refuse to do their job simply because t=
he Republican leader in the Senate has
 requested that they do so.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are Presidents in bot=
h parties that made a strong case for the Senate fulfilling their constitut=
ional duty.&nbsp; And it was President Reagan who observed that a protracte=
d vacancy on the Supreme Court didn&#8217;t serve the American people
 well.&nbsp; And President Obama has made exactly the same case.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as =
for the substance of the issue, are you confident that the administration a=
nd these groups can come to some sort of compromise at this point?&nbsp; Do=
 you think there&#8217;s a compromise to be had?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think what is true is the administration has put forward an accommodation t=
hat ensures that women, nationwide, have access to health care, including c=
ontraceptive coverage -- without pay, I might add -- while
 also protecting religious liberty.&nbsp; And we were pleased to announce t=
his accommodation and to demonstrate that we were committed to both princip=
les.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, what&#8217;s also true=
 is there may be another process that plays out, because ultimately that wa=
s the announcement that's been remanded to lower courts.&nbsp; And we'll ob=
viously continue to engage in the process.&nbsp; But we obviously are
 pleased that the announcement today from the Supreme Court protects the ab=
ility of millions of women nationwide to continue to get access to their he=
alth care.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&n=
bsp; And switching topics.&nbsp; On Libya, the announcement out of Vienna t=
hat the U.S. is backing the decision to lift the embargo and start arming t=
he government there.&nbsp; I'm wondering if -- obviously this has been a de=
cision that
 the U.S. was reluctant to make because of the concerns of these weapons fa=
lling into wrong hands, so I'm wondering if you could speak to why you're c=
onfident now that the government there can control some of these arms at th=
is point.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think my understanding of the way that this process is working is that Gove=
rnment of National Accord that the international community has come to rall=
y around is now in a position to make a specific request of
 weapons that they would like to see provided to forces in Libya that are f=
ighting ISIL and securing the country.&nbsp; And the United Nations will re=
view that request and determine whether or not that is a request that can b=
e agreed to in a way that doesn&#8217;t exacerbate
 our concerns that those weapons could fall into the wrong hands.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is the beginning of=
 the process, not the end of it. But it is an indication that the internati=
onal community is coming together in support of the Government of National =
Accord in Libya that&#8217;s seeking to bring some long-sought
 political stability to that country.&nbsp; Libya has encountered some sign=
ificant challenges.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">They had an authoritarian=
 dictator that ruled that country for more than four decades that eroded al=
most all of the remaining institutions that typically are needed to govern =
a country.&nbsp; And it means that the Government
 of National Accord is essentially having to come in from the bottom up and=
 start building the infrastructure of a government to rule a country that&#=
8217;s got a significant economy, particularly based on the natural resourc=
es that they can sell on the global market,
 and a populace that has been divided along tribal lines for a long time.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this is a difficult ch=
allenge.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s important for the international community to =
come together in support of this Government of National Accord so that the =
Libyan people can finally have the kind of government
 that reflects their preferences.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a=
s a sign of -- a vote of confidence in this government, should we expect th=
at then, particularly in the campaign against ISIS, that the U.S. and the c=
oalition will start to be more engaged in Libya?&nbsp; Should
 we expect more Special Operations or airstrikes, or is this sort of the fi=
rst step towards an increased involvement in Libya on that front?<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Ultima=
tely, our goal would be to build up the capacity of the Government of Natio=
nal Accord so they could begin doing this work of fighting ISIL and securin=
g their own country themselves.&nbsp; That ultimately
 is the goal, so that the United States and the rest of the international c=
ommunity doesn&#8217;t have to come in and fight this fight for them.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But, as I mentioned, they=
 are doing some very basic work that -- to sort of build up the institution=
s of that country.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s going to require a lot of broader i=
nternational support in order for them to succeed
 in that effort.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the United States has =
already taken military strikes against ISIL targets in Libya, and when nece=
ssary, to take additional strikes to protect the American people, we won&#8=
217;t hesitate to do so.&nbsp; So back in November,
 as a result of a U.S. military airstrike, there was -- the leading ISIL fi=
gure in Libya was killed.&nbsp; There was another strike that was carried o=
ut earlier this year that removed a number of ISIL fighters from the battle=
field.&nbsp; These are fighters who we were
 concerned were prepared to go out and carry out a large-scale operation.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we&#8217;ve used -- th=
e President has ordered military action in Libya against ISIL targets in th=
e past, and that continues to be an option.&nbsp; But that is not a substit=
ute for building the capacity of a central government
 in Libya that can begin to secure that country and begin to take the fight=
 to ISIL in that country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Tim.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just =
a quick one on the House invitation for Ben Rhodes to appear tomorrow.&nbsp=
; There&#8217;s been suggestions that he may not appear.&nbsp; Could you te=
ll us definitively if he will not appear tomorrow?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Tim, the answers that you heard from me before are still operative here.&nb=
sp; The truth is, it is Republicans in Congress who criticized the Iran dea=
l, who have got a lot to explain when it comes
 to saying things about the Iran deal that didn&#8217;t turn out to be true=
.&nbsp; And if they want to hold a hearing to determine whether or not Repu=
blicans were just wrong and badly misinformed, or if they were purposefully=
 lying to the American people, then they can
 do that.&nbsp; There obviously would be ample time -- at least they should=
 set aside ample time, because there are any number of witnesses, including=
 individuals who serve on the committee, who could provide some significant=
 insight.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think what&#8217;s true=
 is, Tim, that previous administrations have been fairly skeptical of these=
 kinds of efforts, particularly because this isn&#8217;t a whole lot more t=
han just a three-ring circus that Republicans are
 looking to organize up there.&nbsp; And so I don&#8217;t have an answer fo=
r you.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to review the letter, but I thin=
k you can sense the not-so-thinly-veiled skepticism about this whole exerci=
se that I&#8217;m displaying here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But t=
o be clear, he&#8217;s not going?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&=
#8217;t have a definitive answer for you.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a defini=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
again, I&#8217;ll let the individual
<a name=3D"_GoBack"></a>presidential candidates express their own views abo=
ut what they hope to do to strengthen our alliances around the world.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Obama, obviously,=
 over the course of his tenure in office has invested deeply in our allianc=
es around the world because of the important benefits those alliances bring=
 to the American people, both in terms of economic security
 but also when it comes to our national security.&nbsp; And the President h=
as invested deeply in the special relationship that the United States and t=
he UK have enjoyed for centuries, and the President certainly believes that=
 that&#8217;s an alliance that&#8217;s worthy of
 an investment.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterd=
ay at Rutgers, we saw the President criticize policies of a certain Republi=
can, one by one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; You&#821=
7;re talking about Jim Inhofe?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, not=
 that one.&nbsp; &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Oh, okay=
.&nbsp; Well, he was the only one that was specifically mentioned in the sp=
eech.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Mr. =
Trump&#8217;s policies, is this kind of a signal that we&#8217;re going to =
see the President open up a little bit more?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Mr. Trum=
p wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the speech, though, Tim.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp=
; Mr. Inhofe was, though.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&=
nbsp; Is it likely we&#8217;ll see -- <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
that what I&#8217;m trying to illustrate here is that this is a -- the conc=
erns that President Obama raised were not new but are concerns that extend =
broadly throughout the Republican Party.&nbsp; The President talked a
 lot about the continued insistence by Republicans to deny the fact of clim=
ate change in the face of overwhelming evidence and already-observed impact=
s.&nbsp; Republicans continue to deny that this is even taking place, and t=
he President highlighted the example
 of Senator Inhofe, in the middle of winter, bringing a snowball to the flo=
or of the United States Senate, and suggesting that somehow this confirmed =
his denial of science.&nbsp; Even years later, it&#8217;s difficult to expl=
ain exactly what he was trying to illustrate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s not that difficu=
lt, however, to make clear what the President was trying to illustrate, whi=
ch is that our country has long benefitted from political leaders that are =
not seeking to deny evidence and facts and science in order
 to advance a political agenda, but actually to focus on evidence and scien=
ce and facts to make an argument about improving the country and moving the=
 country forward and living up to the values that we have long fought for.&=
nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are not new arguments=
 that President Obama has made.&nbsp; For example, the President talked abo=
ut the fact that, &#8220;The biggest challenges we face cannot be solved in=
 isolation.&#8221;&nbsp; I know that many of your colleagues, Tim, suggeste=
d
 that that might have been a shot at one presidential candidate or another.=
&nbsp; The truth is, that sounds like just a few more words for &#8220;yes,=
 we can.&#8221;&nbsp; And I think what&#8217;s important for people to unde=
rstand about the President&#8217;s speech is these are values that
 he fought for as a candidate for President and that he has spent the last =
seven and a half years fighting for in office.&nbsp; This has been his appr=
oach to problem-solving.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been his approach to leading the =
country.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been his approach to leading the
 world.&nbsp; And the country and the world are better off for it.<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on=
e more on the speech yesterday.&nbsp; While he didn&#8217;t mention Trump&#=
8217;s name, he did go after the wall policy and he did go after the tempor=
ary ban on Muslims.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m curious whether we might hear more =
from the President on
 Mr. Trump&#8217;s treatment of women.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, Tim, there are a variety of Republican candidates and a variety of Rep=
ublican officeholders who have suggested that a religious test should be im=
posed on individuals seeking to enter the United States.&nbsp; And
 for the reasons that the President outlined in the speech, that is inconsi=
stent with our values and it&#8217;s inconsistent with a smart strategy to =
destroy ISIL.&nbsp; So, again, this is not an argument about one presidenti=
al candidate; this is an argument about many
 leaders in a political party that have eschewed evidence because it is inc=
onvenient to the political argument that they want to make.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s particularly d=
angerous when you&#8217;re talking about something like the national securi=
ty of the United States and the danger that the Republican strategy poses t=
o our efforts to coordinate with Muslims in America and Muslims around
 the world to fight ISIL.&nbsp; Those are some of our most important partne=
rs.&nbsp; And to alienate them is unwise, to put it mildly.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; You mentioned being satisfied with this ACA decision, the stat=
us quo is intact.&nbsp; But isn&#8217;t this disappointing that it&#8217;s =
going back and, at the very least, will probably lead to a compromise that =
is less than what
 you originally would have liked to have seen?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, we w=
ere gratified by the ruling today.&nbsp; And this announcement does ensure =
that millions of women across the country can continue to have access to th=
eir health care.&nbsp; And it is a reflection of something that we have
 long believed, which is that it is possible to prioritize both access to h=
ealth care for everybody while protecting the religious liberty of every Am=
erican.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we sought to do, and we obviously are pleas=
ed that this is something that will continue
 to remain in effect.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things =
could change at the lower court level, though.&nbsp; And I mean, in terms o=
f trying to find a compromise, that could morph in a way that you might not=
 agree with, right?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I don&#8217;t know how the process is going to play out so we&#8217;ll=
 see.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&n=
bsp; And seeing how this was the result of an evenly divided Court, and loo=
king at how this could have gone another way if the President had a nominee=
 that was accepted prior to this, so do you expect this to just solidify op=
position
 to taking up Garland?&nbsp; And I mean, in a sense, Republicans could see =
this as the status quo working for them in some ways.&nbsp; Do you feel lik=
e that&#8217;s a possibility?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I have n=
o idea what Republicans will conclude.&nbsp; The truth is, all the Democrat=
s and at least a couple of the Republicans have concluded that Chief Judge =
Garland, the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in American
 history when you consider his 19 years of service on the federal bench, is=
 somebody who is deserving of a fair hearing and a yes-or-no vote.&nbsp; It=
&#8217;s even Republicans who have described him as a consensus nominee.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I did take note of some=
thing that Leader McConnell said last week that in some ways I think actual=
ly makes the case as strongly as anything that I&#8217;ve been able to come=
 up with.&nbsp; Senator McConnell, speaking on the floor of the House
 of -- or I&#8217;m sorry, of the United States Senate -- and this is not s=
omething that we had to dig into the archives on and find on C-SPAN from th=
ree decades ago but rather something that he said last week.&nbsp; Senator =
McConnell:&nbsp; &#8220;We are going to give the Senate
 every opportunity to do the basic work of government this year,&#8221; he =
said.&nbsp; &#8220;Some have said that because it is an election year we ca=
n&#8217;t do much.&nbsp; I would like to remind everyone that we have had a=
 regularly scheduled election in this country every two years
 since 1788 right on time.&nbsp; I heard some people say we can&#8217;t do =
it because we have an election next year, and others have said we can&#8217=
;t do whatever it is because we have an election this year.&nbsp; We have e=
lections in this year right on time, and that is not an
 excuse not to do our work.&#8221;&nbsp; I think Senator McConnell said it =
quite well.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.=
&nbsp; Now that we have sort of the fruits, we&#8217;re seeing this happen =
now that we only have eight people on the Supreme Court.&nbsp; So how big o=
f a concern is it that we&#8217;re going to see this happen again and again=
?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
again, I think it is unclear exactly what role the protracted vacancy on th=
e Supreme Court had on this -- the outcome here, in part because the announ=
cement reflected the unanimous view of the
 justices.&nbsp; Now, would they have been able to cobble together a differ=
ent agreement if Justice Scalia were still alive and serving on the bench, =
or if Chief Judge Garland had been confirmed as he should be to the Supreme=
 Court? It&#8217;s very unclear exactly what
 the difference would be.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think what is undeniabl=
e, though, is that even Republicans have failed to make any sort of coheren=
t case that the American people are better served by having a vacancy on th=
e Supreme Court.&nbsp; That flies in the
 face of certainly the argument that President Obama has made.&nbsp; It als=
o flies in the face of the argument that President Reagan has made.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that&#8217;s the chall=
enge that we&#8217;re seeking to overcome.&nbsp; And the truth is I think t=
his is the -- this underscores the discomfort, the obvious discomfort, that=
 Republican senators have shown in trying to defend their
 position.&nbsp; The fact is, there&#8217;s no good justification for allow=
ing this vacancy to persist.&nbsp; And it is simply a result of Republican =
senators refusing to do their job, and refusing to do their job at the spec=
ific request of Leader McConnell.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So again, I&#8217;m not e=
xactly sure exactly what the broader Republican aim is, particularly when y=
ou consider the views of most Republican senators about both presidential c=
andidates.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s something for them
 to explain.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.=
&nbsp; And speaking of presidential candidates, Bill Clinton as economic cz=
ar for Hillary Clinton -- is that a good thing for Democrats?<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
again, Democrats will have to decide.&nbsp; Ultimately this will factor in,=
 I&#8217;m sure, into the decision that some Democrats will have to make in=
 terms of choosing a nominee. I think what I can just
 say generally is I think those of you who remember -- and I think -- belie=
ve at least some of you in here covered the 2012 Democratic convention down=
 in Charlotte -- you may remember a speech that former President Clinton de=
livered on national television in
 which he articulated an economic strategy and an economic vision entirely =
consistent with what President Obama has fought for in his seven and a half=
 years in office.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I think the results s=
peak for themselves.&nbsp; They certainly spoke volumes in evaluating Presi=
dent Clinton&#8217;s legacy. They also speak volumes about the progress tha=
t we&#8217;ve made in this country over the last seven
 and a half years of President Obama&#8217;s tenure in office, even -- agai=
n, after all, Leader McConnell himself said it best when he acknowledged th=
at our country was better off -- is better off now than we were when Presid=
ent Obama took office.&nbsp; And a lot of that
 is because of the economic strategy that President Obama has pursued to gr=
ow our economy from the middle out, to be focused on the middle class, to b=
e focused on job creation, and to be focused on the future of our economy t=
hat will be critical to our long-term
 success.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh,=
 in the aftermath of the administration&#8217;s initiatives last week on tr=
ansgender rights, one issue that remains is the ban prohibiting transgender=
 people from serving openly in the armed services.&nbsp; Last
 week, Secretary Carter said the issue was complicated, which was detailed =
in a Washington Post report over the weekend on agreements on lifting that =
ban.&nbsp; Shouldn&#8217;t the White House apply the same standard on the P=
entagon for transgender access as it has done
 for education, health care and bathroom use?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Chris, I think that we have long acknowledged, even on issues that are rele=
vant to the LGBT community, that ensuring the effective implementation of p=
olicies at the Department of Defense has
 higher stakes than it may in other government agencies.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We&#8217;re talking about=
 our basic national security.&nbsp; And what the Secretary of Defense has c=
oncluded -- and the President agrees -- is that qualified American citizens=
 should not be denied an opportunity to serve their
 country just because of who they are or who they love.&nbsp; Our national =
security is enhanced when we can draw upon the skills and expertise and pat=
riotism of every American.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that&#8217;s part of =
what motivated Secretary Carter to conduct this review and seek the smooth =
implementation of a policy that would allow transgender Americans -- again,=
 who meet the relevant qualifications -- to
 serve our country.&nbsp; But the smooth and effective implementation of th=
is policy is not insignificant. And what Secretary Carter and the other ser=
vices are conscientiously moving forward to do is to figure out the best wa=
y to settle on a policy and implement
 it effectively and as expeditiously as possible.&nbsp; And that's what the=
y continue to work on.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last we=

 the joint guidance for schools on transgender students.&nbsp; Is the Presi=
dent receiving the same kind of updates with regards to the military servic=
e
 guidance?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e President does have a regular opportunity to meet with the Secretary of D=
efense in the Oval Office when they both happen to be in town.&nbsp; It hap=
pens once or twice a week -- I'm sorry -- once a week or once every
 two weeks. And the President is updated on a range of issues that Secretar=
y Carter is focused on.&nbsp; I'm not going to read out the details of ever=
y conversation that they have, but it's fair for you to assume that in thos=
e conversations the President is kept
 apprized as necessary of the progress of this review.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One suc=

&#8217;s schedule.&nbsp; Will the President, during this meeting, call on t=

</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, the =
President -- again, I'm not going to walk through the agenda for their meet=

Defense is handling this review as conscientiously as they
 should.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, i=
s the President proud of his Syria policy?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ol=
ivier, I think the President is certainly pleased that the Syria policy tha=
t he has put forward&nbsp; -- and he&#8217;s confident that the Syria polic=
y that he has put forward and pursued has advanced the national security
 interest of the United States.&nbsp; What is also true is that we've seen =
terrible violence in Syria; it's an awful humanitarian situation and it's a=
 genuine human tragedy.&nbsp; And it's a dangerous place and it's a place t=
hat poses a heightened risk to the United
 States and to our allies and interests around the world.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why the President an=
d his team have spent so much time focused on how to confront that risk, ho=
w to counter that risk, and how to work with the international community to=
 ultimately destroy ISIL.&nbsp; But there is no denying that
 what has happened in Syria has changed millions of lives, and not for the =
better.&nbsp; And that's a testament to the failed political leadership of =
Bashar al-Assad.&nbsp; It's a testament to the way that the political chaos=
 in that country has propagated so much violence,
 not just in Syria but throughout the region.&nbsp; And people fleeing that=
 violence have gone to far-flung countries around the world in a way that h=
as been genuinely destabilizing to some of the countries where they&#8217;v=
e sought refuge.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the long-term consequenc=
es of what&#8217;s been happening in Syria are serious, but the President d=
oes believe that the way that he has handled this situation is entirely con=
sistent with our national security interest.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when=
 Ben Rhodes tells Syria activists we are not proud of our Syria policy -- i=
s that a fair characterization of how the White House views its own policy?=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ol=
ivier, again, I can't speak to any of that conversation.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217=
;t there for that conversation, so I don't really know the context in which=
 it came up.&nbsp; But I think the description that I have just put forward
 of the situation in Syria and the way that the President has focused on ou=
r interests in that situation are consistent with the way that Ben views th=
at situation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at =
the risk of giving everybody whiplash, in the GQ interview, the President w=
as asked, &#8220;Have you ever said, give me the JFK assassination files, I=
 want to read them, give me all the secret stuff,&#8221; and the President =
says,
 &#8220;I got to tell you, it's a little disappointing.&nbsp; People always=
 ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff g=
oing on that's top secret isn't nearly as exciting as you&#8217;d expect.&#=
8221;&nbsp; Why not make it public?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
haven't looked at the documents, so it's unclear to me exactly what the equ=
ities might be.&nbsp; So maybe at the next news conference you can have the=
 opportunity to ask the President that yourself -- which would be
 interesting.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

nbsp; Can you explain what those changes might be and why they&#8217;re bei=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have any announcements about our sanctions against Burma at this point.&nbs=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST: &nbsp;Judge Ga=
rland -- Chief Judge Garland is heading back up to Capitol Hill where he'll=
 have a series of meetings this week.&nbsp; He'll be meeting tomorrow with =
Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island.&nbsp; On Wednesday, he'll have a meeting
 with Senator Hirono of Hawaii and Senator Udall and Senator Murphy.&nbsp; =
And on Thursday, he&#8217;ll meet with Senators Merkley and Heinrich.&nbsp;=
 So that is another six senators -- all Democrats this week.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Repu=
blicans?&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; At this =
point, no, I&#8217;m not aware of any meetings that he has coming up with R=
epublicans this week.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the=
re been any response to the questionnaire that was handed in last week?<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 did make note of the fact that this is a question that was a questionnaire=
 that was accepted by Republicans and I believe posted on the committee web=
site.&nbsp; So I think it&#8217;s an indication that at least the American
 public now has access to even more evidence to illustrate why the Presiden=
t has chosen Chief Judge Garland to assume the important responsibility of =
serving a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have=
 a team that&#8217;s been doing some reporting about the number of American=
s who are involved in ISIS, trying to join, being recruited, so on and so f=
orth.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering, how big a problem does the administration =
see this as
 -- Americans -- I think the number is about 250 -- who have tried to join.=
&nbsp; There are a few dozen who have made it to Iraq and Syria.&nbsp; How =
serious is that part of the problem?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ro=
n, when we&#8217;ve talked about our counter-ISIL strategy, we&#8217;ve tal=
ked a lot about the military aspect of that strategy, particularly as it&#8=
217;s focused on taking ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria off the battlefie=
ld.&nbsp;
 And that obviously is an important priority.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But another key priority in=
 which the administration has deeply invested is countering violent extremi=
sm and countering the efforts of ISIL to radicalize vulnerable populations =
around the world, including inside the United States.&nbsp;
 And we&#8217;ve worked diligently with community leaders across the countr=
y, include in the Muslim community, to counter the strategy that we know IS=
IL has, which is to recruit people from around the world to do one of two t=
hings -- to either carry out attacks where
 they are or travel to Iraq and Syria and take up arms in that region of th=
e world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is an issue that we=
 take quite seriously.&nbsp; The good news is that when you consider the su=
ccess that ISIL has had thus far in radicalizing Americans to their cause, =
that the percentage of people -- based on the sizeable population
 of the United States -- is much lower than it has been in other countries.=
&nbsp; But that&#8217;s not a coincidence.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a product of =
hard work, and we remain vigilant in countering those efforts because we un=
derstand the potential negative consequences of failing
 in that effort.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I under=
stand there are investigations going on in just about every state.&nbsp; Do=
es that sound about right?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
wouldn&#8217;t have anything to say about any ongoing investigations. &nbsp=
;You can always check with the FBI about that.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hav=
e you been able to develop a sense of who are the most -- is there a group,=
 a region, a category of people who you think are most vulnerable to this?&=
nbsp; And is there any more specifics about what you&#8217;re doing, or wha=
t law
 enforcement is doing, or what anyone is doing, for that matter, to try and=
 combat this particular -- is the phenomenon getting smaller, bigger?&nbsp;=
 Just trying to get a bit more about just how big a problem this is.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ro=
n, I think as even your network&#8217;s reporting shows that there&#8217;s =
-- the people from all walks of life are potentially vulnerable to this kin=
d of radicalization; that it&#8217;s not focused on just one region of the =
country
 or on one specific community.&nbsp; And in some ways, that&#8217;s what ma=
kes them so dangerous.&nbsp; This is a pretty amorphous effort that they ha=
ve undertaken.&nbsp; Obviously they are able to use social media to interac=
t with the world and that poses some significant challenges.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our countering violent extr=
emism efforts are actually based over at the Department of Homeland Securit=
y, and they are focused on understanding the way that ISIL has used social =
media in particular to try to recruit people.&nbsp; We have
 worked hard to lift up the voices in the Muslim community that can effecti=
vely counter the radical ideology that&#8217;s being propagated by ISIL ext=
remists.&nbsp; But we can certainly get you a more comprehensive rundown fr=
om the Department of Homeland Security about
 what they&#8217;ve done to counter these efforts.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wante=
d to ask you about a development out of the Treasury Department today that =
certainly had some coordination with the White House in one of the implicat=
ions for White House policy.&nbsp; The Treasury Department had disclosed th=
at
 Saudi Arabia now holds $116 billion in U.S. debt.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m wond=
ering, is it now going to be going forward -- the government&#8217;s policy=
 to release the Saudi data rather than keep it secret, as it had been for a=
 few decades?&nbsp; And do you have a handle on whether
 that is the full extent of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s treasury holdings?&nbsp; T=
here had been a New York Times report that there was something like $750 bi=
llion in play that the Saudis were going to pull back if that bill went for=
ward.&nbsp; Part three of my one-subject question
 is what&#8217;s the state of play now with that legislation?&nbsp; Are you=
 working actively to try to head this bill off?&nbsp; Is there actually a v=
eto threat out there now?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the state of that?<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, fo=
r the technical aspects of the report from Treasury in terms of what their =
disclosure schedule is moving forward, I&#8217;d encourage you to check wit=
h them.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But tha=
t&#8217;s a shift in policy.&nbsp; I mean, you --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the Department of Treasure has indicated that that was the case.&nbsp=
; And those of you who follow these reports closely noticed the difference.=
&nbsp; So I&#8217;m not suggesting that somehow that there hasn&#8217;t bee=
n a change
 in policy, but for how that policy will be implemented moving forward I en=
courage you to check with the Treasury Department.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t seen the la=
test legislative proposal from Congress as it relates to Saudi Arabia, but =
obviously the concerns that we have with the way that it was written when i=
t was presented last month are still significant and I know
 that there has been some talk on Capitol Hill about potentially revising t=
hat legislation, but I don&#8217;t know where that effort stands at this po=
int.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you=
 speak to the question of whether that $116 billion is comprehensive, or ar=
e you referring that to Treasury?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I encour=
age you to check with Treasury on that as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I t=
oss out a Vietnam question? <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Sure.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you=
 talk a little bit from the podium about how the President wants to mark th=
e legacy of the Vietnam War when he goes and about this idea of him being a=
t war longer than any other U.S. President -- largely because of issues
 that he inherited -- how he will address that broader topic in Vietnam par=
ticularly --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, la=
st week, the President&#8217;s National Security Advisor had an opportunity=
 to meet with Vietnam War-era veterans and veterans service organizations t=
o talk about the President&#8217;s trip.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s impossible fo=
r any American
 President to go to Vietnam without acknowledging the history between our t=
wo countries.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth is, there&#8217;s=
 a whole generation of Americans that proudly served this country in Vietna=
m.&nbsp; And I think the mistake that most Americans if not all Americans a=
cknowledge that was made in this country at that time is that there
 was a tendency to allow political concerns with American foreign policy to=
 interfere with showing respect and gratitude to fellow Americans who had p=
ut themselves in great peril to serve the country.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think this President,=
 like many Americans, is determined to make sure that that never happens ag=
ain.&nbsp; And so I think you can anticipate that on his trip, the Presiden=
t will acknowledge that history but will do so with the courageous
 service of hundreds of thousands of patriotic Americans in mind.<o:p></o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, d=
o you have a reaction to the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro&#8217;s de=
claration of a state of emergency?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I didn&#=
8217;t see that announcement from President Maduro.&nbsp; Obviously the rep=
orting, particularly just over the last couple of days about the situation =
in Venezuela is breathtaking. The conditions for the Venezuelan population
 are terrible.&nbsp; And obviously we continue to be quite concerned about =
the wellbeing of the people of Venezuela.&nbsp; And we stand with the inter=
national community in expressing that concern.&nbsp; But the solution to th=
ese challenges will require the inclusion of all
 interested parties. And now is the time for leaders to listen to diverse V=
enezuelan voices and work together peacefully to try to find solutions.&nbs=
p;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the failure to do that =
only puts hundreds of thousands if not millions of Venezuelans at risk of f=
urther suffering.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, I=
 want to ask a couple of questions on two different subjects.&nbsp; One, AC=
A.&nbsp; With the months that you have remaining here at the White House, w=
hat are the lessons learned when it comes to ACA?&nbsp; I mean, you had the=
 ruling today
 and then also last week you had another one about subsidizing insurance or=
 subsidizing co-pays for some of the people who wanted it.&nbsp; So what ar=
e some of the lessons learned?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think certainly one of the lessons that we&#8217;ve seen from Republican cr=
itics of the bill is that they&#8217;re going to stop at nothing to try to =
tear this bill down.&nbsp; But I continue to be confident that they&#8217;r=
e going
 to continue to fail.&nbsp; And as it relates to the district court ruling =
that we saw last week, it&#8217;s unfortunate that Republicans have even re=
sorted to getting taxpayers to foot the bill for their political efforts.&n=
bsp; That&#8217;s disappointing and I don&#8217;t think even
 some Americans who might be skeptical of the impact of the Affordable Care=
 Act I don&#8217;t think would appreciate that their taxpayer funds are bei=
ng used in this way.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we continue to have a lo=
t of confidence in the power of the legal arguments that we&#8217;ve been m=
aking for some time.&nbsp; I think at this point the Justice Department has=
 built up a pretty effective track record for our success in protecting
 the Affordable Care Act so that millions of Americans can get access to th=
e health care that they&#8217;ve long been denied.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a leg=
acy that President Obama is quite proud of.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the =
President himself -- early on, critics were saying things needed to change,=
 and the President said he welcomed ideas about how to tweak it.&nbsp; Look=
ing back, what are some of the areas beyond the Supreme Court issues -- or
 maybe even with the Supreme Court rulings -- that you would tweak in these=
 waning months?&nbsp; And also, is there a fear that once this administrati=
on is over, number 45 comes in, that things could be different for ACA?<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, at=
 this point, we&#8217;re quite proud of the record of the ACA.&nbsp; Every =
single month since President Obama signed that bill into law, our economy h=
as created private-sector jobs.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a pretty good track reco=
rd, particularly
 when you consider that Republicans, even six years later, try to describe =
that bill as a job-killer.&nbsp; At some point, somebody is going to call t=
hem out for, again, either being wrong or lying.&nbsp; But there will be am=
ple time for that, as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The legacy of the Afforda=
ble Care Act is 20 million more people now have access to health care that =
didn&#8217;t before, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp; The growth in=
 health care costs is lower than it&#8217;s ever been
 in the history of tracking that measurement; that&#8217;s more than 50 yea=
rs now.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we&#8217;ve made a lot=
 of important -- to say nothing of the benefits that millions of Americans =
who had health insurance before the Affordable Care Act now enjoy because o=
f the patient protections that are included
 in that legislation.&nbsp; No one in America can be discriminated against =
because they have a preexisting condition.&nbsp; Every child, every young a=
dult in America is eligible to stay on their parents&#8217; health insuranc=
e until they turn 26 because of the Affordable Care
 Act.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">A whole range of preventa=
tive services are now available to Americans for free because of the Afford=
able Care Act.&nbsp; That&#8217;s quite a legacy.&nbsp; And that includes m=
illions of Americans that think that they&#8217;re unaffected
 by the Affordable Care Act because they haven&#8217;t had to go and purcha=
se insurance through the exchanges, but yet they benefit in ways that have =
a profound impact on their family&#8217;s budget and on their health.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this is a piece of leg=
islation that the President remains intensely proud of.&nbsp; And the legac=
y of this legislation is a stronger economy and a country full of citizens =
whose health prospects are enhanced because
 of this bill.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And w=
ith that issue of high deductibles for some of these insured -- is that any=
thing that could be tweaked or looked at or viewed through a microscope?&nb=
sp; Because some people have complained about higher deductibles
 through this process.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Again,=
 April, this is an argument that we&#8217;ve been making for six years.&nbs=
p; The health insurance market is a lot better for private citizens now tha=
n it was before the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp; That&#8217;s just
 a fact.&nbsp; And I know that&#8217;s a fact that Republicans like to deny=
, but it&#8217;s the truth.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And m=
y last question.&nbsp; There&#8217;s this increased interest in Roswell.&nb=
sp; You&#8217;re doing your dance at the podium about it.&nbsp; Is there a =
such thing?&nbsp; Are you -- look at you, you&#8217;re drinking so you&#821=
7;re trying to think.&nbsp;
 (Laughter.)&nbsp; Is there a such thing -- are you keeping quiet because o=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#821=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Okay.&=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=

 would be, if nothing else, instructive, if not enlightening?<o:p></o:p></p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
we have all of the available evidence that&#8217;s necessary to evaluate wh=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So again, if they want to=

I guess part of the reason is that there are administration officials who, =
on countless occasions, have traveled up to Capitol Hill to participate in =
hearings about the Iran deal.&nbsp; There have
 been literally dozens of congressional engagements about the Iran deal sin=
ce January of 2015.&nbsp; The most recent example of this -- you have actua=
lly the person who&#8217;s in charge of implementing the Iran deal under Se=
cretary of State Tom Shannon, who appeared
 before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and he appeared there solel=
y to discuss Iran and the Iran deal.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And, in fact, the House F=
oreign Affairs Committee held an open hearing with the coordinator from the=
 Department of State on this question back in February.&nbsp; I guess my po=
int is -- and I guess the other metric here
 that I think is relevant is that the administration has provided classifie=
d briefings or appeared at open hearings to discuss the Iran deal more than=
 30 times in just the last 18 months.&nbsp; So if it were a matter of just =
one hearing that would convince Republicans
 to stop lying or to at least start telling the truth when it comes to the =
Iran deal, then presumably that would have happened in one of the first 30 =

r of detainees?&nbsp; And if you have any announcements about potential tra=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Somebody=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I will.&=
nbsp; It's not a surprising number.&nbsp; And I think that's the other part=
 of this.&nbsp; Every time there&#8217;s a transfer we announce it publicly=
.&nbsp; So if there&#8217;s a change to that number since the last time tha=
t we spoke, that's
 something that you would have seen because we do make an affirmative publi=
c announcement every time that that happens.&nbsp; But I will make sure som=
ebody follows up with you today to give you the specific remaining count.<o=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cha=
ir of the House Appropriations Committee has introduced a bill for $622 mil=
lion to fund Zika.&nbsp; It's all out of existing money and it comes with t=
he statement again that the administration has failed to answer -- repeated=
ly
 failed to answer questions about where and how the money would be spent.&n=
bsp; Is it enough money?&nbsp; And are there questions you haven't answered=
?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, no=
t that I'm aware of, because I do continue -- while sometimes I don't have =
the Gitmo guidance that Kevin is looking for, I have made a habit of bringi=
ng this with me.&nbsp; This is the letter that was sent by the White
 House to congressional leaders on February 22nd, detailing exactly how our=
 $1.9 billion appropriations request should be used to protect the American=
 people from the Zika virus.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we are, almost three m=
onths later, and we hear that some House Republicans have gotten around to =
considering a piece of legislation that is only about a third of what our p=
ublic health professionals say is necessary to do everything
 possible to protect the American people.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, t=
here&#8217;s been some money spent already, right?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, not because Congress did anything.&nbsp; There have been some funds th=
at have been reprogrammed by the Centers for Disease Control and a couple o=
f other health care-related agencies that have been devoted to this
 effort.&nbsp; But that is essentially the bureaucratic equivalent of diggi=
ng through the sofa cushions to try to come up with the necessary money.&nb=
sp; So the truth is our public health professionals shouldn&#8217;t be redu=
ced to doing that when it comes to something as
 critically important as protecting the American people from the Zika virus=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, the thing that I wi=
ll say is that at some point this summer -- and we're probably not that far=
 off from it -- there&#8217;s going to be widespread public reporting about=
 the threat of the Zika virus, and there will be questions,
 I'm confident, in this room by all of you, wondering why the federal gover=
nment didn&#8217;t more effectively plan to protect the American people fro=
m the Zika virus.&nbsp; And my answer then will be, we've been trying.&nbsp=
; The President held a meeting on this back in January.&nbsp;
 The President made clear the first week in February that we were going to =
have a specific request for funding.&nbsp; The administration put forward t=
hat specific request just a couple of weeks later in the form of the letter=
 that I just held up.&nbsp; And we've not
 seen Republicans act.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I don't really know wha=
t the explanation is for that.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t really aware of the fac=
t that there was a partisan difference about the need to protect the Americ=
an people from Zika virus.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cha=
irman is saying you still haven't provided full accounting of justification=
 for the request.&nbsp; And given the lack of complete information, indepen=
dent determinations on necessary funding levels have not been made.&nbsp; A=
ny future
 funding now has to wait, he says, until the fiscal year 2017.&nbsp; <o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I don't think that's going to be a satisfactory explanation to the Ame=
rican people when they see that pregnant women and babies across this count=
ry are at extreme risk because of the Zika virus.&nbsp; The truth
 is our public health professionals have had many conversations with member=
s of Congress about what exactly is needed.&nbsp; There are countless lette=
rs that have gone back and forth, including the first one that I just held =
up from February 22, 2016.&nbsp; So if there
 was something in that February 22nd letter that Republicans in Congress di=
dn&#8217;t understand, why didn&#8217;t they pick up the phone on February =
23rd and ask about it?&nbsp; Waiting a day to deal with an emergency situat=
ion seems like -- I guess it's a legitimate question.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But here we are, three mont=
hs later, and Republicans are making bureaucratic excuses about why they ar=
e not dealing with what our public health professionals say is a genuine em=
ergency. And here&#8217;s the thing.&nbsp; It's not just scientists
 and it's not just Democrats at the White House who have raised these conce=
rns.&nbsp; I began my briefing one day last week by reading a letter from t=
he bipartisan group of governors all across the country who are deeply conc=
erned by congressional inaction and Republican
 obstruction to needed Zika virus funding.&nbsp; And we haven't gotten it, =
and the American people I think are rightly concerned about it.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, is it going to requir=
e the onset of that emergency before Republicans act?&nbsp; I sure hope not=
, but that's the direction it seems to be trending.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, i=
n terms of the nationwide guidance on&nbsp; transgender students that the a=
dministration put out last week, you and others have described it as a resp=
onse to school administrators on the state and local level who were asking
 for clarification.&nbsp; And I assume there was some consultation with tho=
se officials.&nbsp; I was interested into what extent the administration, t=
he Education and the Justice Departments consulted with top state elected o=
fficials in forming that guidance, whether
 anything was done on that front.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
I'd refer you, actually, to my colleagues in the Department of Education an=
d they can talk about the sense of outreach that they did to develop this p=
olicy guidance.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the thing that I wou=
ld just point you to is that the way that we can tell there was extensive o=
utreach is that the guidance that was produced included essentially case st=
udies of the way schools all across the country have dealt
 with this particular challenge.&nbsp; So those ideas didn&#8217;t just mat=
erialize, they were a result from intensive consultations by the Department=
 of Education to educators and community leaders all across the country.&nb=
sp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for the details of thos=
e conversations, I'd refer you to the Department of Education.&nbsp; Maybe =
they can provide you some more information about who exactly they consulted=
.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pre=
sident has now been at war longer than any U.S. President in history.&nbsp;=
 Does the President or the White House have any reaction to that unexpected=
 element of his legacy?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I'm not sure I would describe it as unexpected.&nbsp; I think those wh=
o listen carefully to the President&#8217;s arguments as a candidate for Pr=
esident understood that he believed that the United States had been distrac=
ted
 by the 2003 invasion of Iraq and had not been sufficiently focused on goin=
g after al Qaeda.&nbsp; And that's why President Obama ramped up the commit=
ment that the United States made to decimating core al Qaeda in Afghanistan=
 and Pakistan.&nbsp; And that was a mission
 that was carried out under very difficult circumstances by courageous memb=
ers of our armed forces.&nbsp; And they succeeded in decimating core al Qae=
da in that region of the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what we also knew was l=
ikely to happen is that the threat from al Qaeda elements around the world =
was likely to be more diffuse.&nbsp; And we do continue to be concerned abo=
ut dangerous al Qaeda elements in other countries.&nbsp; The dangers
 that they pose is different than the danger that was posed by core al Qaed=
a, but they are dangerous nonetheless.&nbsp; And the President has been vig=
ilant about countering those extremist organizations, ordering the military=
 to take action against them -- to take
 military action against them, all in the name of trying to protect the Ame=
rican people.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the success that our co=
untry has had in fighting core al Qaeda and in protecting the American peop=
le and in intensifying our ability to work with our allies around the world=
 to do that is an important part of President Obama&#8217;s
 legacy.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julie.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.=
&nbsp; I just want to follow up on Juliet&#8217;s question about the transg=
ender guidance, as well.&nbsp; You said last week that this was not a direc=
t response to what happened in North Carolina and the legislation there.&nb=
sp; Can you talk
 about whether you think that influenced the process at all?&nbsp; In other=
 words, were you hearing from more educators, more folks who had been follo=
wing this issue because of the public debate over that law, and some of you=
r own Cabinet members were actually coming
 out and saying that there was a risk of North Carolina endangering its own=
 funding?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
ere&#8217;s no denying that the scrutiny around this issue was increased dr=
amatically after states like North Carolina took the steps that they took.&=
nbsp; I know that there was a referendum that was considered by voters
 in the city of Houston, I believe last fall, around a similar question.&nb=
sp; So there&#8217;s no denying that in the last several months there has b=
een increased public awareness of dealing with this issue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what precise impact that=
 had on the process, again, I think I'd refer you to the Department of Educ=
ation, because ultimately they were the ones who were formulating this poli=
cy guidance and they were on the receiving end of people
 seeking the guidance.&nbsp; But I'll just go back to where I started, whic=
h is that there&#8217;s no denying that there has been a significant uptick=
 in public consideration of these kinds of questions, and that included a b=
roader public consideration of what kinds of
 policy responses were available to school administrators and local elected=
 officials.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that is a challenge that=
 many of those school administrators are dealing with across the country, a=
nd the desire on the part of the Department of Education was to empower tho=
se school administrators with more information and more
 good ideas about what steps they can take to protect the safety and dignit=
y of every student at their school.&nbsp; That ultimately is the goal of ad=
ministrators who are seeking to nurture an inclusive environment where thei=
r students can learn and get the best
 possible education.&nbsp; And the Department of Education is obviously ful=
ly supportive of that goal, and that's what motivated them to share this gu=
idance last week.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To your=
 knowledge, there wasn&#8217;t any effort by the White House to say, we kno=
w this policy was under consideration, now it's time to move forward with i=
t?&nbsp; Because there have been activists who have been asking for this fo=
r quite
 a long time.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; There ha=
ve been.&nbsp; But, look, this is a policy process that was the responsibil=
ity of the Department of Education.&nbsp; They obviously had to work closel=
y with the Department of Justice because there were important legal questio=
ns
 that were raised.&nbsp; And as you&#8217;d expect, the White House was not=
 just aware of these policy deliberations, but in the loop as decisions wer=
e being made to ensure that the guidance reflected the President&#8217;s va=
lues and the President&#8217;s preferences.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're =
obviously aware that this issue has created a lot of discussion around the =
country.&nbsp; Over the weekend, you heard some praise for the administrati=
on; you heard a lot of outrage as well.&nbsp; Is the White House concerned =
that
 you&#8217;ve given the Republican base a campaign issue here?<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
surprised to hear -- or I was not surprised to see that there were Republic=
an politicians who were seeking to use this as a political tool.&nbsp; And =
I think this goes to the core not just of what we were talking about
 in this room on Friday, but it goes in part to what the President was talk=
ing about in his commencement address at Rutgers on Sunday, and that is sim=
ply this:&nbsp; People who serve in government have a responsibility to loo=
k out for the best interests of the American
 people and to ensure that our values are reflected in the way the country =
is governed.&nbsp; And too often, there&#8217;s a tendency on the part of p=
oliticians to cynically use these kinds of decisions to score political poi=
nts and to slice and dice the electorate.&nbsp;
 And that&#8217;s unfortunate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The truth is school admin=
istrators across the country are dealing with an actual dilemma that has co=
nsequences for the safety and dignity of every student at their school.&nbs=
p; So when the response from politicians
 is just to use rhetoric that&#8217;s aimed at scoring political points, th=
at doesn&#8217;t protect any students&#8217; safety or dignity.&nbsp; What =
those school administrators need is practical advice.&nbsp; They need the l=
egal interpretations.&nbsp; They need good ideas that have been used
 by school administrators around the country to address this challenge.&nbs=
p; And that&#8217;s exactly what was provided by the Department of Educatio=
n, and they did that in spite of the cynical political gamesmanship of a lo=
t of Republican politicians across the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You m=
entioned the issue of safety.&nbsp; Can you explain why the administration =
moved relatively quickly on this issue, which carries the potential loss of=
 federal funding, when, in contrast, on the issue of sanctuary
 cities, the administration, for eight years, has not threatened to take aw=
ay a city&#8217;s federal funding for harboring dangerous illegal immigrant=
s?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
again, I think, as -- again, as we pointed out and discussed on Friday, the=
re were requests for this kind of guidance that had been coming to the Depa=
rtment of Education for more than a year.&nbsp;
 And so I think that there were many school administrators who had been wai=
ting a long time and urging the Department of Education to provide this gui=
dance.&nbsp; I think they would have liked to have seen it arrive even more=
 quickly than it did.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Look, it&#8217;s hard to =
keep track of the various proposals around sanctuary cities that have been =
put forward by Republicans.&nbsp; But the truth is, and the irony about thi=
s, is that it&#8217;s Republicans who blocked comprehensive
 immigration reform legislation.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s a little rich for Repu=
blicans to block the solution and then blame the President for not punishin=
g cities who are dealing with the problem.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, again, I think that a=
ctually is maybe even a better example of Republicans eschewing common-sens=
e solutions because it might interfere with their ability to deliver a pers=
uasive political message.&nbsp; And again,
 I think that&#8217;s relevant to a lot of what the President had to talk a=
bout in Rutgers yesterday.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Group=

 hurt their case, and there isn&#8217;t really precedent for the Supreme Co=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these are important =
positive benefits that are a direct result and part of the design of the Af=
fordable Care Act.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last statistic I&#8217;=
ll share in some ways is the most important one, that we've actually seen t=
he growth in health care costs held to the lowest level on record because o=
f the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp; And keeping those costs -- or that
 growth in costs low has a positive impact on our economy, has a positive i=
mpact on the bottom line of businesses large and small.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">It has a positive impact =
on the deficit -- all things that are important to this economy.&nbsp; And =
that's part of why the President made this issue a priority -- not just bec=
ause of the moral question about whether
 or not having access to health care is a right.&nbsp; The President believ=
es that it is, that every American is entitled to access to quality health =
care, but also because resolving this problem in the right way can be good =
for our economy and yield important economic
 benefits.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And after six years, it&#82=
17;s undeniable that that's been the case.&nbsp; And that hasn&#8217;t stop=
ped -- as I mentioned earlier, that hasn&#8217;t stopped Republicans from r=
esorting to all sorts of wild strategies to try to undermine the bill.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspect the reason they'r=
e trying to undermine the bill is because they all opposed it.&nbsp; So it&=
#8217;s a pretty cynical view on their -- a pretty cynical tactic on their =
part to try to undermine a bill that they opposed.&nbsp; Maybe that helps
 them justify why they opposed it, is if they can find a way to tear that l=
aw down and say, see, we told you it wouldn&#8217;t work.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the truth is they've be=
en unsuccessful in that effort.&nbsp; There have been previous occasions wh=
ere people have gotten excited and hope that, oh, well, maybe this will fin=
ally be the legal death blow to the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp; They've
 been wrong every single time.&nbsp; And as it relates to this specific cas=
e, I&#8217;m confident they're going to be wrong again.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah, I&#8217;ll give you =
the last one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; At the beginning, you suggested that the press too narrowly in=
terpreted the President&#8217;s comments yesterday in hearing them as being=
 about Trump.&nbsp; You said they're about the Republicans more generally.&=
nbsp; At the same
 time, we've seen a lot of coverage kind of suggesting a lot of ways that T=
rump doesn't fit with GOP orthodoxy.&nbsp; So could you just articulate kin=
d of the key areas where the White House sees Trump and the GOP as being in=
 lockstep?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I&=
#8217;ll let you guys talk about Mr. Trump&#8217;s campaign.&nbsp; We're go=
ing to be focused on what the President believes is important for the Ameri=
can people to consider as they head to the ballot box in November.&nbsp; An=
d the
 President&#8217;s opportunity to make that case in public will become more=
 frequent when we actually are in the general election stage of the campaig=
n.&nbsp; We're getting close to that, but we're not there yet.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the President will have=
 an ample opportunity to weigh in and make his case that the President who =
succeeds him is a President who is committed to building on all of the succ=
ess that we've enjoyed over the last seven years.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trump i=
s the presumptive GOP nominee at this point.&nbsp; Why not use his name?&nb=
sp; And once he really -- assuming he does ultimately, officially have that=
 title of nominee, will we hear the President speak about him by name, or i=
n a
 more specific way?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, as=
 you pointed out, the President has on occasion spoken directly about his c=
andidacy or some of this statements on the stump.&nbsp; And I suspect the P=
resident will do that again in the future.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just in terms of people=
 trying to understand exactly the message that the President was delivering=
 to the Class of 2016 at Rutgers, it&#8217;s important for them to understa=
nd the broader argument that the President was making.&nbsp; This
 is central to not just his presidency over the last seven years, but also =
central to the promise of his candidacy back in 2007 and 2008.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think there&#8217;s a=
 remarkable consistency to the President&#8217;s advocacy for these kinds o=
f issues and a remarkable consistency to the President&#8217;s arguments.&n=
bsp; And I think it&#8217;s important for that not to be lost in the swirl =
of the ongoing
 presidential campaign. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last qu=
estion.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been consistent discussion among Republicans do=
wn ballot about whether they should or could run against Trump or distance =
themselves from Trump.&nbsp; The way the Republican Party is right now, can=
 people down
 ballot, or especially in the Senate do that authentically?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
guess I would just note the difficulty that many candidates have encountere=
d in trying to do that.&nbsp; I know at least one candidate tried to draw a=
 distinction between supporting a candidate and endorsing a candidate.&nbsp=
;
 If that's the best they're going to be able to do, then I wish them luck.<=
