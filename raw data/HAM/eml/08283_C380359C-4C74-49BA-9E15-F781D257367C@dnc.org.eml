SL: Trump Now the "Puppet" of GOP SuperPACs and
Right-Wing Billionaires

"Despite numerous promises he would fund his own
campaign, Trump is now clearly the 'puppet' of
Republican SuperPACs and right-wing billionaires."
- DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach


Despite arguing he is "really rich" [link] and wouldn't
take campaign funds from donors because he XXX [comment
and link], Trump has since changed his tune.

This week Trump said would accept contributions for
his general election campaign. And, today, GOP
mega-donor Sheldon Adelson -- who spent XXX [amount
and link] on SuperPACs during the 2012 election -- indicated he
would support Trump's campaign. Of, course Trump
said just six months ago that Adelson was "looking to
give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold
him into his perfect little puppet." [link]
