Friend --

We have 195 days left to do absolutely everything we can to make sure that =
our next president is a Democrat, that they have a Democratic Senate to wor=
k with, and that we elect other great Democrats up and down the ballot in a=
ll 50 states.

It=92s a big job, but I know we have what it takes to get it done -- becaus=
e we have supporters like you, NAME.


DONORS

You=92ve already chipped in $XX so far during this election, and I can=92t =
thank you enough for that. It=92s what helps us keep the lights turned on a=
round here, yes, but it also builds the war chest we=92ll need to face the =
Republicans and puts Democrats in the best possible position to win in Nove=
mber. Now is the time when we need everyone to dig a little deeper to help =
us cross that finish line, and we=92re counting on grassroots supporters li=
ke you to help us get there.

We have a big deadline coming up on Saturday, NAME -- can I count on you to=
 step up again and chip in $10 or more right now?

We still have a few more caucuses and primaries between now and our convent=

 ground running to beat whoever the Republicans nominate.

And NAME, the $XX that you=92ve chipped in so far this election is going to=
 help us keep a Republican out of the White House. But the stakes are too h=

nted, and we need our best grassroots supporters -- people like you -- to k=
eep stepping up so our great candidates have a fighting chance.

Before Saturday=92s deadline, will you pitch in $10 or more one more time t=
o help elect Democrats?

Remember a couple months ago when we were welcoming in the New Year? If you=
r answer to that is =93Sure, vaguely=85=94 -- well, that makes two of us, N=
AME. We are 40 state primaries and caucuses in to 2016, just 92 days away f=
rom our convention in Philadelphia, and only a little over six months away =
from the day we elect our next Democratic President of the United States. <=
LINK>But before then, we=92re facing major deadlines, like the one coming u=
p this Saturday. Your donation of $10 or whatever you can today helps prepa=
re us for those rapidly approaching days ahead of us.</LINK>

Those are some pretty big countdowns ahead of us, NAME. Every last day lead=
ing up to these milestones matter tremendously and I=92m hoping that you=92=
ll help us keep up the momentum we need to win -- starting with our deadlin=
e this Saturday:

I know we ask a lot of you, NAME, and I want you to know how much I appreci=

Friend --

We're less than 100 days from our convention, a little over six months from=
 Election Day, and we've had 40 state primaries and caucuses so far, so I w=
anted to take a minute to let you know where things stand.

Here's how you've been a part of our efforts so far this election:


NON-ACTIONTAKERS

Email subscriber: Yes (We're glad to have you here!)
Online action taker: No (<LINK>If you want to let us know you're standing w=
ith Democrats, click here.</LINK>)
2016 Election donor: Not yet

NONDONORS

Email subscriber: Yes (We're glad to have you here!)
Online action taker: Yep (Thanks for showing your support for Democrats.)
2016 Election donor: Not yet

DONORS

Email subscriber: Yes (We're glad to have you here!)
Online action taker: Yep (Thanks for showing your support for Democrats.)
2016 Election donor: Yes (And we appreciate it more than I can say, NAME.)


No matter how you choose to get engaged with the Democratic Party and our a=
mazing candidates, both at the presidential level and down the ticket in al=
l 50 states, we're so glad that you're on the team. Because at the end of t=
he day, we all know that we simply can't allow a President Trump to replace=
 Barack Obama in the White House.

And to stop that from happening, we've all got to work together, harder tha=
n we ever have before. I know we can do it, but we need to dig deep. That's=
 why today I'm asking you to step up (donors: again) and pitch in $10 or wh=
atever you can before Saturday's end-of-month deadline.

LINKS

With another Democrat in the White House -- and a Democratic Congress to ba=
ck him or her up -- we're not just going to protect President Obama's progr=
ess, we're going to build on it so that generations of Americans to come ha=
ve a fair shot to succeed.

Thank you for everything you do.

All the best,

Amy
