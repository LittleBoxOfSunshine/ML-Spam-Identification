>>> The White House is hosting a summit in June called the United State of Women. One piece of the 2 days will be a huge concert at the convention center. This piece needs some fundraising support (and is separate from the summit so can take $$). They've come to us asking if we have donors who would be interested in sponsoring the concert. I think sponsorship levels will range from $5k - $20k. Sponsors will definitely have time with the musicians/talent (tbd), recognition at the concert, and hopefully some other cool perks. Obviously they can go to the summit too.
