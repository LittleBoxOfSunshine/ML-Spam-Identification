DATE:                        April 22, 2016





2016 CYCLE OVERVIEW



Democrats are excited about the 2016 Democratic primary election season, an=
d that=92s because we have strong candidates who are dedicated to solving t=
he issues that matter most to Americans.  Voters are eager to cast their vo=
te for the next Democratic presidential nominee and participate in the Demo=
cratic delegate selection process in their state.  Our process aims to upho=
ld our Party=92s values of inclusivity, diversity, and transparency.



Here is the Democratic delegate selection process by the numbers:



=B7        4,765 =3D total number of Democratic delegates as of today

=B7        4,051 =3D total number of pledged Democratic delegates

=B7        714 =3D total number of unpledged delegates

=B7        2,383 =3D number of delegate votes needed to win the Democratic =
nomination as of today

=B7        57 =3D the number of presidential nominating contests





PROCESS DEVELOPMENT



The DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee (RBC) reviews the Delegate Selection Rul=
es prior to each presidential election year.  While the general structure o=
f the Democratic delegate selection process has been in place since 1972, t=
he Committee, over the course of many public meetings, reflects on the dele=
gate selection process of the previous cycle and updates the Rules accordin=
gly.



The RBC met five times in 2014 in order to finalize the Delegate Selection =
Rules for the 2016 cycle, which were then shared with the 57 state and terr=
itory Democratic parties.  In May of 2015, each party submitted their Deleg=
ate Selection Plan to the RBC.  These plans were subsequently reviewed by t=
he Committee to ensure compliance with the DNC=92s Delegate Selection Rules=
 during the summer of 2015 at three public meetings, attended by press, pre=
sidential campaigns, and other interested parties, held on June 26, July 24=
 and August 27.  In partnership with the RBC, DNC staff, and presidential c=
ampaigns, state parties work to implement their Delegate Selection Plans st=
arting in September of 2015 until the process draws to a close.



While state and territory parties are the drivers of their process, the cre=
ation and implementation of their Plans are governed by the DNC=92s Delegat=
e Selection Rules, the Call for the Convention, and the Regulations of the =
Rules and Bylaws Committee.  These materials provide states and territories=
 with the guidance that ensures fundamental values of the Democratic Party=
=97such as a commitment to diversity and participation of all eligible vote=
rs=97are upheld throughout this process.  For example, each state and terri=
tory party solicits public comment on their Plan for no less than 30 days t=
o allow for input from constituents, making the drafting of the Delegate Se=
lection Plan a democratic process.



Additionally, each state is required to develop and implement an extensive =
affirmative action and inclusion outreach plan. The state and territory par=
ties as well as presidential campaigns are tasked with conducting widesprea=
d outreach and recruitment to encourage Democrats of all backgrounds to run=
 to be delegates.  Our Party believes that our convention should look like =
America, and state and territory parties and campaigns are responsible for =
striving to meet that diversity goal.





THE REPUBLICAN DELEGATE SELECTION PROCESS VERSUS THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS



Some stark differences between the Democrats=92 delegate selection process =
and the Republican=92s delegate selection process were mentioned in the pre=
vious section, but that=92s not where the differences end.  Outlined below =
are some major differences between our process and that of the Republicans:



=B7        A commitment to diversity and equal representation of men and wo=
men

=B7        The solicitation of input from the public during the creation of=
 a state=92s Delegate Selection Plan

=B7        The transparent development of our Rules

=B7        Proportional allocation of pledged delegates to presidential can=
didates based on the results of the state=92s primary or caucus

o   Unlike the Republicans, we do not allow for =93winner-take all=94 outco=
mes, meaning that the candidate who wins the majority vote in a state does =
not win all of the state=92s delegates.

o   Instead, presidential candidates who break threshold, which is 15% in a=
ll states, are allocated delegates proportional to the percentage of the vo=
te that they won in the primary or caucus.

o   Delegates must affirm in writing that they are bona fide supporters of =
the candidates that they are representing in the delegation and are subject=
 to review by each campaign.

o   We believe that this is the fairest way to reflect the intention of Dem=
ocratic voters and to mirror the results at each step in the delegate selec=
tion process in the states.

=B7        Delegates elected in the states are pledged not bound, meaning t=
hat they are required only to represent in good faith those who elected the=
m.





UNPLEDGED DELEGATES



An often discussed feature of the Democratic delegate selection process is =
the unpledged delegates, also referred to as =93superdelegates.=94  These i=
ndividuals serve by virtue of the elected office that they hold, and they i=
nclude:



=B7        Democratic Governors

=B7        Democratic Members of Congress

=B7        Distinguished Party Leaders (such as former presidents and forme=
r leaders in the Senate and the House)

=B7        DNC Members



We ensure these leaders have a voice in our convention, and their existence=
 as a separate group means that interested voters don=92t have to run again=
st elected officials in order to attend the Democratic National Convention.=
 Unpledged delegates are also distinguished by the fact that they are not p=
ledged to a presidential candidate based on the results of their state=92s =
primary or caucus and instead exercise their best judgment when selecting a=
 presidential candidate to support.



Concerns that unpledged delegates may change the outcome of the election ar=
e historically unfounded=97unpledged delegates have never changed the outco=
me of an election since unpledged delegates were established over 30 years =
ago.  Like pledged delegates, unpledged delegate cast one vote, which carri=
es the same weight as the vote of any other delegate.



There have been recent reports of harassment or mistreatment of state parti=
es who are managing the process in their state and unpledged delegates.  Th=
is does not reflect the values of this process and our great Party.  State =
Parties are working year round to elect Democrats at every level and are th=
e foundation of our Party.  Unpledged delegates have been a feature of our =
process for many decades and will continue to play a role.



We encourage all interested parties, including presidential candidates and =
members of the press and public, to learn all about their state=92s process=
. It is important that our process is open, transparent, and maximizes part=
icipation.  Each state plan has undergone a rigorous review process to ensu=
re compliance with our Rules, and changing Rules midway through the cycle w=
ould lead to confusion among participants in the delegate selection process=
, unnecessary costs to state parties, and inconsistent standards for states=
 to abide by.



Our Party spends years preparing for each presidential election cycle, and =
we believe that our process is designed to best position our Party and our =
eventual nominee for victory in the general election in November.  We are l=
ooking forward to the Democratic National Convention in July where our dele=
gates will cast their vote for the next President of the United States.

 important that our process is open, transparent, and maximizes participati=
