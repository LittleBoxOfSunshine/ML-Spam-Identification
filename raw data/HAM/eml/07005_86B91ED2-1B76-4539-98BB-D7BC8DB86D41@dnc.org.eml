Sanders Raises $26M in April and Breaks $200M Raised for Campaign

WASHINGTON =96 Bernie Sanders=92 presidential campaign on Sunday announced =
that supporters made almost 1 million donations in April totaling $25.8 mil=
lion, far surpassing the campaign=92s average monthly total of $17 million.

Since the Sanders campaign was launched one year ago, his supporters have r=
evolutionized campaign fundraising and demonstrated that he can wage a comp=
etitive campaign for president without relying on Wall Street and other spe=
cial interests. More than 7.4 million contributions have poured in from mor=
e than 2.4 million donors totaling $210 million.

A key to Sanders=92 fundraising success has been that his grassroots suppor=
ters consistently have contributed more to his campaign than Hillary Clinto=
n=92s big-dollar donors. Sanders=92 April donations far exceeded Hillary fo=
r America's $21 million in March.

=93What our campaign is doing is bringing millions of Americans into the po=
litical process,=94 said Jeff Weaver, Sanders=92 campaign manager. =93Sande=
rs is the candidate with the most energy and excitement. He is the candidat=
e with the best chance of winning in November. He is the candidate who is i=
n the best position to bring a new generation of voters into the democratic=
 process and restore the faith of working-class voters that we can have a g=
overnment that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.=94

In April, the average contribution was slightly less than $26. Only 3 perce=
nt of the total came from donors who have given the maximum $2,700 an indiv=
idual may donate to a candidate. More than 51 percent Hillary Clinton=92s d=
onors have maxed out.

A typical Sanders donor is 27 years old. Forty-one percent of people giving=
 to his campaign are between the ages of 18 and 39, an unprecedented level =
of support from younger Americans. =91Teacher=92 is the most common profess=
ion followed by =91student=92 and =91engineer.=92

Sanders continued fundraising success comes as the presidential nomination =
contest with Clinton enters the final phase with 14 states, territories and=
 the District of Columbia still to hold primaries or a caucuses. Sanders an=
d Clinton are neck and neck in national polls with Sanders edging ahead in =
some surveys. He consistently is a much stronger general election candidate=
 polling much better than Clinton in head-to-head matchups with Donald Trum=
p or other Republican White House hopefuls.
