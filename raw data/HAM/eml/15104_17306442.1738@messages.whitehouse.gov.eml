THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release May 19, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20





12:23 P.M. EDT



 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I do not have any announcements =
at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.



 Darlene, would you like to start?



 Q Thank you. Starting with the news that everyone woke up to today. What=
 conclusions has the United States government reached about what may have=
 brought down the Egyptian airline?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, let me start, Darlene, by offering our thoughts and p=
rayers to the families of those who were aboard EgyptAir Flight 804. The =
uncertainty and creeping sense of loss that the loved ones of those who w=
ere lost on the plane must be experiencing right now is painful to even c=
ontemplate.



 The President, as you all are aware, has received multiple updates from =
his national security team on the situation. U.S. national security and a=
viation experts have been in touch with their counterparts in France and =
Egypt to offer assistance. Many of you all have probably also seen the an=
nouncement from the Department of Defense that the United States Navy is =
working to deploy a P-3 Orion aircraft to provide support for the search =
of the missing jetliner.



 At this point, Darlene, to go straight to your question, it's too early =
to definitively say what may have caused this disaster. The investigation=
 is underway and investigators will consider all of the potential factors=
 that could have contributed to the crash. And obviously if theres an opp=
ortunity for the United States government to support those efforts then w=
e will do that. And the President asked his team to keep him apprised of =
developments as they occur.



 Q Switching topics to Puerto Rico and the legislation on the Hill, the a=
greement on a new bill. Is there any reaction from the White House on tha=
t?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the administration has made clear for several months =
now that any legislation to address the crisis in Puerto Rico must provid=
e a workable and comprehensive restructuring authority with appropriate o=
versight that respects Puerto Ricos self-governance. We're encouraged to =
see the House introduce legislation yesterday that provides Puerto Rico w=
ith these tools to address a crisis that's having a negative impact on th=
e 3.5 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico. There are tangible, real=
-world, negative consequences for Americans living in Puerto Rico.=20



And we continue to believe that additional measures are necessary to help=
 Puerto Rico grow its economy and address this humanitarian crisis. But t=
he legislation that was unveiled late last night is an important first st=
ep. We believe that overall the legislation provides a fair process for P=
uerto Rico to restructure its debts, enact fiscal reforms, and create a f=
oundation for economic recovery after enduring a decade of recession.=20



Q Theres one other thing I'd like to ask you about. The chief of staff to=
 the Hungarian Prime Minister today said that President Obama and the Uni=
ted States favor immigration to Europe because they want to send all the =
Muslims to Europe. Is there anything you want to say in response to that?=




MR. EARNEST: I didnt see those comments. I'm not sure theyre worthy of a =
response.=20



Jeff.



Q Josh, is the United States concerned about security at Charles de Gaull=
e Airport in Paris, and are you concerned about reports that Islamic Stat=
e militants have infiltrated that airport and others?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, the United States does have a relationship throu=
gh TSA and DHS with those airports around the world that are the last poi=
nt of departure to the United States. So the United States has successful=
ly worked with security officials at airports across the country to ensur=
e that international flights arriving in the United States are subject to=
 more exhaustive security and screening procedures to ensure the safety o=
f the American traveling public.



Again, at this point, it's too early to say what potential factors may ha=
ve contributed to this particular incident. But it is fair for you to obs=
erve and for the American people to understand that over the last 18 to 2=
4 months, the Department of Homeland Security has made some important enh=
ancements to those international airports that are the last points of dep=
arture for international flights. And that includes expanded screening th=
at's applied to a variety of items that could be transported on an aircra=
ft, so not just carry-on baggage but other baggage and other equipment th=
at is maintained on the aircraft.



TSA officials have also engaged in conducting airport assessments in conj=
unction with our international partners to ensure the security of the ter=
minal and the airport more broadly. And the DHS has worked with partners =
to offer assistance to certain foreign airports related to broader aviati=
on and airport security questions. Theres extensive expertise that exists=
 at TSA, and working with the operators at foreign airports, we've been a=
ble to use that expertise to discuss best practices that could be used to=
 enhance security at foreign airports.



Q Do you have any specific concerns, though, about the Paris airport?



MR. EARNEST: Nothing that I have to articulate from here. Obviously there=
 are U.S. flights that originate from that airport and the United States =
has a very important national security relationship with France and that =
would extend to our coordination on issues related to aviation security. =
But I don't have anything specific to raise in terms of concerns about th=
e security situation in Charles de Gaulle.



Q More broadly, does the United States have concerns about militants from=
 the Islamic State infiltrating airports, be it in Europe or be it elsewh=
ere in the world?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I would say something that probably is even slightly b=
roader than the way that you asked your question. We have seen a desire o=
n the part of extremists around the world, including some extremists in t=
he Middle East, to carry out attacks targeting the international aviation=
 system, so we obviously are mindful of that. And here in the United Stat=
es weve experienced the pain of those aviation-borne attacks firsthand on=
 9/11. So our experts at the TSA take very seriously the need to apply ad=
aptive security measures to ensure the safety of our aviation system. The=
y pursue a layered approach that involves a variety of technologies and t=
actics, and these are tactics that they can be shared with our partners a=
round the world and applied in airports around the world.



So weve obviously learned a lot since 9/11 about whats necessary to prote=
ct the aviation system. But that has not diminished the desire of some ex=
tremist organizations to try to carry out attacks against the aviation sy=
stem. Were aware of that, and we are constantly countering that threat by=
 adapting our security system to protect the traveling public.



Q Finally, you said its too early to comment on what the causes were. Are=
 you able, or has the U.S. intelligence community been able to rule out a=
nything, such as a bomb? Or has anything so far, from the United States p=
erspective, been ruled out?



MR. EARNEST: Im not aware of any sort of intelligence assessment that has=
 ruled anything out. Im also not aware of any intelligence assessment tha=
ts ruled anything in at this point. So were still quite early in this inv=
estigation, and investigators will examine all of the potential factors t=
hat may have contributed to this tragedy.



Toluse.



Q I wanted to ask about Puerto Rico. You mentioned that you think there a=
re still more steps that need to be taken in addition to this bill, but a=
s the bill stands now, would you sign it? Is this something that the Whit=
e House supports?



MR. EARNEST: Well, we are encouraged that Democrats and Republicans did w=
ork effectively together to produce this piece of legislation. Bipartisan=
ship has been hard to come by in the United States Congress for a few yea=
rs now, so thats why you heard me describe the fact that were encouraged =
by the introduction of this legislation yesterday. So, yes, I think you c=
ould say that we are supportive of this legislative proposal to establish=
 a fair process that allows Puerto Rico to restructure its debts, enact f=
iscal reforms, and create a foundation for economic recovery.



Whats true, though, is that the introduction of legislation is just the b=
eginning of the process. And this crisis in Puerto Rico can only end when=
 Congress takes bipartisan action. And we urge members of Congress in bot=
h parties to stand firm against the special interests attempting to under=
mine this essential legislation. We urge Congress to act without delay to=
 provide Puerto Rico with the tools that it desperately needs to address =
a situation thats having a negative impact on 3.5 million Americans livin=
g in Puerto Rico.



Q One of the fiscal reforms in the bill includes allowing the governor of=
 Puerto Rico to reduce the minimum wage over five years, below the nation=
al average. Obviously, thats something=20

-- the minimum wage is something the administration has pushed for increa=
sing -- there are state increases as high as $15. So whats your response =
to the idea that Puerto Rico could be reducing its minimum wage less than=
 $7.25?



MR. EARNEST: Well, my understanding is -- Ive been briefed on this provis=
ion -- is that it applies to a particular quirk in the law that actually =
affects people who are younger than age 20 who are working for the minimu=
m wage and that it would allow their employer to pay them even below the =
minimum wage.



I think it would be pretty hard for anybody to explain how exactly a 19-y=
ear-old Puerto Rican whos making minimum wage is somehow responsible for =
the situation or should be punished as a result of this situation, or tha=
t the situation would be improved if 19-year-old Puerto Ricans who are wo=
rking minimum wage got paid less.=20



So, no, this is not a provision that we support. Supporters of this provi=
sion I think have a hard time justifying it, but in order to see bipartis=
an action in Congress, we are prepared to encourage Congress to pass a pi=
ece of legislation even if its less than perfect.



Q And it seemed like one of the recent changes was actually increasing th=
e age from 20 to 25. That was one of the things that got changed.=20



MR. EARNEST: Exactly. And so, yes, are 23-year-old Puerto Ricans who are =
making minimum wage deserving of a pay cut, and somehow thats going to im=
prove the economic climate in Puerto Rico? Again, weve seen mean-spirited=
 policymaking on the part of Republicans for quite some time now. I think=
 well just file this example in a rather large file. But the President ha=
s made assisting Puerto Rico and addressing their challenging economic si=
tuation a top priority, and sometimes getting bipartisan progress in Cong=
ress requires supporting legislation thats not perfect.=20



Olivier.



Q Josh, back on the plane. Can you say whether and with what frequency th=
e expanded screenings have resulted in thwarted plots against Americans?



MR. EARNEST: I dont have an assessment of that. These expanded screenings=
, just to be clear, are applied to international aircraft that are bound =
for the United States. Obviously, EgyptAir Flight 804 took off from Paris=
 and was bound from Cairo, so it wasnt subjected necessarily to these spe=
cific enhanced screening.=20



Q I understand.



MR. EARNEST: I dont have an assessment for how those enhanced security me=
asures have disrupted plots, but we do believe that expertise from the TS=
A and additional screening measures even at foreign airports does enhance=
 the safety and security of Americans traveling abroad.



 Q Two more. Ill try to keep them short. You said that investigators woul=
d look at all factors. Did you mean U.S. investigators? And if so, why ar=
e they involved at this point?



 MR. EARNEST: No, I didnt say U.S. investigators.



 Q But Im just wondering --=20



 MR. EARNEST: What I have indicated -- and I think that this was part of =
the Presidents instruction -- is that U.S. officials, both national secur=
ity officials and aviation experts, would be in touch with their counterp=
arts and offering assistance. Im not aware that that assistance has been =
accepted at this point, but certainly U.S. officials, including officials=
 who could assist in the investigation of an aviation disaster, could be =
made available if requested.



 Q Last one. When you were asked whether you had specific concerns about =
Charles De Gaulle Airport, you said nothing you can articulate from there=
. That doesnt sound terrifically reassuring.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess, what Im saying is I cant offer a security as=
sessment of any airport around the world, so I certainly would encourage =
you guys to check with TSA on that. But theres no specific concern thats =
been raised that Im aware of.



 Michelle.



 Q Thanks, Josh. You said that its too early, of course, to really know w=
hat happened. But even at this point, and even hours ago, Egyptian offici=
als were saying that terrorism in this case is more likely than a technic=
al fault on this plane. Does the administration share that view? Or does =
the U.S. have information that backs that likelihood up, at the very leas=
t?



 MR. EARNEST: At this point, the information that is available is somethi=
ng that investigators are still taking a close look at and so I wouldnt h=
azard a guess at this point about what factors may have potentially contr=
ibuted to this disaster. But obviously were going to take a close look at=
 all the available evidence and were going to be in close touch with our =
counterparts, and if there is assistance that U.S. experts or U.S. nation=
al security officials can provide in the investigation, then well certain=
ly do that.



 Q So when Egyptian officials are saying its likely terrorism, and other =
officials are speculating that, based on what we know happened, it looks =
like a bomb, is that something that is taken into account? I mean, do you=
 feel that its premature to make those assessments right now? Or is the U=
.S. looking at those assessments from other countries?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, right now, what the United States is doing is offerin=
g our assistance to those investigators who are taking a look at this inf=
ormation and trying to draw conclusions as best they can. So thats why I =
dont have a separate assessment to share from here. But we obviously want=
 to be supportive of those who are conducting this investigation, and the=
 deployment of a U.S. Navy aircraft to assist in the search is one tangib=
le example of how U.S. assets can be used to benefit the ongoing effort.



 Q But by saying its too early to really know, youre not, by saying that,=
 dismissing those early assessments?



 MR. EARNEST: No, Im merely explaining why I dont have my own assessment =
to offer.



 Q Okay. And because it is a question mark and because those assessments =
at this point are coming from elsewhere and this originated at an airport=
 where flights to the U.S. originate, on its face, does this, at this poi=
nt, raise the risk for U.S. passengers?



 MR. EARNEST: At this point, I think its too early to reach that conclusi=
on. Obviously national security officials at the Department of Homeland S=
ecurity and the TSA can offer up the best assessment about that. As I was=
 explaining to Olivier, flights that originate from Charles De Gaulle tha=
t are bound for the United States are subjected to additional screening t=
hat may not have applied in this situation. So American passengers can ce=
rtainly take some confidence from that.=20



But, look, were only hours, not even days, into trying to get to the bott=
om of what exactly happened here. So we obviously are going to be very su=
pportive of those who are conducting the investigation, and we are eager =
to understand exactly what may have contributed to this particular traged=
y. And if it merits any sort of change in our security posture, then Im c=
onfident thats something that will be carefully evaluated by DHS Secretar=
y Johnson and TSA Administrator Neffenger to make the appropriate changes=
 if necessary.



 Q And because we dont know what happened here and terrorism is a possibi=
lity, can you just sort of broadly describe the kinds of additional measu=
res that are going on in foreign airports by the TSA right now? I mean, c=
an you say that this is something of an internal alert? Or because there =
are expanded measures already, are they now tighter immediately? I mean, =
what can you say about what happens after something like this has transpi=
red?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, what happens immediately when something like this tra=
nspires is that there is work -- well, that there are offers of assistanc=
e that are made to the investigators overseas that are conducting the inv=
estigation. And the United States has expertise and assets that other inv=
estigators may find useful. They certainly have been useful in other inte=
rnational investigations that have been conducted.



 But there are a number of things that the TSA is engaged in, regardless =
of whether or not there is an unexplained crash like this one. So let me =
give you a couple more examples. In the fiscal year 2015, the TSAs transp=
ortation security specialists performed 289 air carrier inspections and 1=
46 foreign airport assessments. So, again, this is an example of how expe=
rtise at the TSA can be deployed overseas to enhance not just the U.S. av=
iation system but the international aviation system.



 The other thing that the TSA often does is they will deploy canine teams=
 in airports, including teams that are sometimes led by state and local l=
aw enforcement as well as by TSA officers themselves. These teams operate=
 in secure areas of the airport, including activities such as screening c=
argo and baggage as its being loaded into the aircraft.



 The other thing that DHS has been able to do is to establish something c=
alled preclearance. And there are a handful of airports around the world =
where international flights will originate and fly into the United States=
. And preclearance means that Customs and Border Patrol officers dont scr=
een the passengers after they get off the plane but actually will engage =
in screening those passengers overseas on foreign soil before they even b=
oard a plane that is bound for the United States.



 And that means that the security of those flights is enhanced even furth=
er than they already would be. And there are 15 preclearance locations ar=
ound the world right now, and DHS and CVP are working together to try to =
expand that program and, again, provide greater confidence that air passe=
ngers who are boarding flights bound for the United States have actually =
been thoroughly reviewed by U.S. national security professionals before t=
hey even board the plane.



 Q Does TSA have any involvement in the maintenance of planes and how tho=
se procedures are done before that plane takes off?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that TSA has a maintenance function, but TSA =
can certainly provide assistance and advice to foreign airport officials =
as they try to secure sensitive parts of the airport. So that could inclu=
de terminals, but that could also include sensitive maintenance areas. So=
 while they're not, firsthand, involved in conducting that maintenance, t=
hey can certainly offer advice and assistance in terms of helping airport=
 officials secure those sensitive parts of the airport.



 Juliet.



 Q Continuing on the theme of bipartisan agreement on legislation, today =
a group of Republican and Senate Democrats have unveiled a bill to overha=
ul the decades-old Toxic Substances Control Act -- a chemical bill that i=
s something the White House and EPA have been consulting on. Can you say =
at this point if the White House endorses this proposal, which has receiv=
ed considerable support from both parties in the Senate and, to a lesser =
degree, in the House?



 MR. EARNEST: I have to check with our team to see to what extent we've b=
een briefed on the details of the proposals that's apparently been agreed=
 to. So let me circle back with you on the details of that.



 Ron.



 Q I'm just trying to understand the investigative cooperation relationsh=
ip between the U.S. and, say, the Egyptian and French and other authoriti=
es. Because you said that there have been offers of assistance and that s=
o far they have not been accepted. Yet, at the same time, there's every -=
- well, there are some indications that this could be a terrorist attack,=
 and this is obviously a big concern for the United States. So what you'v=
e described sounds more passive than active and aggressive and engaged. D=
o you see what I'm saying? And I'm just trying to understand why that is.=
 Why is the United States not just -- why isnt there some sort of mechani=
sm whereby because of -- again, there's been so much emphasis on intellig=
ence-sharing and the fight against ISIS. Why isnt there some sort of mech=
anism or some sort of process whereby, given the work that TSA has done i=
n these airports, that there's a much more aggressive and engaged posture=
 by the United States when something like this happens?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I think the first thing that we should step back=
 and recognize is that this is an aircraft that did not originate on Amer=
ican soil. It was not bound for American soil; it was not an American air=
line. I'm not aware that the pilots were American. Obviously, the plane d=
idnt crash in America. So there are other countries that have appropriate=
 jurisdictions.=20



And the United States has important relationships with both France and wi=
th Egypt. We've got an important relationship with Greek authorities, who=
 had launched the preliminary search effort because this obviously took p=
lace near Greek waters. So there are reasons why there are other countrie=
s who were immediately responsible for dealing with this situation, but t=
hat has not at all resulted in a delay of the United States offering assi=
stance, communicating with our partners in both of the countries, and bei=
ng engaged in trying to get to the bottom of what exactly transpired.



 I did not mean to lead you to conclude that somehow our offers of assist=
ance had been rebuffed, just that other countries have the lead. We have =
offered to help and we stand ready to provide that assistance as soon as =
they're ready to integrate it into their efforts.



 Q So what if it's not accepted? Is this diplomatic language that you can=
't say --



 MR. EARNEST: Given the strong relationships between the United States an=
d France, and the United States and Egypt, I'm confident that we'll be ab=
le to provide them the needed support to ensure that this investigation p=
roceeds expeditiously and is conducted with a focus on getting to the bot=
tom of what exactly transpired so that we can make any necessary changes =
-- whether that's changes to an aircraft, enhancements to maintenance, or=
 taking additional security precautions to ensure the safety and security=
 of the traveling public.



 Q Right. Because, again, even though this does not involve an American p=
lane or passengers or a pilot or airports, the international air system i=
s essentially -- it's an international system. It's really not -- I mean,=
 obviously it's not a state-separated system. And that's why -- again, so=
 you have every expectation that the -- so at this moment, the FBI, the T=
SA, others are not actively involved in this investigation? They are esse=
ntially -- have extended an offer, and now some 12 or more hours after th=
is happened, we're still waiting to hear whether or not they will be enga=
ged and involved?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I would encourage you to consult with those in=
dividual agencies, and they can detail for you the kinds of conversations=
 that they've had with our partners. But I have confidence that France an=
d Egypt will seek whatever assistance is required, and the United States =
stands ready to provide as much assistance as is necessary to achieve our=
 shared goal, which is to get to the bottom of what happened as quickly a=
s possible.



 April.



 Q Josh, I want to ask you questions on two different subjects. One, star=
ting off with the airports and this crash, or this possible or alleged te=
rrorist attack. What is the, I guess, conversations, and is there some li=
ne of conversation between the FAA here, intelligence officials, and thei=
r counterparts in other nations when it comes to airports and airlines? B=
ecause that is still considered the number-one target for terrorists, in =
airports. What kind of conversations are happening? And particularly when=
 it comes to the uniformity in stepping up security in all of these airpo=
rts around the country -- because every airport is different. Security in=
 every airport is different.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, April, the priority that we have placed is on those a=
irports overseas that are the last point of departure. So international a=
ircraft that originate in other countries flying into the United States, =
those are, for obvious reasons, the point of emphasis that our security p=
rofessionals have identified. And as a result, there are enhanced screeni=
ng measures in place at airports around the world -- not on American soil=
 -- but that are consistent with established standards put together by TS=
A to ensure the safety of flights bound for the United States that origin=
ate in other countries.



 In addition to that, TSA obviously has experts and equipment and strateg=
ies for safeguarding aircraft, for safeguarding passengers, for safeguard=
ing airports. And that assistance advice about that expertise is provided=
 to our partners around the world. As I pointed out, in the last fiscal y=
ear, TSA security specialists performed 289 air carrier inspections and 1=
46 foreign airport assessments. So I think that's an indication that the =
scope of their work is quite broad.



 But in addition to that, the Department of Homeland Security has sought =
to expand their preclearance program that provides significantly enhanced=
 screening of passengers who are originating -- who are trying to travel =
to the United States from overseas. And examining the passports and docum=
entation of those passengers before they ever board the plane, ensuring t=
hat those aircraft and those passengers can be swept prior to boarding th=
e plane consistent with U.S. standards is certainly another way that we c=
an enhance the safety of the American traveling public.



 So DHS and TSA and CVP and all of these national security agencies that =
have different responsibilities for protecting the American people are no=
t just actively engaged in the United States in protecting the traveling =
public, but theyre actively engaged overseas to ensure that international=
 flights arriving in the United States are secure as well.



 Q What I'm getting from what you're saying is theres not uniformity but =
theres efforts to increase and enhance it. So with that, whats the realit=
y in the timeline that there could be uniformity in these airports where =
everyone is on the same page with documentation, screenings, et cetera?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, April, I don't envision a scenario in which every sin=
gle airport in the world has the same security screening measures.



 Q I'm asking about the airports that -- as you say, there are efforts th=
at you're making when it comes to security more so with the airports that=
 have flights coming into the United States. When will there be -- whats =
the timeline for that uniformity as far as screenings and documentations,=
 things of that nature?



 MR. EARNEST: Flights that are the last point of departure are subject to=
 enhanced screening measures that are applied by TSA. So does that answer=
 your question?



 Q No.=20



 MR. EARNEST: I think what I would do is this. I think you should check w=
ith TSA and they can provide you a more detailed assessment of what secur=
ity measures they have in place at airports around the world.



 Q Make sure TSA and I can talk? Okay.



 MR. EARNEST: Anybody else?



 Q I'm not finished with my other question -- I'm sorry. It was the Niger=
ian girls since we had the latest news yesterday. Could you talk to us ab=
out any intelligence youve received? Whats the latest as relates to the N=
igerian girls?



 MR. EARNEST: AS you know, April, extensive resources have been provided =
by the United States to the Nigerian officials who are responsible for se=
arching not just for the Chibok girls but for the thousands of Nigerians =
who have been kidnapped by Boko Haram. Boko Haram is a vicious terrorist =
organization that has capitalized on kidnapping to try to raise money for=
 their terrorist organization and to otherwise terrorize the people in th=
at country and the people in that region. And the United States has provi=
ded intelligence, military and financial support to the Nigerian governme=
nt as they confront this threat. And we continue to provide that even to =
this day.



 Q And was that a glimmer of hope yesterday that even though she was foun=
d pregnant and they were questioning if that could have been one of the c=
aptors -- it was supposed to be her husband -- is there still a glimmer o=
f hope that more will be found?



 MR. EARNEST: Certainly the United States continues to vigorously support=
 the efforts of the Nigerian government. Ultimately, it's the Nigerian go=
vernment who is responsible for conducting the search, and their search e=
fforts have been enhanced greatly by the assistance provided by the Unite=
d States.

=20

 Andrew.



 Q Thanks, Josh. Two Chinese tactical jets have intercepted an American r=
econnaissance plane in the South China Sea. And I was wondering, how seri=
ously are you taking this incident? Do you see it as a provocation?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Andrew, the Department of Defense is reviewing public=
 claims of a May 17 intercept of a U.S. maritime patrol reconnaissance ai=
rcraft by two tactical aircraft from the Peoples Republic of China. The i=
ncident occurred in international airspace during a routine U.S. patrol i=
n the South China Sea. Initial reports of the incident characterized it a=
s unsafe.=20



I can tell you more generally that the Department of Defense has made pro=
gress reducing the risk between U.S. operational forces and those of the =
Peoples Republic of China. We've reduced that risk by improving dialogue =
at multiple levels under the bilateral confidence-building measures and t=
he Military Maritime Consultative Agreement. These are established diplom=
atic and military channels that allow the United States and China to comm=
unicate clearly and raise concerns about these kinds of issues when they =
arise.



I'm told that the next Military Maritime Consultative Agreement talks are=
 actually scheduled for May 24 and 25 in Hawaii. So there is a well-estab=
lished diplomatic and military channel to work through these kinds of con=
cerns. Over the course of the last year, the Department of Defense has se=
en improvements in the way that Chinese military pilots fly consistent wi=
th international guidelines and consistent with the way that aircraft can=
 be operated in a safe and professional manner. But suffice it to say tha=
t the Department of Defense is addressing this issue through the appropri=
ate channels.



Q Is the President typically told about these incidents, or this one in p=
articular?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President is certainly apprised of these d=
evelopments as warranted. I don't know whether or not he received a speci=
fic briefing on this particular situation. Again, based on the kinds of i=
mprovements that we've seen over the last year, I think these kinds of in=
cidents are not common. But there also was a pretty significant incident =
in the first few months of the Bush administration with Chinese military =
aircraft intercepting U.S. intelligence aircraft that resulted in a much =
more significant geopolitical incident. The reports of this incident obvi=
ously didnt result in the same kind of consequences.



Q This is obviously not an accident. Do you think that its going to coinc=
ide with the Presidents trip to Vietnam?



MR. EARNEST: Well, well try to address this issue through the established=
 channels. And presumably, in those channels, Chinese officials can expla=
in their perspective on what exactly occurred. But I would hesitate to as=
cribe a motive at this point.=20



Margaret.



Q Josh, youve been pretty restrained in how youve described what has happ=
ened with the EgyptAir flight. Donald Trump was out with a tweet this mor=
ning -- he says, Looks like another terrorist attack. Airplane departed f=
rom Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant? That would imply t=
hat this administration has not done those things in terms of being tough=
, smart and vigilant. What do you make of those comments? Inappropriate a=
t this time?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I dont have a specific reaction to that tweet. Obvious=
ly we believe that this investigation should move forward, and move forwa=
rd expeditiously. And if conclusions point toward specific security conce=
rns, then Im confident that our security professionals will address it.



But since you, or someone else, brought it up, my colleagues at the Depar=
tment of Defense did provide I think a pretty useful update on some of th=
e progress thats been made against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria in recent we=
eks. So let me just point out a couple of the highlights.



The first is that we obviously are pleased with the progress that Iraqi s=
ecurity forces have made in the western Anbar town of Rutbah. This operat=
ion, once its complete, will help the Iraqis reclaim Iraqs southwestern b=
order and reestablish economic trade along highways between Jordan and Ir=
aq. We obviously have been supportive of Iraqi forces that are operating =
in that area, and were pleased to see them make important progress.=20



I also have an updated assessment for you in terms of the success that Ir=
aqi forces have had in driving ISIL out of populated territory in Iraq. T=
he updated assessment is that now 45 percent of the populated area that I=
SIL previously controlled has been retaken from them. In Syria, that figu=
re is now 20 percent, thanks to the work of local partners, including the=
 Syrian-Arab coalition. Thats an increase in both countries.=20



In addition, there are some additional metrics I can share with you here.=
 DOD has indicated they have targeted and killed more than 120 high-value=
 individuals in ISILs attack network, including leaders, facilitators, pl=
anners and recruiters. And my colleagues at the Department of Defense hav=
e indicated that thats had a measurable impact on ISILs effectiveness.



The coalition more broadly has trained more than 30,000 Iraqi security fo=
rces. They reported that, right now, nearly 5,000 Iraqi security forces a=
re in training. Thats about 3,800 Iraqi army soldiers and about 1,100 Pes=
hmerga fighters in Erbil. Together, that is the highest number the coalit=
ion has been training at any one point in time.=20



And then finally, I want to draw to your attention an announcement that w=
as made today by the International Monetary Fund. They announced that the=
y had come to an agreement with the government of Iraq on a $5 billion lo=
an agreement over the next three years. Over the last several weeks, youv=
e heard the President talking with a greater sense of urgency about the e=
conomic situation in Iraq, and obviously the security challenges in Iraq =
combined with some of the challenges that theyve encountered in implement=
ing political reforms, as well as the impact of a much lower global price=
 of oil -- all have combined to have a negative impact on the economic si=
tuation in Iraq.=20



And the President made a concerted effort to encourage our partners and a=
llies who are part of the coalition to ramp up the financial assistance t=
hat theyre providing to Iraq, both to offer support to the Abadi governme=
nt, but also to offer support to the Iraqi government as they try to rebu=
ild those areas that have been retaken from ISIL. We know that some of IS=
ILs tactics have been to essentially destroy the infrastructure of places=
 that they had occupied.



So being able to quickly rebuild that infrastructure and allow people to =
move home is a top priority of the Abadi government and will be critical =
to the success of stabilizing and securing the country. And the internati=
onal contribution to this effort is critical. And obviously, a $5.4 billi=
on commitment from the IMF is significant.=20



So thank you for indulging me on that.



Q Well, ISIS hasnt claimed responsibility. Is there a reason you brought =
them up?



MR. EARNEST: No, but I think that was implied in the tweet. And you had a=
sked whether or not we had been vigorous in pursuing extremist organizati=
ons that have vowed to attack the United States, or at least our interest=
s. And so it seemed appropriate to offer an update to our efforts against=
 ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.



Q Lisa Monaco delivered the briefing this morning, I believe, to the Pres=
ident, according to your readout. Is that the U.S. official who has conti=
nued to update the President? Or are there others from different departme=
nts?



MR. EARNEST: She will continue to be principally responsible for that, bu=
t obviously there are other officials, including in the intelligence comm=
unity and other places, that may also have information to share with the =
President. But she obviously is the person responsible for that, principa=
lly.



 Q Given her role in counterterrorism, it would imply that that is obviou=
sly a key concern when it comes to this EgyptAir crash, or disappearance,=
 I suppose. Is that a fair thing to surmise?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, she is both the Presidents top counterterrorism advis=
or but also his top homeland security advisor, so its also customary for =
her to apprise him of events that could have a potential impact on the ho=
meland, even if theyre not related to terrorism.



 Q But is this being treated, I guess, like any other plane downing or di=
sappearance? Weve had a few in the past few years. I mean, is there somet=
hing specific about this focus and how quickly the administration has res=
ponded -- about it?



 MR. EARNEST: I think the response that we have initiated here at the Whi=
te House is consistent with any significant or potentially significant wo=
rld event that could have an impact on U.S. policy. And certainly Ms. Mon=
aco and her colleagues at the NSC have been conscientious about making su=
re the President has all of the information that he needs.



 Q So in public discourse about this, do you think that terrorism is bein=
g too focused on? Or are we -- youre getting a lot of questions in this r=
oom specifically about that as a hypothesis that hasnt been ruled out. Bu=
t is that the prime focus right now, ruling that out?



 MR. EARNEST: Im not aware that our intelligence community has concluded =
that thats the prime focus at this point. But look, I think Im not going =
to second-guess the questions that independent journalists choose to ask.=


=20

 Karen.



 Q Josh, Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said today on TV that p=
olitics is the reason that the United States is not defining the mission =
in Iraq as a combat mission. He says he believes it is. He says its a dis=
service to those out there putting their lives on the line, and incredibl=
y unfortunate not to speak openly about whats going on. Is Secretary Gate=
s wrong?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Karen, weve had an opportunity to discuss this on a n=
umber of occasions from here. But I know that people like General Dunford=
 and Secretary Carter have also had an opportunity to discuss this. The f=
act of the matter is we have worked very diligently to try to be as clear=
 as possible about what mission our men and women in uniform have been gi=
ven by the Commander-in-Chief in Iraq and in Syria. And the mission that =
they have been given and the responsibility that they are bearing is sign=
ificant and dangerous. And Im not aware of anybody in the administration =
who has sought to downplay that.



 What we have tried to do is to be as precise as possible in describing w=
hat exactly their mission is. And while their presence in Iraq and in Syr=
ia is dangerous and, on occasion, our men and women in uniform have found=
 themselves in combat situations that are dangerous, they have not been d=
eployed to Iraq to wage combat on the ground against ISIL. Their responsi=
bility, their mission has been to offer training, advice, and assistance =
to Iraqi security forces.



 Now, of course, there are some U.S. Special Operators that have been dep=
loyed to carry out raids against ISIL targets. Obviously thats a combat s=
ituation. But that is very different than the decision that was made by P=
resident Bush to deploy more than 100,000 U.S. forces on the ground in a =
sustained combat role where their principal responsibility was to seek ou=
t and engage the adversary in combat. The mission that has been given to =
U.S. forces is different. And we have gone to great lengths to try to hel=
p you and the American public understand with precision exactly what resp=
onsibilities the Commander-in-Chief has given them.



 The reason that that precision is important is its important for people =
to understand the different in approach, but its also important for peopl=
e to understand how much gratitude we should have for our men and women i=
n uniform who are assuming a great burden, at great peril to themselves, =
to keep our country safe. Certainly the Commander-in-Chief has that grati=
tude, and hopefully every American does.



 Q Its a pretty tough charge, though, using the word politics in this. Ca=
n you specifically respond to that?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont think Im going to respond to Secretary Gates today.



 Mark.



 Q Josh, back on the Chinese aircraft incident. You said you would not as=
cribe a motive to that incident. But is there any doubt in the administra=
tions mind that the incident was deliberate?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think this is exactly why weve got this esta=
blished channel where U.S. military and diplomatic officials can consult =
with their counterparts in China and engage in a dialogue with them about=
 this particular incident and give those Chinese officials an opportunity=
 to explain from their perspective exactly what happened and try to preve=
nt those kinds of dangerous incidents from occurring in the future. So th=
ats why Im hesitating to ascribe a motive. Ill let Chinese officials expl=
ain their actions, and Im confident that theyll do that both publicly and=
 privately.



 Q Could you say whether this is the kind of incident President Obama wou=
ld raise in his next conversation with President Xi?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont know that it necessarily would rise to that level. T=
here have been a couple of high-profile incidents with --=20



 Q The Russians.=20



 MR. EARNEST -- the Russians. And the President, in the immediate afterma=
th of one of those incidents, had a long phone call with President Putin =
and it didnt come up. I dont know if this kind of incident would rise to =
that level. It certainly wouldnt rise to the level of prompting proactive=
ly a call from the President to his Chinese counterpart, but its hard for=
 me to say whether or not it would come up in a call that was scheduled t=
o discuss something else.=20



 Q Last one. Can you say whether or not Chinese leaders have raised the i=
ssue of U.S. reconnaissance planes near their airspace operating in that =
area?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the concern that they have raised is about the kind o=
f territorial disputes that have arisen in the South China Sea. And China=
 makes some significant claims in that region of the world that are in di=
spute. And the United States has asserted that those disputes should be r=
esolved through diplomacy. We've made clear both publicly and privately t=
hat the United States is not a claimant to any of those land features in =
the South China Sea, but we have encouraged those with competing claims, =
including China, to find a diplomatic resolution to those competing claim=
s.



 Taka.



 Q Thank you, Josh. Former U.S. Marine working for the U.S. military base=
 Kadena in Okinawa was arrested by Okinawa police after a Japanese woman'=
s body was found. Are you concerned this incident will make worse relatio=
ns between people in Okinawa and U.S. military base?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Taka, we've seen the reports and we're aware of the a=
rrest of a U.S. citizen civilian in Okinawa, and we're following the case=
 closely. You probably have seen the statement from Ambassador Kennedy on=
 this issue. Our heartfelt sympathy and deepest condolences go out to the=
 family and friends of the victim. This is a terrible tragedy and an outr=
age, and we wish to express our deepest sorrow.



 The United States is treating this situation with the utmost seriousness=
, and the United States military is cooperating fully with local authorit=
ies in their investigation. For additional details about that, I'd refer =
you to the Department of Defense. They presumably could answer any questi=
ons you would have about any impact this could potentially have on the mi=
litary presence in Okinawa, but I would not anticipate any sort of policy=
 change.



 Q The President is going to Japan next week, so will he talk about these=
 kinds of issues?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm sorry? He'll go to Japan next week. And what was the la=
st part of your questions?



 Q Will he talk about these issues when he goes to Japan? Will he talk ab=
out this military base issue?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont know if the conversation about this particular incid=
ent will occur. I would anticipate the President will have an opportunity=
 to have a discussion with Prime Minister Abe, but I dont know whether or=
 not this will be on the agenda.



 Dave.



 Q Thanks, Josh. On TPP, the ITC report came out late yesterday and it sh=
owed in their assessment that the TPP would boost American agriculture, b=
oost the service sector, but actually have a slightly downward impact on =
U.S. manufacturing. Obviously, manufacturing has been a big selling point=
 for the President in this, and this is showing that it would actually re=
duce manufacturing slightly. Is that a disappointment to you? Or do you a=
gree with that assessment?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, let me say a couple of things. I mean, the overall nu=
mbers are, as you point out, quite good. The U.S. annual real income woul=
d be boosted by $57 billion if TPP were to go into effect based on this i=
ndependent analysis. And about two-thirds -- GDP would increase $42 billi=
on. And about two-thirds of the GDP growth resulting from the TPP would g=
o to American workers through wage increases and increased job opportunit=
ies. And that's how -- I think this provides additional evidence of how t=
he TPP is consistent with the President's strategy of focusing on growing=
 the U.S. economy from the middle out.=20



 I would say that these numbers would be even higher if they factored in =
the important success that we have enjoyed in negotiating a reduction in =
non-tariff barriers in the TPP agreement. This independent analysis did n=
ot fully account for the impact of the reduction in non-tariff barriers.=20=




 As it relates to the manufacturing sectors, the report shows very clearl=
y that, under TPP, manufacturing employment and output do not decline fro=
m where they are now, but they would grow. And the ITC says very clearly =
that output in employment in each of the 56 sectors that they model will =
rise with TPP in effect.=20



 Let me give you a couple of examples. The fact that -- the ITC report sh=
ows that nearly $2 billion in increased auto exports is evidence of the i=
mpact of reducing the 70 percent tax that Vietnam currently imposes on Am=
erican automobiles. Malaysia imposes a 30 percent tax. And the reduction =
in those taxes would have a positive impact on U.S. workers and auto comp=
anies here at home.



The last thing Ill say about this is just that I think its important to c=
onsider also that the ITC report didnt -- conducted their analysis essent=
ially in isolation. Their analysis compares TPP to a baseline in which ev=
erything remains the same. One of our most powerful arguments, I think, a=
bout the need to move forward with implementing the Trans-Pacific Partner=
ship agreement is that if we do not, then China will certainly look to ca=
pitalize on opportunities in Southeast Asia that would not just preserve =
the status quo, but actually put American businesses at a further disadva=
ntage.



So the question right now is not whether or not we should protect the sta=
tus quo -- which many critics of the TPP are concerned about -- but rathe=
r, whether the United States would benefit from deeper engagement in the =
region and a trade agreement like the TPP that would raise labor standard=
s, raise environmental standards, and raise human rights standards. Or ar=
e we going to subject U.S. businesses and U.S. workers to further disadva=
ntage by effectively retreating from that region of the world?



Q Obviously your opponents, including Democrats in Congress, have been sa=
ying this would be bad for manufacturing. Are you concerned that this new=
er port will give them even more ammunition and decrease the likelihood t=
hat Congress will take this up this year?



MR. EARNEST: Im not. Again, I think they would be challenged to make the =
case that the U.S. auto industry, for example, would be negatively affect=
ed by cutting the 70 percent tax that Vietnam currently imposes on Americ=
an autos. I also think theyd be challenged to make an argument that, give=
n the status quo that they claim to be concerned about, that we should tr=
y to preserve it and not implement the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreemen=
t. Because I havent really heard them articulate a strategy for dealing w=
ith our increasingly globalized 21st century economy.



In fact, whats likely to happen if the United States withdraws from this =
region of the world -- we will see China seek to expand its influence. Th=
ey wont be looking to raise environmental labor and human rights standard=
s. If anything, theyll be looking to reduce them. That will put U.S. busi=
nesses and U.S. workers and the U.S. economy at a further disadvantage. A=
nd thats the essence of the case that we have made about the wisdom of mo=
ving forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.



Q One other thing. Youve now had a full 24 hours to study the list of Don=
ald Trumps potential Supreme Court nominees. (Laughter.) Anything else yo=
ud like to add about them?



MR. EARNEST: You wont be surprised to hear that I have not devoted a sing=
le second of the last 24 hours to doing that. Plenty of others have and I=
ll let them weigh in with their opinions.=20



Kevin.



Q Thanks, Josh. Has the President reached out or spoken to President Sisi=
 or Hollande?



MR. EARNEST: Not at this point. But if a contact like that occurs well de=
finitely let you know.



Q And should we or should we not expect him to make an on-camera statemen=
t or comment about it?



MR. EARNEST: I wouldnt expect that today.



Q Should we or should we not expect the President at some point to addres=
s the Puerto Rican people directly or visit the island?



MR. EARNEST: Im not aware of any presidential plans to visit the island, =
but if that changes well make sure -- we would make accommodations for yo=
u to join as well.



Q Would there be any interest in doing that, though?=20



MR. EARNEST: The President did have the opportunity to campaign in Puerto=
 Rico in 2008. I had the pleasure of joining him on that trip. It was act=
ually about this time of year eight years ago. Seems like a long time ago=
 now.=20



Q But given the economic crisis there, it would seem to be of interest to=
 the President, certainly the Puerto Rican people, that he make a direct =
appeal, especially if this makes its way through Congress and something g=
ets signed.



MR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I dont have a trip right now to tell you about=
. Obviously Secretary Lew traveled to the island within the last couple o=
f weeks. I understand that Secretary Castro is there this week, I believe=
 -- is that right? So Secretary Castro is there this week. So there certa=
inly have been a number of Obama administration officials, Cabinet-level =
officials who have visited Puerto Rico just within the last couple of wee=
ks, to see firsthand the impact of the financial crisis on the island, on=
 the livelihood of the 3 million Americans who live there.=20



So the President and the senior officials who are responsible for the dom=
estic economy are quite concerned about the situation there. After all, t=
hats why the administration put forward a plan back in October to try to =
address this situation, and ever since then, weve been trying to get Repu=
blicans to engage in a good-faith conversation about addressing the situa=
tion. We obviously were pleased that that lengthy process resulted in the=
 introduction of bipartisan legislation last night.



Q It would be, by the way, the 40th bipartisan piece of legislation signe=
d by the President this year. Were you aware of that?



MR. EARNEST: Well, unfortunately, were a long way from getting it signed.=
 We certainly would like to see Congress act expeditiously to get this to=
 the Presidents desk.



Q Let me circle back on something Karen asked you about, what former Secr=
etary Gates had to say. Hes been relatively consistent in his criticism o=
f this notion that if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, its a =
duck. It is combat by any definition. Today you said you wanted to make c=
ertain that the American people understood the difference between having =
a combat mission and being engaged in combat. I want to give you another =
run at that, and I want to understand specifically, are you suggesting th=
at unless theyre on a combat mission, they are not in combat? Or are you =
saying even the ones who are not on a combat mission are engaged, in fact=
, in combat?



MR. EARNEST: What Im trying to do, Kevin, is explain to the American peop=
le and to your viewers exactly what mission our men and women in uniform =
have been given by their Commander-in-Chief. I think whats important for =
people to first recognize is that the mission that our men and women in u=
niform have been given by President Obama is quite different than the mis=
sion that more than 100,000 U.S. servicemembers received from President B=
ush in the invasion of Iraq in 2003. That was a ground combat operation i=
n which their principal responsibility was to go and seek out the enemy a=
nd engage them in combat.



The mission of most of our personnel in Iraq and in Syria now is differen=
t than that. Their principal responsibilities, setting aside those who ar=
e focused on counterterrorism and some of the special operators there tha=
t are conducting raids. The bulk of our servicemembers are engaged in a t=
raining, advice and assist mission. This means they are supporting Iraqi =
forces on the ground in Iraq who are, themselves, responsible for taking =
the fight to ISIL in their own country. Those forces, those Iraqi forces,=
 are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central governm=
ent and U.S. forces have been deployed in relatively small numbers to sup=
port their efforts, to offer them advice, including tactical advice, to c=
arry out those operations and to maximize their likelihood of success.



But we have said on a number of occasions that that responsibility requir=
es tremendous courage and professionalism because its dangerous. Iraq is =
a dangerous place, and there have been situations in which U.S. military =
personnel have found themselves in combat situations when in the context =
of carrying out this training, advising and assist mission. That is why t=
hose soldiers that are deployed and given this role and given this missio=
n are armed for combat, they are trained for combat, and some of them hav=
e had to engage in combat.=20



Tragically, I think at least three of them now have died in combat, and w=
e owe them and their families a debt of gratitude for the tremendous sacr=
ifice they have made for the safety and security of our country. Again, I=
 know that our critics want to ascribe a variety of motives to this expla=
nation. And what the Commander-in-Chief, his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs=
 of Staff, his Secretary of Defense have all consistently done is try to =
be as precise and as clear as possible about what exactly the mission is =
that our men and women in uniform are pursuing in Iraq and in Syria.



Bob.



Q Josh, a quick follow-up, really. Since we brought up the fight against =
ISIS in Iraq, as theyve been squeezed -- as ISIS has been squeezed in oth=
er parts of the country or wherever theyve launched a series of suicide o=
r car-bomb attacks, any number of them in Baghdad itself, does the United=
 States have any kind of role in securing Baghdad right now that you know=
 of?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Iraqi forces obviously do have a responsibility both t=
o proactively go after ISIL and fight for their own country. They also ha=
ve a responsibility to try to protect the Iraqi people from terrorist att=
acks that are perpetrated by ISIL extremists. So they are responsible for=
 doing both. And our men and women in uniform that are providing training=
 and are providing some advice and assistance are providing them that tra=
ining, advice and assistance even as they try to perform both of those fu=
nctions.



Q In Baghdad, you mean?



MR. EARNEST: Well, in Baghdad there are Iraqi security forces.=20



Q Its a big city, I know. I understand.



MR. EARNEST: In Baghdad, for example, there are Iraqi security forces tha=
t are there to protect the city. Some of those forces have been trained b=
y the United States and our coalition partners. That probably, I guess, i=
s the most tangible example I can give you.



Mike.



Q Yeah, I want to follow up on TPP. The ITC report was a prerequisite for=
 congressional consideration of the deal on the Hill. Can you just say wh=
at the White House preference is in terms of timing? Will you start the c=
lock on that congressional proceedings now?



MR. EARNEST: Mike, what we have said is that wed consult with the Democra=
ts and Republicans in Congress about the best strategy for getting the TP=
P agreement approved as soon as possible. So the White House has been in =
touch with Democrats and Republicans who are supportive of the agreement =
to develop a legislative strategy for moving forward.



Q And are you resigned to this probably -- I mean, theres only I think fi=
ve or six weeks that theyre in session before the long recess. Is this on=
ly going to be something that happens in the lame duck session at this po=
int?



MR. EARNEST: Not necessarily. Were going to continue to consult about the=
 best path forward and we would like to see Congress act soon to approve =
the agreement. And the case that we have made is consistent with the argu=
ment that the Chamber of Commerce and other influential Republican-leanin=
g organizations have made, which is that every day that goes by is a miss=
ed opportunity for American businesses and American workers to benefit fr=
om this agreement.=20



So were hopeful that well build the same bipartisan coalition that we bui=
lt last year to give the President the authority necessary to negotiate t=
his agreement, and were hopeful that well be able to build a similar bipa=
rtisan coalition to approve the agreement.



Q And I noticed that the White House has been in touch with Democrats and=
 Republicans on the Hill. I think Denis McDonough was up there this week.=
 Can you say when the last time was that the President spoke directly wit=
h either the Speaker or to Senator McConnell?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I cant, Mike, primarily because weve preserved the Pre=
sidents ability to engage in private conversations. But I can just tell y=
ou as a general matter that our consultations on this issue have -- well,=
 let me say it this way. Both Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan have indi=
cated on a number of occasions that they believe an agreement like this w=
ould be in the best interest of the United States and our economy. So it =
certainly makes sense that we would coordinate with them, even at the hig=
hest levels, on the path for legislative approval.



Susan, Ill give you the last one.



Q Thank you, Josh. Two things. While you were out here in the briefing, i=
t seems like CNN -- Im looking on Twitter here so I cant be quite sure --=
 is reporting that U.S. officials are saying that the early belief is tha=
t a bomb brought the plane down -- the Egypt airplane down. Im wondering =
if you can confirm that theyve found wreckage and whether that -- if you =
could confirm that U.S. officials are believing this is a bomb.



MR. EARNEST: Well, I saw some of that reporting before I walked out here =
and I dont have an intelligence assessment to share at this point.



Q Okay. The second question is a little more complicated. Im wondering if=
 -- I know that at the beginning of the administration the President real=
ly stressed the importance of not including lobbyists coming into the adm=
inistration -- there were some exceptions. But does he feel the same way =
about it when -- does he have the same concern when officials leave the a=
dministration? That when they become lobbyists, do they need to sign up a=
nd be transparent about that disclosure?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Susan, I dont have the details in front of me, but I k=
now that some of the restrictions that the President put in place on his =
first day in office didnt just apply to individuals who might be consider=
ing employment in the federal government during the Obama administration;=
 there were also commitments that incoming administration officials had t=
o make about limiting their lobbying activities after leaving government.=
 And so there are prohibitions, or at least limitations, that apply to fo=
rmer Obama administration officials.



Q Does the White House advise people leaving? Do they remind them of that=
 and their requirements? Is there a process --=20



MR. EARNEST: Yes, there is. As part of the out-boarding process, youre re=
minded of the commitments that youve made on the way in that would limit =
your job prospects on the way out. And look, many people have raised conc=
erns about how historically theres been a revolving door between the fede=
ral government and K Street. And the Presidents efforts, again, that he i=
nitiated on his first day in office were to close that revolving door, bo=
th in terms of the impact it has on people seeking to enter the governmen=
t, but also based on restrictions that individuals committed to on their =
way out.



Q Its not just K Street that these individuals are going to. Im wondering=
 if anybody left the White House that went to go on and lobby on behalf o=
f engagement in Cuba, if -- and theyre contacting administration official=
s, should they have registered to lobby?



MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I assume -- it sounds now like youre asking abo=
ut a specific case, and why dont we just walk through the details and -- =
help you understand how the rules might apply in a particular case.



Q Sure. Luis Miranda left the White House. He went to the Trimpa Group. H=
e did, from what I understand, engage in contacting the White House on th=
at issue repeatedly, and from what I understand theres no lobbying disclo=
sure records to show for that. I have written about this, but weve talked=
 about a lot -- theres been a lot of discussion about the Iran narrative =
this week, but there hasnt been a lot of discussion about the -- and the =
timeline -- and there hasnt been a lot of discussion about the Cuba timel=
ine and the transparency on those negotiations. Thats why Im asking.



MR. EARNEST: Okay. Well, look, we can take a look and see if we can provi=
de you some additional information. It sounds like -- Im not sure that an=
y of that disclosure would apply to the administration, but we can take a=
 look.



Q To Luis Miranda specifically?



MR. EARNEST: Well, he doesnt work here anymore.



Q Right, so thats why --=20



MR. EARNEST: So maybe you should go ask him.



Q Right, Ive tried to contact him.=20



MR. EARNEST: Okay.



Q Is it important for the White House to have some level of -- on the Cub=
a issue -- to have had some level of surprise on that issue? Or I mean, i=
s it the Presidents right and the White Houses right to -- and the State =
Department -- to engage in diplomacy behind the scenes before announcing =
a major initiative like trying to normalize relations with Cuba or anothe=
r country?



MR. EARNEST: Yes, I think thats entirely appropriate. And that certainly =
has applied to other diplomatic breakthroughs that have been -- that the =
United States has benefitted from in just the last couple of years. And w=
hen we were negotiating to secure the release of Americans who were being=
 unjustly held in Iran, that was not something that we discussed extensiv=
ely in the past. When the United States was working behind the scenes wit=
h China to get them to make some significant commitments to fight carbon =
pollution in their country, that I think -- the results of those negotiat=
ions I think were a surprise to many in the public, but the United States=
 enjoyed significant benefits as a result.



Those kinds of negotiations, that kind of diplomacy is often most effecti=
ve when its done behind the scenes, as you described it.=20



Thanks, everybody.

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Good aft=
ernoon, everybody.&nbsp; I do not have any announcements at the top, so we =
can go straight to your questions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darlene, would you like to =
start?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou. &nbsp;Starting with the news that everyone woke up to today.&nbsp; What=
 conclusions has the United States government reached about what may have b=
rought down the Egyptian airline?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, le=
t me start, Darlene, by offering our thoughts and prayers to the families o=
f those who were aboard EgyptAir Flight 804.&nbsp; The uncertainty and cree=
ping sense of loss that the loved ones of those who were lost on
 the plane must be experiencing right now is painful to even contemplate.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President, as you all a=
re aware, has received multiple updates from his national security team on =
the situation.&nbsp; U.S. national security and aviation experts have been =
in touch with their counterparts in France and Egypt to offer
 assistance.&nbsp; Many of you all have probably also seen the announcement=
 from the Department of Defense that the United States Navy is working to d=
eploy a P-3 Orion aircraft to provide support for the search of the missing=
 jetliner.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Darlene, to =
go straight to your question, it's too early to definitively say what may h=
ave caused this disaster.&nbsp; The investigation is underway and investiga=
tors will consider all of the potential factors that could
 have contributed to the crash.&nbsp; And obviously if there&#8217;s an opp=
ortunity for the United States government to support those efforts then we =
will do that.&nbsp; And the President asked his team to keep him apprised o=
f developments as they occur.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Switchi=
ng topics to Puerto Rico and the legislation on the Hill, the agreement on =
a new bill.&nbsp; Is there any reaction from the White House on that?<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e administration has made clear for several months now that any legislation=
 to address the crisis in Puerto Rico must provide a workable and comprehen=
sive restructuring authority with appropriate oversight that
 respects Puerto Rico&#8217;s self-governance.&nbsp; We're encouraged to se=
e the House introduce legislation yesterday that provides Puerto Rico with =
these tools to address a crisis that's having a negative impact on the 3.5 =
million Americans who live in Puerto Rico.&nbsp;
 There are tangible, real-world, negative consequences for Americans living=
 in Puerto Rico.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we continue to believ=
e that additional measures are necessary to help Puerto Rico grow its econo=
my and address this humanitarian crisis.&nbsp; But the legislation that was=
 unveiled late last night is an important
 first step.&nbsp; We believe that overall the legislation provides a fair =
process for Puerto Rico to restructure its debts, enact fiscal reforms, and=
 create a foundation for economic recovery after enduring a decade of reces=
sion.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There=
&#8217;s one other thing I'd like to ask you about.&nbsp; The chief of staf=
f to the Hungarian Prime Minister today said that President Obama and the U=
nited States favor immigration to Europe because they want to
 send all the Muslims to Europe. Is there anything you want to say in respo=
nse to that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I didn=
&#8217;t see those comments.&nbsp; I'm not sure they&#8217;re worthy of a r=
esponse.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Jeff.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh,=
 is the United States concerned about security at Charles de Gaulle Airport=
 in Paris, and are you concerned about reports that Islamic State militants=
 have infiltrated that airport and others?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Jeff, the United States does have a relationship through TSA and DHS with t=
hose airports around the world that are the last point of departure to the =
United States. So the United States has successfully
 worked with security officials at airports across the country to ensure th=
at international flights arriving in the United States are subject to more =
exhaustive security and screening procedures to ensure the safety of the Am=
erican traveling public.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Again, at this point, it'=
s too early to say what potential factors may have contributed to this part=
icular incident.&nbsp; But it is fair for you to observe and for the Americ=
an people to understand that over the last
 18 to 24 months, the Department of Homeland Security has made some importa=
nt enhancements to those international airports that are the last points of=
 departure for international flights.&nbsp; And that includes expanded scre=
ening that's applied to a variety of
 items that could be transported on an aircraft, so not just carry-on bagga=
ge but other baggage and other equipment that is maintained on the aircraft=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">TSA officials have also e=
ngaged in conducting airport assessments in conjunction with our internatio=
nal partners to ensure the security of the terminal and the airport more br=
oadly. And the DHS has worked with partners
 to offer assistance to certain foreign airports related to broader aviatio=
n and airport security questions.&nbsp; There&#8217;s extensive expertise t=
hat exists at TSA, and working with the operators at foreign airports, we'v=
e been able to use that expertise to discuss
 best practices that could be used to enhance security at foreign airports.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do yo=
u have any specific concerns, though, about the Paris airport?<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Nothin=
g that I have to articulate from here.&nbsp; Obviously there are U.S. fligh=
ts that originate from that airport and the United States has a very import=
ant national security relationship with France
 and that would extend to our coordination on issues related to aviation se=
curity.&nbsp; But I don't have anything specific to raise in terms of conce=
rns about the security situation in Charles de Gaulle.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More =
broadly, does the United States have concerns about militants from the Isla=
mic State infiltrating airports, be it in Europe or be it elsewhere in the =
world?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I would say something that probably is even slightly broader than the way t=
hat you asked your question. We have seen a desire on the part of extremist=
s around the world, including some extremists
 in the Middle East, to carry out attacks targeting the international aviat=
ion system, so we obviously are mindful of that.&nbsp; And here in the Unit=
ed States we&#8217;ve experienced the pain of those aviation-borne attacks =
firsthand on 9/11.&nbsp; So our experts at the TSA
 take very seriously the need to apply adaptive security measures to ensure=
 the safety of our aviation system.&nbsp; They pursue a layered approach th=
at involves a variety of technologies and tactics, and these are tactics th=
at they can be shared with our partners
 around the world and applied in airports around the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we&#8217;ve obviously =
learned a lot since 9/11 about what&#8217;s necessary to protect the aviati=
on system. &nbsp;But that has not diminished the desire of some extremist o=
rganizations to try to carry out attacks against the
 aviation system.&nbsp; We&#8217;re aware of that, and we are constantly co=
untering that threat by adapting our security system to protect the traveli=
ng public.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Final=
ly, you said it&#8217;s too early to comment on what the causes were.&nbsp;=
 Are you able, or has the U.S. intelligence community been able to rule out=
 anything, such as a bomb?&nbsp; Or has anything so far, from the United
 States&#8217; perspective, been ruled out?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#821=
7;m not aware of any sort of intelligence assessment that has ruled anythin=
g out.&nbsp; I&#8217;m also not aware of any intelligence assessment that&#=
8217;s ruled anything in at this point.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re still quite ea=
rly
 in this investigation, and investigators will examine all of the potential=
 factors that may have contributed to this tragedy.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wan=
ted to ask about Puerto Rico.&nbsp; You mentioned that you think there are =
still more steps that need to be taken in addition to this bill, but as the=
 bill stands now, would you sign it?&nbsp; Is this something
 that the White House supports?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
we are encouraged that Democrats and Republicans did work effectively toget=
her to produce this piece of legislation.&nbsp; Bipartisanship has been har=
d to come by in the United States Congress for
 a few years now, so that&#8217;s why you heard me describe the fact that w=
e&#8217;re encouraged by the introduction of this legislation yesterday.&nb=
sp; So, yes, I think you could say that we are supportive of this legislati=
ve proposal to establish a fair process that allows
 Puerto Rico to restructure its debts, enact fiscal reforms, and create a f=
oundation for economic recovery.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What&#8217;s true, though=
, is that the introduction of legislation is just the beginning of the proc=
ess.&nbsp; And this crisis in Puerto Rico can only end when Congress takes =
bipartisan action.&nbsp; And we urge members of Congress
 in both parties to stand firm against the special interests attempting to =
undermine this essential legislation.&nbsp; We urge Congress to act without=
 delay to provide Puerto Rico with the tools that it desperately needs to a=
ddress a situation that&#8217;s having a negative
 impact on 3.5 million Americans living in Puerto Rico.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One o=
f the fiscal reforms in the bill includes allowing the governor of Puerto R=
ico to reduce the minimum wage over five years, below the national average.=
&nbsp; Obviously, that&#8217;s something
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">-- the minimum wage is something the administration =
has pushed for increasing -- there are state increases as high as $15.&nbsp=
; So what&#8217;s your response to the idea that Puerto Rico could be reduc=
ing its minimum wage less than $7.25?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
my understanding is -- I&#8217;ve been briefed on this provision -- is that=
 it applies to a particular quirk in the law that actually affects people w=
ho are younger than age 20 who are working for
 the minimum wage and that it would allow their employer to pay them even b=
elow the minimum wage.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think it would be prett=
y hard for anybody to explain how exactly a 19-year-old Puerto Rican who&#8=
217;s making minimum wage is somehow responsible for the situation or shoul=
d be punished as a result of this situation,
 or that the situation would be improved if 19-year-old Puerto Ricans who a=
re working minimum wage got paid less.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, no, this is not a pro=
vision that we support.&nbsp; Supporters of this provision I think have a h=
ard time justifying it, but in order to see bipartisan action in Congress, =
we are prepared to encourage Congress to
 pass a piece of legislation even if it&#8217;s less than perfect.<o:p></o:=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And i=
t seemed like one of the recent changes was actually increasing the age fro=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Exactl=
y.&nbsp; And so, yes, are 23-year-old Puerto Ricans who are making minimum =
wage deserving of a pay cut, and somehow that&#8217;s going to improve the =
economic climate in Puerto Rico?&nbsp; Again, we&#8217;ve seen
 mean-spirited policymaking on the part of Republicans for quite some time =
now.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;ll just file this example in a rather large fil=
e.&nbsp; But the President has made assisting Puerto Rico and addressing th=
eir challenging economic situation a top priority,
 and sometimes getting bipartisan progress in Congress requires supporting =
legislation that&#8217;s not perfect.&nbsp;

o be clear, are applied to international aircraft that are bound for the Un=

 from Paris and was bound from Cairo, so it wasn&#8217;t subjected necessar=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two mor=

And if so, why are they involved at this point?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, I di=
dn&#8217;t say U.S. investigators.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I&#=
8217;m just wondering -- <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; What I h=
ave indicated -- and I think that this was part of the President&#8217;s in=
struction -- is that U.S. officials, both national security officials and a=
viation experts, would be in touch with their counterparts and offering
 assistance.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not aware that that assistance has been accept=
ed at this point, but certainly U.S. officials, including officials who cou=
ld assist in the investigation of an aviation disaster, could be made avail=
able if requested.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last on=
e.&nbsp; When you were asked whether you had specific concerns about Charle=
s De Gaulle Airport, you said nothing you can articulate from there.&nbsp; =
That doesn&#8217;t sound terrifically reassuring.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
guess, what I&#8217;m saying is I can&#8217;t offer a security assessment o=
f any airport around the world, so I certainly would encourage you guys to =
check with TSA on that.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s no specific concern that&#8=
217;s been raised
 that I&#8217;m aware of.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; You said that it&#8217;s too early, of course, to really know =
what happened.&nbsp; But even at this point, and even hours ago, Egyptian o=
fficials were saying that terrorism in this case is more likely than a tech=
nical fault
 on this plane.&nbsp; Does the administration share that view?&nbsp; Or doe=
s the U.S. have information that backs that likelihood up, at the very leas=
t?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; At this =
point, the information that is available is something that investigators ar=
e still taking a close look at and so I wouldn&#8217;t hazard a guess at th=
is point about what factors may have potentially contributed to this
 disaster.&nbsp; But obviously we&#8217;re going to take a close look at al=
l the available evidence and we&#8217;re going to be in close touch with ou=
r counterparts, and if there is assistance that U.S. experts or U.S. nation=
al security officials can provide in the investigation,
 then we&#8217;ll certainly do that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when=
 Egyptian officials are saying it&#8217;s likely terrorism, and other offic=
ials are speculating that, based on what we know happened, it looks like a =
bomb, is that something that is taken into account?&nbsp; I mean, do you fe=
el that
 it&#8217;s premature to make those assessments right now?&nbsp; Or is the =
U.S. looking at those assessments from other countries?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ri=
ght now, what the United States is doing is offering our assistance to thos=
e investigators who are taking a look at this information and trying to dra=
w conclusions as best they can.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t hav=
e
 a separate assessment to share from here.&nbsp; But we obviously want to b=
e supportive of those who are conducting this investigation, and the deploy=
ment of a U.S. Navy aircraft to assist in the search is one tangible exampl=
e of how U.S. assets can be used to benefit
 the ongoing effort.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But by =
saying it&#8217;s too early to really know, you&#8217;re not, by saying tha=
t, dismissing those early assessments?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, I&#8=
217;m merely explaining why I don&#8217;t have my own assessment to offer.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&n=
bsp; And because it is a question mark and because those assessments at thi=
s point are coming from elsewhere and this originated at an airport where f=
lights to the U.S. originate, on its face, does this, at this point, raise
 the risk for U.S. passengers?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; At this =
point, I think it&#8217;s too early to reach that conclusion.&nbsp; Obvious=
ly national security officials at the Department of Homeland Security and t=
he TSA can offer up the best assessment about that.&nbsp; As I was explaini=
ng
 to Olivier, flights that originate from Charles De Gaulle that are bound f=
or the United States are subjected to additional screening that may not hav=
e applied in this situation.&nbsp; So American passengers can certainly tak=
e some confidence from that.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But, look, we&#8217;re on=
ly hours, not even days, into trying to get to the bottom of what exactly h=
appened here.&nbsp; So we obviously are going to be very supportive of thos=
e who are conducting the investigation, and we
 are eager to understand exactly what may have contributed to this particul=
ar tragedy.&nbsp; And if it merits any sort of change in our security postu=
re, then I&#8217;m confident that&#8217;s something that will be carefully =
evaluated by DHS Secretary Johnson and TSA Administrator
 Neffenger to make the appropriate changes if necessary.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bec=
ause we don&#8217;t know what happened here and terrorism is a possibility,=
 can you just sort of broadly describe the kinds of additional measures tha=
t are going on in foreign airports by the TSA right now?&nbsp; I mean, can =
you say
 that this is something of an internal alert?&nbsp; Or because there are ex=
panded measures already, are they now tighter immediately?&nbsp; I mean, wh=
at can you say about what happens after something like this has transpired?=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, wh=
at happens immediately when something like this transpires is that there is=
 work -- well, that there are offers of assistance that are made to the inv=
estigators overseas that are conducting the investigation.&nbsp;
 And the United States has expertise and assets that other investigators ma=
y find useful.&nbsp; They certainly have been useful in other international=
 investigations that have been conducted.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there are a number of t=
hings that the TSA is engaged in, regardless of whether or not there is an =
unexplained crash like this one.&nbsp; So let me give you a couple more exa=
mples.&nbsp; In the fiscal year 2015, the TSA&#8217;s transportation securi=
ty
 specialists performed 289 air carrier inspections and 146 foreign airport =
assessments.&nbsp; So, again, this is an example of how expertise at the TS=
A can be deployed overseas to enhance not just the U.S. aviation system but=
 the international aviation system.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing that the TS=
A often does is they will deploy canine teams in airports, including teams =
that are sometimes led by state and local law enforcement as well as by TSA=
 officers themselves.&nbsp; These teams operate in secure areas
 of the airport, including activities such as screening cargo and baggage a=
s it&#8217;s being loaded into the aircraft.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing that DHS ha=
s been able to do is to establish something called preclearance.&nbsp; And =
there are a handful of airports around the world where international flight=
s will originate and fly into the United States.&nbsp; And preclearance
 means that Customs and Border Patrol officers don&#8217;t screen the passe=
ngers after they get off the plane but actually will engage in screening th=
ose passengers overseas on foreign soil before they even board a plane that=
 is bound for the United States.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that means that the sec=
urity of those flights is enhanced even further than they already would be.=
&nbsp; And there are 15 preclearance locations around the world right now, =
and DHS and CVP are working together to try to expand that
 program and, again, provide greater confidence that air passengers who are=
 boarding flights bound for the United States have actually been thoroughly=
 reviewed by U.S. national security professionals before they even board th=
e plane.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does TS=
A have any involvement in the maintenance of planes and how those procedure=
s are done before that plane takes off?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
aware that TSA has a maintenance function, but TSA can certainly provide as=
sistance and advice to foreign airport officials as they try to secure sens=
itive parts of the airport.&nbsp; So that could include terminals,
 but that could also include sensitive maintenance areas.&nbsp; So while th=
ey're not, firsthand, involved in conducting that maintenance, they can cer=
tainly offer advice and assistance in terms of helping airport officials se=
cure those sensitive parts of the airport.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continu=
ing on the theme of bipartisan agreement on legislation, today a group of R=
epublican and Senate Democrats have unveiled a bill to overhaul the decades=
-old Toxic Substances Control Act -- a chemical bill that is something
 the White House and EPA have been consulting on.&nbsp; Can you say at this=
 point if the White House endorses this proposal, which has received consid=
erable support from both parties in the Senate and, to a lesser degree, in =
the House?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I have t=
o check with our team to see to what extent we've been briefed on the detai=
ls of the proposals that's apparently been agreed to.&nbsp; So let me circl=
e back with you on the details of that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm jus=
t trying to understand the investigative cooperation relationship between t=
he U.S. and, say, the Egyptian and French and other authorities.&nbsp; Beca=
use you said that there have been offers of assistance and that so far they
 have not been accepted.&nbsp; Yet, at the same time, there's every -- well=
, there are some indications that this could be a terrorist attack, and thi=
s is obviously a big concern for the United States.&nbsp; So what you've de=
scribed sounds more passive than active and
 aggressive and engaged.&nbsp; Do you see what I'm saying?&nbsp; And I'm ju=
st trying to understand why that is.&nbsp; Why is the United States not jus=
t -- why isn&#8217;t there some sort of mechanism whereby because of -- aga=
in, there's been so much emphasis on intelligence-sharing
 and the fight against ISIS.&nbsp; Why isn&#8217;t there some sort of mecha=
nism or some sort of process whereby, given the work that TSA has done in t=
hese airports, that there's a much more aggressive and engaged posture by t=
he United States when something like this happens?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ro=
n, I think the first thing that we should step back and recognize is that t=
his is an aircraft that did not originate on American soil.&nbsp; It was no=
t bound for American soil; it was not an American airline.&nbsp; I'm
 not aware that the pilots were American.&nbsp; Obviously, the plane didn&#=
8217;t crash in America.&nbsp; So there are other countries that have appro=
priate jurisdictions.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the United States has=
 important relationships with both France and with Egypt.&nbsp; We've got a=
n important relationship with Greek authorities, who had launched the preli=
minary search effort because this obviously
 took place near Greek waters.&nbsp; So there are reasons why there are oth=
er countries who were immediately responsible for dealing with this situati=
on, but that has not at all resulted in a delay of the United States offeri=
ng assistance, communicating with our
 partners in both of the countries, and being engaged in trying to get to t=
he bottom of what exactly transpired.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not mean to lead you =
to conclude that somehow our offers of assistance had been rebuffed, just t=
hat other countries have the lead.&nbsp; We have offered to help and we sta=
nd ready to provide that assistance as soon as they're ready
 to integrate it into their efforts.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what=
 if it's not accepted?&nbsp; Is this diplomatic language that you can't say=
 --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Given th=
e strong relationships between the United States and France, and the United=
 States and Egypt, I'm confident that we'll be able to provide them the nee=
ded support to ensure that this investigation proceeds expeditiously
 and is conducted with a focus on getting to the bottom of what exactly tra=
nspired so that we can make any necessary changes -- whether that's changes=
 to an aircraft, enhancements to maintenance, or taking additional security=
 precautions to ensure the safety
 and security of the traveling public.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&=
nbsp; Because, again, even though this does not involve an American plane o=
r passengers or a pilot or airports, the international air system is essent=
ially -- it's an international system.&nbsp; It's really not -- I mean, obv=
iously
 it's not a state-separated system.&nbsp; And that's why -- again, so you h=
ave every expectation that the -- so at this moment, the FBI, the TSA, othe=
rs are not actively involved in this investigation? They are essentially --=
 have extended an offer, and now some
 12 or more hours after this happened, we're still waiting to hear whether =
or not they will be engaged and involved?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I would encourage you to consult with those individual agencies, and t=
hey can detail for you the kinds of conversations that they've had with our=
 partners.&nbsp; But I have confidence that France and Egypt will
 seek whatever assistance is required, and the United States stands ready t=
o provide as much assistance as is necessary to achieve our shared goal, wh=
ich is to get to the bottom of what happened as quickly as possible.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, I=
 want to ask you questions on two different subjects.&nbsp; One, starting o=
ff with the airports and this crash, or this possible or alleged terrorist =
attack.&nbsp; What is the, I guess, conversations, and is there some line o=
f conversation
 between the FAA here, intelligence officials, and their counterparts in ot=
her nations when it comes to airports and airlines?&nbsp; Because that is s=
till considered the number-one target for terrorists, in airports.&nbsp; Wh=
at kind of conversations are happening?&nbsp; And
 particularly when it comes to the uniformity in stepping up security in al=
l of these airports around the country -- because every airport is differen=
t.&nbsp; Security in every airport is different.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ap=
ril, the priority that we have placed is on those airports overseas that ar=
e the last point of departure.&nbsp; So international aircraft that origina=
te in other countries flying into the United States, those are,
 for obvious reasons, the point of emphasis that our security professionals=
 have identified.&nbsp; And as a result, there are enhanced screening measu=
res in place at airports around the world -- not on American soil -- but th=
at are consistent with established standards
 put together by TSA to ensure the safety of flights bound for the United S=
tates that originate in other countries.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to that, TSA ob=
viously has experts and equipment and strategies for safeguarding aircraft,=
 for safeguarding passengers, for safeguarding airports.&nbsp; And that ass=
istance advice about that expertise is provided to our partners
 around the world.&nbsp; As I pointed out, in the last fiscal year, TSA sec=
urity specialists performed 289 air carrier inspections and 146 foreign air=
port assessments.&nbsp; So I think that's an indication that the scope of t=
heir work is quite broad.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in addition to that, th=
e Department of Homeland Security has sought to expand their preclearance p=
rogram that provides significantly enhanced screening of passengers who are=
 originating -- who are trying to travel to the United
 States from overseas.&nbsp; And examining the passports and documentation =
of those passengers before they ever board the plane, ensuring that those a=
ircraft and those passengers can be swept prior to boarding the plane consi=
stent with U.S. standards is certainly
 another way that we can enhance the safety of the American traveling publi=
c.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So DHS and TSA and CVP and =
all of these national security agencies that have different responsibilitie=
s for protecting the American people are not just actively engaged in the U=
nited States in protecting the traveling public, but they&#8217;re
 actively engaged overseas to ensure that international flights arriving in=
 the United States are secure as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I'=
m getting from what you're saying is there&#8217;s not uniformity but there=
&#8217;s efforts to increase and enhance it.&nbsp; So with that, what&#8217=
;s the reality in the timeline that there could be uniformity in these airp=
orts where everyone
 is on the same page with documentation, screenings, et cetera?<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ap=
ril, I don't envision a scenario in which every single airport in the world=
 has the same security screening measures.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm ask=
ing about the airports that -- as you say, there are efforts that you're ma=
king when it comes to security more so with the airports that have flights =
coming into the United States.&nbsp; When will there be -- what&#8217;s the=
 timeline
 for that uniformity as far as screenings and documentations, things of tha=
t nature?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Flights =
that are the last point of departure are subject to enhanced screening meas=
ures that are applied by TSA.&nbsp; So does that answer your question?<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No.&nbs=
p; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
what I would do is this.&nbsp; I think you should check with TSA and they c=
an provide you a more detailed assessment of what security measures they ha=
ve in place at airports around the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make su=
re TSA and I can talk?&nbsp; Okay.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Anybody =
else?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not=
 finished with my other question -- I'm sorry.&nbsp; It was the Nigerian gi=
rls since we had the latest news yesterday. Could you talk to us about any =
intelligence you&#8217;ve received?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the latest as relate=
s to the Nigerian
 girls?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; AS you k=
now, April, extensive resources have been provided by the United States to =
the Nigerian officials who are responsible for searching not just for the C=
hibok girls but for the thousands of Nigerians who have been
 kidnapped by Boko Haram.&nbsp; Boko Haram is a vicious terrorist organizat=
ion that has capitalized on kidnapping to try to raise money for their terr=
orist organization and to otherwise terrorize the people in that country an=
d the people in that region.&nbsp; And the
 United States has provided intelligence, military and financial support to=
 the Nigerian government as they confront this threat.&nbsp; And we continu=
e to provide that even to this day.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And was=
 that a glimmer of hope yesterday that even though she was found pregnant a=
nd they were questioning if that could have been one of the captors -- it w=
as supposed to be her husband -- is there still a glimmer of hope that
 more will be found?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Certainl=
y the United States continues to vigorously support the efforts of the Nige=
rian government.&nbsp; Ultimately, it's the Nigerian government who is resp=
onsible for conducting the search, and their search efforts have
 been enhanced greatly by the assistance provided by the United States.<o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; Two Chinese tactical jets have intercepted an American reconna=
issance plane in the South China Sea.&nbsp; And I was wondering, how seriou=
sly are you taking this incident?&nbsp; Do you see it as a provocation?&nbs=
p;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, An=
drew, the Department of Defense is reviewing public claims of a May 17 inte=
rcept of a U.S. maritime patrol reconnaissance aircraft by two tactical air=
craft from the People&#8217;s Republic of China.&nbsp; The incident occurre=
d
 in international airspace during a routine U.S. patrol in the South China =
Sea.&nbsp; Initial reports of the incident characterized it as &#8220;unsaf=
e.&#8221;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I can tell you more gener=
ally that the Department of Defense has made progress reducing the risk bet=
ween U.S. operational forces and those of the People&#8217;s Republic of Ch=
ina.&nbsp; We've reduced that risk by improving
 dialogue at multiple levels under the bilateral confidence-building measur=
es and the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement.&nbsp; These are establ=
ished diplomatic and military channels that allow the United States and Chi=
na to communicate clearly and raise concerns
 about these kinds of issues when they arise.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I'm told that the next Mi=
litary Maritime Consultative Agreement talks are actually scheduled for May=
 24 and 25 in Hawaii.&nbsp; So there is a well-established diplomatic and m=
ilitary channel to work through these kinds
 of concerns.&nbsp; Over the course of the last year, the Department of Def=
ense has seen improvements in the way that Chinese military pilots fly cons=
istent with international guidelines and consistent with the way that aircr=
aft can be operated in a safe and professional
 manner.&nbsp; But suffice it to say that the Department of Defense is addr=
essing this issue through the appropriate channels.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is th=
e President typically told about these incidents, or this one in particular=
?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think the President is certainly apprised of these developments as warran=
ted.&nbsp; I don't know whether or not he received a specific briefing on t=
his particular situation.&nbsp; Again, based on the
 kinds of improvements that we've seen over the last year, I think these ki=
nds of incidents are not common.&nbsp; But there also was a pretty signific=
ant incident in the first few months of the Bush administration with Chines=
e military aircraft intercepting U.S.
 intelligence aircraft that resulted in a much more significant geopolitica=
l incident.&nbsp; The reports of this incident obviously didn&#8217;t resul=
t in the same kind of consequences.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This =
is obviously not an accident.&nbsp; Do you think that it&#8217;s going to c=
oincide with the President&#8217;s trip to Vietnam?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
we&#8217;ll try to address this issue through the established channels.&nbs=
p; And presumably, in those channels, Chinese officials can explain their p=
erspective on what exactly occurred.&nbsp; But I would hesitate
 to ascribe a motive at this point.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh,=
 you&#8217;ve been pretty restrained in how you&#8217;ve described what has=
 happened with the EgyptAir flight.&nbsp; Donald Trump was out with a tweet=
 this morning -- he says, &#8220;Looks like another terrorist attack.&nbsp;=
 Airplane
 departed from Paris.&nbsp; When will we get tough, smart and vigilant?&#82=
21;&nbsp; That would imply that this administration has not done those thin=
gs in terms of being &#8220;tough, smart and vigilant.&#8221;&nbsp; What do=
 you make of those comments?&nbsp; Inappropriate at this time?<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I don&#8217;t have a specific reaction to that tweet.&nbsp; Obviously we be=
lieve that this investigation should move forward, and move forward expedit=
iously.&nbsp; And if conclusions point toward specific security
 concerns, then I&#8217;m confident that our security professionals will ad=
dress it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But since you, or someone=
 else, brought it up, my colleagues at the Department of Defense did provid=
e I think a pretty useful update on some of the progress that&#8217;s been =
made against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria in
 recent weeks.&nbsp; So let me just point out a couple of the highlights.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The first is that we obvi=
ously are pleased with the progress that Iraqi security forces have made in=
 the western Anbar town of Rutbah.&nbsp; This operation, once it&#8217;s co=
mplete, will help the Iraqis reclaim Iraq&#8217;s southwestern
 border and reestablish economic trade along highways between Jordan and Ir=
aq.&nbsp; We obviously have been supportive of Iraqi forces that are operat=
ing in that area, and we&#8217;re pleased to see them make important progre=
ss.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I also have an updated as=
sessment for you in terms of the success that Iraqi forces have had in driv=
ing ISIL out of populated territory in Iraq.&nbsp; The updated assessment i=
s that now 45 percent of the populated area
 that ISIL previously controlled has been retaken from them.&nbsp; In Syria=
, that figure is now 20 percent, thanks to the work of local partners, incl=
uding the Syrian-Arab coalition.&nbsp; That&#8217;s an increase in both cou=
ntries.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In addition, there are so=
me additional metrics I can share with you here.&nbsp; DOD has indicated th=
ey have targeted and killed more than 120 high-value individuals in ISIL&#8=
217;s attack network, including leaders, facilitators,
 planners and recruiters.&nbsp; And my colleagues at the Department of Defe=
nse have indicated that that&#8217;s had a measurable impact on ISIL&#8217;=
s effectiveness.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The coalition more broadl=
y has trained more than 30,000 Iraqi security forces.&nbsp; They reported t=
hat, right now, nearly 5,000 Iraqi security forces are in training.&nbsp; T=
hat&#8217;s about 3,800 Iraqi army soldiers and about
 1,100 Peshmerga fighters in Erbil.&nbsp; Together, that is the highest num=
ber the coalition has been training at any one point in time.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And then finally, I want =
to draw to your attention an announcement that was made today by the Intern=
ational Monetary Fund.&nbsp; They announced that they had come to an agreem=
ent with the government of Iraq on a $5 billion
 loan agreement over the next three years.&nbsp; Over the last several week=
s, you&#8217;ve heard the President talking with a greater sense of urgency=
 about the economic situation in Iraq, and obviously the security challenge=
s in Iraq combined with some of the challenges
 that they&#8217;ve encountered in implementing political reforms, as well =
as the impact of a much lower global price of oil -- all have combined to h=
ave a negative impact on the economic situation in Iraq.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the President made a =
concerted effort to encourage our partners and allies who are part of the c=
oalition to ramp up the financial assistance that they&#8217;re providing t=
o Iraq, both to offer support to the Abadi
 government, but also to offer support to the Iraqi government as they try =
to rebuild those areas that have been retaken from ISIL.&nbsp; We know that=
 some of ISIL&#8217;s tactics have been to essentially destroy the infrastr=
ucture of places that they had occupied.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So being able to quickly =
rebuild that infrastructure and allow people to move home is a top priority=
 of the Abadi government and will be critical to the success of stabilizing=
 and securing the country.&nbsp; And the
 international contribution to this effort is critical.&nbsp; And obviously=
, a $5.4 billion commitment from the IMF is significant.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, bu=
t I think that was implied in the tweet.&nbsp; And you had asked whether or=
 not we had been vigorous in pursuing extremist organizations that have vow=
ed to attack the United States, or at least our
 interests.&nbsp; And so it seemed appropriate to offer an update to our ef=
forts against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.<o:p></o:p></p>

Monaco delivered the briefing this morning, I believe, to the President, ac=
cording to your readout.&nbsp; Is that the U.S. official who has continued =
to update the President?&nbsp; Or are there others from different
 departments?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; She wi=

 other officials, including in the intelligence community and other places,=
 that may also have information to share
 with the President.&nbsp; But she obviously is the person responsible for =
that, principally.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given h=
er role in counterterrorism, it would imply that that is obviously a key co=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, sh=
e is both the President&#8217;s top counterterrorism advisor but also his t=
op homeland security advisor, so it&#8217;s also customary for her to appri=
se him of events that could have a potential impact on the homeland, even
 if they&#8217;re not related to terrorism.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But is =
this being treated, I guess, like any other plane downing or disappearance?=
&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had a few in the past few years.&nbsp; I mean, is there =
something specific about this focus and how quickly the administration has =
responded
 -- about it?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
the response that we have initiated here at the White House is consistent w=
ith any significant or potentially significant world event that could have =
an impact on U.S. policy.&nbsp; And certainly Ms. Monaco and her
 colleagues at the NSC have been conscientious about making sure the Presid=
ent has all of the information that he needs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in p=
ublic discourse about this, do you think that terrorism is being too focuse=
d on?&nbsp; Or are we -- you&#8217;re getting a lot of questions in this ro=
om specifically about that as a hypothesis that hasn&#8217;t been ruled out=
.&nbsp; But is that
 the prime focus right now, ruling that out?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#8217;=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, F=
ormer Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said today on TV that politics is t=
he reason that the United States is not defining the mission in Iraq as a c=
ombat mission.&nbsp; He says he believes it is.&nbsp; He says it&#8217;s a =
disservice
 to those out there putting their lives on the line, and &#8220;incredibly =
unfortunate not to speak openly about what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;&nbsp; I=
s Secretary Gates wrong?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ka=
ren, we&#8217;ve had an opportunity to discuss this on a number of occasion=
s from here.&nbsp; But I know that people like General Dunford and Secretar=
y Carter have also had an opportunity to discuss this.&nbsp; The fact of th=
e
 matter is we have worked very diligently to try to be as clear as possible=
 about what mission our men and women in uniform have been given by the Com=
mander-in-Chief in Iraq and in Syria.&nbsp; And the mission that they have =
been given and the responsibility that
 they are bearing is significant and dangerous.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m not awa=
re of anybody in the administration who has sought to downplay that.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we have tried to do is=
 to be as precise as possible in describing what exactly their mission is.&=
nbsp; And while their presence in Iraq and in Syria is dangerous and, on oc=
casion, our men and women in uniform have found themselves
 in combat situations that are dangerous, they have not been deployed to Ir=
aq to wage combat on the ground against ISIL.&nbsp; Their responsibility, t=
heir mission has been to offer training, advice, and assistance to Iraqi se=
curity forces.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, of course, there are s=
ome U.S. Special Operators that have been deployed to carry out raids again=
st ISIL targets.&nbsp; Obviously that&#8217;s a combat situation.&nbsp; But=
 that is very different than the decision that was made by President Bush
 to deploy more than 100,000 U.S. forces on the ground in a sustained comba=
t role where their principal responsibility was to seek out and engage the =
adversary in combat.&nbsp; The mission that has been given to U.S. forces i=
s different.&nbsp; And we have gone to great
 lengths to try to help you and the American public understand with precisi=
on exactly what responsibilities the Commander-in-Chief has given them.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason that that precis=
ion is important is it&#8217;s important for people to understand the diffe=
rent in approach, but it&#8217;s also important for people to understand ho=
w much gratitude we should have for our men and women in uniform who
 are assuming a great burden, at great peril to themselves, to keep our cou=
ntry safe.&nbsp; Certainly the Commander-in-Chief has that gratitude, and h=
opefully every American does.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#821=
7;s a pretty tough charge, though, using the word &#8220;politics&#8221; in=
 this.&nbsp; Can you specifically respond to that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t think I&#8217;m going to respond to Secretary Gates today.<o:p></o:p>=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, b=

a motive to that incident.&nbsp; But is there any doubt in the administrati=
on&#8217;s mind that the incident was deliberate?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I think this is exactly why we&#8217;ve got this established channel w=
here U.S. military and diplomatic officials can consult with their counterp=
arts in China and engage in a dialogue with them about this particular
 incident and give those Chinese officials an opportunity to explain from t=
heir perspective exactly what happened and try to prevent those kinds of da=
ngerous incidents from occurring in the future.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s why I=
&#8217;m hesitating to ascribe a motive.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll let
 Chinese officials explain their actions, and I&#8217;m confident that they=
&#8217;ll do that both publicly and privately.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could y=

his next conversation with President Xi?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t know that it necessarily would rise to that level.&nbsp; There have b=
een a couple of high-profile incidents with --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rus=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST&nbsp;&nbsp; -- =
the Russians.&nbsp; And the President, in the immediate aftermath of one of=
 those incidents, had a long phone call with President Putin and it didn&#8=
217;t come up.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if this kind of incident would rise=
 to that level.&nbsp;
 It certainly wouldn&#8217;t rise to the level of prompting proactively a c=
all from the President to his Chinese counterpart, but it&#8217;s hard for =
me to say whether or not it would come up in a call that was scheduled to d=
iscuss something else.&nbsp; &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last on=
e.&nbsp; Can you say whether or not Chinese leaders have raised the issue o=
f U.S. reconnaissance planes near their airspace operating in that area?<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e concern that they have raised is about the kind of territorial disputes t=
hat have arisen in the South China Sea.&nbsp; And China makes some signific=
ant claims in that region of the world that are in dispute.&nbsp; And
 the United States has asserted that those disputes should be resolved thro=
ugh diplomacy.&nbsp; We've made clear both publicly and privately that the =
United States is not a claimant to any of those land features in the South =
China Sea, but we have encouraged those
 with competing claims, including China, to find a diplomatic resolution to=
 those competing claims.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou, Josh.&nbsp; Former U.S. Marine working for the U.S. military base Kaden=

as found.&nbsp; Are you concerned this incident will make worse relations b=
etween
 people in Okinawa and U.S. military base?&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ta=
ka, we've seen the reports and we're aware of the arrest of a U.S. citizen =
civilian in Okinawa, and we're following the case closely.&nbsp; You probab=
ly have seen the statement from Ambassador Kennedy on this issue.&nbsp;
 Our heartfelt sympathy and deepest condolences go out to the family and fr=
iends of the victim.&nbsp; This is a terrible tragedy and an outrage, and w=
e wish to express our deepest sorrow.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States is treati=
ng this situation with the utmost seriousness, and the United States milita=
ry is cooperating fully with local authorities in their investigation.&nbsp=
; For additional details about that, I'd refer you to the Department
 of Defense.&nbsp; They presumably could answer any questions you would hav=
e about any impact this could potentially have on the military presence in =
Okinawa, but I would not anticipate any sort of policy change.<o:p></o:p></=

our questions?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will he=
 talk about these issues when he goes to Japan?&nbsp; Will he talk about th=
is military base issue?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t know if the conversation about this particular incident will occur.&n=
bsp; I would anticipate the President will have an opportunity to have a di=
scussion with Prime Minister Abe, but I don&#8217;t know whether or not thi=
s
 will be on the agenda.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; On TPP, the ITC report came out late yesterday and it showed i=
n their assessment that the TPP would boost American agriculture, boost the=
 service sector, but actually have a slightly downward impact on U.S. manuf=
acturing.&nbsp;
 Obviously, manufacturing has been a big selling point for the President in=
 this, and this is showing that it would actually reduce manufacturing slig=
htly.&nbsp; Is that a disappointment to you?&nbsp; Or do you agree with tha=
t assessment?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, le=
t me say a couple of things.&nbsp; I mean, the overall numbers are, as you =
point out, quite good.&nbsp; The U.S. annual real income would be boosted b=
y $57 billion if TPP were to go into effect based on this independent
 analysis.&nbsp; And about two-thirds -- GDP would increase $42 billion.&nb=
sp; And about two-thirds of the GDP growth resulting from the TPP would go =
to American workers through wage increases and increased job opportunities.=
&nbsp; And that's how -- I think this provides
 additional evidence of how the TPP is consistent with the President's stra=
tegy of focusing on growing the U.S. economy from the middle out.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say that these numb=
ers would be even higher if they factored in the important success that we =
have enjoyed in negotiating a reduction in non-tariff barriers in the TPP a=
greement.&nbsp; This independent analysis did not fully account
 for the impact of the reduction in non-tariff barriers.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it relates to the manufa=
cturing sectors, the report shows very clearly that, under TPP, manufacturi=
ng employment and output do not decline from where they are now, but they w=
ould grow.&nbsp; And the ITC says very clearly that output
 in employment in each of the 56 sectors that they model will rise with TPP=
 in effect.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you a couple of=
 examples.&nbsp; The fact that -- the ITC report shows that nearly $2 billi=
on in increased auto exports is evidence of the impact of reducing the 70 p=
ercent tax that Vietnam currently imposes on American automobiles.&nbsp;
 Malaysia imposes a 30 percent tax.&nbsp; And the reduction in those taxes =
would have a positive impact on U.S. workers and auto companies here at hom=
e.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The last thing I&#8217;ll=
 say about this is just that I think it&#8217;s important to consider also =
that the ITC report didn&#8217;t -- conducted their analysis essentially in=
 isolation.&nbsp; Their analysis compares TPP to a baseline
 in which everything remains the same.&nbsp; One of our most powerful argum=
ents, I think, about the need to move forward with implementing the Trans-P=
acific Partnership agreement is that if we do not, then China will certainl=
y look to capitalize on opportunities
 in Southeast Asia that would not just preserve the status quo, but actuall=
y put American businesses at a further disadvantage.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the question right now=
 is not whether or not we should protect the status quo -- which many criti=
cs of the TPP are concerned about -- but rather, whether the United States =
would benefit from deeper engagement
 in the region and a trade agreement like the TPP that would raise labor st=
andards, raise environmental standards, and raise human rights standards.&n=
bsp; Or are we going to subject U.S. businesses and U.S. workers to further=
 disadvantage by effectively retreating
 from that region of the world?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obvio=
usly your opponents, including Democrats in Congress, have been saying this=
 would be bad for manufacturing.&nbsp; Are you concerned that this newer po=
rt will give them even more ammunition and decrease the
 likelihood that Congress will take this up this year?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#821=
7;m not.&nbsp; Again, I think they would be challenged to make the case tha=
t the U.S. auto industry, for example, would be negatively affected by cutt=
ing the 70 percent tax that Vietnam currently imposes
 on American autos.&nbsp; I also think they&#8217;d be challenged to make a=
n argument that, given the status quo that they claim to be concerned about=
, that we should try to preserve it and not implement the Trans-Pacific Par=
tnership agreement.&nbsp; Because I haven&#8217;t really
 heard them articulate a strategy for dealing with our increasingly globali=
zed 21st century economy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In fact, what&#8217;s lik=
ely to happen if the United States withdraws from this region of the world =
-- we will see China seek to expand its influence.&nbsp; They won&#8217;t b=
e looking to raise environmental labor and human rights
 standards.&nbsp; If anything, they&#8217;ll be looking to reduce them.&nbs=
p; That will put U.S. businesses and U.S. workers and the U.S. economy at a=
 further disadvantage.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the essence of the case that =
we have made about the wisdom of moving forward with the Trans-Pacific
 Partnership agreement.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#821=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would=
 there be any interest in doing that, though?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The Pr=
esident did have the opportunity to campaign in Puerto Rico in 2008.&nbsp; =
I had the pleasure of joining him on that trip.&nbsp; It was actually about=
 this time of year eight years ago.&nbsp; Seems like a long
 time ago now.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But g=
iven the economic crisis there, it would seem to be of interest to the Pres=
ident, certainly the Puerto Rican people, that he make a direct appeal, esp=
ecially if this makes its way through Congress and
 something gets signed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
listen, I don&#8217;t have a trip right now to tell you about.&nbsp; Obviou=
sly Secretary Lew traveled to the island within the last couple of weeks.&n=
bsp; I understand that Secretary Castro is there this week,
 I believe -- is that right?&nbsp; So Secretary Castro is there this week.&=
nbsp; So there certainly have been a number of Obama administration officia=
ls, Cabinet-level officials who have visited Puerto Rico just within the la=
st couple of weeks, to see firsthand the impact
 of the financial crisis on the island, on the livelihood of the 3 million =
Americans who live there.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the President and the =
senior officials who are responsible for the domestic economy are quite con=
cerned about the situation there.&nbsp; After all, that&#8217;s why the adm=
inistration put forward a plan back in October
 to try to address this situation, and ever since then, we&#8217;ve been tr=
ying to get Republicans to engage in a good-faith conversation about addres=
sing the situation.&nbsp; We obviously were pleased that that lengthy proce=
ss resulted in the introduction of bipartisan
 legislation last night.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wo=

President this year.&nbsp; Were you aware of that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
unfortunately, we&#8217;re a long way from getting it signed.&nbsp; We cert=
ainly would like to see Congress act expeditiously to get this to the Presi=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let m=
e circle back on something Karen asked you about, what former Secretary Gat=
es had to say.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been relatively consistent in his criticism=
 of this notion that if it walks like a duck and quacks like a
 duck, it&#8217;s a duck.&nbsp; It is combat by any definition.&nbsp; Today=
 you said you wanted to make certain that the American people understood th=
e difference between having a combat mission and being engaged in combat.&n=
bsp; I want to give you another run at that, and I want
 to understand specifically, are you suggesting that unless they&#8217;re o=
n a combat mission, they are not in combat?&nbsp; Or are you saying even th=
e ones who are not on a combat mission are engaged, in fact, in combat?<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; What I=
&#8217;m trying to do, Kevin, is explain to the American people and to your=
 viewers exactly what mission our men and women in uniform have been given =
by their Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp; I think what&#8217;s important
 for people to first recognize is that the mission that our men and women i=
n uniform have been given by President Obama is quite different than the mi=
ssion that more than 100,000 U.S. servicemembers received from President Bu=
sh in the invasion of Iraq in 2003.&nbsp;
 That was a ground combat operation in which their principal responsibility=
 was to go and seek out the enemy and engage them in combat.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The mission of most of ou=
r personnel in Iraq and in Syria now is different than that.&nbsp; Their pr=
incipal responsibilities, setting aside those who are focused on counterter=
rorism and some of the special operators
 there that are conducting raids.&nbsp; The bulk of our servicemembers are =
engaged in a training, advice and assist mission.&nbsp; This means they are=
 supporting Iraqi forces on the ground in Iraq who are, themselves, respons=
ible for taking the fight to ISIL in their
 own country.&nbsp; Those forces, those Iraqi forces, are operating under t=
he command and control of the Iraqi central government and U.S. forces have=
 been deployed in relatively small numbers to support their efforts, to off=
er them advice, including tactical advice,
 to carry out those operations and to maximize their likelihood of success.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But we have said on a num=
ber of occasions that that responsibility requires tremendous courage and p=
rofessionalism because it&#8217;s dangerous.&nbsp; Iraq is a dangerous plac=
e, and there have been situations in which U.S.
 military personnel have found themselves in combat situations when in the =
context of carrying out this training, advising and assist mission.&nbsp; T=
hat is why those soldiers that are deployed and given this role and given t=
his mission are armed for combat, they
 are trained for combat, and some of them have had to engage in combat.&nbs=
p; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Tragically, I think at le=
ast three of them now have died in combat, and we owe them and their famili=
es a debt of gratitude for the tremendous sacrifice they have made for the =
safety and security of our country.&nbsp;
 Again, I know that our critics want to ascribe a variety of motives to thi=
s explanation.&nbsp; And what the Commander-in-Chief, his Chairman of the J=
oint Chiefs of Staff, his Secretary of Defense have all consistently done i=
s try to be as precise and as clear as
 possible about what exactly the mission is that our men and women in unifo=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh,=
 a quick follow-up, really.&nbsp; Since we brought up the fight against ISI=
S in Iraq, as they&#8217;ve been squeezed -- as ISIS has been squeezed in o=
ther parts of the country or wherever they&#8217;ve launched a series
 of suicide or car-bomb attacks, any number of them in Baghdad itself, does=
 the United States have any kind of role in securing Baghdad right now that=
 you know of?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Iraqi forces obviously do have a responsibility both to proactively go afte=
r ISIL and fight for their own country.&nbsp; They also have a responsibili=
ty to try to protect the Iraqi people from terrorist
 attacks that are perpetrated by ISIL extremists.&nbsp; So they are respons=
ible for doing both.&nbsp; And our men and women in uniform that are provid=
ing training and are providing some advice and assistance are providing the=
m that training, advice and assistance even
 as they try to perform both of those functions.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; In Bag=

 I guess, is the most tangible example I can give you.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah,=
 I want to follow up on TPP.&nbsp; The ITC report was a prerequisite for co=

 start the clock on that congressional proceedings now?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Mike, =
what we have said is that we&#8217;d consult with the Democrats and Republi=
cans in Congress about the best strategy for getting the TPP agreement appr=
oved as soon as possible.&nbsp; So the White House has
 been in touch with Democrats and Republicans who are supportive of the agr=
eement to develop a legislative strategy for moving forward.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a=
re you resigned to this probably -- I mean, there&#8217;s only I think five=
 or six weeks that they&#8217;re in session before the long recess.&nbsp; I=

 at this point?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Not ne=
cessarily.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to consult about the best pa=
th forward and we would like to see Congress act soon to approve the agreem=
ent.&nbsp; And the case that we have made is consistent with
 the argument that the Chamber of Commerce and other influential Republican=
-leaning organizations have made, which is that every day that goes by is a=
 missed opportunity for American businesses and American workers to benefit=
 from this agreement.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we&#8217;re hopeful th=

to give the President the authority necessary to negotiate this agreement, =
and we&#8217;re hopeful that we&#8217;ll be able to build a
 similar bipartisan coalition to approve the agreement.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I=
 noticed that the White House has been in touch with Democrats and Republic=

 directly with either the Speaker or to Senator McConnell?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I can&#8217;t, Mike, primarily because we&#8217;ve preserved the President&=
#8217;s ability to engage in private conversations.&nbsp; But I can just te=
ll you as a general matter that our consultations on this issue
 have -- well, let me say it this way.&nbsp; Both Leader McConnell and Spea=
ker Ryan have indicated on a number of occasions that they believe an agree=
ment like this would be in the best interest of the United States and our e=
conomy.&nbsp; So it certainly makes sense
 that we would coordinate with them, even at the highest levels, on the pat=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
 you, Josh.&nbsp; Two things.&nbsp; While you were out here in the briefing=
, it seems like CNN -- I&#8217;m looking on Twitter here so I can&#8217;t b=
e quite sure -- is reporting that U.S. officials are saying that the early
 belief is that a bomb brought the plane down -- the Egypt airplane down.&n=
bsp; I&#8217;m wondering if you can confirm that they&#8217;ve found wrecka=
ge and whether that -- if you could confirm that U.S. officials are believi=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I saw some of that reporting before I walked out here and I don&#8217;t hav=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.=
&nbsp; The second question is a little more complicated.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wo=
ndering if -- I know that at the beginning of the administration the Presid=
ent really stressed the importance of not including lobbyists coming
 into the administration -- there were some exceptions.&nbsp; But does he f=
eel the same way about it when -- does he have the same concern when offici=
als leave the administration?&nbsp; That when they become lobbyists, do the=
y need to sign up and be transparent about
 that disclosure?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Susan, I don&#8217;t have the details in front of me, but I know that some =
of the restrictions that the President put in place on his first day in off=
ice didn&#8217;t just apply to individuals who might
 be considering employment in the federal government during the Obama admin=
istration; there were also commitments that incoming administration officia=
ls had to make about limiting their lobbying activities after leaving gover=
nment.&nbsp; And so there are prohibitions,
 or at least limitations, that apply to former Obama administration officia=
ls.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does =
the White House advise people leaving?&nbsp; Do they remind them of that an=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, t=
here is.&nbsp; As part of the out-boarding process, you&#8217;re reminded o=
f the commitments that you&#8217;ve made on the way in that would limit you=
r job prospects on the way out.&nbsp; And look, many people have
 raised concerns about how historically there&#8217;s been a revolving door=
 between the federal government and K Street.&nbsp; And the President&#8217=
;s efforts, again, that he initiated on his first day in office were to clo=
se that revolving door, both in terms of the impact
 it has on people seeking to enter the government, but also based on restri=
ctions that individuals committed to on their way out.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8=

&nbsp; Luis Miranda left the White House.&nbsp; He went to the Trimpa Group=

 lobbying disclosure records to show for that.&nbsp; I have written about t=
his, but we&#8217;ve talked about a lot -- there&#8217;s been a lot of disc=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, I=
 think that&#8217;s entirely appropriate.&nbsp; And that certainly has appl=

tes has benefitted from in just the last couple of years.&nbsp;
 And when we were negotiating to secure the release of Americans who were b=
eing unjustly held in Iran, that was not something that we discussed extens=
ively in the past.&nbsp; When the United States was working behind the scen=
es with China to get them to make some
 significant commitments to fight carbon pollution in their country, that I=
 think -- the results of those negotiations I think were a surprise to many=
