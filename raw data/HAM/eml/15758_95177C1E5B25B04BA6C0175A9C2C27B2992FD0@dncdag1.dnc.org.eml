Excerpts from the DNC Press Call To Hold Donald Trump Accountable As He Cam=
paigns In Indiana

Today, Representative Andre Carson and Indiana Democratic Party Chair John =
Zody hosted a press call to hold Donald Trump accountable as he campaigned =
in Indiana. Donald Trump has proven that he is dangerous, dishonest, and af=
raid to face the tough questions. With so much at stake in the general elec=
tion for the state of Indiana, Hoosiers cannot afford to be dragged backwar=
ds by the out-of-touch agenda of the Republican Party. From divisive rhetor=
ic to enticing violence and prejudice, Donald Trump and his fellow Republic=
ans stand to negatively affect the state of Indiana and it's residents. The=
se are the many reasons why Hooisers need to elect Democrats up and down th=
e ballot.

Below find excerpts from the call as prepared for delivery:

Indiana Democratic Party Chairman John Zody:
...

But let's be clear - Donald Trump did not hijack the Republican Party. He i=
s the natural result of years of extreme ideology and dangerous, divisive r=
hetoric coming from the Republican Party. We've already suffered from the o=
ut-of-touch agenda of our own version of Trump in the state - Governor Mike=
 Pence. Like Trump, Governor Pence wants to redefine birthright citizenship=
 rules in the U.S. Constitution.

Just yesterday, Trump's immigration policy expert testified in favor of ant=
i-immigrant legislation in Indiana and a measure that could bring another w=
ave of RFRA-like economic panic to the state. While Trump has said women sh=
ould be "punished" for having abortions, Mike Pence signed one of the most =
restrictive abortion laws in the nation. Under this law, women no longer ha=
ve the privacy and confidentiality of consulting with their doctors about t=
heir own well-being. And finally, Donald Trump supports policies similar to=
 the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act - essentially a licens=
e to discriminate, which Mike Pence has championed.

Not only did this dash his chances to run for president, but his destructiv=
e ideology threw the state into a $250 million economic panic while putting=
 our coveted "Hoosier Hospitality" reputation in jeopardy. So Mike Pence is=
 Indiana's Donald Trump. And I can tell you, we don't need another one.
...
After the past four disastrous years of his leadership, Hoosiers are ready =
to fire Mike Pence this fall. But I remain worried about the hateful rhetor=
ic that Trump and Cruz will spread across Indiana in the meantime. After No=
vember, Indiana will be recovering from one out-of-touch ideologue, we defi=
nitely can't afford another one in the White House.

Representative Andre Carson:

As most know -- three years ago, after their 2012 election loss, the Republ=
ican Party put out an autopsy report that was supposed to help them connect=
 with a more diverse electorate. Instead of heeding the warnings, the party=
 paved the way for a divisive demagogue at the top of the ticket: Donald Tr=
ump.
...

But even more shocking is that the Republican Party has done nothing in the=
 three years since it released its autopsy to build relationships with peop=
le of color or to make us feel welcome. In fact, it's barely done anything =
in the last fifty years to bridge the gap. Division has been a deliberate p=
art the strategy employed by Republicans for years.

So we shouldn't be surprised that Donald Trump's vicious campaign tactics p=
ut him at the top of the Republican primary field. By inciting violence at =
his rallies, encouraging the crowd to beat up a Black Lives Matter proteste=
r, and waffling on whether or not to denounce the Klu Klux Klan, Trump know=
s exactly what he's doing, and it's shameful. I don't want to see another a=
rticle suggesting that Trump is engaging in a hostile takeover of his party=
. He's not. He is a product of years and years of racial appeals by generat=
ions of Republicans. Trump is the GOP without the wrapping paper. The truth=
 is, the other Republican candidates running for president are not much dif=
ferent.
...

Trump's call for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S=
." promotes prejudice of and discrimination against Muslims. Our nation is =
not at war with Islam, or any other religion. Our nation is at war with tho=
se who seek to harm us. I am a proud Hoosier. And I am a proud Muslim Ameri=
can who has served my country as a member of the law enforcement community,=
 the intelligence committee, and now as the Representative from Indiana's 7=
th Congressional District. There are millions Muslim American citizens - ha=
rdworking families and patriots who contribute and serve our nation in many=
 ways - from education, to law enforcement, to medicine, including some rig=
ht here in Indiana.

Our country is better than the division and hatred we're being sold by Repu=
blicans. If the GOP is truly interested in broadening its appeal, then it n=
eeds to abandon divisive leaders like Donald Trump and commit to changing i=
ts priorities, policies, and practices in order to win over minority voters=
. People of color hear them too.
