Cruz to announce intention to name Fiorina as his running mate<http://www.wmur.com/politics/wmur-first-cruz-to-announce-intention-to-name-fiorina-as-his-running-mate/39241650?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=wmur9>

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will announce on Wednesday afternoon that former presidential rival Carly Fiorina has agreed to be his running mate should he win the GOP presidential nomination.

Sources confirmed to WMUR political director Josh McElveen and political reporter John DiStaso that Fiorina, who has been a supporter of Cruz for several weeks, will be the focus of the announcement that Cruz intends to make in Indiana Wednesday afternoon.

Fiorina dropped out of the presidential race after finishing seventh in the New Hampshire presidential primary on Feb. 9.

The former Hewlett-Packard CEO endorsed Cruz a month later, calling him a "leader and a reformer" who is "willing to take on the status quo in Washington." She has since appeared often as a surrogate for Cruz.

Cruz's campaign is on the ropes after suffering defeats in five eastern states on Tuesday. He is looking to Indiana's May 3 primary to salvage his campaign as frontrunner Donald Trump nears the 1,237 delegate threshold needed to secure the GOP presidential nomination.

Should Cruz survive Indiana, California's primary is key on June 7. Fiorina is viewed as a potential asset to Cruz in California, where she won a U.S. Senate primary in 2010 before losing to Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer in the general election.

Republicans also view Fiorina as someone with conservative credibility with a strong business record. She is also marketable by Cruz as an asset in a general election bid against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Fiorina was perhaps the most effective critic of Clinton during primary process in New Hampshire and later states.
