Subject: In-town pool report #5/lid

POTUS received a warm reception at APAICS gala dinner, where he spoke for=
 about 20 mins.

He highlighted his accomplishments in helping the Asian-American/Pacific =
Islander community and called again for comprehensive immigration reform.=


He mentioned his judicial and federal appointments from the AAPI communit=
y and a taskforce on new immigrants as some of his administration's accom=
plishments.

He was interrupted often by applause by APAICS members in the packed room=
 at the Washington Hilton. Many members were wearing traditional outfits =
from their native countries.

On immigration reform, POTUS said: "It's so difficult to understand why s=
ome folks are still standing in the way of comprehensive immigration refo=
rm."

He reminded the audience to vote in midterm elections to elect members of=
 Congress who would support immigration reform.

POTUS did not mention Donald Trump by name, but pointed to the anti-immig=
rant sentiment in the news the last few months. "We've got to push back o=
n any anti-immigrant sentiment," he said.

(Check quotes with the official transcript of his remarks).

Rep. Judy Chu introduced the president.

Side note -- Your pooler walked by Aziz Ansari on the way out.

Motorcade made it back to the White House at 8:45 pm.

Travel/Photo lid called at 8:46 pm.

Goodnight everyone!
