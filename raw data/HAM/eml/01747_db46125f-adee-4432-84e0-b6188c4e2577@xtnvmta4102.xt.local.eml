Good Thursday morning, Illinois. The City of Chicago is threatening to privatize security at O'Hare and Midway airports following dismal performance by the TSA that's brought insanely long lines. TSA's chief Peter Neffenger is visiting Chicago today, where, according to Sun-Times columnist Mark Brown, he will proceed to blame three-hour plus security lines on the flying public. That should go over well. 

An unusual story is unfolding out of northwest suburban Elgin, where a public mural up for years was just recognized to be tied to a most horrific scene. When placed side by side a historic photo of a 1930s public lynching of two black men, it appears to match the portion of the photo showing the crowd's reaction. The revelation has the town reeling and a hearing is scheduled to discuss whether it should be taken down. The mural was up for 10 years before passersby saw a resemblance between it and a historic photo in Marion, Indiana of the lynching. See both images here and read the story: "Elgin mural's connection to lynching photo raises questions," Elgin Courier-News reports:

CLAYPOOL GOES UP AGAINST RAUNER -- Chicago Public Schools chief Forrest Claypool will be among 200 people rallying today in Chicago calling on Springfield to act on school funding reform. Ald. Michael Scott Jr. will also speak at the rally. The invite: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=3b896603c5104112b1313b62db53edbceee5af7a395b53b2c824e41458ba235f 

At the same time: A group of school superintendents, including Claypool have signed a letter to Gov. Bruce Rauner today, asking him to approve a change to the school funding formula. "Instead of working to fix how the state funds education, we are disappointed to see that your administration is proposing an approach that would continue the broken status quo, helping districts that are already wealthy and putting a greater burden on districts that have high concentrations of poverty. We urge you to recommit your administration to working with the General Assembly to pass a funding formula that treats districts fairly and doesn't stack the deck against students who already face the greatest
 challenges." The 15 superintendents from districts across the state, including Waukegan, Peoria and Taylorville, among others. Read the letter: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4ea88a3a194421acd0fa3f421d872d76dbe900a67b0fa09ba685ffb095c6442e

RAHM ON THE HOT SEAT -- "Fed judge: Emanuel may be called to testify about code of silence," by Chicago Sun-Times' Jon Seidel: "Mayor Rahm Emanuel may be called to testify during a civil trial about the Chicago Police Department's notorious code of silence. But U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman said he reluctantly made the ruling only because city lawyers turned agnostic in court on the question of whether such a code exists - promising not to deny it when a whistleblower lawsuit goes to trial, but refusing to confirm it. Meanwhile, Emanuel has already acknowledged the code in a speech to the City Council last December." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0186fa752e6d1be8e4a5c33f6c4a59dc470b5c800ae1bfcbae46d488e6306f87 

HOUSTON COULD BECOME THIRD LARGEST CITY -- "Chicago losing population, could be overtaken by Houston as 3rd-largest," by Chicago Tribune's Marwa Eltagouri: "Chicago, the only city among the nation's 20 largest to see population loss in 2015, could be overtaken in a decade by Houston as the third-most-populous city if the trend continues, experts said. The city of Chicago lost about 2,890 residents between 2014 and 2015." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e0f96a2365dfc164223ccd9dba55ce0104b644db32d4a4c210e277311227c68c 

SELL SOME TO ELGIN WHILE YOU'RE AT IT -- "24 years after proposing spray paint ban, Burke wants to relax it," by Chicago Sun-Times' Fran Spielman: "The sponsor of Chicago's 24-year-old ban on spray paint wants to relax the law, allowing sales to adults and helping retailers in border wards that are losing business to the suburbs. Ald. Edward Burke (14th), chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee, agreed to propose the change to the groundbreaking ordinance he championed. Since 1992, Chicago has had a law on the books that bans the sale of spray paint. The goal was to take away at least one of the tools that taggers use to vandalize buildings, streets and sidewalks with graffiti."

** A message from VoteVets Action Fund: Strong prevailing wage laws improve the lives of veterans, who work in construction at much higher rates than non-veterans. Each year, prevailing wage laws help hundreds of thousands of returning veterans put their skills to work building our communities while providing a middle class life for their families. - http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a5d277106e3f116ec68c697befb23293af8700f351c4c8985db55a30861c5721 **

TSA DEBACLE 'MONTHS IN THE MAKING' -- "Brown: Airport security fiasco demands more than just new hires," by Chicago Sun-Times' Mark Brown: "The essence of that problem is that the Transportation Security Administration cut way back on its staffing levels in anticipation of large numbers of travellers paying $85 and submitting to an interview to enroll in its PreCheck program for expedited boarding. Except only a fraction of those expected to sign up for PreCheck did so." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d3fad02315fbe3c38718f59668fec111ee9bf276274817460140a0cf0bab8368 

NOTHING LIKE A THREAT TO GET THINGS MOVING -- "Emanuel uses possible privatization of security at airports to leverage TSA," by Chicago Tribune's Bill Ruthhart: "Mayor Rahm Emanuel is seeking to use the threat of privatizing security screening at O'Hare and Midway airports to leverage the Transportation Security Administration into beefing up inadequate Chicago staffing that has left travelers waiting in huge lines and rescheduling missed flights. A group of influential aldermen introduced a resolution Wednesday calling on Emanuel's administration to apply for the TSA Screening Partnership Program, which would allow City Hall to contract with federally approved private firms to screen
 passengers and baggage at Chicago airports. The move also would give the city greater flexibility in security assignments, staffing levels and operating hours of staff." 

"Ald. Edward Burke, the powerful chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee, said 20 airports across the country already have taken steps toward privatizing security screening, including ones in San Francisco, Orlando, Fla., and Kansas City, Mo. Burke, 14th, said New York and Atlanta also have sent letters to the TSA requesting to be allowed to privatize security screening. 'I think Chicago should be doing the same,' Burke said." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1682ea47d64d30b3d524cf36bb4cab5c376e5f46467fb8d351b7331193b0f3ac 

TSA TODAY: LOW MORALE, HIGH TURNOVER -- "The View From Behind The Security Check," by WBEZ's Melba Lara: "Over the last three years, the Transportation Security Administration and Congress cut the number of front-line screeners by about 10 percent. On Tuesday, TSA sent 58 more screeners to O'Hare to relieve some of the tension. Eddie Palacios, president of Chicago TSA officers Local 777, spoke to WBEZ's Melba Lara about the situation from a screener's point of view. He says lines are growing now because flight loads always increase in May and June, but also says there bigger issues at play." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=93391b166c158b50c0ab4ecc0f69a15e93a035861f090aceb054ad71ca26bd61 

WHAT DIFFERENCE A DAY MAKES (NONE) -- "TSA lines still long at Chicago airports," by ABC 7's Tanja Babich: "Less than 24 hours after the TSA administrator apologized for hours-long wait times at Chicago airports, passengers encountered a massive security line at O'Hare International Airport. ABC7 Eyewitness News viewers Patty Donovan and Krissy Kosmoski shared photos of the line at O'Hare around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday. Kosmoski said despite the long wait, airport personnel did a great job moving people whose flights were scheduled to depart earlier than others to the front of the line. After gaining national attention for major travel delays at O'Hare and Midway International Airport, the TSA
 announced Tuesday that it's making some changes." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d9e28c739fb4c8815e7e2e8e56abdd1996605c5813f3292bf7c6e332cad02f06 

STRONG COUNCIL, WEAK MAYOR -- "Signs Point to Disconnect Between City Council, Chicago Mayor," by NBC Chicago's Mary Ann Ahern: "More clues surfaced at Wednesday's Chicago City Council meeting that Mayor Rahm Emanuel is experiencing perhaps the toughest period of his tenure. Votes from aldermen on key issues showed signs of a strong council and a weak mayor, the likes of which Chicago has not seen in years. Following the Licensing Committee's approval of regulations on house-sharing businesses like Airbnb, Emanuel promised a vote on the floor Wednesday, but that full council vote was delayed after several aldermen requested more time. The mayor's office had made last-minute changes on the
 bill up until midnight before the meeting, according to Ald. Brendan Reilly." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9abab398a3031bfc4579c900974895eb1e563d77e5472916da79318ce6afca8b 

LET'S CHANGE THE SUBJECT -- "Emanuel proposes transgender restroom ordinance," by Chicago Tribune's John Byrne: "Chicago hotels, restaurants and grocery stores would not be allowed to require patrons to prove their gender in order to use restrooms under a proposal Mayor Rahm Emanuel introduced Wednesday ... If the measure passes, 'public accommodations' like grocery stores would be prohibited from requiring patrons to show government IDs to access restrooms. It's unclear whether that's actually happening anywhere in the city, however. And the proposal says nothing about enforcement." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=190d48cd099571f7eaec08fc428b9f436017d48257552c098dc1cc4c928f2754 

NOT BUYING IT -- "Top Cop Eddie Johnson Spins Tall Tales While Trying To Earn Chicago's Trust," by DNAinfo's Mark Konkol: "With a careful mix of seemingly credible details and unchallenged exaggeration, Police Supt. Eddie Johnson has offered up a pretty fuzzy picture of his journey to becoming the police boss charged with addressing the troubled city's shooting problem. Johnson started spinning his yarn on his first day on the job - a position he had not applied for when he was hand-picked by Mayor Rahm Emanuel to run the department. He introduced himself to Chicagoans by offering up some pretty interesting details about his 27 years on the force. One particularly stood out. 'I've actually
 never encountered police misconduct,' he said." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0e4ea5b59f71eb6de51c66fc965ab695c380d5828db9ee6f10623583a78cc8e4 

NEW LUCAS IDEA: HABITABLE GREEN ROOF -- "Put a Park on It: Save the Lucas Museum," by New City's Nick Cecchi: "It appears as though Chicago will lose the Lucas Museum after a protracted and unnecessary legal battle with Friends of the Parks ... It is not often that architecture can provide solutions to what are fundamentally political and social problems, however this may be an exception. The simple reconfiguration of the museum to incorporate a habitable green roof (see illustration above) would provide continuous parkland across the site-a sure improvement over the current condition. With an uninterrupted ground plane, the welcome addition of some topography, and the stitching together of
 previously disconnected sections of the lakefront green space, this approach could save the museum while drastically improving the lakefront for public use." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=58b29b77355ec121adc1f6c0bc53c7c31afb8de2ce863e25b120c161ba9b5295 

THE BIG SELL TO THE PUBLIC, IN FOUR STEPS -- "Oh, the irony: Mayor Rahm's allies call Lucas Museum opponents elitists," by The Reader's Ben Joravsky: "The power struggle over the Lucas Museum isn't being driven by some group of elites (read: rich white people), and it has nothing to do with race-though that won't stop the mayor and his pals from invoking it. In many ways, the mayor and his allies are following a script written by Emanuel's predecessor-Mayor You-Know-Who-when he tried to cram the Children's Museum into Grant Park or turn Chicago's parks into construction zones for the 2016 Olympics. Call it a four-step process. 

"Step one: The mayor announces, Great news, Chicago! You're getting something you didn't know you wanted. ... Step two: The mayor pressures his oversight boards and bodies to approve the deal without anything resembling serious oversight. ... Step three: The mayor gets scions of civic and corporate Chicago-always willing to oblige-to praise the plan. Usually they quote Daniel Burnham, who's not around to defend himself since he's been dead for more than a century. Finally, if there's any resistance, the mayor brings out the heavy artillery-often Father Pfleger-to denounce the opposition as elitists." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9760baaa7feac7cfc8a600b08e8b67b95110208aba15360d77066a12c80d36ae 

SURF'S UP NEAR LAKE MICHIGAN -- "On-Land Surfing At Montrose Beach? Meeting To Renovate Beach House Thursday," by DNAinfo's Josh McGhee: "Chicago Surf has big plans that could make Uptown a destination for surfers across the city. The surf park vendor's proposal, which includes building an on-land surf park and renovating the Clarendon Park Community Center, will be discussed at a Thursday community meeting hosted by 46th Ward Ald. James Cappleman, according to Uptown Update. Improvements would include completely renovating utility sewer and water lines and restrooms and adding licensed security officers and security cameras linked to the Town Hall District police station."

FORMER BEARS PLAYERS IN CRASH -- "Barrington Hills crash kills man, injures former Bears players," by Northwest Herald's Katie Dahlstrom: "Police have identified the Barrington Hills man who died after a crash Monday, as well as the two former Chicago Bears players who were injured. Salvatorre J. DiMucci, 35, was driving a 2015 Mercedes Benz east on Goose Lake Drive west of Brinker Road about 9:45 p.m. when the vehicle left the road, struck a tree and crashed into the ditch ... Police identified the two 30-year-old passengers as former Bears backup quarterback Caleb Hanie, of Rockwall, Texas, and Agoura Hills, California resident Joseph LaRocque, a linebacker who appeared in 14 games for
 the bears between 2008 and 2009." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=363c8b0492ca4193d1cc8be23c8406be9015a19939cb6b08aa23b9b7281d1ee3 

STATE 

10K PROTEST RAUNER, MADIGAN EATS IT UP -- "Buttoned-up Madigan pumps fist in air at anti-Rauner union rally," by Chicago Tribune's Celeste Bott: "It's not often, if ever, that House Speaker Michael Madigan is seen pumping his fist in the air. But the usually reserved 74-year-old Democrat did just that Wednesday as thousands of state workers cheered while he fired up union troops gathered to protest against Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. A crowd that Springfield police estimated at 10,000 flooded the streets in front of the Capitol, calling on Rauner to resume contract talks with the state's largest employee union and drop his demands that collective bargaining rights be scaled back before
 he'd sign off on a full state budget. While Rauner has spent the last few weeks declaring he's optimistic a grand compromise could be reached before lawmakers head home for the summer, the union display was indicative of the deep ideological divide that's fueled the state's record-breaking budget impasse." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=abb03411ed72d320dcffdcc78722dc1e6ee7025e3f48f01499dcaee609ac4dd2 

WHAT SPRINGFIELD LOOKED LIKE -- "On Twitter: The view of Wednesday's large union rally," by The State Journal-Register: Twitter highlights of the demonstration. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4da0c9ab6d8427c914652581ce93030f2972b0b31b833776681dcb91116677cc 
 
-- Marijuana Decriminalization bill sent to Rauner: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5a837be85f6b520c034865e3297a044dfd6d12fa9c1175c9d4aa79acffde6f5f 

METH STILL AN ISSUE BUT FADES FROM DEBATE -- Illinois Issues: "For the past few years, Illinois lawmakers have been focused on the state's heroin crisis. Meth has faded from the headlines and is no longer the subject of debate in the General Assembly, but it's still a problem in Illinois." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=3797fac746f48956350e23fa10c3f9340fa41d0987aab01c01866770379b8aee 

RAUNER: SET WAGES AT BARGAINING TABLE -- "Rauner cool to idea of $15 hourly wage for home care workers," by The Associated Press: "Gov. Bruce Rauner is signaling a cool reception to legislation that raises the base salary for home care workers to $15 an hour. The Illinois House approved the idea 67-44 Wednesday. Roughly 24,000 workers care for disabled residents in their homes and make $13 an hour. Rep. Sonya Harper says the work is physically taxing, often unpleasant and saves the state money in nursing-home expenses. Catherine Kelly is a spokeswoman for Republican Rauner. She says the proposal would cost $87 million more annually and mean cuts to other important programs. The workers
 belong to the SEIU Healthcare Illinois union and could continue negotiating wages above $15. Kelly says the bargaining table is the place to settle wages, not the Legislature." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d659b2bd3f08355f305df3f2b01d4f373263592008b41d2fb563ac06d0001d34 

ANOTHER UNPAID STATE BILL -- "Illinois Adds More Than $600 Million In Debt Not Processed Through Comptroller's Office," by NPR's Sarah Mueller: "Illinois is racking up more debt than even its comptroller knows about. Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of bills are awaiting payment. They're part of a little known program that has lawmakers asking questions. Documents obtained by Illinois Public Radio show that since November, the state owes businesses in the Vendor Support Initiative program more than $600 million. That doesn't include the 1 percent interest fee applied per month to bills over 90 days old under the Prompt Payment Act. The program allows companies to buy invoices of
 others who have done business with the state, and are awaiting payment. The companies pay the bills, then make a profit by collecting both the overdue money and the interest on it when the state eventually pays up." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d1771dd952fbc5f9b046fbe45c64c07d6469b4068c2ebfd7cbb339297633a98b 

STATE SUGAR TAX POPS UP -- "Amid budget deficit, Illinois considers taxing sugary drinks," by The Associated Press' Ivan Moreno: "Lawmakers scrambling to find money to fix Illinois' multibillion dollar deficit are looking to sugary drinks as one potential source of revenue. Taxing distributors of sodas, energy drinks and other sugary beverages was among the revenue-generating ideas a group of lawmakers proposed to Gov. Bruce Rauner and other legislative leaders last week to try to finally end a nearly yearlong impasse that's left the state without a budget. Illinois is facing a $5 billion-and-growing deficit. Lawmakers are also considering raising the state income tax from 3.75 percent to
 4.85 percent and making budget cuts as part of an overall deal Rauner wants contingent on getting pro-business, union-weakening reforms. And while a resolution to the budget stalemate remains elusive, those who support taxes on sugary drinks and the beverage industry are preparing for a possible fight on an idea that pops up frequently nationwide." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=eaf5fa642071af688baaefe8b1b652c933bc1110e16f1459606d6df7a8f61f0c 

BUSINESSES COMPLAIN ABOUT WORKERS COMP COSTS -- "Governor Rauner hears from Metro East business owners about financial hardships," by KMOV's Spencer Michelson: "Metro East businesses met with Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner Wednesday in Fairmont City to discuss their concerns over the growing budget crises ... Many owners spoke about the struggles of paying workers compensation among other financial hardships. Most companies in Illinois are paying up to five times more in workers comp than in other states. Rauner did say that the state is running on a 'broken system' and 'destructive cycle.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=802db1e8570c99a53aa9d03f6077418f9a52e2ac7cf533562183e671352b9702 

COUNTY SWIPES CREDIT CARD TO PAY BILLS -- "'Broke' Rock Island County borrows to pay bills," by Quad-Times City's Thomas Geyer: "Rock Island County board members approved a loan for the general fund Tuesday to help the county pay its bills. The county is borrowing $500,000 from its tax anticipation warrant approved in November, County Administrator Dave Ross said. The county can borrow up to a maximum of $3 million. 'We're broke," Ross said. 'The money will be paid back once the county receives its portion of property taxes.' Property tax payments are due in installments to be paid in June, August, September and November." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=214b0d6134c0ca64aea04e62d13b8ee8be8317cf111348751a7224bac98e579e 

MCSWEENEY CALLS FOR AN IEPA LEAD REPORT -- "Lawmaker seeks state report on lead in water," by Daily Herald's Jake Griffin: "On the heels of findings that 70 percent of suburban drinking water systems recorded some levels of lead during testing over the past three years, Barrington Hills Republican state Rep. David McSweeney is calling for a full report on the safety of the state's water supplies by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. McSweeney filed a joint resolution this week requesting the state agency charged with monitoring public water systems compile a comprehensive report by the end of the year. 'It's the No. 1 responsibility of government to ensure the public safety and

CONVENTIONAL FROM THE UNCONVENTIONAL -- "Trump unveils 11 potential Supreme Court nominees," by POLITICO's Nick Gass: "Donald Trump on Wednesday released a list of 11 judges he would consider appointing to the Supreme Court, offering up a group of relatively tame conservative jurists apparently curated with the help of GOP leaders. In an unusually restrained statement, Trump's campaign offered up short bios of the judges and described the list as one assembled 'first and foremost, based on constitutional principles, with input from highly respected conservatives and Republican Party leadership.' The roster is made up of a combination of six George W. Bush appointees to federal appeals
 courts and five currently serving on their states' highest courts - not exactly extreme choices from a candidate who has run such an unconventional race." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=127a82e7cf2607114dd2fbbde4a9dfcb122b89383d43e69b2c53dc6300884bbe 

DOUBTS OVER DEMS UNITING -- "Sanders sticks it to the Democratic Party," by POLITICO's Daniel Strauss: "In the wake of a chaotic state convention that resulted in death threats for party officials and vandalism to party headquarters, the Democratic establishment asked Bernie Sanders for his help Tuesday in getting some of his overzealous supporters to stand down. His response: Stick it ... The rifts caused by the presidential primary may be deeper than anyone knew. The level of vitriol generated by the convention outcome - in which Sanders backers erupted in fury over Hillary Clinton's delegate win there - and Sanders' reaction to those pointing the finger at his supporters are suddenly
 raising doubts about the party's ability to quickly unite after its long slog of a primary." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=dbd6c47f54b7c8f513e212e52d1f06a288d19c808e565fbaabd48feaff7c2c41

** A message from VoteVets Action Fund: Strong prevailing wage laws are like a minimum wage for skilled construction workers. Because veterans work in construction at higher rates than non-veterans, prevailing wage laws enable hundreds of thousands of veterans to put their battle-tested leadership and problem solving skills to work building our communities while providing a good life for their families. Unfortunately, in the last two years, at least eleven states (including Illinois) have considered repealing or weakening their prevailing wage laws, which would hurt our economy and drive thousands of veterans out of their jobs and into poverty. Our nation's heroes deserve better from our
 elected officials. Stand with veterans and sign our petition for the strong prevailing wage laws that help our veterans and their families. - http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a5d277106e3f116ec68c697befb23293af8700f351c4c8985db55a30861c5721 **

<b>RAHM ON THE HOT SEAT -- &quot;Fed judge: Emanuel may be called to testify about code of silence,&quot; by Chicago Sun-Times' Jon Seidel: </b>&quot;Mayor Rahm Emanuel may be called to testify during a civil trial about the Chicago Police Department's notorious code of silence. But U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman said he reluctantly made the ruling only because city lawyers turned agnostic in court on the question of whether such a code exists - promising not to deny it when a whistleblower lawsuit goes to trial, but refusing to confirm it. Meanwhile, Emanuel has already acknowledged the code in a speech to the City Council last December.&quot;

</b> &quot;The sponsor of Chicago's 24-year-old ban on spray paint wants to relax the law, allowing sales to adults and helping retailers in border wards that are losing business to the suburbs. Ald. Edward Burke (14th), chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee, agreed to propose the change to the groundbreaking ordinance he championed. Since 1992, Chicago has had a law on the books that bans the sale of spray paint. The goal was to take away at least one of the tools that taggers use to vandalize buildings, streets and sidewalks with graffiti.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a5fdd143d94c2226999fa4df6ec8c684fc35c9f13fad2fa95db3bddaaabc954d" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1W3f3rC</a> <br></p><p>

</b> &quot;Mayor Rahm Emanuel is seeking to use the threat of privatizing security screening at O'Hare and Midway airports to leverage the Transportation Security Administration into beefing up inadequate Chicago staffing that has left travelers waiting in huge lines and rescheduling missed flights. A group of influential aldermen introduced a resolution Wednesday calling on Emanuel's administration to apply for the TSA Screening Partnership Program, which would allow City Hall to contract with federally approved private firms to screen passengers and baggage at Chicago airports. The move also would give the city greater flexibility in security assignments, staffing levels and operating hours of

ABC7 Eyewitness News viewers Patty Donovan and Krissy Kosmoski shared photos of the line at O'Hare around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday. Kosmoski said despite the long wait, airport personnel did a great job moving people whose flights were scheduled to depart earlier than others to the front of the line. After gaining national attention for major travel delays at O'Hare and Midway International Airport, the TSA announced Tuesday that it's making some changes.&quot;

Votes from aldermen on key issues showed signs of a strong council and a weak mayor, the likes of which Chicago has not seen in years. Following the Licensing Committee's approval of regulations on house-sharing businesses like Airbnb, Emanuel promised a vote on the floor Wednesday, but that full council vote was delayed after several aldermen requested more time. The mayor's office had made last-minute changes on the bill up until midnight before the meeting, according to Ald. Brendan Reilly.&quot;

Johnson started spinning his yarn on his first day on the job - a position he had not applied for when he was hand-picked by Mayor Rahm Emanuel to run the department. He introduced himself to Chicagoans by offering up some pretty interesting details about his 27 years on the force. One particularly stood out.

</b>&quot;It appears as though Chicago will lose the Lucas Museum after a protracted and unnecessary legal battle with Friends of the Parks ... It is not often that architecture can provide solutions to what are fundamentally political and social problems, however this may be an exception. The simple reconfiguration of the museum to incorporate a habitable green roof (see illustration above) would provide continuous parkland across the site-a sure improvement over the current condition. With an uninterrupted ground plane, the welcome addition of some topography, and the stitching together of previously disconnected sections of the lakefront green space, this approach could save the museum while
 drastically improving the lakefront for public use.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=58b29b77355ec121adc1f6c0bc53c7c31afb8de2ce863e25b120c161ba9b5295" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1W3fYbs</a> </p><p><b>THE BIG SELL TO THE PUBLIC, IN FOUR STEPS -- &quot;Oh, the irony: Mayor Rahm's allies call Lucas Museum opponents elitists,&quot; by The Reader's Ben Joravsky:
</b> &quot;The power struggle over the Lucas Museum isn't being driven by some group of elites (read: rich white people), and it has nothing to do with race-though that won't stop the mayor and his pals from invoking it. In many ways, the mayor and his allies are following a script written by Emanuel's predecessor-Mayor You-Know-Who-when he tried to cram the Children's Museum into Grant Park or turn Chicago's parks into construction zones for the 2016 Olympics. Call it a four-step process.  </p><p><b>&quot;Step one: 
</b>The mayor announces, Great news, Chicago! You're getting something you didn't know you wanted. ... Step two: The mayor pressures his oversight boards and bodies to approve the deal without anything resembling serious oversight. ... Step three: The mayor gets scions of civic and corporate Chicago-always willing to oblige-to praise the plan. Usually they quote Daniel Burnham, who's not around to defend himself since he's been dead for more than a century. Finally, if there's any resistance, the mayor brings out the heavy artillery-often Father Pfleger-to denounce the opposition as elitists.&quot;

</b>&quot;Gov. Bruce Rauner is signaling a cool reception to legislation that raises the base salary for home care workers to $15 an hour. The Illinois House approved the idea 67-44 Wednesday. Roughly 24,000 workers care for disabled residents in their homes and make $13 an hour. Rep. Sonya Harper says the work is physically taxing, often unpleasant and saves the state money in nursing-home expenses. Catherine Kelly is a spokeswoman for Republican Rauner. She says the proposal would cost $87 million more annually and mean cuts to other important programs. The workers belong to the SEIU Healthcare Illinois union and could continue negotiating wages above $15. Kelly says the bargaining table
 is the place to settle wages, not the Legislature.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d659b2bd3f08355f305df3f2b01d4f373263592008b41d2fb563ac06d0001d34" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1W3gC8T</a> </p><p><b>ANOTHER UNPAID STATE BILL -- &quot;Illinois Adds More Than $600 Million In Debt Not Processed Through Comptroller's Office,&quot; by NPR's Sarah Mueller:
</b> &quot;Illinois is racking up more debt than even its comptroller knows about. Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of bills are awaiting payment. They're part of a little known program that has lawmakers asking questions. Documents obtained by Illinois Public Radio show that since November, the state owes businesses in the Vendor Support Initiative program more than $600 million. That doesn't include the 1 percent interest fee applied per month to bills over 90 days old under the Prompt Payment Act. The program allows companies to buy invoices of others who have done business with the state, and are awaiting payment. The companies pay the bills, then make a profit by collecting both
 the overdue money and the interest on it when the state eventually pays up.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d1771dd952fbc5f9b046fbe45c64c07d6469b4068c2ebfd7cbb339297633a98b" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1TIdskP</a> </p><p><b>STATE SUGAR TAX POPS UP -- &quot;Amid budget deficit, Illinois considers taxing sugary drinks,&quot; by The Associated Press' Ivan Moreno: 
</b>&quot;Lawmakers scrambling to find money to fix Illinois' multibillion dollar deficit are looking to sugary drinks as one potential source of revenue. Taxing distributors of sodas, energy drinks and other sugary beverages was among the revenue-generating ideas a group of lawmakers proposed to Gov. Bruce Rauner and other legislative leaders last week to try to finally end a nearly yearlong impasse that's left the state without a budget. Illinois is facing a $5 billion-and-growing deficit. Lawmakers are also considering raising the state income tax from 3.75 percent to 4.85 percent and making budget cuts as part of an overall deal Rauner wants contingent on getting pro-business,
 union-weakening reforms. And while a resolution to the budget stalemate remains elusive, those who support taxes on sugary drinks and the beverage industry are preparing for a possible fight on an idea that pops up frequently nationwide.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=eaf5fa642071af688baaefe8b1b652c933bc1110e16f1459606d6df7a8f61f0c" target="_blank">http://apne.ws/1TIdx87</a> </p><p><b>BUSINESSES COMPLAIN ABOUT WORKERS COMP COSTS -- &quot;Governor Rauner hears from Metro East business owners about financial hardships,&quot; by KMOV's Spencer Michelson:

</b>&quot;On the heels of findings that 70 percent of suburban drinking water systems recorded some levels of lead during testing over the past three years, Barrington Hills Republican state Rep. David McSweeney is calling for a full report on the safety of the state's water supplies by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. McSweeney filed a joint resolution this week requesting the state agency charged with monitoring public water systems compile a comprehensive report by the end of the year.

In an unusually restrained statement, Trump's campaign offered up short bios of the judges and described the list as one assembled 'first and foremost, based on constitutional principles, with input from highly respected conservatives and Republican Party leadership.'

</b>Strong prevailing wage laws are like a minimum wage for skilled construction workers. Because veterans work in construction at higher rates than non-veterans, prevailing wage laws enable hundreds of thousands of veterans to put their battle-tested leadership and problem solving skills to work building our communities while providing a good life for their families. Unfortunately, in the last two years, at least eleven states (including Illinois) have considered repealing or weakening their prevailing wage laws, which would hurt our economy and drive thousands of veterans out of their jobs and into poverty. Our nation's heroes deserve better from our elected officials. Stand with
 veterans and sign our petition for the strong prevailing wage laws that help our veterans and their families. - <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a5d277106e3f116ec68c697befb23293af8700f351c4c8985db55a30861c5721" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/24Kgd0c</a> **</p><p><b>READ more Illinois and Chicago news from</b> <b>POLITICO Illinois</b>: <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9805478cdf9e0a033829a4c58f41c64ee0187325f916dc7e06ef758112ef55eb" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1Ln6sIF </a><br> <br><b>SUBSCRIBE</b> to the Playbook family: <b>POLITICO Playbook:</b> <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=50897f0694713da8afa1e1f901f4943fe183f55cb8c5b90e702a022ba9cef795" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1phAeAC</a> ... <b>New York Playbook</b>:
