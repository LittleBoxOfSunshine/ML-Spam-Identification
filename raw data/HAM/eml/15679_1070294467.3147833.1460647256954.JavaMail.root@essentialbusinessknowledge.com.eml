PROGRAM SUMMARY
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that all areas of accounting within a compa=

** Policy and procedure documentation: Save time and ease compliance
** What to expect from DOL audits: How and when to prepare

EXPERT SPEAKER
Mark Schwartz has over 15 years experience in state and federal payroll tax=
 audits, collections, and payroll consulting.
** As an auditor, Mark prided himself on his ability to educate his auditee=
s on state and federal payroll tax requirements. Whatever issues he found i=
n audits, he ensured the auditee knew how to comply in the future. He worke=
d to minimize company disruptions in the audit process.
** In addition to his real-life experiences, Mark has a Masters in Business=
 Administration, and currently uses his entertaining and helpful personalit=
y to help organizations prepare for payroll tax audits - whether they've al=
ready got the notice or are still hoping they don't!
