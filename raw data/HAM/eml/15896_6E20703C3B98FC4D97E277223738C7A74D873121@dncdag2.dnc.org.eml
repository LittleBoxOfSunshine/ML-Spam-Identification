Excerpts of Remarks from DNC Chair Wasserman Schultz at the Florida Democra=
tic Party State Convention

Washington, DC- Tonight, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz will addre=
ss the Florida Democratic Party State Convention. Below you will find excer=
pts as prepared for delivery:

"No matter who our eventual nominee will be for the Democratic Party, we al=
l know that they will build on the accomplishments and legacy of President =
Barack Obama and Vice President Biden.

"We are the party of inclusion, empowerment, and opportunity for all."
...

"Across the aisle, the Republican's first three debates have shown us one t=
hing:

"The GOP and their candidates would rather drag America back to failed poli=
cies that contributed to the Great Recession rather than build the middle c=
lass.  They want to find a way to make the American Dream accessible to few=
er, not more Americans."
...

"Jeb Bush said he thought it was a good idea to ask women to wait 24 hours =
for an abortion, and Marco Rubio voted for a bill to do just that. As Linds=
ey Graham reminded us last week, Rubio doesn't support an abortion even in =
the case of rape or incest, something that puts him at odds with 80% of Ame=
ricans.

"Jeb thinks we should phase out Medicare, and Marco Rubio likes to talk a n=
ice game about not wanting to do anything that would harm his own mother an=
d her Medicare, but facts are a tricky thing:

"In fact Rubio's plan is to give seniors a voucher and tell them to go out =
and find coverage.

"It may sound familiar because he recycled this idea from Paul Ryan, and he=
 supported the Ryan budget plan that would have changed benefits to current=
 Medicare recipients and left nearly 3 out 4 seniors - here in Florida and =
all across the country - with higher out of pocket costs.

"Between that and his support for repealing the Affordable Care Act, which =
would likely re-open the donut hole, he is willing to put the economic and =
health security of millions of mothers at risk.

"While Governor, Jeb Bush significantly cut early voting hours here in Flor=
ida and has since sided with the Supreme Court's misguided decision to roll=
back key pieces of the Voting Rights Act.

"Not to be outdone, Marco Rubio has supported legislation limiting the numb=
er of early voting days and eliminating Sunday voting, while having the gal=
l to say 'what's the big deal' when it comes to voter ID laws.

"Senator, here's the big deal: you and your mentor have been wrong for Flor=
ida and would be wrong as President, and Florida Democrats are not going to=
 let you get away with it!

"Especially when you say you hate the job Floridians hired you to do, and y=
ou refuse to show up, we don't think you deserve a promotion.

"In fact when Rubio finally showed up to vote this week in the Senate, he v=
oted against a bipartisan budget agreement to avert a government default.

"In other words, not only is he not willing to do his job...when he does it=
, he actually votes for policies that could harm hardworking Americans! He'=
s just another politician playing games with our economy.

"I think everyone in this room agrees that the Sun Sentinel was right this =
week. If Mr. Rubio doesn't like serving the people of Florida, he should st=
op taking our money!

"It's up to us, Florida Democrats, to hold both Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush ac=
countable and make sure voters nationwide know about their records!

"The bottom line is we Democrats must be the truth squad for the American p=
ublic. We simply cannot let the Republicans get away with their distortions=
 and their outdated vision that would drag our country backward."
