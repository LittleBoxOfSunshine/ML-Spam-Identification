By Rachael Bade (Rbade@politico.com or @RachaelMBade) 

A DO-NOTHING CONGRESS? "Senate on pace for lightest work schedule in 60 years." Burgess Everett and Seung Min Kim on the election-year slog: "Senate Republicans have left town for another recess with their yearlong claim that the Senate is 'back to work' an increasingly tough sell to voters. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has worked painstakingly to craft an identity that's distinct from the raucous presidential contest - one built on stability and passage of legislation the Democrats couldn't get through when they controlled the Senate." 

"But the chamber is on pace to work the fewest days in 60 years, the party continues to insist it won't act on President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nomination, and Republicans' ballyhooed strategy to shepherd all dozen spending bills through the chamber is in serious trouble. The level of productivity isn't just about bragging rights: Senate Republicans are staking their push to maintain control of the chamber in November on a message that a do-nothing Senate is a thing of the past. Successfully prosecuting that case could become even more critical if Donald Trump, who many believe will be a drag on the GOP ticket, wins the nomination." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d5c7cb30274bad9199eaec8c1845edbef44f3714151ae63d232e5df27d50cf11 

Silver lining or wishful thinking? "Spending Gridlock Breathes Life Into Criminal Justice Effort." Will Dobbs-Allsopp at Morning Consult: "Senators are heading in to a weeklong recess with no clear way forward on the spending bills that constitute the annual government funding process. But there's a silver lining for a bipartisan group of senators: A long-awaited overhaul of the criminal justice system might have a chance at a Senate vote." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d5c7cb30274bad91fab199c02ad3475fc1b1479b99c18f40e87dda90f7899604 

ROTHENBERG: "Ryan Rides to the Rescue - But Not Until 2020." The latest Speaker Paul Ryan-W.H. bid theory comes from Roll Call's Stuart Rothenberg and looks like this: "If Republicans lose big in November, Ryan becomes de facto leader of the party and its top White House contender in four years." Full story: "I recently asked a veteran Republican strategist how his party picks up the pieces after what now looks to be a very difficult 2016 election. His answer was quick and decisive: Paul Ryan. If November's elections are as messy for the GOP as they now appear, with Republicans failing once again to win the White House and also losing their Senate majority, Ryan would almost certainly
 become his party's de facto leader - and that would offer him both opportunities and challenges after the election." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d5c7cb30274bad9188bac0e8e6ff4b3b36ee241ce734a6c5e787aa614c8c5fa3 

WELCOME TO RECESS. It's May 2, 2016, and thanks for reading Huddle. I'll be your host this week for an abridged tipsheet (at least in theory), given that Congress is out. Email me at: rbade@politico.com, or tweet me here @RachaelMBade

TODAY IN CONGRESS. Recess.

AROUND THE HILL. Staffers and reporters still recovering from Nerd Prom. (By the way: Someone please tell me why it's called Nerd Prom. Washington D.C.'s press corps is hardly nerdy... I hate this nickname!) 

MEANWHILE... PAST DUE: Per the AP: "Puerto Rico won't make $370 million in debt payments."

"SENATORS DON'T WANT VETO POWER OVER THE PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER." Karoun Demirjian for PowerPost: "House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) is expected to propose a measure to winnow the size of the White House's security apparatus and subject its chief to Senate confirmation when the annual defense authorization bill hits the floor later this month. Senate Republicans and Democrats are concerned about the size of the NSC staff and what they argue is the outsize clout wielded by the powerful team inside the White House. But neither they nor Senate Democrats want to change the way the national security adviser is picked." 

"'I've watched as the State Department and secretary of state is marginalized because he's out the building,' said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.)... 'But the confirmation issue,' Corker said, 'I have to think about, because in some ways you're elevating the position ... then you're creating a competing position to the secretary of state, so it has the opposite effect.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d5c7cb30274bad910c233c877306b3eb314c9487d498d7d7a6653184ff6797d0 

RIP - "Conrad Burns, former U.S. Senator of Montana, dies at 81." Christopher Mele and Daniel Victor with the N.Y. Times obit: "Conrad Burns, a former Montana livestock auctioneer with a penchant for speaking plainly who catapulted from county commissioner to United States senator, died on Thursday at his home in Billings, Mont. He was 81. His death was confirmed by Mark Baker, his former staff director and counsel in the Senate. Mr. Burns served three terms in the Senate, where he worked on telecommunications legislation, focusing on access in rural areas, and influenced policies on energy and federal land management."

"After serving just two years as a commissioner in Yellowstone County, he defeated an incumbent Democratic senator, John Melcher, in 1988. In 1994, Mr. Burns became the first Republican senator in Montana history to be re-elected. His ways might have been out of step with the traditional character of the Senate - The Billings Gazette noted that he would chew tobacco and occasionally pick his teeth with a pocketknife - but that did not stop him from assuming influential positions. He served on the Senate Appropriations Committee, where he helped funnel millions of dollars to Montana. As chairman of a communications subcommittee, he pushed for the installation of broadband in rural areas, new
 Internet and cellphone technologies and legislation to combat spam email." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d5c7cb30274bad91a8c1b89660410d7871e5c879d263e8956a4174107a061da5

GOP ESTABLISHMENT TURNS TABLES ON TEA PARTY IN INDIANA. Kevin Robillard for POLITICO previewing tomorrow's GOP primary from the heartland, Indiana: "Establishment Republicans are poised to rout the tea party in their biggest Senate showdown of 2016, a dramatic turn of the tables from both recent Senate history and this year's unpredictable presidential race. Just four years ago in Indiana, a shocking 20-point primary loss by six-term GOP Sen. Richard Lugar demonstrated just how far establishment control of the GOP had slipped. But this year, Rep. Todd Young has opened a lead in the state's Republican Senate primary behind a tsunami of establishment money and support - and the tea-party
 energy that took down Lugar has failed to materialize, despite the anti-establishment vigor of the presidential race."

"GOP Rep. Marlin Stutzman, Young's opponent, has won support from some of the same groups that backed Lugar challenger Richard Mourdock in Indiana in 2012. But neither the money nor the outrage that drove past tea-party campaigns has been there for Stutzman. Young and his supporters have outspent Stutzman 9-to-1 on TV. Senate Leadership Fund - a new super PAC run by allies of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell - has even attacked Stutzman, a first for a PAC in the Crossroads outside-group network, which has typically aired only positive ads in Republican Senate primaries." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d5c7cb30274bad9182a714627937329cfef586d26c8629a9243d347e0950a5a9 

REFLECTING - "EMILY's List Strategy Questioned After Big Losses." Alex Roarty for Roll Call: "Katie McGinty won Pennsylvania's Senate Democratic primary last week thanks in part to a major investment from EMILY's List, which spent nearly $2 million to help her overcome a difficult opponent. It was the only good news on an otherwise dreadful night for EMILY's List which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights - the group also lost a quartet of races that has Democratic strategists questioning if its political operation requires a strategic reassessment." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d5c7cb30274bad91651b7e63fdaa6a6d74b2938777f7fb4ac5968c58a2c2b581 

FRINGE PROPOSAL GAINING TRACTION: "Conservatives in Congress urge shutdown of tax-collecting IRS." Never mind that any honest tax expert will tell you this is unrealistic. Here's Susan Cornwell for Reuters: "It's a U.S. taxpayer's dream: make the Internal Revenue Service go away, and the largest conservative group in Congress is endorsing just that. The Republican Study Committee, which counts over two-thirds of House of Representatives Republicans as its members, called recently for 'the complete elimination of the IRS.' The committee's support for this idea, once confined to the fringes of conservative ideology, suggests it is more widely accepted on Capitol Hill than ever. But many in
 Washington, including some Republicans, have trouble taking it seriously." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d5c7cb30274bad9128d225f14ad5d1fc33e7f08508b68e625f3be8ac5e9c6b39
