DNC to ask Sanders, Clinton to denounce Nevada behavior<http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/280197-dnc-to-ask-sanders-clinton-to-denounce-nevada-behavior>

THE HILL // JONATHAN EASLEY

The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee on Tuesday said chaos on the floor of the Nevada State Democratic Party convention last weekend was "troublling." "We will be reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic Party in denouncing and taking steps to prevent the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas," Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), the DNC chairwoman, said in a statement. "Our democracy is undermined any time threats, intimidation, physical violence or damage to property are present. If there are legitimate concerns, they must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner." Bernie Sanders fell short to rival Hillary Clinton at the Nevada Democratic presidential caucuses in February. But his fervent base of supporters packed the state convention over the weekend in hopes of winning additional delegates for their candidate.

The Democratic National Committee has issued a statement expressing deep concern following violent protests and death threats against party officials by supporters of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders at the Nevada Democratic convention this weekend, calling details of a letter sent by the party's state chair "troubling." "We are deeply concerned about the troubling details laid out in the letter from the Nevada Democratic party," wrote party chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. "We will be reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic party in denouncing and taking steps to prevent the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas. Our democracy is undermined any time threats, intimidation, physical violence or damage to property are present. If there are legitimate concerns, they must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner."

The head of the Democratic Party on Tuesday denounced the violence and incivility that marred this past weekend's party gathering in Nevada and called on leaders to reject such actions. "Our democracy is undermined any time threats, intimidation, physical violence or damage to property are present," Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., chairman of the Democratic Party, said in a statement. "If there are legitimate concerns, they must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner." Chair throwing, shouted profanities and even later death threats to party leaders marked Saturday's party meeting. The Nevada Democratic Party send a letter to the Democratic National Committee accusing supporters of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of having a "penchant for extra-parliamentary behavior - indeed, actual violence - in place of democratic conduct in a convention setting." Responding to the letter, Wasserman Schultz said, "There is no excuse for what happened in Nevada, and it is incumbent upon all of us in positions of leadership to speak out."

Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the committee is calling on the campaigns of both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to denounce the behavior of Sanders supporters at the Nevada Democratic state convention over the weekend. "We are deeply concerned about the troubling details laid out in the letter from the Nevada Democratic Party," Wasserman Schultz said in the statement on Tuesday. "We will be reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic Party in denouncing and taking steps to prevent the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas. Our democracy is undermined any time threats, intimidation, physical violence or damage to property are present. If there are legitimate concerns, they must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner." The Nevada state convention descended into chaos over the weekend with Sanders supporters lashing out in frustration over the state party's process for allocating delegates. The state party on Monday sent a letter to the DNC's Rules and Bylaws Committee "regarding the conduct of Senator Bernie Sanders' supporters and representatives from his campaign at the party's 2016 State Convention in Las Vegas."



Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Nevada Chaos: Hillary, Sanders Camps Should Denounce Threats<http://www.mediaite.com/online/debbie-wasserman-schultz-on-nevada-chaos-hillary-sanders-camps-should-denounce-threats/>

MEDIATE // JOSH FELDMAN

The head of the DNC is now speaking out about the chaos this past weekend at the Nevada Democratic convention. Sanders supporters in Nevada went ballistic on Saturday over what they denounced as a rigged delegate system that kept them out and rewarded Hillary Clinton. The resulting scene was so chaotic the police had to be called in. There were scuffles, protesters were disruptive, a Democratic senator was booed, and there were threats made against state Democratic chair Roberta Lange. Yesterday the Nevada Democratic party warned the DNC that this could be a problem at the party's national convention because of what they describe as a violent streak amongst Sanders supporters.
