Weeks after blowing past the statutory deadline to enact a budget, Republic=
ans in Congress are lashing out.

There=92s no plan in sight for the GOP =96 and Republican Leaders are so ve=
xed by this budget debacle that their only idea is to scrap the Budget Comm=
ittee altogether.

Senator Mike Enzi, Chairman, Senate Budget Committee<http://www.budget.sena=
te.gov/republican/public/index.cfm/hearing-schedule?ID=3D06A2A784-1BCE-48E2=
-951A-01B9A9106B13>: =93=85I have volunteered to eliminate the Budget Commi=
ttee if it=92s irrelevant=94

Republicans are trying everything they can to get themselves off the hook f=
rom passing a budget.  But eliminating the Budget Committee won=92t get rid=
 of the problem at the heart of the Republican budget mess: GOP Leaders pro=
posed the most devastating =93Road to Ruin=94 budget in history, and even t=
hat wasn=92t extreme enough to satisfy the radical forces that have seized =
control of the Republican Congress.

Stan Collender =96 a budget expert and witness at the very same hearing whe=
re Chairman Enzi proposed axing the Budget Committee =96 took Republicans t=
o task<https://mninews.marketnews.com/content/us-senate-budget-chief-receiv=
es-scolding-budget-expert> for their attempts to distract the American peop=
le from the GOP=92s outright failure to pass a budget:

"I can't start my testimony with the standard line of commending the commit=
tee for holding this hearing," Collender began.

"How is it possible that the Senate Budget Committee that earlier this year=
 flatly refused to invite the director of the Office of Management and Budg=
et to testify and in so doing helped render the Obama 2017 budget irrelevan=
t, is now holding a hearing to discuss, in part, whether the president's bu=
dget is irrelevant and should be changed?" Collender said.

"How is it possible that the same Senate Budget Committee that so far has r=
efused to develop and vote on a budget resolution for the coming year is no=
w holding a hearing to fix the budget process it refuses to follow?," he co=
ntinued.

Twisting the knife further, Collender said the Senate Budget Committee hear=
ing was supplanting Leo Rosten's explanation of the word "chutzpah" with a =
new definition.

Collender said that Rosten defined chutzpah as when a man who is convicted =
of murdering his parents then begs for mercy from the court because he's an=
 orphan.

"Today this committee is the fiscal policy equivalent of that man. After fi=
rst preventing the budget process from being implemented, it is now demandi=
ng that the process be changed so the committee can implement it," he said.

Republicans in Congress: instead of throwing a tantrum over process, do you=
r job for the American people.  Republicans should join with Democrats to c=
raft a budget that invests in the future and protects the security of hard-=
working American families.
