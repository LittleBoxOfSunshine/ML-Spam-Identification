SL: Trump vs. Trump on Releasing his Tax Returns

Every major presidential candidate since 1976 has made their returns public=
 and, until recently, Donald Trump agreed with that forty-year precedent.  =
When he first considered running for President in 1999, he said, =93I proba=
bly wouldn=92t have a problemwith=94 releasing my tax returns if I ran.=94 =
In 2012 he said if you=92re running for President, =93at a minimum,probably=
, you=92re going to have to show your tax returns=94you probably had to sho=

on year.

But, now Trump won=92t hold himself to those standards. His refusal to rele=
ase his own tax returns raises questions about what he=92s hiding. Below is=
 an abridged timeline of Trump's shifting positions over the years.
