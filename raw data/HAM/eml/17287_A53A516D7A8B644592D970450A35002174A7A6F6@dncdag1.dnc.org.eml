Thanks for the update.  You should make sure your contact on the Hillary campaign knows your responsible for this contribution.  They are putting together convention packages similar to ours and since this is a HVF contribution you should make sure you get full credit with them and it gets counted towards convention.

Hi Erik,

Liz wrote a $200,000K check to HVF for her and Caitlin to go to a private dinner that I arranged for her to attend with Hillary at the home of Eileen Donahoe. It is this Wednesday, May 25th.  Can you please be sure that I get the credit!! I am the person who invited her and collected the check:)!

Thanks,

Elspeth
