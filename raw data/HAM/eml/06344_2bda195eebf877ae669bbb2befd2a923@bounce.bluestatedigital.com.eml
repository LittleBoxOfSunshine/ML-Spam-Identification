			The Flint water crisis is now two years old =E2=80=94 and the water stil=
l isn=E2=80=99t safe to drink. There have been civil and criminal investiga=
tions, two congressional hearings and extensive reporting, particularly dur=
ing the presidential primary in Michigan. Gov. Rick Snyder appointed a spec=
ial task force. Yet only 33 pipes =E2=80=94 3 of every thousand =E2=80=94 h=
ave been replaced.</p>
		<p>
			The Obama administration=E2=80=99s limited declaration of emergency was =
extended for four more months in April, but the administration made it clea=
r no further extensions will be granted. State emergency resources will end=
 at the same time. Residents still depend on bottled water and filters, and=
 they won=E2=80=99t be supplied beyond August. Now residents are not only s=
uffering from the lead poisoning but from depression and anxiety driven by =
an agony that it seems will never end.</p>
		<p>
			Melissa Mays, one of the mothers who forced the exposure of the poisoned=
 water, appeared on my radio show last week. She is sick and tired of being=
 sick and tired.</p>
		<p>
			At a demonstration protesting the two-year anniversary of the crisis, sh=
e said, =E2=80=9CFlint wasn=E2=80=99t a community that was =E2=80=98worth g=
oing out on a limb for.=E2=80=99</p>
		<p>
			=E2=80=9CSo, our job is to prove them wrong. Our job is to show them we =
are not going sit down and take this anymore. And you know what, I have bee=
n peaceful. I have tried to fight this in the courts, in the labs doing all=
 the things to prove that the water was poisoned. We got that proof. The wa=
ter is poisoned. And two years later, it is getting worse.</p>
		<p>
			=E2=80=9CI watched my 13-year-old son damn near pass out today from bloo=
d tests looking for bacteria and immune disorders. He=E2=80=99s 13. So, I a=
m reaching my breaking point. I=E2=80=99m tired of being peaceful. I=E2=80=
=99m tired of being nice. They=E2=80=99re not listening.=E2=80=9D</p>
		<p>
			The city has gone back on water drawn from Lake Huron, as opposed to the=
 toxic Flint River. But in mid-April, Professor Marc Edwards and the Flint =
Water Study team at Virginia Tech, the courageous team that helped expose t=
he poisoning, reported that new testing shows Flint=E2=80=99s water remains=
 unsafe to drink.</p>
		<p>
			The Flint crisis has led to the exposure of leaded water and aged pipes =
in other communities in America. But it is clear that Flint paid the price =
of being poor and largely black.</p>
		<p>
			The governor=E2=80=99s own task force concluded: =E2=80=9CFlint resident=
s, who are majority Black or African American and among the most impoverish=
ed of any metropolitan area in the United States, did not enjoy the same de=
gree of protection from environmental and health hazards as that provided t=
o other communities. Moreover, by virtue of their being subject to emergenc=
y management, Flint residents were not provided equal access to, and meanin=
gful involvement in, the government decision-making process.=E2=80=9D Now t=
he Michigan Civil Rights Commission is holding its first hearings on the ro=
le that discrimination played in the crisis. Some indictments have come dow=
n, but the problem isn=E2=80=99t being solved.</p>
		<p>
			Gov. Snyder couldn=E2=80=99t find funds in the state to replace the lead=
 pipes exposed by the toxic water. Yet he=E2=80=99s allocated $1.2 million =
of state funds to pay private attorneys for his criminal defense fund.</p>
		<p>
			The residents want action. They need an emergency program to replace the=
 lead pipes. They want an end to the state appointed emergency manager syst=
em. It was an unelected emergency manager, with no accountability to the re=
sidents of the city, who made the decision to use the toxic Flint River wat=
er. And they want Medicare coverage for all those impacted by the poisoning=
.</p>
		<p>
			The latter is not unprecedented. Residents of Libby, Mont., benefitted f=
rom a special provision put into law by Sen. Max Baucus that provides full =
Medicare coverage for every person who was exposed to asbestos poisoning fr=
om the mine owned by W.R. Grace &amp; Co. that left hundreds dead and many =
more sick. The same should be done for the victimized residents of Flint.</=
p>
		<p>
			This country continues to squander billions on failed =E2=80=9Cnation bu=
ilding=E2=80=9D efforts on the other side of the world. We wasted over $2 t=
rillion on the debacle in Iraq that has helped destabilize the greater Midd=
le East. As Flint has revealed, we will face spreading calamities from obso=
lete water systems, dangerous bridges, crumbling roads, dated and insuffici=
ent mass transit. It is time we stop pretending we can police the world and=
 start rebuilding our country here at home.</p>
