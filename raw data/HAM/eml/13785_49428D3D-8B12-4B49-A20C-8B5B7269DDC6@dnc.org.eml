TOPLINE:

This is an opportunity to start the day=92s news cycle with a hit that atta=
cks Trump and talk about how we proud we are of our campaigns, all in the g=
eneral context of the Indiana Primary. We will want to help frame our messa=
ging with respect to where we are as a party and also where we see a contra=
st with the GOP candidates as we head into November. We want to tell them h=
ow to look at the race in the coming months.





TALKING POINTS:



Topline Message:


Last week in five states we saw Democrats voting with enthusiasm for the ca=
ndidate they like most =96 and Republicans holding their noses and casting =
their votes for the candidate they dislike least.



In Pennsylvania, exit polling showed that 71 percent of Democratic voters f=
elt their primary had energized the party while 58 percent of Republican vo=
ters said their primary had divided the party. That=92s what we saw in New =
York, where just 39% of Republicans thought their campaign has energized th=
eir party while in Wisconsin 4 out of 10 Republican primary voters said the=
y fear what a Trump presidency would do to our country. And roughly a third=
 would rather stay home, vote for a third party, or vote for a Democrat tha=
n support either Trump or Cruz.



That=92s stunning, but it tells you that Democrats are heading into Novembe=
r in a far stronger position than Republicans.

On the other side, it=92s hard to pick what=92s been a stranger story the p=
ast week -- Trump changing his mind on whether to act Presidential, or Ted =
Cruz teaming up with Carly Fiorina in a last ditch =96 and inevitably unsuc=
cessful =96 effort to stop Trump.



Trump is gaining momentum.



=95      He reached over 50% in last week=92s five contests, even hitting 6=
0% in two of those (Delaware and Rhode Island).



=95      And, heading into tomorrow=92s primary in Indiana, it=92s clear th=
at Trump is close to wrapping up the GOP nomination. According to the lates=
t NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Trump leads in Indiana by 15 points [T=
rump 49%, Cruz 34%, Kasich 13%]. This is despite Cruz=92s superior campaign=
 infrastructure in the state.



Republicans are going to have to come to terms with Trump being their nomin=
ee and what that means. Just yesterday former Secretary of Defense Robert G=
ates, who served under both a Republican and Democratic Administration, sai=
d that he=92s troubled by the fact that Donald Trump doesn=92t listen to an=
yone, and raised serious questions about Trump on foreign policy. Between h=
is contradictions and threatening our most important alliances, it=92s clea=
r Dangerous Donald lacks the judgment and temperament to serve as our next =
Commander in Chief.

For years, GOP leaders have pushed a cynical and feckless political strateg=
y that exploits unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LG=
BT community and more, all for political gain. They have sold hardworking A=
mericans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while strangling Ame=
rica=92s middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich tho=
se already at the top. Donald Trump=92s impending nomination after Tuesday=
=92s results is the ultimate, sad culmination of the success of that strate=
gy. Trump is the modern Republican Party.



It=92s clear that when we get through our conventions, Democrats will emerg=
e united having nominated the next president, while the GOP will have to wa=
llow in the chaotic mess of their own making.

Sanders Comments Yesterday About a Contested Convention / Arizona Lawsuit



We=92re going to be united at our convention, and we=92re confident in our =
process, which was in place well before we knew who would run this cycle an=
d which has been fair to all of our candidates.



It=92s not our job to handicap the race, our candidates will determine the =
future of their own campaigns. Both Senator Clinton and Senator Sanders hav=
e been clear they=92ll work hard in November to ensure we don=92t let a Rep=
ublican like Trump or Cruz drag our country backward. So I=92m confident we=
=92ll be united.



We=92ve cautioned our candidates to maintain a tone that helps us build tow=
ard the general election, recognizing that as we funnel down the home stret=
ch of any campaign the intensity level will rise.



Ultimately, Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders are drawing sharp differe=
nces with one another, but their differences remain focused on how to best =
move America forward.



They=92re focused on how to make sure our government reflects the values of=
 the American people, that we have an economy and a democracy that are incl=
usive, and that we respect everyone in America.



If you want to talk about a rigged process, we=92re doing that too. The Dem=
ocratic National Committee and our Senatorial Campaign Committee are suing =
officials in Arizona whose decisions led to voters having to wait for hours=
 to vote during their March primaries, and many to be disenfranchised as a =
result. We want to make sure that doesn=92t happen in November.



If you want to talk about rigging elections, that=92s the real example, and=
 it=92s a serious problem and we=92re glad both our candidates have express=
ed interest addressing attempts to make it harder for the American people t=
o vote.



=95      In Maricopa County, officials reduced the number of polling locati=
ons to just 1 for every 21,000 people. That=92s seven times what it was in =
other parts of the state, and it shows you the magnitude of the efforts to =
make it harder to vote that Republicans are championing all across the coun=
try.



=95      And it=92s not just Arizona, you had a member of Congress from Wis=
consin, Glenn Grothman, who flat out said that they expected they could now=
 win Wisconsin because of the Voter ID law. It was his Kevin McCarthy momen=
t, and the type of rigging of the system we=92re not going to put up with.



When voters go to the polls in November, they can be certain that the Democ=
ratic nominee will have the temperament and judgment to serve as commander =
in chief, and that's not something you can say about the Republican candida=
tes.



Joint Fundraising Committees

We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the DNC and=
 state parties, which is why stood up similar agreements for joint victory =
funds with both the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign early in the =
cycle.

The DNC is the only entity that will be able to closely coordinate with our=
 eventual nominee, and we took these important steps because of the urgency=
 to build a strong national infrastructure NOW that will help elect Democra=
ts up and down the ballot in November.

It=92s important to note, the funds that the DNC and state parties get thro=
ugh the joint victory funds help strengthen, for example, our national vote=
r file and communications, research and digital support for state parties a=
nd down ballot candidates. That includes training across a variety of areas=
, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid response support. T=
his is helping us build infrastructure for the general election.

These arrangements are not new or unusual. Similar joint fundraising commit=
tees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 2008 and 2012. =
And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint=
 victory funds.

***The DNC remains committed to our state parties. Since 2009, the DNC has =
sent $24.5 million to the states for the State Partnership Program and $170=
 million to states for all purposes.***

And let=92s be clear, neither the DNC nor state parties are subsidizing fun=
draising through these committees for either campaign. For whatever each ca=
mpaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign, that ca=
mpaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundraising=
.

Sanders/DNC Lawsuit



=95      We are glad that this issue has been resolved and look forward to =
continuing to work with both campaigns to facilitate a successful primary c=
ampaign process.



=95       Background on Resolution: The forensic analysis conducted by the =
cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike confirmed that the DNC=92s initial findings,=
 which were the basis of the temporary shutdown in December, were accurate.=
 The audit confirmed that one campaign gained unauthorized access to the da=
ta of another, and the audit further confirmed that the results of those se=
arches were saved within the system and that data was exported. Following t=
he conclusion of the audit that confirmed the DNC's original findings, the =
Sanders campaign withdrew its lawsuit.





Chaos in Cleveland vs Our Next President in Philadelphia

We=92re less than 100 days from the July conventions, and it=92s clear that=
 Democrats will emerge united, while Republicans are embroiled in drama bet=
ter suited for a reality show than a contest for the presidency.



=95      Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are dedicated to supportin=
g the eventual Democratic nominee.



=95      Last week, Senator Sanders said at a town hall on MSNBC that he wi=
ll do everything in his power to make sure no Republican gets into the Whit=
e House in November.



=95      And Secretary Clinton has been clear about her commitment to unify=
ing the party and the need to build on the progress we=92ve made under Demo=
cratic leadership over the last 7 years.



Because the Party=92s platform is a statement of our values, the DNC is com=
mitted to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both of our campai=
gns will be represented on the Platform Drafting Committee, and just as we =
did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate.



Democrats know that we=92re stronger when more voices are heard, and when w=
e stand together to move our country forward, we=92ll see that in Philadelp=
hia at our convention.



Compare that to the Republicans.


Last week, the increasingly desperate Cruz and Kasich campaigns forged an u=
nusual alliance to stop Trump, but it barely lasted as long as the announce=
ment that it was happening.



A majority of Trump supporters said they would abandon the Republican Party=
 if he loses the nomination and runs as a third-party candidate.



Even Republican leaders are afraid of going near their radioactive conventi=
on. You=92ve already seen Republican candidates in tight races, like Senato=
r Kirk in Illinois and John McCain =96 the GOP nominee eight years ago =96 =
say they will not attend their own convention in Cleveland. But don=92t let=
 them fool you, they=92re not any better than the top of their ticket.



Clinton=92s Speeches and Sanders=92 Taxes



Our job at the Party isn=92t to handicap our own primary, we=92re not going=
 to referee.



There are real differences, but they=92re with the Republicans, and while y=
ou have to expect that the candidates are going to draw sharp differences, =
they=92re also highlighting what a much better option voters have with Demo=
crats.



Just look at the issue of taxes as millions of Americans filed last week, b=
ut most of them didn=92t get to take advantage of special loopholes or get =
special breaks. Yet every single Republican plan for the economy is based o=
n tax cuts for those at the very top of the income scale. It=92s exactly th=
e economic policy that the Bush Administration had as they drove us toward =
the great recession.



So ultimately those are the differences that will matter most in November.



GOP Frontrunner Trump is Reckless and Dangerous



=95      The Economy: Trump=92s unfounded predictions of recession and warn=
ings against investing in the stock market are reckless, and economists hav=
e already predicted his policies could start an international trade war and=
 cause a global recession.



=95      Foreign Policy: Trump=92s threat to pull back from our most import=
ant military alliances in NATO sends a dangerous message, which is particul=
arly troubling in light of his past praise of Russian President Vladimir Pu=
tin.



=95      Nuclear Proliferation: Trump has refused to say he wouldn=92t use =
nuclear weapons on European territory, then suggested South Korea and Japan=
 should either develop nuclear weapons or pay the United States for protect=
ion against North Korea.



=95      On abortion: Trump has taken multiple positions on abortion - from=
 a dangerous and offensive call to punish women who get an abortion, to say=
ing he would allow states to restrict women=92s rights, to saying abortion =
laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial appointments.



Cruz



The vast majority of his Republican colleagues can barely muster a straight=
 face to say anything nice or positive about him!



=95      Lindsey Graham crassly talked about how no one in the Senate would=
 object if he was killed on the Senate floor, and said that endorsing him o=
ver Trump was the equivalent of choosing to get poisoned over being shot.



=95      Senator Jim Risch of Idaho =96 TWICE =96 gave one of the most pass=
ive, non-endorsement endorsements I=92ve ever seen.


It=92s going to be very difficult for Senators and Congress members to run =
alongside a presidential nominee they really don=92t like!



The GOP=92s Problem with Women Voters



=95      Trump is viewed unfavorably by 7 out of 10 women, but both of his =
primary opponents would also alienate women voters with their policies as t=
he nominee.

=95
Kasich said that he wants to see Roe v. Wade repealed, and when asked what =
kind of punishment that would lead to, he evaded the question by saying tha=
t it should be left to the states.



=95      Cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped, she should=
 be forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to term.



=95      In the past, the Republican candidates have opposed equal pay, fam=
ily leave, and voted against the Violence Against Women Act.

Earlier this month we marked Equal Pay Day, the day in 2016 when women=92s =
earnings have caught up with men=92s earnings from 2015. On average we earn=
 79 cents to their dollar, and it=92s worse for women of color. All of the =
Republican presidential candidates would stand against protections that ens=
ure greater equality in the workplace.



=95      John Kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we don=
=92t need workplace protections, just a =91change of heart=92 among major e=
mployers.

=95
Ted Cruz voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act three times and ridiculed =
the legislation as a =91show vote.=92

Donald Trump stated that women would have pay equity if we did =91as good a=
 job=92 as men.



Republicans to Blame for Trump and His Down Ballot Impact



It=92s fitting that Donald Trump is the standard-bearer of a party that has=
 relied on divisive politics and scapegoating for electoral gain for so lon=
g. Since 2004 they=92ve used gay marriage as a wedge issue, demonized immig=
rants and stoked fears about border security. They=92ve given birthers like=
 Trump a pass, and fueled the Tea Party with lies about a total government =
takeover of healthcare and the economy. Then while in office, the only thin=
g Republicans have done in Washington over the last seven years is obstruct=
. Trump IS the Republican Party.



Advantage, Democrats



Despite all the media attention that Republican frontrunner Trump gets with=
 his say-anything strategy, Democrats are winning where it matters.



Senator Clinton has earned more than 10 million votes =96 Over a million mo=
re than Donald Trump =96 while Senator Sanders has  earned more than 8 mill=
ion votes (well ahead of Ted Cruz and John Kasich), while also garnering mo=
re than seven million individual campaign contributions from low dollar don=
ors. If there is an enthusiasm gap, it clearly favors Democrats.



Overall fundraising shows a Democratic edge, with Democrats raising a total=
 of $72.1 million in February and 67.5 million in March, eclipsing Republic=
ans=92 fundraising, which amounted to less than $12 million for Cruz, $6 mi=
llion for Trump, and just $3.4 million for Kasich in February.



And while Trump continues to claim that he is self-funding his campaign, hi=
s latest report with the FEC shows that he has loaned his campaign $24 mill=
ion throughout this election cycle, while he raising just $34 million from =
outside contributors and loans for the entire cycle.



Democrats will have the strongest candidate in November. Period. And we are=
 poised to take back the Senate and make serious gains in the House.



Broad Contrast and Infrastructure



We have been building an infrastructure and operation that will work regard=
less of who the Republicans nominate. We see the numbers of course; it=92s =
clear Trump is far ahead of his competitors, and we=92re ready for him if h=
e makes it through what is shaping up to be a train wreck of a convention.



But we don=92t think taking on Trump is fundamentally different from any of=
 the others.



At least with Trump, he=92s not shy about exposing what the Republican bran=
d has truly become. Ted Cruz and John Kasich are every bit as extreme as th=
eir party=92s front-runner, they just hide it a bit better.



They promise the same extreme agenda on women=92s rights, they deny the thr=
eat of climate change, and they oppose fixing a broken immigration system w=
ith a path to citizenship.



They all want to drag America back to the failed economic policies of the l=
ast Republican president who left office losing 800,000 jobs a month and ha=
ving plunged our country into the Great Recession.

And they=92ve all been just as offensive in their rhetoric, using language =
that alienates our allies, helps ISIS recruit terrorists, and makes America=
 less safe.

So if it is Trump, we=92re ready. Maybe it=92s Cruz, but it=92s hard to see=
 how that comes together in the end. But regardless we=92re building a grou=
nd game and an infrastructure that=92s ready to challenge him on every sing=
le position he=92s taking on the campaign trail, and that holds him account=
able for what those positions would actually mean for the American people.
