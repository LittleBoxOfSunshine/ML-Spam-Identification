To everyone,
Not sending this out for anyone to donate. Please read. All I'm asking is th=
at if you are at all concerned about the exponential escalation of the insan=
ity of gun violence in our country and the nra's control of those in congres=
s weakening our already lax gun legislation, please, think real hard before y=
ou cast your vote in the fall. Do you want your children or their classmates=
 ' carrying' to school?!!! What have we become?
Thank you for reading.

<p>Donald Trump likes to talk a lot about poll numbers. But here are a coup=
le he may have missed: 90 percent of Americans support background checks fo=
r all gun sales, along with 82 percent of gun owners and 74 per cent of NRA=
 members.=20

</p>

<p>Americans know how to Make America Safe Again. And the simple truth is t=
hat if more guns in more places made us safer, we'd be the safest country i=
n the world. Instead, we are 25 times more likely to be murdered with a gun=
 than people in other developed countries. That's why we are launching a ca=
mpaign to hold Trump and any candidate who promotes dangerous, gun lobby po=
licies accountable by:

</p>

<p></p><ul><li>Tracking and exposing radical gun statements by candidates t=
o the press</li>
	<li>Organizing Moms and volunteers to attend rallies and townhalls and ask=
 candidates tough questions on guns</li>
	<li>Educating voters about candidates' positions on gun violence preventio=
n</li></ul><p></p>


<p>This election, we can prove that pandering to the gun lobby is a liabili=
ty. <a href=3D"https://act.everytown.org/donate/shut-down-trump-NRA/?source=
