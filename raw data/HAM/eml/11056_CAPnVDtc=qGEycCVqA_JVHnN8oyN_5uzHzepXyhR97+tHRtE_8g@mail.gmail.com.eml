Wondering if there's a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that
Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess.

Specifically, DWS had to call Bernie directly in order to get the campaign
to do things because they'd either ignored or forgotten to
something critical.

She had to call Bernie after the data breach to make his staff to respond
to our concerns. Even then they didn't get back to us, which is why we had
to shut off their access in order to get them to finally let us know
exactly how they snooped around HFA's data.

Same was true with the standing committee appointments. They never got back
to us with their names (HFA and even O'Malley got there's in six weeks
earlier) for the committees. So, again, the chair had to call Bernie
personally for his staff to finally get us critical information. So, they
gave us an awful list just a few days before we had to make the
announcements.

It's not a DNC conspiracy, it's because they never had their act together.
