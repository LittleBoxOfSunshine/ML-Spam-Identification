FACT CHECK: John Kasich=92s Budget Reality: Taxpayers, Local Communities, P=
ublic Education Have All Borne the Brunt While The Top 5% Benefited



John Kasich=92s budget cuts have starved local governments, threatened serv=
ices and created an urgent need for local municipalities to raise taxes. Th=
e burden of financing libraries, school districts, parks and social service=
s shifted to local taxpayers, including middle class and lower income famil=
ies =96 while Kasich cut taxes for wealthy households. Police and firefight=
ers expressed concern that Kasich=92s pursuit of cuts could put Ohioan=92s =
safety at risk.



Kasich has gutted Ohio=92s public education system =96 slashing $1.8 billio=
n from Ohio=92s public schools while at the same time funneling hundreds of=
 millions of tax dollars to private charter schools.



Kasich cut $400 million in taxes in 2014. Half that amount was directed to =
the top 5% of households. As for the other half, they got the scraps. The b=
ottom 20% of Ohioans saw an average tax cut of just $4.  Earlier this year,=
 Kasich proposed a budget that would have increased taxes for 60% of Ohioan=
s but shifted the tax system =93further in favor of wealthier Ohioans.=94 I=
t=92s clear Kasich does not look out for the middle class.

Columbus Dispatch: Kasich=92s Cuts In State Aid =93Threaten[ed] Services At=
 The Local Level And Create[d] An Urgent Need For Cash From Local Tax Reven=
ues.=94 =93All across Ohio, cuts in state aid have pushed hundreds of local=
 governments, schools and libraries to ask voters for more money. Although =
Gov. John Kasich and GOP legislative leaders frequently boast of closing a =
massive budget shortfall without raising taxes, it hasn=92t taken long for =
the cuts =96 compounded by those from earlier years =96 to threaten service=
s at the local level and create an urgent need for cash from local tax reve=

Under Kasich, The Burden Of Financing Service Agencies, Libraries, And Scho=
ol Districts Has Shifted From The State To Local Taxpayers. =93Restraining =
the growth of government, another watchword for Kasich, has translated into=
 less state support for service agencies, parks, libraries and, as some sch=
ool districts will attest, education. The burden of financing them has shif=
ted from the state to local taxpayers, who find themselves being asked to s=
upport tax levies. Again, the governor's rhetoric seems at odds with realit=
y.=94 [Editorial, Twinsburg Bulletin, 3/4/15<http://www.twinsburgbulletin.c=

Kasich Oversaw A Nearly 50% Cut To Ohio=92s Local Government Fund. =93Nearl=
y 50 percent of Ohio's Local Government Fund has been cut in the past three=
 years, leaving many local governments seeking replacements for funding the=
y had come to count on. The Muskingum County and Zanesville governments fel=
t the cuts just as harshly as other areas but appear to be taking the loss =
in stride through increases in alternative revenue sources and departmental=
 decreases. Despite the reduction, instituted by the administration of Gov.=
 John Kasich between 2010 and 2013, Muskingum County's revenue increased by=
 about $1.2 million, following in the footsteps of most of the state's othe=
r counties.=94 [Zanesville Times-Recorder, 9/7/14<http://www.zanesvilletime=
