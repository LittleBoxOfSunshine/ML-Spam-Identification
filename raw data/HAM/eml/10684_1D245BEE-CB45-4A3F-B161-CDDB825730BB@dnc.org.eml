> The Costa Report is a post-partisan human affairs show with an audience of over 2 million people with over 250,000 followers on social media.
> 
> I am pitching this to you because Rebecca Costa is interested in doing an interview with Congresswoman Wasserman-Schultz that isn't particularly partisan or political in nature but to appeal to our higher angels as Americans in terms of our love for civic duty and commitment to public service.

> You can hear recordings of past work here: http://www.rebeccacosta.com/the-costa-report.htm  You will see that we have had on major players on before.
> 
> I have May 12 open right now, which is right before the California primary. It would be an opportune time for her to be on and reach out to a talk radio audience that would open to another perspective on the Congresswoman's life and career.
