x years thinking up: =93An Old Idea That Doesn=92t Work,=94 according to Th=

eplacement_us_57222c59e4b01a5ebde4b236>.

Paul Ryan=92s Big Plan To Replace Obamacare Is An Old Idea That Doesn=92t W=
ork<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-obamacare-replacement_us_=
57222c59e4b01a5ebde4b236>
It took him six years to come up with a policy invented in the 1970s.

If you were hoping Republicans had fresh new solutions for health care refo=
rm up their sleeves, you might find the recent hints from House Speaker Pau=
l Ryan (R-Wis.) a bit disappointing.

After six years of the GOP failing to come up with a comprehensive alternat=
ive to the Affordable Care Act, what Ryan outlined during an appearance at =
Georgetown University on Wednesday was essentially another stab at a decade=
s-old idea that=92s never really worked =97 an idea that would involve allo=
wing health insurance companies to resume charging sick people higher rates=
 than healthy people.

The cornerstone of Ryan=92s approach is so-called high-risk pools, a form o=
f health insurance designed for people with the most serious health conditi=
ons and highest costs, who were mostly locked out of the regular private ma=
rket before the Affordable Care Act required insurers to accept all applica=
nts.

If the concept sounds familiar, it=92s because high-risk pools have existed=
 since 1976, and are a go-to policy proposal for Republicans who don=92t wa=
nt to be accused of not caring about people with pre-existing conditions=85=
The problem is, high-risk pools =97 which existed in 35 states before the A=
ffordable Care Act made them virtually obsolete =97 always failed to achiev=
e their goal of providing a true insurer of last resort to those who needed=
 it=85

=85This was part of Ryan=92s argument to the college-aged audience that let=
ting insurance companies once again discriminate against the sick, and movi=
ng the most ailing into a separate program, would be good for them. Young p=
eople would pay lower health insurance premiums if older, sicker people wer=
e in a separate program, he said.

But that doesn=92t account for the cost to taxpayers of whatever government=
 subsidies would be provided to people in the high-risk pools=85

Earlier in his appearance at Georgetown, Ryan repeated his promise that Rep=
ublicans would finally tell Americans how they would do health care reform =
differently=85Ryan didn=92t offer a lot of fine detail in his four-minute r=
eply to the student=92s question. Republicans will supposedly unveil a heal=
th care plan this summer, and maybe it will address the shortcomings appare=
nt in what Ryan did say this week. For now, though, his plan sounds like it=
 won=92t be as good for people with pre-existing conditions as what they al=
ready have under Obamacare.

Old ideas that don=92t work: That=92s all we=92ve seen from Speaker Ryan du=
ring his =93Year of Ideas.=94

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, a milestone 20 million previously uninsu=
red Americans now have quality, affordable health insurance.  Here=92s a ne=
w idea for Speaker Ryan and House Republicans: wake up to the truth of the =
ACA=92s success, and join with Democrats to build on the monumental progres=
s we=92ve made toward a healthier, stronger America.
