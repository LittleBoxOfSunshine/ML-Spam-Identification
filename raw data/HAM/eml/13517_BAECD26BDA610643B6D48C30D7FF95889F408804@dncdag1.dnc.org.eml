Thanks Collin! McCain on Trump:

Host: why would you support Donald Trump? He has said many derogatory things about you.
McCain: I've always said I would support the nominee. 4 years of HRC would disastrous for national security. Will work with whoever the next president to keep country safe.
Host: I would have thought you would have been the person to speak out against Trump.
McCain: Have seen 8 years of Obama. Can't have a 4 more years of that.
Host: Are you comfortable w/ talking to Putin, the Chinese?
McCain: I'm not comfortable with a lot of the things he has done. Will work with colleagues to keep country safe. But can you get my colleagues thoughts? They have come a long way to be here.

Not a lot from Cotton but interesting comments from McCain. When asked by the host about supporting Trump, all 3 said they would support the republican nominee.

McCain was ask about how comfortable he was with Trump talking to Putin and the Chinese. McCain said he was not comfortable with many things Trump has said and done and then pivoted

Dan Sullivan said the Obama administration had the worst economic record of any administration in the past 70 years

Finally McCain had an interesting Re: the politico recording of him

Host: how comfortable w/ you all w/ Trump as nominee.
Sullivan: Agree w/McCain. In 2014 country elected 25 new GOP senators, many of whom are coming to support McCain-
Host: -But-
Sullivan: I mention that b/c there is focus on the white house but regardless of who wins, we have to keep the Senate in GOP hands.
Host: But how do you do that in a state like AZ, which has a lot of Hispanics and we know what Trump has said about Hispanics, and get Sen. McCain reelected?
Sullivan: a number of things that Trump has said and done, rhetoric and policies on national security and the like that I don't agree w/. but looking at the choice between someone w/out fully formed ideas or someone who would continue Obama's presidency. Obama admin has worst economic record in 70 years. That is what has given rise to Trump and Sanders. Administration has never hit 3% GDP growth in one quarter. If HRC, its more of the same.

Host: we are up against a break, but all 3 willing to say you are supporting Donald Trump?
(3 seconds silence)
Sullivan: I have had disagreements w/rhetoric and policy but I plan on supporting the republican nominee.
Host: Senator Cotton?
Cotton: I have said that I would support the republican nominee b/c we cannot afford a 3rd Obama/Clinton term. Trump has responsibility to unite the party which is something I hope he does in the coming days.
Host: Senator McCain you are supporting Trump but are you endorsing Trump?
McCain: I am supporting the nominee of the party.
Host: Is there a difference between supporting and endorsing?
McCain: Not clear, I'll have to get out a dictionary but I am saying I will support the Republican nominee.

Host: Endorsement means you have bumper stickers you can hand out.

...

(McCain talking about death of Navy SEAL Charlie Keating, shameful it is that Obama admin won't call it a combat death)

Cotton: My heart breaks when we get reports of a death in action. Its appalling that president and senior advisors that they won't call it what it is. That's why its important to return McCain to the Senate. He understands better than most the sacrifices that country's sons and daughters make. He is a great leader

(Sullivan talks up McCain...)

Host: RE politico report. Does having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket make it difficult for your reelection?
McCain: Entirely possible. But for context, I have always take races seriously. My advantage is that people in AZ know me and people will vote based on that. I feel confident.
Host: What does it say about GOP establishment that you, Romney, GHW Bush, W Bush, are not going to convention?
McCain: I am not going b/c I have a campaign.
Host: does that send a bad signal though?
McCain: I don't think its highest on people's mind.
Host: But in previous years you have gone to the convention so what is different this time?
McCain: This is going to be a tough campaign. It conflicts too much now. I enjoying campaigning.
