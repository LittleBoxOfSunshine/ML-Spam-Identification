The Democratic Party

Luis --

This morning, the GOP's presumptive nominee for president,=20
Donald Trump, met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell=20
and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. McConnell has already=20
fallen in line and committed to supporting Trump as his party's=20
nominee, but according to Ryan this meeting was about "getting=20
ourselves on the same page as a party."=20

Well, I hate to break it to Speaker Ryan, but the Republican Party=20
has been on the same page as Donald Trump for a while:

up fears about immigrants and minority groups, Donald Trump has=20
been one of the loudest voices in the GOP for a long time.=20

Now it's up to us to make sure that's clear to the American people.
