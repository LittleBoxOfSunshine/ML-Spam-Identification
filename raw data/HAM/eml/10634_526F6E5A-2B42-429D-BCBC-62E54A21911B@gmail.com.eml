This is an updated version of the story from when it posted last night. Long=
abaugh's comment about being well represented on all the committees wasn't i=
n that version. It should also include that each candidate will get their pr=
oportion of the remaining 167 members of the committee. The Chair's At-Large=
 appointments are only 25 on each committee.=20

>=20

=9D
>=20
> Amid his unexpectedly strong showing in the Democratic primaries, Mr. Sand=
ers has tapped his two-million-person donor list to raise money for liberal c=
ongressional candidates in New York, Nevada and Washington State. And in the=
 waning months of Barack Obama=E2=80=99s presidency, Mr. Sanders=E2=80=99s a=
llies are testing their muscle against the White House, mounting a public at=
tack on the president=E2=80=99s housing secretary, Juli=C3=A1n Castro, over h=
is department=E2=80=99s sales of delinquent mortgages to banks and private e=
quity firms.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CThere is a greater goal here,=E2=80=9D said Representative Ra=C3=BA=
l M. Grijalva of Arizona, a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Cau=
cus, who sent a letter to Mr. Castro criticizing the mortgage sales. =E2=80=9C=
The contribution of Bernie that will be lasting for us is that we will coale=
sce around an agenda.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> The pressure from Mr. Sanders and his allies is putting the party establis=
hment, which is closely aligned with Hillary Clinton, in a delicate position=
. Democratic leaders are wary of steering the party too far left, but do not=
 want to alienate the Sanders supporters whose votes Mrs. Clinton needs in N=
ovember, or risk losing the vast new donor base Mr. Sanders has created.
>=20
> The institutional bulwarks against Mr. Sanders are significant: Hundreds o=
f the party=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Csuperdelegates=E2=80=9D have endorsed Mrs. Cl=
inton, a signal of her broad support among the party=E2=80=99s power brokers=
. The Democratic National Committee now relies on Mrs. Clinton=E2=80=99s fun=
d-raising to provide a fifth of its monthly income, an arrangement the Sande=
rs campaign has criticized.
>=20
> And Mrs. Clinton is well positioned to block any proposals she would not w=
ant to defend in a general election. In January, the party chairwoman, Repre=
sentative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, appointed dozens of Clinton s=
upporters and advisers to the three standing committees of the Democratic Pa=
rty convention. Of 45 potential members submitted by Mr. Sanders, she appoin=
ted just three, according to Mr. Sanders=E2=80=99s campaign.
>=20
> Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, a top Clinton surrogate, will be co-=
chairman of the platform committee. Barney Frank, a former Massachusetts con=
gressman and fierce critic of Mr. Sanders and his Wall Street proposals, wil=
l be a co-chairman of the rules committee, which governs procedure on the co=
nvention floor. Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said he be=
lieved the campaign would ultimately be well represented on all the committe=
es as more members are named. But he questioned how Ms. Wasserman Schultz ha=
d chosen her discretionary appointments.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CNot only are they supporting Clinton, but they have been extremel=
y critical of Bernie Sanders,=E2=80=9D Mr. Longabaugh said. =E2=80=9CThat do=
esn=E2=80=99t seem like the right way to go if we want to have a convention t=
hat is evenhanded.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> Luis Miranda, a spokesman for the Democratic National Convention, said the=
 party was =E2=80=9Ccommitted to an open, inclusive and representative proce=
ss=E2=80=9D to draft the platform.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CBoth of our campaigns will be represented on the drafting committ=
ee,=E2=80=9D Mr. Miranda said.
>=20
> Some fissures within the Democratic family may be inevitable. For eight ye=
ars, Mr. Obama=E2=80=99s presidency has muted ideological disagreement withi=
n the party. His moral authority as the country=E2=80=99s first black comman=
der in chief, his popularity with grass-roots Democratic voters and his poli=
tical battles with Congress have worked to squelch the kind of ideological b=
attles that have divided the Republican Party.
>=20
> But the Democrats=E2=80=99 liberal wing, including lawmakers like Senator E=
lizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, has become more restive in Mr. Obama=E2=80=
=99s second term. Liberal groups have pressured the president on recent appo=
intments to the Treasury Department and his deportation policies. At the sam=
e time, a younger generation of activists is challenging presidential candid=
ates in both parties on issues of criminal justice, police violence and the r=
ights of undocumented immigrants.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CA boldly populist, people-oriented type of platform is massively a=
ppealing to those who have come of age during the financial meltdown and the=
 period afterward,=E2=80=9D said Kurt Walters, the campaign director at Root=
strikers, a group that favors limiting the influence of big donors in politi=
cs.
>=20
> The party is relatively unified on raising the minimum wage to $15, and Mr=
s. Clinton recently voiced qualified support. But there is a risk, some Demo=
crats said, that Mr. Sanders =E2=80=94 an independent who is not actually a m=
ember of the party =E2=80=94 would push the party to embrace positions that c=
ould later hurt Mrs. Clinton and other Democratic candidates.
>=20
> Mr. Sanders is almost certain to win a prime-time speaking slot at the sum=
mer convention, providing one of the biggest audiences yet for his views. So=
me Democrats said they feared a left-wing equivalent of Pat Buchanan=E2=80=99=
s searing speech at the 1992 Republican convention, when Mr. Buchanan, who h=
ad failed to win his party=E2=80=99s nomination, called for a =E2=80=9Ccultu=
ral war=E2=80=9D against =E2=80=9Cliberals and radicals.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> Matt Bennett, a founder of the center-left think tank Third Way, said Mrs.=
 Clinton had so far avoided tacking too far left to compete effectively in a=
 general election. =E2=80=9CThey need to be careful not to go so far as to h=
and the Republicans something to beat them over the head with,=E2=80=9D Mr. B=
ennett said. =E2=80=9CBans on anything tend to be politically problematic.=E2=
=80=9D
>=20
> The campaign against Mr. Castro=E2=80=99s policies at the Department of Ho=
using and Urban Development, called =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t Sell Our Homes to=
 Wall Street,=E2=80=9D could foreshadow the kind of leverage progressives wo=
uld like to exert after November. Mr. Castro, one of the country=E2=80=99s m=
ost prominent young Latino politicians, is seen as a potential vice-presiden=
tial pick for Mrs. Clinton.
>=20
> But the pressure tactics are also likely to sow more of the bitterness tha=
t has come to dominate Mr. Sanders=E2=80=99s primary battle with Mrs. Clinto=
n.
>=20
> This month, Mr. Sanders asked his supporters to contribute money to Lucy Fl=
ores, a former Nevada assemblywoman running for Congress.
>=20
> In his email, Mr. Sanders also suggested that Emily=E2=80=99s List, a poli=
tical action committee that is dedicated to electing women who support abort=
ion rights and is close to Mrs. Clinton, had spurned Ms. Flores in her race b=
ecause she had endorsed Mr. Sanders. Emily=E2=80=99s List, which has endorse=
d Ms. Flores in past campaigns, backed another Democratic candidate.
>=20
> The claim drew a sharp response from Emily=E2=80=99s List, one of the most=
 powerful groups in mainstream Democratic politics.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CWe support several candidates who have endorsed him, so he should=
 stick to issues rather than disingenuous attacks,=E2=80=9D said Marcy Stech=
, a spokeswoman for Emily=E2=80=99s List.
>=20
> But in an interview, Ms. Flores said she believed there was a broader agen=

>=20
> =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s just like with the presidential race,=E2=80=9D Ms. Fl=
