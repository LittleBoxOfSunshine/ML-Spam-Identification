ELECTION CLIPS



2016 - Presidential

Democratic Party Candidates

Hillary Clinton

Black Women Rally Behind Hillary Clinton<http://www.wsj.com/articles/black-women-rally-behind-hillary-clinton-1461866619>

Hillary Clinton never goes very far without black women sharing the stage, introducing her around or casting ballots for her in outsize numbers-and they are a prime reason she stands on the cusp of claiming the Democratic presidential nomination. Black women have long played a big role in Mrs. Clinton's life and career, and now their expanding roles in politics-as voters, officeholders and activists-have lifted the Clinton campaign in multiple ways. Exit polls show turnout by black women in Democratic primaries is significantly higher than turnout by black men, in several cases more than double. And black women have overwhelmingly supported the former senator and secretary of state over rival Bernie Sanders, with 90% or more of them voting for her in some states. In New York, she took 79% of their votes on her way to an easy victory, the exit polls show. Mr. Sanders, a senator from the overwhelmingly white state of Vermont, has repeatedly tried to make inroads with black voters, without much success. Mr. Sanders's best showing so far with black women came in Missouri, but Mrs. Clinton still took 70%, according to the exit polls.



Bernie Sanders

Donald Trump's new target: Bernie Sanders supporters<http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/29/politics/donald-trump-bernie-sanders/>
With the Republican presidential nomination within his grasp, Donald Trump is courting an unlikely group of voters: Bernie Sanders supporters. The GOP front-runner has ratcheted up his rhetoric against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in recent weeks, calling her a "crooked" politician who is unqualified to be president. But when it comes to her challenger, Bernie Sanders, Trump has taken a notably softer tone, praising the Vermont senator's rhetoric and encouraging him to launch a third-party bid. "I think Bernie Sanders should run as an independent. I think he'd do great," Trump said at a victory rally in New York City Tuesday night, after sweeping five GOP contests in the Northeast. The next morning, Trump said on MSNBC: "Bernie Sanders has a message that's interesting. I'm going to be taking a lot of the things Bernie said and using them." Trump's advisers say these comments are a preview of more explicit overtures the campaign is ready to make to Sanders' supporters once the populist liberal exits the 2016 race. That strategy is based on the broad areas of overlap between voters attracted to Trump and those who have flocked to Sanders. Both have angrily denounced the political system as corrupt and expressed deep frustration that Washington is not helping ordinary people. They both oppose international trade deals, saying they hurt American jobs.



Republican Party Candidates

Ted Cruz

Ted Cruz is 'Lucifer in the flesh', says former speaker John Boehner<DPG%202.9.docx>
John Boehner<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-boehner>, the former House speaker, has called presidential candidate Ted Cruz "Lucifer in the flesh" in remarks that expose the depth of discontent within the Republican party. Speaking at a town hall-style event for students at Stanford University in California on Wednesday, Boehner called front-runner Donald Trump<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> his "texting buddy", but offered a more graphic response when asked about the Texas senator. "Lucifer in the flesh," the former speaker said. "I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life." His comments were first reported by Stanford's student newspaper. Cruz, campaigning in Fort Wayne, Indiana on Thursday ahead of the state's 3 May primary, responded by saying Boehner was letting his "inner Trump come out". "John Boehner in his remarks described Donald Trump as his texting and golfing buddy," Cruz said. "So if you want someone that's a texting and golfing buddy, if you're happy with John Boehner as speaker of the House and you want a president like John Boehner, Donald Trump is your man."



John Kasich

John Kasich Tells Oregon Voters His Wife Agreed: Keep Going<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/04/29/john-kasich-tells-oregon-voters-his-wife-agreed-keep-going/>

Gov. John Kasich was helping his wife carry some clothes to the basement of their home in Ohio on Wednesday when they broached the subject that many Republicans have been wondering about. Should he continue his presidential campaign? After all, Mr. Kasich has not won a single state aside from Ohio. He has fewer delegates than Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who ended his own bid more than a month ago. And on Tuesday, Mr. Kasich even lost<http://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2016/04/28/Kasich/stories/201604280077> to Donald J. Trump in McKees Rocks, the Pennsylvania community where he grew up. "I said, 'What do you think, sweetie? I'm inclined to keep going,' " Mr. Kasich recounted at a town-hall-style event on Thursday. By Mr. Kasich's telling, his wife, Karen, agreed.



Donald Trump
Donald Trump's Gender-Based Attacks on Hillary Clinton Have Calculated Risk<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-women.html?_r=0>

With the nation on the verge of a presidential election between the first woman to lead a major party and an opponent accused of misogyny, Hillary Clinton<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/hillary-clinton-on-the-issues.html?inline=nyt-per> and Donald J. Trump<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/donald-trump-on-the-issues.html?inline=nyt-per> are digging in for a fight in which he is likely to attack her precisely because she is a woman. Mr. Trump, the Republican favorite, has already proved willing to attack Mrs. Clinton in ways that many women find sexist and that her supporters consider out of bounds. This week alone<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html>, he accused her of playing the "woman's card" to get where she is, saying, "If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote." He questioned her "strength" and "stamina," and he mocked her for "shouting." Also this year, he attacked Mrs. Clinton as the enabling political spouse of a former president who Mr. Trump said had abused women. Mrs. Clinton's advisers say they are confident that such comments will galvanize Democrats - and infuriate nearly any woman who has ever had to work harder than a man. But they also recognize that Mr. Trump has proved adept at reading the electorate and at dominating news coverage - and that Mrs. Clinton must parry his attacks without overplaying her hand or further eroding her standing with male voters, whom she has struggled to win over in the Democratic primary.



2016 - Senate

California

Barbara Boxer: Carly Fiorina Pick Shows Ted Cruz 'Has No Judgment Whatsoever'<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barbara-boxer-ted-cruz-carly-fiorina_us_572256b1e4b0b49df6aaa1be>

Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) criticized Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz for selecting former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina as his running mate<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-carly-fiorina-vice-president_us_5720e23ce4b0f309baef5657>, arguing the pick shows the Texas senator has "no judgment whatsoever." Fiorina challenged Boxer<http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2010/california/senate/#.VyJiCKMrJTY> for her Senate seat in 2010, and lost the election by 10 points. Boxer effectively used Fiorina's HP tenure against her, criticizing the former CEO for laying off thousands<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/news.cnet.com/Fiorina-10,000-layoffs-by-Nov.-1/2100-1014_3-931718.html> at the California-based company and moving many jobs overseas. The failed Senate campaign loomed large<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/carly-fiorina-failed-senate-bid-haunts-2016-ambitions> over Fiorina's foray into the 2016 presidential race, which ended shortly<http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/10/politics/carly-fiorina-drops-out-suspends-campaign/> after underwhelming performances in the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. In an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Thursday, Boxer said Cruz's decision to name Fiorina as his running mate should he win the GOP nomination was ill-conceived. "She hasn't held office, any office, be it Senate, House, state legislature, local government, not a minute's worth, and her claim to fame is running a large corporation which she practically destroyed, Hewlett-Packard, the pride of California," she said. "I think it just shows Ted Cruz has no judgment whatsoever by choosing her."

Colorado

Are Republicans blowing their chance in the Colorado Senate race?<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/29/are-republicans-blowing-their-chance-to-knock-off-colorado-sen-michael-bennet/>

For a year in which they're playing plenty of defense<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/08/why-democrats-should-like-their-chances-of-taking-back-the-senate/> by trying to protect numerous vulnerable incumbents, Senate Republicans have some chances out West: An open seat in Nevada and a chance to take down Senate Democrats' most vulnerable incumbent, Michael Bennet, in Colorado.

But when it comes to the latter, they might be in the process of blowing it. The past few months have brought on a slew of recruiting and campaign troubles for Republicans. They struggled to find an experienced and reputable candidate to take on Bennet. Now they're trudging through a crowded nominating process with no obvious standout hopeful. And this week, the establishment's preferred candidate - to the extent there is one - failed to qualify to be on the GOP primary ballot. So did two other candidates. Senate Republicans' campaign arm also hasn't reserved airtime in Colorado for the fall, which some took as a sign they might just take a pass on the race altogether. (Senate Republicans caution against reading too much into that.) Taken altogether, Republicans' missteps have given Bennet some much-needed breathing room in a race that his campaign perhaps rightly expected to be much more competitive than it is now.

Florida

Who's the front-runner? Grayson, Jolly claim lead in Florida's U.S. Senate race<http://www.tcpalm.com/news/politics/elections/local/whos-the-frontrunner-alan-grayson-david-jolly-claim-lead-in-floridas-us-senate-race-30ed18fb-8ae8-5c-377498911.html>

With a large number of undecided voters in the race to replace U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio<http://elections.tcpalm.com/races/2016/primary/u-s-senate-main-candidates>, it's hard to determine which candidates are the front-runners in both parties, yet some already are claiming the lead. U.S. Reps. Alan Grayson<http://elections.tcpalm.com/candidates/alan-grayson>, a Democrat, and David Jolly<http://elections.tcpalm.com/candidates/david-jolly>, a Republican, called themselves the front-runners in their respective primaries during an April 25 debate in Orlando. Republican Carlos Beruff<http://carlosberuff.com/1279hf983/> last week launched attacks against Grayson, whom he described as the "Democratic front-runner." Grayson led Treasure Coast U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy<http://elections.tcpalm.com/candidates/patrick-murphy> 33 percent to 32 percent in the latest public poll in March, which was commissioned by two pro-Grayson progressive groups. Murphy leads Grayson in four of nine polls taken this year; however, most of the people surveyed said they hadn't decided how they'd vote. For example, undecided voters accounted for more than 54 percent of surveyed Democrats in a March St. Leo University poll<http://polls.saintleo.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Saint-Leo-Poll-Report-March-2016-Part-1.pdf>.



Illinois

Morning Spin: Karl Rove snubs Mark Kirk in Senate Republican fundraising email<http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-karl-rove-mark-kirk-tammy-duckworth-20160428-story.html>

Karl Rove, former President George W. Bush's political strategist, sent out a fundraising email on behalf of Senate Republicans, but there was a prominent name missing from his pitch: Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk<http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/mark-kirk-PEPLT003562-topic.html>. Perhaps the reason is that Kirk has said he would consider votin<http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-court-kirk-garland-20160329-story.html>g for President Barack Obama<http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/barack-obama-PEPLT007408-topic.html>'s nominee for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland. Kirk also has called Garland "one of the most eminent jurists in the country." In his email, Rove cited Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Rob Johnson of Wisconsin, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio defending their seats in battleground states. "Whether they win in November or not will have a tremendous impact on the future of conservative policies for decades, especially the direction of the Supreme Court," Rove wrote in his plea for dollars.



Iowa

Chuck Grassley Admits It's 'A Gamble' To Let Trump Fill SCOTUS Vacancy<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chuck-grassley-trump-supreme-court_us_57223b28e4b0f309baefffb3>

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) conceded Thursday that there's a flaw in the GOP's plan to block President Barack Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court: Who the hell would a President Donald Trump pick for the seat? The argument Republicans make for denying a vote to Obama's pick, Merrick Garland, is that Obama is in his last year of office, so the next president should get to make the lifetime appointment. Not only is that an unprecedented move - Obama is still the president and he's supposed to get up-or-down votes on his nominees - but it's one that could leave Republicans worse off if their party's presidential front-runner wins. For all his success in the polls, Trump has given few details on any of his policies or the kinds of judges he'd put on courts. All he's said about the Supreme Court is that he'd defer to the conservative Heritage Foundation<http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/03/22/3762275/trump-says-he-will-delegate-supreme-court-appointments-to-the-heritage-foundation/> to give him names.

Louisiana

Rep Boustany and Rep. Fleming leading race for campaign dollars<http://www.wwl.com/Rep-Boustany-and-Rep-Fleming-leading-race-for-camp/22711966>
Latest campaign finance numbers show Republican Senate candidates Charles Boustany and John Fleming each have around $2 million in their campaign war chest. GOP state Treasurer John Kennedy has about $700,000. UL-Lafayette political science professor Pearson Cross says the November 1st primary is about six months away, and these numbers reflect that this will be an expensive race. "It looks like it's going to be a very heavily spent race. There's going to be lots of money around. If the people who don't have money don't start raising it soon, they're going to be left out," Cross said.  Other republican candidates include Rob Maness, who has $213,000 on hand, while former Congressman Joseph Cao reported raising zero dollars during the first quarter. Democrats Caroline Fayard and Foster Campbell each have about $250,000 as of March 31st. Cross expects Democrats will continue to lag behind the Republican favorites.



Maryland

Van Hollen Defeats Edwards In Maryland Democratic Senate Primary<http://postregistrar.com/2016/04/29/van-hollen-defeats-edwards-in-maryland-democratic-senate.html>

Rep. Chris Van Hollen has defeated fellow Maryland congressman Donna Edwards for the state's Democratic nomination for Senate, CNN projects. Edwards<http://donnaedwards.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=412&Itemid=2> has put race and gender at the forefront of her campaign, emphasizing that only one black woman has ever served<https://vanhollen.house.gov/about-chris>in the U.S. Senate. Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring. A black Maryland congresswoman running in the state's Democratic primary for U.S. Senate recently accused the party of using a racial "foghorn" to thwart her campaign in favor of that of her competitor. "I think they share so many positions that small differences had to be magnified", Madaleno said<https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/i-wasnt-part-of-the-club-edwards-roils-colleagues-while-emphasizing-her-unique-perspective/2016/04/19/88541d8e-faa4-11e5-80e4-c381214de1a3_story.html>, later adding, "It's frightening for the future of politics that you can twist a vote to say it does something that it doesn't". "It's not that the black community doesn't like Chris Van Hollen<https://ballotpedia.org/Chris_Van_Hollen>". "Ultimately, people decide who is best to represent all of us", he said. At a rally for striking Verizon workers, two candidates for the Maryland Democratic Senate nomination appealed to a key constituency: organized labor.



New Hampshire

As Senate campaign ramps up, Ayotte tries to deal with Trump factor<http://www.wmur.com/politics/as-senate-campaign-ramps-up-ayotte-tries-to-deal-with-trump-factor/39269758>

As it becomes increasingly likely that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will fight a monumental presidential general election battle later this year, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Gov. Maggie Hassan face the question of whether to embrace, reject or try to ignore their parties' nominees. Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton are particularly popular. And Trump's unorthodox policies and rants put pressure on fellow Republican Ayotte to either run with, or from, the New York billionaire. She has so far kept away from the question, staying neutral in the state's leadoff primary and refraining from commenting on Trump in any significant way. There is no daylight between Hassan and likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Hassan is an early supporter of the former Secretary of State and has praised her as "committed, dedicated and strong.



North Carolina

Burr holds steady single-digit lead over Ross in new PPP results<http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article74438177.html>

For the third time in the past six months, poll results from Public Policy Polling show Deborah Ross, a Democrat and former N.C. representative, within striking distance of incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, but still struggling with raising her profile in North Carolina. The latest results from PPP, based in Raleigh, show Burr with a four-point lead over Ross<http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_NC_42716.pdf>among 960 registered voters who participated in the phone poll this past weekend. PPP released the results Wednesday. Public Policy Polling, or PPP, has Democratic leanings. In an analysis of the recent poll results, PPP said the U.S. Senate race is "unexpectedly competitive" this year. The polling shows Ross has a slight advantage over Burr among "independent" voters but, more than half of those polled said they had no opinion of Ross.

Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania Senate rivals use Trump, Clinton as ammunition<http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/278102-pennsylvania-senate-rivals-use-trump-clinton-as-ammunition>

National Democrats got the Senate candidate they wanted for the critical Pennsylvania seat in Katie McGinty, but the race's outcome is likely to be determined by who's at the top of the presidential ticket.  Pennsylvania hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988, giving Democrats hope they can take back the Senate seat won by GOP Sen. Pat Toomey in 2010.  They're also bullish because of the likelihood that Donald Trump<http://thehill.com/people/donald-trump> will be the GOP nominee. Trump's numbers with women are weak, and the hope is that having McGinty on a Hillary Clinton<http://thehill.com/people/hillary-clinton>ticket will be a hit with suburban Democratic women.  "This has to be one of Sen. Toomey's fears: the nationalizing of this race and the ability to try to link Donald Trump and Pat Toomey," said Chris Borick, political science professor at Muhlenberg College. "That's something that's going to be an issue for Toomey all the way to election day." Toomey has looked strong so far, with a lead against McGinty in a poll from earlier this month and more than $9 million in the bank while the former chief of staff to Gov. Tom Wolf (D) has shallow coffers after a costly contested primary.

2016 - Governors

Indiana

Indiana Governor Mike Pence to Endorse Ted Cruz, Source Says<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/indiana-governor-mike-pence-endorse-ted-cruz/story?id=38760674>

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence will announce his endorsement of Sen. Ted Cruz at noon today, according to a source familiar with his plans. The endorsement comes just four days before the state holds its primary. During a campaign stop in Indiana this morning, Cruz praised Pence. "I respect Gov. Pence a great deal. I would enthusiastically welcome his support," Cruz said. Pence's coveted endorsement was clearly something that Cruz's rival Donald Trump was hoping to win. The Republican front-runner posted a tweet on April 20 showing him and Chris Christie meeting with Pence.



Montana

Gubernatorial Candidates Call Infrastructure Funding Critically Important For Montana<http://mtpr.org/post/gubernatorial-candidates-call-infrastructure-funding-critically-important-montana#stream/0>
Both of the major candidates in Montana's gubernatorial race agree infrastructure funding is important for the state and its citizens. Governor Steve Bullock announced his plan for the 2017 Legislative Session during a stop in Billings. The Democrat says this proposal melds together ideas negotiated with the Republican majority in the 2015 session that narrowly failed. "Don't forget this bill (SB 416) passed 47-3 in the Senate last time and died by one vote a year ago today," Bullock says. "So most folks got it. It was a small handful of legislators who stood in the way of getting this thing done for the entire state." This time Bullock proposes budgeting $200 million for infrastructure in a yet to be determined mix of cash and bonds.

Megyn Kelly grills Pat McCrory over anti-trans North Carolina law: 'What is the fear?'<https://www.rawstory.com/2016/04/megyn-kelly-grills-pat-mccrory-over-anti-trans-north-carolina-law-what-is-the-fear/>

North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory found himself ducking Megyn Kelly's questions on Thursday when the Kelly File host pressed him on the rationale behind the anti-trans law sparking criticism against his administration. "I've been in women's bathrooms my whole life, and we don't have the urinal situation; we've got like, the stalls," Kelly said. "We get to go in and we do our business, and we don't see each other. So why are you concerned about girls exposing themselves or seeing somebody else exposed in a woman's bathroom?" "I can't believe we're even talking about this," McCrory said, before blaming "the left" for the passage of HB2 by the Republican-dominated state legislature. The law rolled back anti-discrimination statues implemented in Charlotte, and bans trans residents from using public restrooms according to their gender identity. "It's not just womens' bathrooms, it's mens' bathrooms," he continued. "In fact, the Obama administration is now putting requires on federal money given to states that they also have to have this gender identification requirement for schools."

Vermont governor signs automatic voter registration law<http://www.wptz.com/news/vermont-governor-signs-automatic-voter-registration-law/39262670>

Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin has signed into law a bill that automatically registers eligible residents to vote when they apply for a driver's license. Vermont's law will go into effect July 1, 2017. Oregon, California and West Virginia have similar laws. The Democratic governor signed the measure Thursday. It streamlines voter registration at the Department of Motor Vehicles with a system that identifies eligible Vermont residents and automatically sends their information to the town or city clerk for addition to the checklist, unless they opt out. "While states across the country are making it harder for voters to get to the polls, Vermont is making it easier by moving forward with commonsense polices that remove unnecessary barriers and increase participation in our democracy," Shumlin said in a press release. "I would like to thank Secretary Condos who has long championed important electoral reforms to help more Vermonters exercise this fundamental right to vote."

Democrats' governor race getting nasty in WV<http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20160428/democrats-governor-race-getting-nasty-in-wv>

A new round of negative ads in West Virginia governor's race has sharpened the Democratic candidates' attacks, with state Senate Minority Leader Jeff Kessler accusing businessman Jim Justice of running as a Republican and former U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin issuing a statement whose headline screams "Justice is lying again." Justice released two negative ads this week, one calling Kessler and Goodwin two "insiders who think more government is the answer" and "want to raise taxes." Another attacks Goodwin specifically, as "another career politician," and accusing him of taking contributions from lawyers with cases before his father, a federal judge. The three men are fighting for the Democratic nomination for governor. "When a candidate starts going negative, that tells me they're in a freefall," said Kessler, who is unabashed in his calls to raise taxes to fill the gaping hole in the state budget. "You can't solve this budget problem without some additional revenue, so he's been bashing me for saying I want to raise taxes, yet here's a guy who's not paying his own taxes."

 in outsize numbers&#8212;and they are a prime reason she stands on the cusp of claiming the Democratic presidential nomination. Black women have long played a big role in Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s life and career, and now their expanding roles in politics&#8212;as voters, officeholders
 and activists&#8212;have lifted the Clinton campaign in multiple ways. Exit polls show turnout by&nbsp;black&nbsp;women&nbsp;in Democratic primaries is significantly higher than turnout by&nbsp;black&nbsp;men, in several cases more than double. And&nbsp;black&nbsp;women&nbsp;have overwhelmingly supported
 the former senator and secretary of state over rival Bernie Sanders, with 90% or more of them voting for her in some states. In New York, she took 79% of their votes on her way to an easy victory, the exit polls show. Mr. Sanders, a senator from the overwhelmingly
 white state of Vermont, has repeatedly tried to make inroads with black voters, without much success. Mr. Sanders&#8217;s best showing so far with&nbsp;black&nbsp;women&nbsp;came in Missouri, but Mrs. Clinton still took 70%, according to the exit polls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:#FEFEFE">With the Republican presidential nomination within his grasp, Donald Trump is courting an unlikely group of voters: Bernie Sanders supporters. The GOP front-runner has ratcheted up his rhetoric against presumptive
 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in recent weeks, calling her a &quot;crooked&quot; politician who is unqualified to be president. But when it comes to her challenger, Bernie Sanders, Trump has taken a notably softer tone, praising the Vermont senator's rhetoric and
 encouraging him to launch a third-party bid. &quot;I think Bernie Sanders should run as an independent. I think he'd do great,&quot; Trump said at a victory rally in New York City Tuesday night, after sweeping five GOP contests in the Northeast. The next morning, Trump
 said on MSNBC: &quot;Bernie Sanders has a message that's interesting. I'm going to be taking a lot of the things Bernie said and using them.&quot; Trump's advisers say these comments are a preview of more explicit overtures the campaign is ready to make to Sanders'
 supporters once the populist liberal exits the 2016 race. That strategy is based on the broad areas of overlap between voters attracted to Trump and those who have flocked to Sanders. Both have angrily denounced the political system as corrupt and expressed
 deep frustration that Washington is not helping ordinary people. They both oppose international trade deals, saying they hurt American jobs.<o:p></o:p></p>

 find an experienced and reputable&nbsp;candidate to take on Bennet. Now they&#8217;re trudging&nbsp;through a crowded nominating process with no obvious standout hopeful. And this week, the establishment&#8217;s preferred candidate &#8212; to the extent there is one &#8212; failed to qualify
 to be on the GOP primary ballot. So did two other candidates. Senate Republicans&#8217; campaign arm also hasn&#8217;t&nbsp;reserved airtime&nbsp;in Colorado for the fall, which some took as a sign they might just take a pass on the race altogether. (Senate Republicans caution
 against reading too much into that.) Taken altogether, Republicans&#8217; missteps have&nbsp;given Bennet some much-needed breathing room in a race that his campaign perhaps rightly expected to be much more competitive than it is now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 is still the president and he&#8217;s supposed to get up-or-down votes on his nominees &#8212; but it&#8217;s one that could leave Republicans worse off if their party&#8217;s presidential front-runner wins. For all his success in the polls, Trump has given few details on any of

 If the people who don't have money don't start raising it soon, they're going to be left out,&quot; Cross said.&nbsp; Other republican candidates include Rob Maness, who has $213,000 on hand, while former Congressman Joseph Cao reported raising zero dollars during the

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">For the third time in the past six months, poll results from Public Policy Polling show Deborah Ross, a Democrat and former N.C. representative, within striking distance of incumbent Republican
 U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, but still struggling with raising her profile in North Carolina. The latest results from PPP, based in Raleigh, show Burr with a<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_NC_42716.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:windowtext;text-decoration:none">four-point
 lead over Ross</span></a><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">among 960 registered voters who participated in the phone poll this past weekend. PPP released the results Wednesday. Public Policy Polling, or PPP, has Democratic leanings.
 In an analysis of the recent poll results, PPP said the U.S. Senate race is &#8220;unexpectedly competitive&#8221; this year. The polling shows Ross has a slight advantage over Burr among &#8220;independent&#8221; voters but, more than half of those polled said they had no opinion
 of Ross.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">National Democrats got the Senate candidate they wanted for the critical Pennsylvania seat in Katie McGinty, but the race's outcome is likely to be determined by who&#8217;s at the top of the presidential
 ticket.&nbsp; Pennsylvania hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988, giving Democrats hope they can take back the Senate seat won by GOP Sen. Pat Toomey in 2010.&nbsp;
<span style="background:white">They're also bullish because of the likelihood that<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://thehill.com/people/donald-trump"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:windowtext;background:white;text-decoration:none">Donald

 Toomey&#8217;s fears: the nationalizing of this race and the ability to try to link Donald Trump and Pat Toomey,&quot; said Chris Borick, political science professor at Muhlenberg College. &quot;That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s going to be an issue for Toomey all the way to election
 day.&quot; Toomey has looked strong so far, with a lead against McGinty in a poll from earlier this month and more than $9 million in the bank while the former chief of staff to Gov. Tom Wolf (D) has shallow coffers after a costly contested primary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 its primary. During a campaign stop in Indiana this morning, Cruz praised Pence. &quot;I respect Gov. Pence a great deal. I would enthusiastically welcome his support,&quot; Cruz said. Pence's coveted endorsement was clearly something that Cruz's rival Donald Trump
 was hoping to win. The Republican front-runner posted a tweet on April 20 showing him and Chris Christie meeting with Pence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 the state and its citizens. Governor Steve Bullock announced his plan for the 2017 Legislative Session during a stop in Billings. The Democrat says this proposal melds together ideas negotiated with the Republican majority in the 2015 session that narrowly
 failed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget this bill (SB 416) passed 47-3 in the Senate last time and died by one vote a year ago today,&#8221; Bullock says. &#8220;So most folks got it. It was a small handful of legislators who stood in the way of getting this thing done for the entire state.&#8221;
 This time Bullock proposes budgeting $200 million for infrastructure in a yet to be determined mix of cash and bonds.<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory found himself ducking Megyn Kelly&#8217;s questions on Thursday when the Kelly File host pressed him on the rationale behind the anti-trans law sparking criticism against
 his administration. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been in women&#8217;s bathrooms my whole life, and we don&#8217;t have the urinal situation; we&#8217;ve got like, the stalls,&#8221; Kelly said. &#8220;We get to go in and we do our business, and we don&#8217;t see each other. So why are you concerned about girls exposing
 themselves or seeing somebody else exposed in a woman&#8217;s bathroom?&#8221; &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re even talking about this,&#8221; McCrory said, before blaming &#8220;the left&#8221; for the passage of HB2 by the Republican-dominated state legislature. The law rolled back anti-discrimination
 statues implemented in Charlotte, and bans trans residents from using public restrooms according to their gender identity. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just womens&#8217; bathrooms, it&#8217;s mens&#8217; bathrooms,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;In fact, the Obama administration is now putting requires on
 federal money given to states that they also have to have this gender identification requirement for schools.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Vermont's law will go into effect July 1, 2017. Oregon, California and West Virginia have similar laws. The Democratic governor signed the measure Thursday. It streamlines voter registration
 at the Department of Motor Vehicles with a system that identifies eligible Vermont residents and automatically sends their information to the town or city clerk for addition to the checklist, unless they opt out. &#8220;While states across the country are making
 it harder for voters to get to the polls, Vermont is making it easier by moving forward with commonsense polices that remove unnecessary barriers and increase participation in our democracy,&#8221; Shumlin said in a press release. &#8220;I would like to thank Secretary
 Condos who has long championed important electoral reforms to help more Vermonters exercise this fundamental right to vote.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="background:white">A new round of negative ads in West Virginia governor&#8217;s race has sharpened the Democratic candidates&#8217; attacks, with state Senate Minority Leader Jeff Kessler accusing businessman Jim Justice of running
 as a Republican and former U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin issuing a statement whose headline screams &#8220;Justice is lying again.&#8221; Justice released two negative ads this week, one calling Kessler and Goodwin two &#8220;insiders who think more government is the answer&#8221;
 and &#8220;want to raise taxes.&#8221; Another attacks Goodwin specifically, as &#8220;another career politician,&#8221; and accusing him of taking contributions from lawyers with cases before his father, a federal judge. The three men are fighting for the Democratic nomination for
 governor. &#8220;When a candidate starts going negative, that tells me they&#8217;re in a freefall,&#8221; said Kessler, who is unabashed in his calls to raise taxes to fill the gaping hole in the state budget. &#8220;You can&#8217;t solve this budget problem without some additional revenue,
 so he&#8217;s been bashing me for saying I want to raise taxes, yet here&#8217;s a guy who&#8217;s not paying his own taxes.&#8221;
