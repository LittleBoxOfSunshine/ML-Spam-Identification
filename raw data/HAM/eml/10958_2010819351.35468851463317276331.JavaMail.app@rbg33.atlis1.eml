Hello Luis!

Did you know that children with cognitive disabilities are 4 times more likely than those without disabilities to be sexually abused? Every 9 minutes, an adult with a disability is sexually assaulted or raped.  Moreover, approximately half of the adults with cognitive disabilities will experience 10 or more sexually abusive incidents in their lifetime.

This issue is profoundly personal to me. I know what it means to raise a child with multiple disabilities. Also, I myself am dyslexic&mdash;I could not really read or write when I was 12, and grew up at a time where my learning differences were not diagnosed until I was 14.  As a result of bullying and my issues with low self-esteem, I trusted someone at school who I should not have. At age 12, I was raped. I do not want this to happen to my children, or anyone else&rsquo;s children.

I share not to shock, but to demonstrate how the high rate of sexual assaults on people with disabilities is just not a statistic, but affects real people.

Being from a strong, supportive family, I was able to succeed.  But others are not so lucky.  Being a victim of violence and sexual assault is often a precursor to mental health issues and to committing crimes, as is failure to complete high school.  Young people with disabilities are much less likely to finish high school, and the statistics are even worse for children with disabilities of color and/or from single parent families. Only a third of working age Americans with disabilities have a job.

RespectAbility is out there, advocating nationally on behalf of all children and adults with disabilities, to ensure safety, equal access and equal opportunity for everyone.  But we need your tax-deducible online donation HERE now! 

We are proud to be a lean organization, but our work takes money. We need your support urgently so I hope we can count on you!
