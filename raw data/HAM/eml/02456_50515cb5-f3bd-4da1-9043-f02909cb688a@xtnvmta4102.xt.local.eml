Donald Trump has won the Pennsylvania Republican primary, according to three networks.

While Ted Cruz and John Kasich have been vying for second place, Trump has maintained a strong advantage over both of his rivals. He averaged a 22-point lead in Pennsylvania, according to a series of state polls.

Trump held few events in the state but did make two stops there Monday, a day after Cruz and Kasich announced a pact late Sunday to cede states to each other in effort to deny Trump from securing the nomination outright.

Pennsylvania awards 54 of its 71 delegates based on each of the state's congressional districts, which are all unbound. The remaining 17 delegates - 10 base at-large and four bonus delegates and three Republican National Committee members - will be bound and allocated to the candidate who carries the statewide vote.
