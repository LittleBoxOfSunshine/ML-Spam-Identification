The White House

Office of the Vice President



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

April 30, 2016



*Remarks of Dr. Jill Biden at the Keel Laying Ceremony of the Future USS =
Delaware *

*As Prepared for Delivery*



Newport News, Virginia



I would like to start by congratulating the entire NavyIndustry here at N=
ewport News Shipbuilding, and those up north at General Dynamics Electric=
 Boat Division, for your efforts in bringing this sub to life. American s=
hipbuilding is the best in the world. What you do is so vital to our nati=
onal defense. And its as good as you  the welders, riggers, machinists, e=
ngineers, metalworkers, electricians  the outstanding tradesmen, speciali=
sts and professionals at Newport News.



Governor McAuliffe, Senator Carper and Representatives Scott and Forbes, =
it is great to be here with you. As well as Vice Admiral Tofalo and all t=
he distinguished Navy officers here today. Commander Brian Hogan, I know =
this is a special day for you too, and Im proud to share it with you.



These ceremonies are always special occasions, but the keel laying for th=
is submarine is particularly meaningful to me. As a proud military daught=
er, military mom and Delawarean, I am honored to serve as its sponsor. It=
s been nearly 100 years since the state of Delaware has had a Navy vessel=
 bearing its name. So this a proud day for the first state. And, this gre=
at tradition of having civilian-sponsored Navy vessels helps to cement th=
e critical connection between our service members and the civilians back =
home who love and miss them.



As a military mom and grandmother, there is no one I would rather be with=
 today than you  the ones who stepped up to serve. I am always inspired b=
y the sacrifice and resilience of our military and their families. The sa=
ilors who serve as the pre-commissioning crew of this sub, epitomize the =
ideals of honor, courage and commitment that define the United States Nav=
y. No matter what challenges you face, you serve with courage and distinc=
tion.=20



Forty-eight sailors and seven officers make up the Delaware crew so far. =
You represent 27 states. Many of your spouses and children  almost 60 kid=
s  are stationed with you in Virginia, including the newest Delaware baby=
, Jacob. Eighteen of you attended community college. Getting into submari=
ne service is not easy  you have to understand complex systems and underg=
o intense training. As a community college teacher, its always great to s=
ee when community college students go on to do exceptional things.



To the crew, I am excited to begin this journey with you and Im honored t=
o be your shipmate for life. I am deeply committed to serving all of you =
as well as you serve our country each and every day. You are the reason w=
e have the best, most powerful military in the world. You go places human=
 beings aren't supposed to be able to go  guarding the depths, protecting=
 our seas and our shores. It's a huge sacrifice to leave your family and =
spend months at a time under the sea, protecting us. It takes a special k=
ind of tough, determined, and smart woman or man, and we need you.



It's our duty to make sure that you have everything you need to stay safe=
 and do your jobs. You need the very best equipment and advanced technolo=
gy that we can provide, and soon that will include the USS Delaware, than=
ks to the ingenuity and skill of the shipbuilders before us.



Five years ago this month, when First Lady Michelle Obama and I launched =
our Joining Forces initiative, our mission was clear: to give all America=
ns the opportunity to step up and show their support for those who sacrif=
ice so much for our country. In this role, I have been privileged to shin=
e a light on the thousands of families who have taken on these challenges=
 role without complaint.



Today, I am excited to begin a lifelong relationship with this vessel and=
 to see this pre-commissioning crew come together and form the Delaware f=
amily, to go through exercises and sea trials, to see the Delaware christ=
ened and ultimately commissioned. Im also looking forward to getting to k=
now your families along the way.



When I spoke to Commander Hogan a few weeks ago, it was more than clear h=
ow proud you are, Brian, to lead the crew of the USS Delaware. I also lea=
rned that your family has moved twelve times throughout your Naval servic=
e and this will be your fifth tour of duty on a submarine.=20



Im sure that is also the case for many of the crew members and their fami=
lies. You all sacrifice so much to keep our country safe. Its not easy. T=
hats why I believe we owe thanks every day to those who wear the uniform,=
 but we also owe a debt of gratitude to their families as well. Behind ev=
ery sailor, is a family  the spouses, children, parents, grandparents and=
 friends.



Its a great privilege to serve as the sponsor of this submarine, but its =
also very personal. As many of you know, the Bidens are a military family=
. My son Beau served in the Delaware Army National Guard for twelve years=
, and deployed to Iraq for a year-long tour in 2009. And, I couldnt be mo=
re proud to have his son, my grandson Hunter here with me today.



The Navy is a big part of my life. My father served in the Navy during Wo=
rld War II. He enlisted just a few months before his 18th birthday, and s=
erved as a signalman in the Pacific. I still have his signalman pin. He t=
ook me, my mother and four sisters to watch the Blue Angels at Willow Gro=
ve Naval Air Station, to the Army-Navy football games, the Fourth of July=
 parades, and on Flag Day there was always a flag waving outside our fron=
t door.=20



It was through these moments that he instilled in all of us a sense of pa=
triotism and pride in the Navy. Ill never forget seeing as a little girl,=
 his picture in his dress whites, proudly displayed by the front door of =
my grandmoms home. Today, that picture hangs in my home.



Now, Im part of this Navy family with the spouses, the children and crew =
of the USS Delaware, and all who will build her. Today, Im truly humbled.=
 This is one of my lifes greatest honors.



Thank you. May God bless our service members and their families.

here is no one I would rather be with today than you &#8212; the ones who s=
tepped up to serve.&nbsp; I am always inspired by the sacrifice and
 resilience of our military and their families.&nbsp; The sailors who serve=

courage and commitment that define the United States Navy.&nbsp; No matter =
what challenges you face, you serve with courage
 and distinction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

 with you in Virginia, including the newest Delaware baby, Jacob.&nbsp; Eig=
hteen of you attended community college.&nbsp; Getting into submarine servi=

 our country each and every day.&nbsp; You are the reason we have the best,=
 most powerful military in the world.&nbsp; You go places human beings aren=

 your family and spend months at a time under the sea, protecting us.&nbsp;=
 It takes a special kind of tough, determined, and smart woman or man, and =
we need you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

t Lady Michelle Obama and I launched our Joining Forces initiative, our mis=
sion was clear: to give all Americans the opportunity to
 step up and show their support for those who sacrifice so much for our cou=
ntry.&nbsp; In this role, I have been privileged to shine a light on the th=
ousands of families who have taken on these challenges role without complai=

me together and form the Delaware family, to go through
 exercises and sea trials, to see the Delaware christened and ultimately co=
mmissioned.&nbsp; I&#8217;m also looking forward to getting to know your fa=

w weeks ago, it was more than clear how proud you are, Brian, to lead the c=

 has moved twelve times throughout your Naval service and this will be your=
 fifth tour of duty on a submarine.&nbsp;

 for many of the crew members and their families.&nbsp; You all sacrifice s=
o much to keep our country safe.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not easy.&nbsp; That&#821=
7;s why I believe
 we owe thanks every day to those who wear the uniform, but we also owe a d=
ebt of gratitude to their families as well.&nbsp; Behind every sailor, is a=
 family &#8212; the spouses, children, parents, grandparents and friends.<o=

bsp; My father served in the Navy during World War II.&nbsp; He enlisted ju=

 in the Pacific.&nbsp; I still have his signalman pin.&nbsp; He took me, my=
 mother and four sisters to watch the Blue Angels at Willow Grove Naval Air=
 Station, to the Army-Navy football games, the Fourth of July parades, and =
on Flag Day there was always a flag waving
 outside our front door.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
