Today in the fight for a full and functioning Supreme Court: Iowans continu=
e to call on Sen. Grassley to end his partisan obstruction over the Supreme=
 Court, editorials and op-eds remind Senate Republicans that it is time to =
do their jobs and after this week's courtesy meetings with Chief Judge Garl=
and, Democratic Senators remain convinced that he deserves a fair hearing a=
nd a timely vote.

Earlier this week, Deborah Holley of Nevada, IA joined other former Sen. Gr=
assley supporters on a trip to Washington to tell the Senator to do his job=
. Listen HERE<https://www.facebook.com/weneednine/videos/vb.175551571800328=
6/1782090605345797/?type=3D2&theater> as to why, as a long-time Grassley su=
pporter, Deborah decided to come to Washington to express her disappointmen=
t with the Senator.

Deborah Holley, Nevada, IA: "My family knows Chuck Grassley from back when =
he was first put in the Senate in 1981. We were always very pleased with Se=
nator Grassley. We thought he exhibited Iowa values with his integrity and =
honesty...we are very upset about this because we feel that our country nee=
ds to be unified."

The Gazette<http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/elections/dem=
ocratic-us-senate-hopefuls-make-case-for-nomination-20160512> reports that =
Sen. Chuck Grassley's (R-IA) Supreme Court obstruction is making an impact =
on Iowan voters.

"Democrats believe that the inevitability of Grassley's re-election has dis=
appeared - or at least diminished, according to Charlene Doyle of the Powes=
hiek County Democrats and one of the organizers of the Democratic debate Th=
ursday in Grinnell."

Charlene Doyle, Poweshiek County Democrats: "It's different now that he's r=
efused to have hearings on the Supreme Court nominee. Even out here in the =
rural areas, at his town hall meetings, Republicans are standing up and ask=
ing him why he's doing that."

ICYMI -  Mitch McConnell Says Elections Are 'Not An Excuse' For Senators To=
 Skip Work
Despite his rhetoric around the Supreme Court vacancy, Sen. McConnell took =
to the Senate floor yesterday to hypocritically discuss Senate action in an=
 election year. Watch the clip HERE<https://twitter.com/SenateDems/status/7=
30838286072205312>. The Huffington Post reports<http://www.huffingtonpost.c=
om/entry/mitch-mcconnell-merrick-garland_us_57350de6e4b08f96c182c26d>:

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday warned senators=
 not to use the election as "an excuse not to do our work."... Sound famili=
ar? The upcoming presidential election is the reason McConnell and other Re=
publicans have cited for not granting a confirmation hearing for Merrick Ga=
rland, President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee."

Meanwhile, editorials and op-eds continue to roll in critiquing the Senate =
GOP's continued obstruction.
From the editorial board of The Republican<http://www.masslive.com/opinion/=
index.ssf/2016/05/senators_have_duty_to_act_on_o.html>:

"Recalcitrant Republicans have absolutely no legitimate reason to keep Garl=
and on the shelf. The president did his job. Now it's up to them to do thei=
rs. Or explain clearly why they refuse to budge. But they won't. Because th=
ey can't...Republicans love to cite the Constitution - when it's convenient=
. McConnell and his allies would do well to take another look at the docume=
nt, specifically at Article II, Section 2. Then they should schedule confir=
mation hearings."

From Scot Lehigh of the Boston Globe<https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/20=
16/05/12/trump-and-supreme-court-fight/NkBukgSIOQpo50C9Ve3CAK/story.html>:

"Do you feel lucky<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D8Xjr2hnOHiM>? That's t=
he question Republicans need to ask themselves when it comes to Merrick Gar=
land, the superbly qualified jurist whom Barack Obama has nominated to the =
US Supreme Court...Republicans are blocking Garland in the hope that Trump =
- who has trafficked in racism and misogyny and who has said (though later =
retracted) that if abortion becomes illegal, women who have abortions must =
be punished - can choose the next justice."

After their courtesy meetings with Chief Judge Garland this week, Democrati=
c Senators call on their Republican colleagues to allow the American people=
 to hear directly from the nominee.

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI): "Chief Judge Garland and I had a productive discu=
ssion about his record and approach to the law, and it is clear to me that =
he is a well-qualified candidate for the Supreme Court.  While I was glad t=
o hear from him personally, the American people deserve to hear from him to=
o... it's time for Senate Republicans to do their job, take the next step i=
n the process, and give Chief Judge Garland a fair and timely hearing and v=
ote." [Sen. Schatz Press Release, 5/10/16<http://www.schatz.senate.gov/pres=
s-releases/schatz-meets-with-supreme-court-nominee-merrick-garland>]

Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT): "Refusing to meet with Judge Garland is as dangerou=
s as it is unprecedented. Considering a Supreme Court nominee is not a choi=
ce, it's a Constitutional responsibility."[Flathead Beacon, 5/13/16<http://=
flatheadbeacon.com/2016/05/13/tester-meets-with-stalled-scotus-nominee-lash=
es-out-at-senate-republicans/>]

Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA): "Chief Judge Merrick Garland is an eminently qualifi=
ed nominee for the Supreme Court, and it is the Senate's obligation to cons=
ider and vote on his nomination without further delay. My discussions today=
 with Judge Garland made clear that he has dedicated his career to upholdin=
g our Constitution and that he will advance the rule of law in our nation..=
.Senate Republicans are engaged in the worst kind of partisan obstruction b=
y ignoring their Constitutional duty to act on Judge Garland's nomination. =
The United States Constitution is a remarkable document. Let us respect it,=
 not run from it." [Sen. Markey Press Release, 5/11/16<http://www.markey.se=
nate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-meets-with-supreme-court-nomine=
e-judge-merrick-garland>]
