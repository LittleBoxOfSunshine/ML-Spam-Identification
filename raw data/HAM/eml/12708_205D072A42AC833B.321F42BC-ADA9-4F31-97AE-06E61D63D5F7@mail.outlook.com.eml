In advance of Trump=92s speech on national security today, here are some of=
 his most outrageous proposals that would make him a disastrous commander-i=
n-chief:


=B7         He has recommended that the U.S. military commit international =

=B7         He wants to allow countries that don=92t currently have<http://=
www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-japan-south-korea-might-need-nuclear-weap=
ons/> nuclear weapons to get them, reversing long-held goals of internation=
al nuclear disarmament, and suggested launching a first strike against a da=
ngerous country like North Korea.


=B7         He would not rule out using nuclear weapons on Europe or the Mi=
ddle East.


=B7         He has questioned whether the U.S. should be a part of the Unit=
ed Nations, saying that the organization =93is not a friend of democracy, i=
t=92s not a friend to freedom.=94


=B7         He thinks that NATO is obsolete and =93doesn=92t help=94 us<htt=

act that it led the UN-mandated International Security Assistance force in =
Afghanistan after 9/11, which had more than 130,000 troops from 51 NATO and=
 partner nations.


=B7         He has spread lies about a domestic recession<http://www.reuter=

sting<http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/15/investing/stock-market-donald-trump-t=
