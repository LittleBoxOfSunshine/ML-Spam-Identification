Excerpts from DNC Press Call with Reps. Elizabeth Esty, Pete Aguilar, Brady=
 Campaign President Dan Gross, and Gun Violence Prevention Advocates discus=
sing Donald Trump at the NRA Leadership Forum

This morning, Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty, Congressman Pete Aguilar, Brady=
 Campaign President Dan Gross, and gun violence prevention advocates held a=
 conference call to discuss Donald Trump=92s appearance at the National Rif=
le Association Leadership Forum.

Below find excerpts as prepared for delivery.
Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty (CT-5)
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut is in my district. I a=
m sickened and horrified that in the three-and-a-half years since those sho=
otings, nothing has been done to combat gun violence. I lay the blame on th=
e NRA and the Members of Congress who are beholden to them.
Despite the fact that 90 percent of Americans supported action on gun refor=
m after the Newtown tragedy, the NRA and their allies worked to defeat the =
bill by spreading rumors and falsehoods. Meanwhile, news of shootings acros=
s the country still dominate the headlines.
Both of our Democratic presidential candidates have proposed solutions to a=
ddress this crisis, and President Obama=92s executive actions earlier this =
year addresses this crisis by expanding background checks,  effectively enf=
orcing the laws already on the books, increasing mental health treatment, a=
nd funding research for gun safety technology.
Congressman Pete Aguilar (CA-31)
=85
We have held so many moments of silence for those lost to gun violence. We =
have prayed for their families, and we have vowed to take steps so that thi=
s would never happen again. Our words are empty if our actions don=92t back=
 them up.

No single reform could have stopped the tragedy that unfolded in San Bernar=
dino, but that=92s not an excuse to ignore the need for a national discussi=
on around gun safety.
 =85

I don=92t know how officials at the NRA or the Republican Party sleep at ni=
ght, knowing that we can and should do more to protect our communities. The=
re=92s an emptiness to our unanswered prayers for change when we don=92t ta=
ke steps to work for the type of change that we want. I don=92t want to hol=
d another moment of silence =96 I want Congress to work towards a sensible =
solution and I want the Republican Party to realize that they answer to the=
 American public, not the NRA.

Dan Gross, President of the Brady Campaign

=85As the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump has mad=
e gun violence in America a campaign trail punchline. In January, the front=
 runner speculated that he could "stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and sho=
ot somebody=94 without hurting his popularity.
=85

Make no mistake: this presidential election represents a critical crossroad=
s for this issue and for our collective safety. Lives are literally at stak=
e. The choice between Democrats and Donald Trump will be a referendum on gu=
n violence in America =96 and the result will make a big difference either =
helping to fight or fuel the problem.
=85

As he prepares to address the National Rifle Association as today's keynote=
 speaker, I challenge Donald Trump to stand by the 74% of NRA members who w=
ant expanded Brady background checks and I call on him to support Senator S=
chumer=92s recently introduced Brady Bill 2.0 that expands background check=
s to all gun sales.

Po Murray, Chair of the Newtown Action Alliance

I have lived in Sandy Hook for 17 years. I am a mother of 4 children, all g=
raduates of Sandy Hook Elementary School. The shooter lived in my neighborh=
ood. I lost my neighbors and our children's teachers. The entire community =
was and continues to be heartbroken. We made a promise to take action to en=
d gun violence.
=85
Donald Trump appeals to the worst elements in our country. If he were elect=
ed president, we should be afraid of the toxic combustion that could result=
 from his hateful rhetoric plus his reckless views on guns.
=85

It=92s crystal clear that Donald Trump stands with the NRA and the gun indu=
stry---not the families of Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Columbine or others =
impacted by gun violence. America will not be great without meaningful comm=
on sense gun measures. More and more American families are touched by gun v=
iolence every single day. We need the voters to elect a President who will =
prioritize and lead on the issue of gun violence prevention to make America=
 safe again.

Tom Mauser, father of Columbine victim Daniel Mauser and spokesman for Colo=
rado Ceasefire

What=92s most disturbing to me about Donald Trump is his view on background=
 checks. At Columbine, where my son was killed, background checks were an i=
mportant issue.
=85
What are we going to do about the 33,000 plus gun deaths and 70,000 plus gu=
n injuries that we suffer every year?
=85
I=92m looking forward to an election where we really put the question to hi=
m: why do you not support the 90 percent of Americans, Mr. Trump, that supp=
ort stronger background checks?

lection represents a critical crossroads for this issue and for our collect=
ive safety. Lives are literally at stake. The choice between
 Democrats and Donald Trump will be a referendum on gun violence in America=
 =96 and the result will make a big difference either helping to fight or f=
uel the problem.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 and our children's teachers. The entire community was and continues to be =

 the toxic combustion that could result from his hateful

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Ti=

mp stands with the NRA and the gun industry---not the families of Sandy Hoo=
k, San Bernardino, Columbine or others impacted by gun violence.
 America will not be great without meaningful common sense gun measures. Mo=
re and more American families are touched by gun violence every single day.=
 We need the voters to elect a President who will prioritize and lead on th=
e issue of gun violence prevention
 to make America safe again.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
