I was just about to reply to his questions about convention (though I'll have to say we can't really offer two rooms at this time because we don't have our allotment yet). Should I reply anyway on this thread or let it go?

My dad reconsidered and decided it is too ambitious a trip right now, so I will not attend the dinner (or likely the convention) after all. Sorry.

Incredible, though I'm sorry to hear about your mothers loss. You're really upping the bar for birthday gifts here.

My guest will be my dad from Chicago. Longstanding supporter and ardent democrat. Turns 86 the day before. My mom passed away this winter.  This is a nice prospect for him. His grand-niece is the #2 press secretary at the White House (Jen Friedman).

Hi Jon,



I hope the timing works out, it would be great to have you there! As for the ticket levels, we've found this election season that some folks have wanted to max out in light of our opposition. The difference is mostly in name only, but it also allows your name to be listed on the invitation as part of the host committee. In your case, attending at the co-host level would also qualify you for the Main Line convention package. I've attached our convention package descriptions for your reference, but please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.



I hope that helps!



Thanks,

Dan

Thanks. Trying to see if can make that timing work. What is the difference between cohost and guest levels?

Jonathan,



I hope you are well. I want to personally invite you to our upcoming event with President Obama  on the evening of June 8th. We will be advertising this event more publicly in the coming days, but I wanted to make sure you were among the first to know. Ken Lerer and Katherine Sailer are hosting what promises to be an intimate evening with remarks from the President and the chance to ask any questions you may have. We are expecting no more than 60 guests and each person will have the opportunity for a photo with the President.



We'd love to see you there if you are available. I've included the invitation for your reference and you can RSVP here<https://finance.democrats.org/page/contribute/NYDinnerJun8>. Please let me know if you have any questions about the event. I hope we'll see you in June!



Best,

Dan
