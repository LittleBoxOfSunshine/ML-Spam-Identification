By Natasha Korecki (nkorecki@politico.com; @natashakorecki) with Manuela Tobias (mtobias@politico.com; @manuelatobiasm)  

Good Wednesday morning, Illinois. It is the day of reckoning for U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 74, who is to be sentenced in federal court for his role in violating banking laws. But as we well know by now, the case is about so much more. Prosecutors say Hastert abused at least five students when he served as wrestling coach at Yorkville High School and keeping that secret served as the underlying motivation in his federal court case. 

Hastert's lawyers have said he was near death and uses a wheel chair. They're factoring health into their arguments calling for probation. U.S. District Judge Thomas M. Durkin will also weigh testimony from victims. Prosecutors have said that a victim identified as "Individual D" in court records may testify at the hearing as well as Jolene Burdge, the sister of the late Stephen Reinboldt. Burdge has said Hastert abused her brother in the 1970s. 

Will Hastert apologize? He must if he wants Durkin to show mercy. So far, his apologies have come only through his lawyers. In a past court appearance Hastert has read from a prepared statement. 

The hearing will no doubt describe dueling portraits of the man. Here's our story in Politico: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522fd04ac7a001cb5828106e0be1d4af73b2b5cd3432f0a326b0 

-- If you're a journalist covering Hastert in court today, here are the media rules of procedure: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f6f825c3db7c5c7b80beddac9db5ffb5cccc1454a0ab182d9 

HASTERT CASE OUTLINES -- "5 Things to Know About the Dennis Hastert Case," by NBC Chicago's Tom Schuba: "Former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert pleaded guilty to financial crimes related to a hush money scandal that stems from sexual 'improprieties' committed decades ago. He will be sentenced Wednesday. The following is a brief run-down of the case." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f85c60a5a931c99939bd77590ad8ae263634fb9793fdc5ede 

COULD SERVE UP TO FIVE YEARS -- "Details of sex abuse could mean prison time for Dennis Hastert," by The Associated Press' Michael Tarm: "When Dennis Hastert pleaded guilty last year to breaking banking laws, sentencing guidelines suggested that the former House speaker would probably serve no more than six months in prison ... But ... the judge made comments that suggested he might impose a longer sentence, potentially putting Hastert behind bars for several years, because of allegations that he molested at least four student athletes when he was a high school wrestling coach. Word that one of the accusers will speak at the sentencing hearing is sure to turn up the pressure on Judge Thomas
 M. Durkin to reject defense calls for probation and send the 74-year-old Republican to prison." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f403ec0654f6256e50d85ea0afd55f15e3cd9745c8685c2fc 

MAY FACE POLYGRAPH ON VICTIM QUESTIONS -- "Facing sentencing, Hastert could be ordered to undergo sex offender exam," by Chicago Tribune's Jason Meisner: "Regardless of whether Hastert, 74, spends a day behind bars, court officials are recommending the former Republican leader undergo a sex offender evaluation that typically includes a series of tests designed to expose any undisclosed wrongdoing and gauge whether he's a danger to society, recent court filings show. Federal prosecutors have said they also support the use of any 'psychological and physiological' testing deemed necessary by the probation department. Such tests can range from routine to invasive. One measure that's been
 suggested for Hastert by a probation official is a polygraph exam to determine whether he's lying about how many people he's victimized and whether any abuse has occurred recently, court records show." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f635fc43834b29c10009f72450a73b9748ea4b0947977f4e0

THE AYES AND THE NAYS HAVE IT. WAIT, WHAT? -- "Wild Harvey Council Meeting ends with officials debating if they passed levy," by Chicago Tribune's Joe Mahr and Matthew Walberg: "In one more twist to an already heated and highly unusual political battle, Harvey city officials can't even agree whether two aldermen were in the room during a crucial vote Monday night. At stake is the city's ability to collect property taxes and, the mayor says, avoid massive layoffs. The latest controversy occurs in a south suburb where Tribune investigations have shown the city has collectively lost millions of taxpayer dollars on insider deals, including at least one that has sparked an FBI investigation. Of
 six aldermen, four said they've refused to vote for the levy in the past in an attempt to force the mayor to stop being so controlling and secretive about how money is spent in the financially strapped town." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f17bdaae9f70fc131dda6b0e239bfc845835af502256cdbf1 

WON'T YOU PLEASE COME TO CHICAGO -- "For The First Time, Over 50 Million People Visited Chicago In A Year," by Chicagoist's Emma G. Gallegos: "Chicago had a bangin' year for tourism: over 50 million domestic tourists visited in 2015. ... Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Choose Chicago Board Chair Desiree Rogers announced that 50.97 million domestic tourists had visited Chicago, and that number is expected to hit 52 million once international tourists are factored in ... The mayor's goal is to bring more than 55 million visitors each year by 2020 ... (That is, if the publicity surrounding the Laquan McDonald case, other ongoing police brutality problems and the ticked up murder rate don't turn off
 tourists.) ... over 39 million people are 'leisure' visitors and 20 million of those are overnight visitors. People who come for business make up over 11 million visitors, and nearly 8 million of those are overnight visitors." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f4b47a1e9f355db9e523b03c03b8a6e62a74b7e1464ec7ef4 

CHICAGO HOSTS NFL DRAFT FOR SECOND YEAR -- From City Hall: "Mayor Emanuel will join NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and NFL Draft prospects for a youth football clinic at the NFL Play 60 Field presented by Danimals in Grant Park. This is the first of many community events planned in Chicago around the NFL Draft. The Draft begins just as the newest domestic tourism numbers were released for Chicago. Last year, large-scale events like the Draft helped the City set a new record with nearly 51 million domestic tourists. The 2015 Draft attracted approximately 200,000 people over the three day event and a total economic impact of nearly $82 million." 

--"What to do around the NFL Draft," Chicago Tribune: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f9b6d9a4aa127e3cd56cf1de4fce7f55c76d02993b86fe9b7 

NEW ANGER BUILDING TOWARD RAHM -- "Rookie alderman refuses to apologize for using the N-word," by Chicago Sun-Times' Fran Spielman: "A rookie aldermen on Tuesday refused to explain or apologize for his use of the N-word to condemn the ouster of popular Blaine Elementary School principal Troy Raviere. Ald. David Moore (17th), who is black, used the offensive and racist language to describe African-Americans in a Facebook post last week. Moore was essentially accusing Mayor Rahm Emanuel of engineering the ouster of the Blaine principal in retaliation for LaRaviere's outspoken criticism of the mayor's education policies. 'All I hear is, 'Stay in your place n-er.' Not one elected official, who
 cares about the education of our children, should remain silent about this DICTATORIAL move!' Moore wrote - though he spelled out the word." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522fe66ed356acc1bafb1eda1521402e8f61244f6775c7224e6b 

BURKE PITCHES DEAL FOR DONOR -- "Medical pot could come to Loop under clout-heavy change," by Chicago Tribune's Hal Dardick: "Medical marijuana dispensaries would be allowed in the Loop under a change to Chicago zoning regulations pitched by Ald. Ed Burke and a campaign contributor he once helped nearly double his state pension through a one-month sweetheart deal. Former-state-lawmaker-turned-lobbyist Robert Molaro told the City Council Zoning Committee on Tuesday about the roadblock that pot dispensaries now face: They're technically allowed in some Loop areas, but the potential sites are within 1,000 feet of a school or day care facility, and that rules them out under state law."

SCROOTENED -- "To Honor Richard M. Daley's 74th Birthday, Here Are Some Classic Daleyisms," by DNAinfo's Mark Konkol: "On Sunday, former Mayor Richard M. Daley's 74th birthday was celebrated on WLS-AM (890) with a half-hour audio extravaganza reliving some of 'Da Mare's' greatest moments in front of a microphone. It was like a birthday gift to Chicagoans presented by the City Hall Press Corps dean, Bill Cameron, on his weekly public affairs show, 'Connected to Chicago.' In case you missed it, here are some of the best things that former boss ever said: Daley had the perfect response to news reports alleging that cops used potty breaks to cheat on promotion test by comparing answers in the
 bathroom. 'You can't go in your pants guys. Gimme a break,' Daley said." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522fcc2dc83f1dc872b9c0878d0ad6e842f9708df333450088aa

THE IV LEAGUE -- "Find out which Chicago hospitals are the safest," by Crain's Katherine Davis: "One of Chicago's highest-profile hospitals gets only average marks in a new patient safety report. Leapfrog Group, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that monitors safety and quality in American acute care hospitals, gave grades of A through F in its latest Hospital Safety Score report, gauging hospitals' track records of preventing avoidable deaths due to causes such as infections and miscommunication over medications ... Of the 22 Chicago hospitals evaluated, six received As. Two received Bs and the remaining 14 got a C or below." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f188095228781a98f595d177c90fe8d9f293d6e5ef96641d2 

FORGET SOMEONE? -- "Two-time Olympic gold medalist Candace Parker left off Rio roster: report," by the Chicago Tribune: "Candace Parker was left off the U.S. women's basketball Olympic roster, according to people familiar with the decision. The two-time Olympic gold medalist won't be one of the 12 players revealed when the team is announced, likely Wednesday, for the Rio de Janeiro Games in August." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f3bac0d48848104ef3730cf4dab6505fe7ee2c64aa68e8c40 

GOODBYE, MOTO -- "Former Motorola campus in Harvard sold for $9.3M in online auction," by Northwest Herald's Katie Dahlstrom: "The 1.52-million-square-foot former Motorola campus has been sold to an unnamed bidder for $9.3 million, a Harvard official said. Online auction house Ten-X.com auctioned Motorola's former regional headquarters, which has sat vacant since 2003, during a sale that ended April 20." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f8e65a5a6d36c428d62ae94c7497a43d97b05fdd397f0db85 

JUST WHEN THE CUBS GET HOT -- "Banquet hall proposed for former Cubby Bear North in Lincolnshire," by Daily Herald's Russell Lissau: "An entrepreneur wants to open a banquet hall at the former Cubby Bear North sports bar in Lincolnshire. The proposed business would be called Loft 21 and would operate in the 31,000-square-foot building at 21661 N. Milwaukee Ave." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f4a8e9cfda63ef4b106210a222375b012761fdb4eed251f31 

TRIPLE AXLE? FILE THAT UNDER ATHLETIC -- "Area high schools agree to give letters to figure skaters," by Rockford Register Star's Randy Ruef: "Makala Arn has earned a varsity letter for cheerleading, which she does only in the fall. But the Stillman Valley senior has devoted roughly 15 hours a week year-round to her true athletic passion: figure skating. Yet Arn and hundreds of other area skaters over the years have not gotten the recognition for their success on the ice ... because area high schools and the Illinois High School Association don't recognize figure skating." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f61ed3fc9c25860b69350ac10251e888cd2c047d511e7b094 

ANITA's INFLUENCE -- "Rough road to judgeship for top aide to Anita Alvarez," by BGA's Robert Herguth: "As Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez's top aide, Daniel Kirk helps run the prosecutorial agency, which has been under fire for its handling of the Laquan McDonald shooting and other police misconduct cases. With Alvarez soon out the door after losing the March Democratic primary to Kim Foxx, Kirk is trying to score an appointment as a Cook County judge, but he's finding it, so far at least, a difficult path. Not only was he bypassed in a recent round of 13 associate judge appointments made by sitting Circuit Court judges, the century-old Cook County Bar Association ... has taken
 the unusual step of rescinding its positive rating of Kirk." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f5909c58cd8e3219d914e398a5827f1103489b5c5643e23af 

STATE  

'THOSE WHO WILL BE WHACKED WILL BE WHACKED PRETTY HARD' -- "Numbers war breaks out over Illinois graduated income tax," by Crain's Greg Hinz: "A war of statistics has broken out over a proposal to institute a graduated income tax in Illinois, with varying camps presenting it as a battle between 'fairness' and a potential business flight from the state. Both sides today offered a flood of competing facts, figures and charts-all accompanied by lots of spin-with one group contending that the plan would give Illinois the third-worst business tax climate of the 50 states. The truth appears to lie somewhere in the middle. A vast majority of the state's taxpayers, and those who 'pass through'
 owners of partnerships, S corps and the like, will be untouched. But those who will be whacked will be whacked pretty hard-hard enough that lawmakers ought to take some care before enacting anything." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f94dc5d72f43e2fddfaf715ccddace7637e9e0dbda19e4591 

DON'T FORGET ABOUT US -- "Our View: Higher ed gets help, but what about the rest of Illinois?" Freeport-Journal Standard Editorial Board: "It's a one-time deal and there's no budget for the fiscal year that ends June 30. Lawmakers should be debating the next fiscal year or even the year after that. 'We are hopeful the General Assembly will build on this bipartisan momentum in the weeks ahead as we negotiate a balanced budget with reform for fiscal years 2016 and 2017,' Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said ... We're reminded almost every day of the effect the lack of a state spending plan is having on Illinois residents, especially those who need help the most ... People with clout are
 being paid. Nonprofit agencies that serve the elderly, troubled teens, the poor, the mentally ill and others in the 10 percent have no clout." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522fa00a9ae85490ec67e208f56d261ec5fb3ecb4fbb34e70e27 

ONE-THIRD OF THE PRIZE -- "Eastern to see partial funding," by The Daily Eastern News' Analicia Haynes: "Gov. Bruce Rauner signed a bill into law Monday that will help institutions of higher education survive through the summer and fund Monetary Award Program grants. Senate Bill 2059 will give Eastern about $12.5 million or about one-third of what it received in FY15 from the state." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f22a159570f671aa7eb2856aaf89fdd4414bb150a03cf4d28 

BIPARTISAN DISGRACE -- "True colors showing," by The News-Gazette's Edit Board: "The Illinois Senate recently rejected a common-sense proposal to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot that eliminates the office of lieutenant governor ... Even worse, it wasn't the party of government - the Democrats - that voted to keep this pointless office. It was the party of consolidating and increasing the efficiency of government - the Republicans - that voted to maintain it. Actually, they're all in it together, and they're hoping one day that people will just give up and quit bothering them. That can't be allowed to happen. Those who think Illinois can and must do better can't quit this fight.
 So in that vein, shame on Gov. Bruce Rauner, who was identified by the Chicago Tribune as instructing Republicans senators to vote 'no.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f0c128a1c3823674a047019cccddc8dde30f5ddd6c610f992 

BLOCKING GUN ACCESS TO MENTALLY ILL -- "Illinois bills would limit mentally ill from owning guns," by The Associated Press' Ashley Lisenby: "Illinois' ability to keep guns out of the hands of people who are mentally ill or pose a danger would be strengthened under several proposals in the General Assembly ... Each measure tightens a loophole in existing law, which some lawmakers said could prevent more gun deaths and keep potentially dangerous people from possessing firearms. But some gun rights advocates say a couple of the plans are too severe and that stricter gun laws disregard the rights of responsible gun owners." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522fa5affd98521d478617ef584a2bc30a0100475f6f6c441354

A DEPARTURE -- "Reporter, writer, editor Rick Soll dead at 69," by Chicago Sun-Times' Maureen O'Donnell: "Rick Soll, an award-winning reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune, died Friday of lung cancer. He was 69. Mr. Soll, the husband of WBBM-Channel 2 reporter Pam Zekman, was a star writer of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s known for his investigations, combat coverage and punchy profiles of colorful characters. In 1973, the Tribune sent Mr. Soll to the Middle East to join correspondent Philip Caputo as he covered the 'October war.' 'He'd never done any foreign correspondence, let alone any war reporting, and he was quite young at the time,' Caputo said Tuesday. But Mr. Soll
 earned the respect of Caputo, a Pulitzer prize-winner and novelist who wrote the acclaimed Vietnam memoir 'A Rumor of War.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522ffe8017607d6873af861a75d833560bc4f7f1fce82d047d24 

GRIM REAPER CAME KNOCKING TOO SOON -- "Prince's sister says musician had no known will," by The Associated Press' Ryan Nakashima and Steve Karnowski: "Prince's sister believes the superstar musician didn't have a will and asked a Minnesota court on Tuesday to appoint a trust company to temporarily oversee his multimillion-dollar estate. Tyka Nelson, Prince's only full sibling, said in the court filing that immediate action was necessary to manage Prince's business interests following his death last week at Paisley Park, his famous home and recording studio complex in suburban Minneapolis ... In just three days, the outpouring of grief and nostalgia after his death prompted fans to buy 2.3
 million of his songs." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f320aa61319f8d47ac3077a5de541c4cbe77b389a1036f2d9

Flint Crisis Could Happen in Cities Across America: Flint's water crisis began with a decision to save public funds. With the need to tighten budgets, have mayors felt forced to make cost-saving decisions that could lead to a threat in public safety or health? Mayors tell POLITICO Magazine that aging bridges, roads, and water pipes are some of their most-pressing issues in our quarterly Mayors' Survey, part of the Magazine's award-winning "What Works "series.

<b>COULD SERVE UP TO FIVE YEARS -- &quot;Details of sex abuse could mean prison time for Dennis Hastert,&quot; by The Associated Press' Michael Tarm: 
</b>&quot;When Dennis Hastert pleaded guilty last year to breaking banking laws, sentencing guidelines suggested that the former House speaker would probably serve no more than six months in prison ... But ... the judge made comments that suggested he might impose a longer sentence, potentially putting Hastert behind bars for several years, because of allegations that he molested at least four student athletes when he was a high school wrestling coach. Word that one of the accusers will speak at the sentencing hearing is sure to turn up the pressure on Judge Thomas M. Durkin to reject defense calls for probation and send the 74-year-old Republican to prison.&quot;

</b>&quot;Regardless of whether Hastert, 74, spends a day behind bars, court officials are recommending the former Republican leader undergo a sex offender evaluation that typically includes a series of tests designed to expose any undisclosed wrongdoing and gauge whether he's a danger to society, recent court filings show. Federal prosecutors have said they also support the use of any 'psychological and physiological' testing deemed necessary by the probation department. Such tests can range from routine to invasive. One measure that's been suggested for Hastert by a probation official is a polygraph exam to determine whether he's lying about how many people he's victimized and whether any
 abuse has occurred recently, court records show.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f635fc43834b29c10009f72450a73b9748ea4b0947977f4e0" target="_blank">http://trib.in/24ipicN</a> <br></p><p><b>** A Message from Nuclear Matters:</b> Providing 90 percent of Illinois' carbon-free electricity, nuclear energy plants play a vital role in achieving our clean-energy and carbon-reduction goals.

WAIT, WHAT? -- &quot;Wild Harvey Council Meeting ends with officials debating if they passed levy,&quot; by Chicago Tribune's Joe Mahr and Matthew Walberg:
</b> &quot;In one more twist to an already heated and highly unusual political battle, Harvey city officials can't even agree whether two aldermen were in the room during a crucial vote Monday night. At stake is the city's ability to collect property taxes and, the mayor says, avoid massive layoffs. The latest controversy occurs in a south suburb where Tribune investigations have shown the city has collectively lost millions of taxpayer dollars on insider deals, including at least one that has sparked an FBI investigation. Of six aldermen, four said they've refused to vote for the levy in the past in an attempt to force the mayor to stop being so controlling and secretive about how money is
 spent in the financially strapped town.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522f17bdaae9f70fc131dda6b0e239bfc845835af502256cdbf1" target="_blank">http://trib.in/1SqNDsR</a>  </p><p><b>WON'T YOU PLEASE COME TO CHICAGO -- &quot;For The First Time, Over 50 Million People Visited Chicago In A Year,&quot; by Chicagoist's Emma G.

David Moore (17th), who is black, used the offensive and racist language to describe African-Americans in a Facebook post last week. Moore was essentially accusing Mayor Rahm Emanuel of engineering the ouster of the Blaine principal in retaliation for LaRaviere's outspoken criticism of the mayor's education policies.

</b> &quot;Rick Soll, an award-winning reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune, died Friday of lung cancer. He was 69. Mr. Soll, the husband of WBBM-Channel 2 reporter Pam Zekman, was a star writer of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s known for his investigations, combat coverage and punchy profiles of colorful characters. In 1973, the Tribune sent Mr. Soll to the Middle East to join correspondent Philip Caputo as he covered the 'October war.' 'He'd never done any foreign correspondence, let alone any war reporting, and he was quite young at the time,' Caputo said Tuesday. But Mr. Soll earned the respect of Caputo, a Pulitzer prize-winner and novelist who wrote the acclaimed Vietnam
 memoir 'A Rumor of War.'&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=87741fdfe64e522ffe8017607d6873af861a75d833560bc4f7f1fce82d047d24" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/24ixw4D</a> </p><p><b>GRIM REAPER CAME KNOCKING TOO SOON -- &quot;Prince's sister says musician had no known will,&quot; by The Associated Press' Ryan Nakashima and Steve Karnowski:

<b>** A Message from Nuclear Matters:</b> Some of America's existing nuclear energy plants face early closure due to current economic and policy conditions. Providing more than 62% of America's carbon-free electricity, existing, state-of-the-art nuclear energy plants play a vital role in achieving our clean-energy and carbon-reduction goals.<br><br>In Illinois, nuclear energy plants provide 48 percent of the state's electricity and 90 percent of our carbon-free electricity. The existing nuclear energy plants in Illinois also support approximately 28,000 direct and indirect jobs and contribute $9 billion to the state's economy.<br>
