-----------------------
Justin --

I know you've been hearing from us a lot about tonight's
first Republican debate (can you tell we're excited?) so
I'll keep this short.

I'll be on the ground in Cleveland for what I'm sure will be
an unforgettable event, and I wanted to make sure you'll be
tuning in at home.

RSVP here to say you'll be joining me and Democrats across
the country to watch at 9:00 p.m. ET tonight, Justin:

http://my.democrats.org/Watch-the-GOP-Debate
=20
We'll send you a reminder closer to showtime -- and a link to
play along at home with GOP Bingo! It's going to be a lot of
fun, but we're also going to have our work cut out for us
after tonight. Justin, if you're ready to see the "best" the
Republicans have to offer and what's in store for 2016, you
won't want to miss this:
