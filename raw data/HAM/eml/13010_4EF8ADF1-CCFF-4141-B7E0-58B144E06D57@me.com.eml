Sorry message was cut off before I could send:

I get that and will ask but I'm getting very different claims from differen=
t people on how this all went down (for instance I'm still trying to verify=
 that the Sanders people submitted ineligible names and weren't told to cor=
rect those names). Any way you can help me straighten that out?
