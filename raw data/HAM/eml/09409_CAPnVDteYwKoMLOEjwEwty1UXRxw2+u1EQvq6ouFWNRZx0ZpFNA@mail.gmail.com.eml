New CNN poll from Monday/yesterday. Lots of interesting stuff including:

About half of Republican voters say the GOP is now divided and will remain
so in November (49% now, about the same as the 46% who said the same in
March). That sentiment is more common among non-Trump supporters. In that
group, 60% say the party is divided and won't be able to unite by November.
That figure dips to 37% among Trump's backers.
