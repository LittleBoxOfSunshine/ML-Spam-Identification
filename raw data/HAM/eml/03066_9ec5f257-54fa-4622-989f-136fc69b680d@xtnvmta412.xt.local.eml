Katie McGinty won Tuesday's Democratic Senate primary in Pennsylvania over former Rep. Joe Sestak, after the Democratic Party threw its weight behind her in the final weeks of the campaign.

McGinty had 42 percent to 30 percent for Sestak with 63 percent of precincts reporting, when the Associated Press called the race. (See results here.) Braddock Mayor John Fetterman, the third-place finisher, took 21 percent of the Democratic vote.

McGinty won endorsements from President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Gov. Tom Wolf, Sen. Bob Casey, the DSCC, EMILY's List, and a host of other powerful Pennsylvania and Washington Democratic figures and groups. The DSCC joined EMILY's List in spending millions of dollars on outside ads boosting McGinty, a rare move for a party committee prompted by Senate Democratic leadership's poor relationship with Sestak and its belief that McGinty would be a better nominee.

Sestak, the party's 2010 nominee, started ahead in the polls, but the late deluge of ads - many featuring Obama's endorsement - swung the race to McGinty late.

McGinty will face GOP Sen. Pat Toomey in a general election matchup that's key to Republican hopes of keeping the Senate majority.
