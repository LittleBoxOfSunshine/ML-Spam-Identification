An Interview With Senator Wofford

Harris Wofford, a former Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, John F. Kenn=
edy=92s presidential assistant on civil rights and an intimate of Martin Lu=
ther King Jr., will wed at his Foggy Bottom apartment Saturday before a gat=
hering of family and friends. Dinner is to follow at a neighborhood Italian=
 restaurant.

The groom is 90.

The other groom, Matthew Charlton, is 40.

Wofford went public with his impending marriage in the essay =93Finding Lov=
e Again, With a Man=94 published in Sunday=92s New York Times.

=93Most of my life has been with a great woman, a great love, and a great f=
amily,=94 says Wofford at his Washington home in his first interview since =
the article appeared. =93Now, I=92m with a great love late in my life.=94

Wofford is well aware that it is the age difference, more than his fiance=
=92s gender, that has caused jaws to plop and unleashed a fusillade of soci=
al media blasts.

=93Everyone has a certain kind of amusement when there=92s a big age differ=
ence,=94 he says, seated in a rattan chair in the apartment that the couple=
, who have been together for 15 years, have shared for the past six. =93But=
 that=92s a part of the magic of love. It really can bring people across a =
bridge, or build a bridge that you can cross.=94

The age difference =93is sort of funny sounding,=94 he says, =93funny with =
a emphasis on fun.=94

Tall and courtly, Wofford has been an idealist for social justice his entir=
e life. In many ways, his public declaration of marriage at age 90 to anoth=
er man can be seen as one of his last and most deeply personal acts in furt=
hering the cause of equal rights.

Wofford attended Howard Law School in the 1950s, then the program=92s only =
white student and, he believes, the first. (He has law degrees from both Ho=
ward and Yale.) He helped establish the Peace Corps. In the Senate in the 1=
990s, he championed universal health care and later worked with several non=
profit organizations on national service and volunteering. In Philadelphia,=
 he introduced President Obama before his 2008 =93A More Perfect Union=94 s=
peech on race.

Wofford worked for weeks on the essay. He wanted to share his love with the=
 public, he says. He appears to have devoted less time to finalizing detail=
s of the wedding, which will be attended by about 30 friends and relatives,=
 including all three of his grown children and four of his six grandsons. T=
he couple will honeymoon and host another party at the family home in Nantu=
cket in June.

Remnants of Wofford=92s April 9 birthday party =97 confetti, a banner and b=
oxes =97 clutter the dining area. Quite frankly, the apartment is nowhere n=
ear ready for nuptials this weekend.

On Monday, he and Charlton were still debating the readings for the ceremon=
y. Charlton, an interior designer, was in New York working on a major assig=
nment, though he hoped to buy the rings. Wofford plans to wear a suit.

The grooms are keeping their own names, =93though Charlton would be very ni=
ce,=94 says Wofford.

He dismisses the assigning of labels, or =93pinning,=94 as he calls it.

=93Did I ever consider myself gay? No. It=92s what I think should not be as=
ked of people,=94 he says. An Old World-style romantic, he discusses the re=
lationship in terms of love rather than sexuality.

=93I think this is an example of the most private matter. Most of us are in=
trigued with the sexuality of friends or others. Perhaps with some close fr=
iends you want to talk about this,=94 he says. =93When people want to talk =
abut their sexuality, either go to confession or be happy about it. I don=
=92t measure myself or my friends by their sexuality.=94

When he first got married in 1948, at age 22, to Clare Lindgren, the local =
St. Paul, Minn., newspaper observed, =93The young couple are active in the =
movement to save the world.=94

In their first year of marriage, the Woffords traveled to India on a fellow=
ship to study the work of Gandhi: =93It shaped my life,=94 says Wofford. Th=
ey both returned with amoebic dysentery. The cure was arsenic injections fo=
r two to three months. The doctor told Clare, =93This is marvelous medicine=
: an ounce will cure you, but 10 ounces will kill you.=94 Clare responded, =
=93That=92s just about what I think about civil disobedience.=94

Clare, Wofford=92s =93best friend and my best critic,=94 died in 1996 of ac=
ute leukemia. She remains a constant in Wofford=92s conversation, as though=
 she were busy in the next room. After her death, =93I was sure I would nev=
er again feel the kind of love Clare and I shared,=94 he says.

Five years later, there was Charlton on a beach in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

Wofford was 75 and Charlton 25. At dusk, gazing east toward the Atlantic, W=
offord recalls, =93We had a wonderful talk, very stirring, a beautiful sky =
and a beautiful ocean.=94

Later, he found himself thinking, =93I would really like to go back to the =
beach and swim with Matthew Charlton again.=94

It took him all of a week, possibly two, to know that this was love.

=93I was surprised in the sense that I didn=92t think it was likely that th=
ere would be someone that really struck me with a spark, that moved me, bec=
ause of my age,=94 he says.

Initially, their professional interests differed, =93though we shared a lov=
e of ad=ADven=ADture and travel, and being outdoors.=94 Charlton, a native =
of South Carolina, first studied industrial design before pursuing interior=
 design, and created a three-legged =93Charlton chair=94 fashioned of metal=
 and wood.

=93He=92s now got a lot of interest in politics,=94 says Wofford. =93And I=
=92ve come to respect and be intrigued by the design field, not that I have=
 anything to contribute.=94

Wofford possesses an unforced elegance =97 in the 1930s, he joined his gran=
dmother on a six-month world tour =97 and is genial and generous, opening h=
is home to a stranger days before the wedding.

He asks to be addressed as Harris. =93I haven=92t been =91Senator=92 for ag=
es,=94 he scoffs. A former president of Bryn Mawr College and chairman of P=
ennsylvania=92s Democratic party, he has stuffed his apartment with books a=
nd photos of Kennedy and King, Clinton and Obama, and George H.W. Bush (=93=
I really grew to admire him=94). An oversized bust of Socrates dominates th=
e library that Charlton designed and that serves as their office.

Often on the premises is 20-something Jacob Finkel, who has been working on=
 a documentary about Wofford for eight years. =93Entirely his idea,=94 says=
 Wofford. Finkel has assumed the role of assistant and gatekeeper. When Wof=
ford=92s stories take an engaging peregrination, he often turns to Finkel t=
o prompt his memory.

For three years, Wofford didn=92t share his romance with his children, who =
are all older than Charlton.

=93If I=92d been wiser, I would have gotten them to know each other a littl=
e sooner,=94 says Wofford, the only time he grows wistful. =93When they did=
 get to know him, they all liked him.=94

=93I think it=92s wonderful,=94 says Susanne Wofford, a Shakespeare scholar=
 and a dean of New York University, who will serve as =93master of ceremoni=
es=94 (her father=92s phrase) at Saturday=92s nuptials. =93My father is ver=
y a lucky man to find someone who cares about him. They=92re both very luck=
y.

There was no need to get married, to make an honest man of them both, but J=
une=92s Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges moved the couple to =
make their union legal. Wofford is particularly taken with Justice Anthony =
M. Kennedy=92s majority decision and Obama=92s reference to the =93dignity=
=94 of marriage.

=93For a long time, I didn=92t think it would be politically possible. And =
I was wrong,=94 he says. =93And it was wrong that I was wrong.=94

A few months ago, in the living room where they are to be wed, Wofford aske=
d Charlton to be his husband.

=93We will find out how long I=92m around and how it strengthens our great =
relationship,=94 he says. =93I=92m very lucky to have the privilege of havi=
ng had two great loves in one life.=94

For the second and final time, he is thrilled to be a groom.
