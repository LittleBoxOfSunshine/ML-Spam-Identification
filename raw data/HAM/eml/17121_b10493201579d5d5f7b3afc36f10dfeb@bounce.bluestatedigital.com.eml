Well, after where we started in 2009 and everything
we've come through since -- and all of the obstruction and
cynicism the Republicans have pitted against our work to
keep America moving forward -- here we are in the final
months of President Obama's second term. And all I can think
right now is, "Here endeth the lesson."

Because at this point, the differences between the Democrats
and the GOP are clearer than night and day. Ever since the
President took office seven years ago, Republicans have made
disrespecting him and undermining the authority of his
office their number one priority. That started with standing
in the way of affordable health care and continues right up
to the outrageous and irresponsible behavior we've seen over
the past few weeks as they've refused to even consider the
confirmation of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee,
Chief Judge Merrick Garland.

It's this latest nonsense that really gets my blood boiling.
Because Senate Republicans are violating the integrity of our
justice system as one final, bitter attempt to undermine the=20
President's constitutional authority. And they have gone too far.

So I'm reaching out to you today, because I have had it with
watching these Republicans pride themselves on preventing
progress. And if you agree that it's time for Senate
Republicans to do their job and give Chief Judge Garland a
hearing and a vote, then I'm asking you to add your name
next to mine right now:
