Alex. Love you but we can't do this to Debbie. There were no joke 10 bills =
on this topic on the floor in the last two days.  Talk to Tom ASAP and get =
something pulled together for the brief. Every time we lean on the legislat=
ive staff to do this it is recorded and we can't have that.

Hey there!

Unfortunately, I don=92t have any talking points but we were talking to our=
 host and they=92re likely going to want to talk about the legislation that=
 was on the floor today (or was meant to be on the floor=97sorry, I don=92t=
 follow this stuff all too closely) regarding opioid abuse and regulation.

They=92ll also be interested in talking about the Zika virus. There=92s leg=
islation to move funds away from Ebola support to address a potential Zika =
outbreak this summer. ANA is opposed to this move as there=92s still potent=
ial for another Ebola outbreak; they believe that Ebola AND Zika both warra=
nt research and that funds should be found elsewhere to address a potential=
 Zika outbreak.

Congressman G. K. Butterfield will also be in attendance and sits on Energy=
 & Commerce. He votes in favor of a lot of ANA=92s priority issues so I don=
=92t see this being a tense breakfast in any way.

Tomorrow is the last day of Nurses Week (5/6-5/12) Florence Nightingale=92s=
 birthday so I=92m sure it would also be good for her to touch on all the g=
ood (and generally thankless) work that nurses do.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks!
