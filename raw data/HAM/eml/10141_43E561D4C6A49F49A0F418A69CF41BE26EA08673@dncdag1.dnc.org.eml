Subject: good for resaerch -- Donald Trump=92s lack of respect for rape vic=
tims are nothing new

SL: Donald Trump=92s lack of respect for rape victims are is nothing new

Just last week, Trump proudly announced endorsements from two =93tough guys=
<http://www.bustle.com/articles/157523-these-brand-new-donald-trump-endorse=
rs-should-horrify-you>=94 =96 Mike Tyson and Bobby Knight =96 with a troubl=
ing history on the issue of rape. Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992 in In=
diana, and Bobby Knight once said =93I think that if rape is inevitable, re=
lax and enjoy it.=94

But Donald Trump=92s misogynistic and backwards defense of Tyson and dismis=
sive attitude towards the rape he was convicted for goes back decades<https=
://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-in-1992-tyson-told-me-wome=
n-who-put-him-in-jail?utm_term=3D.xyw16DXgq#.qqDEJxNgo>:

Trump controversially suggested in 1992 Tyson could pay the victim with mon=
ey from a fight to avoid serving a jail sentence and as reported earlier th=
is week by BuzzFeed News said in the early =9290s that Tyson was =93railroa=
ded=94 in his case, and that the victim had willingly entered Tyson=92s roo=
m.

In another instance in late 1992, Trump discussed the case at length in an =
interview with Charlie Rose. The topic centered around a New York magazine =
profile in which Trump said his mother was angry at him for defending Tyson=
. In the piece, Trump said Tyson told him the victim =93wanted it real bad.=
=94

Donald Trump thinks he can fool us into how presidential he is going to be,=
 and how much he loves women =96 but the warped and backwards view of viole=
nce and rape is who Donald Trump has been for years.

Adding to the offensive rhetoric that has marred his campaign, Donald Trump=
 has also been saying that China is going to =93rape=94 America, which has =
offended sexual violence advocates who are livid<http://www.huffingtonpost.=
com/entry/donald-trump-rape-china_us_572714c7e4b0b49df6abad17> over the use=
 of word, and no doubt countless victims.

=93When someone like Donald Trump uses a heinous crime like rape as a metap=
hor, it=92s an insult to all sexual assault victims and survivors,=94 said =
DNC CEO Amy Dacey. =93This is one more example that today=92s Republican Pa=
rty simply doesn=92t support efforts to combat violence against women, incl=
uding supporting the nearly 300,000 victims<https://rainn.org/get-informati=
on/statistics/frequency-of-sexual-assault> of sexual violence and rape each=
 year =96 all the more reason why we can=92t have a Republican be the 45th =
president of the United States.=94

Preventing violence against women has garnered widespread support among vot=
ers, but a majority of Republicans in Congress, including Trump=92s main co=
mpetitor, Ted Cruz, still voted against the Violence Against Women Act in 2=
013. By contrast, Democrats have been committed to preventing violence agai=
nst women and extending support to survivors.
