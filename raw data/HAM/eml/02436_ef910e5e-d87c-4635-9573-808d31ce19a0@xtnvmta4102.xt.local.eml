By Natasha Korecki (nkorecki@politico.com; @natashakorecki) with Manuela Tobias (mtobias@politico.com; @manuelatobiasm)  

Good Monday morning, Illinois. There's a new power struggle shaping up in City Hall -- this time it's over the city's two airports and the thousands of contracts worth billions of dollars that flow through them. 

An initiative driven by the Service Employees International Union is calling for an elected board that would oversee, manage and hold accountable operations and contracts at O'Hare and Midway airports. The union has been meeting with aldermen over the last week pushing the idea and a Tuesday morning new conference is scheduled. First look at the details in POLITICO: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41d223c360d0c6eb59e9c3beac7561341bfac019b55c73bd76   

ON THE STATE SIDE -- There's big political news with Democratic Rep. Jack Franks announcing on Sunday that he will not seek a new term in the Statehouse. Instead, Franks is moving toward a McHenry County Board bid. This is significant because Franks represents a frequent "no" vote on the Democratic side in the House, including on budgets his party has put forward. In an interview with Illinois Playbook on Sunday, Franks said one benefit of his moving out of the way: the so-called Democratic supermajority would reveal itself to be false. Franks has managed to win in a strongly held GOP district, so there's a stronger chance for Republicans to reclaim that seat. 

THE QUOTE: "It's a lonely voice screaming in the wind at this point." -- Franks on trying to stick it through in Springfield 

How it works: Franks said Democrats have until August to put a new name on the ballot. Franks vowed not to take part in any ploy that would involve his stepping down early before the election so the party could give someone a leg up. He also ruled out protecting the seat, winning, then stepping down after he's reelected. 

Why county chair: "Then maybe I can actually get something done for the people. In Springfield, I don't think the dynamic is going to change for quite some time. I've never seen it so bad. Here's an opportunity where people in McHenry County, in leadership, being an executive, I can implement a lot of changes that can help the taxpayers," Franks said. "What we keep doing is the old Springfield shuffle, 'I'll pass a bill you won't call, you pass a bill I won't call. Then we go and campaign and say what a great job we're doing.'" 

Democratic bench: Independence? Executive experience? It's something Democrats are looking for as they are to face a bitter gubernatorial election in 2018. So far, no one has raised his or her hand to go up against deep-pocketed Rauner. But should Franks win the county chair seat, it could quickly propel him high on the Democrats' short list. 

IPRA: Since we last published, Mayor Rahm Emanuel made news in a Sun-Times op-ed, announcing he was scrapping the Independent Police Review Authority, a move he had been pushed to make early on given the agency's miserable track record with holding accountable. In the Tribune this morning, Emanuel doesn't rule out seeking a third term. (If he did, he'd be irrelevant for the next three years.) 


** A message from VoteVets Action Fund: Strong prevailing wage laws improve the lives of veterans, who work in construction at much higher rates than non-veterans. Each year, prevailing wage laws help hundreds of thousands of returning veterans put their skills to work building our communities while providing a middle class life for their families. - http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41a2f739030b3122baec8c54446961a0cdea355b3c2222b974 **

Let's start with the mayor. 

MAYOR SCRAPS TROUBLED POLICE OVERSIGHT AGENCY -- "Mayor Emanuel: Our next steps on road to police reform," by Mayor Rahm Emanuel in the Chicago Sun-Times: "Five months ago, I pledged to the residents of Chicago that we would do whatever it takes to rebuild public trust and restore accountability in the police department ... Today I can announce that in the coming weeks, we will have the final details worked out on a comprehensive plan to fundamentally reshape our system of police accountability and it will be introduced at the following meeting of the full City Council on June 22. It will be based on the thoughtful suggestions made by my Police Accountability Task Force. It will also be
 informed by the conversations my administration is having with aldermen, community leaders, the U.S. Department of Justice and experts in the field. We want to make sure the police accountability system is trusted by the members of the Chicago Police Department and the residents of Chicago." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d4162514f85668a33e42ddcfe8f5bc3096fe57ddb39dc957ff8 

VIDEO OF WEEKEND REMARKS -- "Mayor Emanuel talks about plan to replace IPRA," by ABC 7's Evelyn Holmes and Laura Podesta: "As the City of Chicago works to fix the police department's image, Mayor Rahm Emanuel spoke for the first time about his new plan to scrap the Independent Police Review Authority and replace it with a civilian agency. IPRA investigates things like police shootings or allegations of officer misconduct. Now, the agency is under fire for the way it handles those investigations. 'IPRA's work is important. An independent review of actions. But IPRA itself has lost credibility with the public,' Emanuel said on Saturday." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d412b81446754ef6620cc8c086de0c2d3988cf634400cfba847

LOOKING BEYOND NUMBERS -- "Heroin deaths - tragedy or murder?" by Sun-Times' Mick Dumke and Frank Main: "When police and paramedics arrived at her aunt's apartment in Carol Stream, Adrianna Diana told them she and her friend Christopher Houdek had cooked and shot up heroin the night before. Diana, 20, said she awoke covered in vomit, with Houdek, 21, next to her, unresponsive and 'cool to the touch.' Her aunt called 911. Paramedics rushed Houdek to a hospital, where he died. The DuPage County coroner ruled his 2013 death an accident by 'heroin intoxication.' But prosecutors decided it was homicide - and charged Diana and two heroin dealers." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41b5806bc8dfe7f842b5e11b50cbea15109c678fb2a2411a1a 

HU DONE IT -- "Feds: Chinatown restaurateur Tony Hu stiffed state on taxes," by Chicago Sun-Times' Stefano Esposito: "Chicago restaurateur Tony Hu once had a seemingly insatiable appetite for publicity. But the sort he received Friday may have gone down as a well as a moldy pot sticker. The local celebrity chef - who has Chinese restaurants across the city, as well as at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas - has been charged with wire fraud and money laundering for allegedly underreporting restaurant receipts paid in cash, federal prosecutors said Friday." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d4154f55a654fc55d147e6af2a28cefb87178464853606f9efc 

-- "Day after old post office deal done, longtime owner is dead," by Chicago Tribune's Kim Janssen: "Just a day after City Hall announced that Bill Davies' company relinquished control of Chicago's massive old main post office building, a representative for the 82-year-old Brit said the eccentric entrepreneur has died. Davies - who touted several proposals to redevelop the crumbling building on the western entrance to downtown Chicago after buying the property at auction for $24 million in 2009 - died after 'a short illness,' according to Sue Sadler, who acts as a spokeswoman for Davies' company, International Property Developers." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41336624e1e3677a57c7b456d38576982aba33205c0c29d1be 

GERRYMANDER PAYOFF -- "Second Ward gerrymandering could help Mayor Rahm rezone Finkl Steel site," by The Reader's Ben Joravsky: "I'm starting to realize there was another-perhaps even more significant-consequence of the mayor's creative gerrymandering that's only now becoming apparent. Many of the near north side's remaining industrial sites were stuffed into one easy-to-control ward. And whether the mayor intended this or not, he's now benefitting from it. This includes the 28-acre Lincoln Park site of the recently demolished Finkl Steel plant, which the mayor's eager to rezone from industrial to commercial and/or residential use, so his salivating developer pals can build high-end shops,
 condos-anything. Just get that noisy industrial stuff out of the near north side-now!" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d418219421a96d68fd78361685474a3110df91820003729a60d 

A LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE -- "Officer in Laquan McDonald killing 'not the monster' people think, wife says," by Chicago Tribune's Christy Gutowski: "When Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke and his wife moved into their raised ranch house 11 years ago, they tore down a red wooden fence that closed off their property and began organizing annual block parties. Now the curtains in their front room's large picture window are typically closed. Cameras have been added to beef up their home security system. Their two daughters aren't allowed outside alone, and Van Dyke no longer volunteers at their school chaperoning class field trips or helping build homecoming floats." 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d411d171902a89f5fab756da8c1726c875cd374e135013bf0d8 

LUCAS' SAN FRAN RETREAT -- "George Lucas looking at Treasure Island as new SF site for museum," by San Francisco Chronicle's Phil Matier and Andy Ross: "After a lobbying campaign by Mayor Ed Lee, 'Star Wars' creator George Lucas is once again looking to San Francisco as a possible home for a museum housing his collection of illustrative art and Hollywood memorabilia - this time on a site already approved for development on Treasure Island. Lucas has renewed his interest in the city because his latest museum proposal - for a futuristic structure on the shores of Lake Michigan in Chicago - is on life support. Open space advocates like those who helped spike his earlier plans for a Beaux
 Arts-style monument near Presidio's Crissy Field have Lucas' Chicago plan hopelessly entangled, legally and politically." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d4148db6594ed04dbc63c7bb6ded046a3cde16c5d6b0f642e26 

COACH SUNSHINE DAYDREAM -- "With his tie-dye and 'shaggin' wagon,' Maddon is dream hippie boss," by Chicago Tribune's Mary Schmich: "Man, it would be groovy to have Joe Maddon as a boss. Imagine the American workplace full of bosses like him, propelled by his kind of freewheeling spirit, unafraid to wear tie-dye, unembarrassed to say groovy, driving around in shaggin' wagons and letting the employees know that sometimes they gotta let it all hang out. OK, visualizing your own boss that way is probably creepy, but Maddon, the manager and guru of the Chicago Cubs, makes it look bitchin'. 'He's the embodiment of everything the hippie era was supposed to be,' says a friend, who was sharing her
 Maddon-as-boss fantasy the other day. 'We are all in love with him, and I think it's because he embodies that hippie spirit.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41e1a71ddfb10edea91065b94b52c689961f106f4c7ea1ba4e 

STATE  

FRANKS' BIG MOVE -- "Jack Franks announces McHenry County Board chairman run," by Northwest Herald's Kevin P. Craver: "Ending months of speculation, Democratic state Rep. Jack Franks announced his candidacy for McHenry County Board Chairman, setting up what is sure to be a fierce race for the first-ever election for the seat. But while the move gives the McHenry County Republican Party a hard fight for what was an uncontested race, it also gives the GOP a chance to reclaim the 63rd Illinois House District seat that Franks said he is relinquishing to run for chairman instead. Franks, of Marengo, made the announcement Sunday morning, shortly after the Democratic Party of McHenry County voted
 to slate him to run against Republican nominee Michael Walkup. Walkup, a County Board member from Crystal Lake, narrowly defeated incumbent Chairman Joe Gottemoller, R-Crystal Lake, in the March 15 primary ... 

'Franks has handily defeated every candidate thrown at him. But his decision to withdraw and focus on the chairman race gives the GOP a better shot at a pickup through candidate Steven Reick, of Harvard. The county Democratic Party has until August to select a candidate to run against Reick, and Democratic Party of McHenry County Chairman Michael Bissett said the decision will not happen until at least after Memorial Day." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41b3a353a554ad5d19cc1cee8866e201f46311b726b7e7ad2a 

POLITICAL LINCHPIN -- "The most important pol in Illinois right now is ..." by Crain's Greg Hinz: "It's Madigan's fellow Democrat, Senate President John Cullerton. The governor and speaker haven't given up their partisan politics. Rather, there's a sense that Rauner finally may have watered down his Turnaround Illinois agenda enough that a reasonable compromise can be reached. Cullerton is key to that happening. Unlike the total tactician that is Madigan-at this point in his career, does he give a damn about anything other than doing what it takes to win the next election?-Cullerton seems to remember that his North Side voters sent him to Springfield to get stuff done. And that he has,
 somehow keeping together the most liberal legislative caucus the Capitol has seen in decades while on occasion rolling the dice to accomplish something." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41f1ef5c62469746fd76eb65a459c6a927f3b5e6544b1bea0f 

DROP IN TEACHING PROSPECTS -- "Where are the teachers? SIU's graduating class of student teachers was smallest in years," by Southern Illinoisan's Molly Parker: "Among the blue-chaired student desks, the brightly colored posters, the books and globes for discovering far-away lands, Megan Taylor is at home standing inside the social studies classroom at Giant City Elementary School where she wraps up her student teaching in a few days. The experiences she gleaned inside the little brick school on Boskydell Road over the last year as an intern, observer and student teacher confirmed for Taylor what she had already suspected for years: She was born to be a teacher." 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41b4ea3eeec225ff5a030a880369a7d84366235d0c2a55e79c 

NO DOLLARS, NO SENSE -- "Making sense out of Rauner's position on education funding," by Rich Miller for Crain's: "Gov. Bruce Rauner has been visiting schools almost every day for weeks to drive home his message that the Illinois General Assembly must approve a funding bill by the end of this month for kindergarten through 12th grade. Rauner wants to make sure schools open on time, and he often talks about how we need good schools to make sure Illinoisans can get quality, high-paying jobs. But much of the best job training is being done by community colleges, and the Republican governor vetoed their budget last year. He also vetoed the budget for four-year universities, which companies
 large and small rely on for white-collar workers. And he vetoed money for scholarships for kids from impoverished families who are trying to make a generational step-up." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d4113c6dfcb90149112411a61c4657e914098df06a6c8294f0c 

SPURNED THIS ROUND AGENDA -- "Where Rauner's Proposals Stand as Legislative Session Winds Down," by AP: "Gov. Bruce Rauner's vision of a grand two-year budget compromise with Illinois lawmakers is diminishing as the clock ticks down on this year's legislative session. The Republican has asked for pro-business and union-weakening proposals and other legislative changes as part of a budget compromise. While he remains optimistic he can get a deal done before the spring session ends May 31, Democrats who control the Legislature have been largely dismissive of his ideas. Any post-session spending plan will require three-fifths support from each chamber, rather than a simple majority, making it
 harder to end the budget standoff that's now in its eleventh month." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41c764d3e2c1e49036ee424a1b63c562c9f60d5b0f49a59d1a 

BLAGO VS. TRUMP -- "Trump and Blagojevich loom large in Illinois Senate race," by Daily Herald's Mike Riopell: "As the candidates in Illinois' hot U.S. Senate race try to define each other, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and imprisoned former Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich are set to play a big role. Both incumbent Sen. Mark Kirk and his Democratic challenger, U.S. 

Rep. Tammy Duckworth, are seeking to remind voters of the other's ties to more controversial members of their parties. After a judge ruled last week a trial could go forward involving Duckworth's time as director of the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs under Blagojevich, Kirk's campaign pounced with a new TV ad calling the Hoffman Estates Democrat 'Blagojevich's veterans director.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d418c8947b7fd09ea9335a582e8d63f2a5636838a7158e6fe0c 

OPPORTUNITY LOST -- "Will Illinois missing out on NGA become an election liability?," by Belleville News-Democrat's Joseph Bustos: "The preliminary decision to build the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's western headquarters in St. Louis rather than St. Clair County could become a campaign issue leading up to November's election, some speculate. But others say as long as local politicians are seen as having tried hard to lure NGA and its 3,100 jobs to a site near Scott Air Force Base, voters won't hold it against them. Among the point people who were hoping to deliver the agency to St. Clair County, and are up for re-election in November, were St. Clair County Board Chairman Mark
 Kern, a Democrat; U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, and U.S. Rep. Mike Bost, R-Murphysboro, whose district includes Scott Air Force Base." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41dab9bc17562d6d7b03e8f0fca368e746691f75ca21693538 

EDITORIALS  

POLICY AND FINANCIAL 'ABOMINATION' -- "Contract fight back on agenda," by The News-Gazette: "The 2015 legislative fight involved SB 1229, legislation aimed at undermining Rauner's ongoing negotiations with AFSCME, the powerful union that represents nearly 40,000 state employees. The new bill - mostly, it's the same bill - is HB 580, which was sent to Rauner for his signature in mid-March. Rauner faces a Tuesday (May 17) deadline to take action. He's expected to veto the bill, setting the stage for a big AFSCME rally, lobbying campaign and possible override vote Wednesday in Springfield. No legislators who both understand and care about Illinois' financial future can support this
 legislation. It's an abomination both from a policy and a financial standpoint." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41b7eb462b5154cd4b98d7d38fa5c2d17de7991d8474d5c419 

NOT ENOUGH COULD BE NOTHING AT ALL -- "Our views: Stopgap spending bill not nearly enough," by The Herald & Review: "Gov. Bruce Rauner and the state Legislature once again are balancing the state's checkbook on the backs of those least able to provide for themselves. And while a 'stopgap' spending measure for social service agencies would provide some welcome relief, it's too little too late for the thousands of Illinois residents who pay taxes and expect to receive needed benefits from state programs. Both the House and Senate approved the bill on Thursday and it is now headed to Gov. Bruce Rauner's desk. The Rauner administration expressed some concerns about the measure as it passed
 through both chambers, but Rauner hasn't said whether he will sign the bill." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41e0599439eda913f80a488f084c99267350115f7b720544e7 

'GET BACK TO WORK ... PUBLICLY' -- "Our view: No more tax hikes," by Northwest Herald: "While the bipartisan group of lawmakers also proposed about $2.4 billion in spending cuts, including $400 million from Medicaid and $440 million the state would not pay back to other funds it borrowed from, according to the Associated Press, it did not make any recommendations on Gov. Bruce Rauner's turnaround agenda to make Illinois more business- and jobs-friendly. And it didn't address pension reform. Illinois' five pension systems remain the worst-funded in the nation with a shortfall of more than $110 billion. They are unaffordable, and taxpayers should not take on more of a burden than they already
 have. We urge Rauner and lawmakers to get back to work - and publicly, not behind closed doors - to address the many inefficiencies in state government and to adopt a budget that does not further cripple taxpayers." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41f04ee42ab0592f37ec985f511bea044d712fa48dc3104da8

INDIGESTION -- "Eater.com Editor Placed On Leave After Apologizing for Racist Punk Past," by Gawker's J.K. Trotter: "Eater.com, a popular food and restaurant website owned by Vox Media, placed an editor named Nick Solares on leave for at least one week, effective immediately, after he apologized for participating in New York City's skinhead punk rock scene in the 1980s, according to several sources with knowledge of the decision. The suspension came a week after former associates of Solares began sending reporters (including several at Gawker) links and photos documenting his past life as a skinhead. On Wednesday, Solares published an apology and explanation of his past on Eater, where he
 had recently been promoted to the position of Restaurant Editor." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41be3ae169b9fa5be865886f3d6a70f9a791a4bb148df35297 

PUTTING OUT FIRES -- "Facebook's Zuckerberg to meet conservatives on political bias flap," by Reuters' Marcy Nicholson: "Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg will meet this week with prominent conservatives in the media, a spokesman said on Sunday, to address allegations of political bias at the popular social networking site. Some 12 'conservative thought leaders' will join the meeting with Zuckerberg on Wednesday, a Facebook spokesman said. Among the invitees are media personality Glenn Beck, Fox News Channel's 'The Five' co-host Dana Perino and Zac Moffatt, co-founder of Targeted Victory, a technology company that aims to bring transparency to media buying."

BIAS, NOW TRENDING -- "Facebook is going to get more politically biased, not less," by Vox's Ezra Klein: "Gizmodo's report that Facebook's ;trending; box was curated by a liberal-leaning staff that suppressed stories from conservative outlets hit like a bomb.

** A message from VoteVets Action Fund: Strong prevailing wage laws are like a minimum wage for skilled construction workers. Because veterans work in construction at higher rates than non-veterans, prevailing wage laws enable hundreds of thousands of veterans to put their battle-tested leadership and problem solving skills to work building our communities while providing a good life for their families. Unfortunately, in the last two years, at least eleven states (including Illinois) have considered repealing or weakening their prevailing wage laws, which would hurt our economy and drive thousands of veterans out of their jobs and into poverty. Our nation's heroes deserve better from our
 elected officials. Stand with veterans and sign our petition for the strong prevailing wage laws that help our veterans and their families. - http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41a2f739030b3122baec8c54446961a0cdea355b3c2222b974 **

</b> is calling for an elected board that would oversee, manage and hold accountable operations and contracts at O'Hare and Midway airports. The union has been meeting with aldermen over the last week pushing the idea and a Tuesday morning new conference is scheduled. <b>First look at the details in POLITICO:</b> <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41d223c360d0c6eb59e9c3beac7561341bfac019b55c73bd76" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1TgYV3l</a> <b> </b> </p><p><b>ON THE STATE SIDE
</b> -- There's big political news with Democratic Rep. Jack Franks announcing on Sunday that he will not seek a new term in the Statehouse. Instead, Franks is moving toward a McHenry County Board bid. This is significant because Franks represents a frequent &quot;no&quot; vote on the Democratic side in the House, including on budgets his party has put forward. In an interview with Illinois Playbook on Sunday, Franks said one benefit of his moving out of the way: the so-called Democratic supermajority would reveal itself to be false. Franks has managed to win in a strongly held GOP district, so there's a stronger chance for Republicans to reclaim that seat.  </p><p><b>THE QUOTE: 
</b>&quot;It's a lonely voice screaming in the wind at this point.&quot; -- Franks<b> </b>on trying to stick it through in Springfield </p><p><b>How it works: </b>Franks said Democrats have until August to put a new name on the ballot. Franks vowed not to take part in any ploy that would involve his stepping down early before the election so the party could give someone a leg up. He also ruled out protecting the seat, winning, then stepping down after he's reelected.  </p><p><b>Why county chair:
</b> &quot;Then maybe I can actually get something done for the people. In Springfield, I don't think the dynamic is going to change for quite some time. I've never seen it so bad. Here's an opportunity where people in McHenry County, in leadership, being an executive, I can implement a lot of changes that can help the taxpayers,&quot; Franks said. &quot;What we keep doing is the old Springfield shuffle, 'I'll pass a bill you won't call, you pass a bill I won't call. Then we go and campaign and say what a great job we're doing.'&quot;  </p><p><b>Democratic bench: 
</b>Independence? Executive experience? It's something Democrats are looking for as they are to face a bitter gubernatorial election in 2018. So far, no one has raised his or her hand to go up against deep-pocketed Rauner. But should Franks win the county chair seat, it could quickly propel him high on the Democrats' short list.  </p><p><b>IPRA:
</b> Since we last published, Mayor Rahm Emanuel made news in a Sun-Times op-ed, announcing he was scrapping the Independent Police Review Authority, a move he had been pushed to make early on given the agency's miserable track record with holding accountable.

</b> &quot;When police and paramedics arrived at her aunt's apartment in Carol Stream, Adrianna Diana told them she and her friend Christopher Houdek had cooked and shot up heroin the night before. Diana, 20, said she awoke covered in vomit, with Houdek, 21, next to her, unresponsive and 'cool to the touch.' Her aunt called 911. Paramedics rushed Houdek to a hospital, where he died. The DuPage County coroner ruled his 2013 death an accident by 'heroin intoxication.' But prosecutors decided it was homicide - and charged Diana and two heroin dealers.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41b5806bc8dfe7f842b5e11b50cbea15109c678fb2a2411a1a" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/23U61wp</a>  </p><p>

</b> &quot;I'm starting to realize there was another-perhaps even more significant-consequence of the mayor's creative gerrymandering that's only now becoming apparent. Many of the near north side's remaining industrial sites were stuffed into one easy-to-control ward. And whether the mayor intended this or not, he's now benefitting from it. This includes the 28-acre Lincoln Park site of the recently demolished Finkl Steel plant, which the mayor's eager to rezone from industrial to commercial and/or residential use, so his salivating developer pals can build high-end shops, condos-anything. Just get that noisy industrial stuff out of the near north side-now!&quot;

</b>&quot;After a lobbying campaign by Mayor Ed Lee, 'Star Wars' creator George Lucas is once again looking to San Francisco as a possible home for a museum housing his collection of illustrative art and Hollywood memorabilia - this time on a site already approved for development on Treasure Island. Lucas has renewed his interest in the city because his latest museum proposal - for a futuristic structure on the shores of Lake Michigan in Chicago - is on life support.

Craver:
</b> &quot;Ending months of speculation, Democratic state Rep. Jack Franks announced his candidacy for McHenry County Board Chairman, setting up what is sure to be a fierce race for the first-ever election for the seat. But while the move gives the McHenry County Republican Party a hard fight for what was an uncontested race, it also gives the GOP a chance to reclaim the 63rd Illinois House District seat that Franks said he is relinquishing to run for chairman instead. Franks, of Marengo, made the announcement Sunday morning, shortly after the Democratic Party of McHenry County voted to slate him to run against Republican nominee Michael Walkup. Walkup, a County Board member from Crystal
 Lake, narrowly defeated incumbent Chairman Joe Gottemoller, R-Crystal Lake, in the March 15 primary ... </p><p><b>'Franks has handily defeated</b> every candidate thrown at him. But his decision to withdraw and focus on the chairman race gives the GOP a better shot at a pickup through candidate Steven Reick, of Harvard.

Unlike the total tactician that is Madigan-at this point in his career, does he give a damn about anything other than doing what it takes to win the next election?-Cullerton seems to remember that his North Side voters sent him to Springfield to get stuff done.

<b>NO DOLLARS, NO SENSE -- &quot;Making sense out of Rauner's position on education funding,&quot; by Rich Miller for Crain's: 
</b>&quot;Gov. Bruce Rauner has been visiting schools almost every day for weeks to drive home his message that the Illinois General Assembly must approve a funding bill by the end of this month for kindergarten through 12th grade. Rauner wants to make sure schools open on time, and he often talks about how we need good schools to make sure Illinoisans can get quality, high-paying jobs. But much of the best job training is being done by community colleges, and the Republican governor vetoed their budget last year. He also vetoed the budget for four-year universities, which companies large and small rely on for white-collar workers. And he vetoed money for scholarships for kids from impoverished
 families who are trying to make a generational step-up.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d4113c6dfcb90149112411a61c4657e914098df06a6c8294f0c" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1TgfNr1</a> </p><p><b>SPURNED THIS ROUND AGENDA -- &quot;Where Rauner's Proposals Stand as Legislative Session Winds Down,&quot; by AP: 
</b>&quot;Gov. Bruce Rauner's vision of a grand two-year budget compromise with Illinois lawmakers is diminishing as the clock ticks down on this year's legislative session. The Republican has asked for pro-business and union-weakening proposals and other legislative changes as part of a budget compromise. While he remains optimistic he can get a deal done before the spring session ends May 31, Democrats who control the Legislature have been largely dismissive of his ideas. Any post-session spending plan will require three-fifths support from each chamber, rather than a simple majority, making it harder to end the budget standoff that's now in its eleventh month.&quot;

He's expected to veto the bill, setting the stage for a big AFSCME rally, lobbying campaign and possible override vote Wednesday in Springfield.

</b>&quot;Gov. Bruce Rauner and the state Legislature once again are balancing the state's checkbook on the backs of those least able to provide for themselves. And while a 'stopgap' spending measure for social service agencies would provide some welcome relief, it's too little too late for the thousands of Illinois residents who pay taxes and expect to receive needed benefits from state programs. Both the House and Senate approved the bill on Thursday and it is now headed to Gov. Bruce Rauner's desk. The Rauner administration expressed some concerns about the measure as it passed through both chambers, but Rauner hasn't said whether he will sign the bill.&quot;

</b>&quot;While the bipartisan group of lawmakers also proposed about $2.4 billion in spending cuts, including $400 million from Medicaid and $440 million the state would not pay back to other funds it borrowed from, according to the Associated Press, it did not make any recommendations on Gov. Bruce Rauner's turnaround agenda to make Illinois more business- and jobs-friendly. And it didn't address pension reform. Illinois' five pension systems remain the worst-funded in the nation with a shortfall of more than $110 billion. They are unaffordable, and taxpayers should not take on more of a burden than they already have. We urge Rauner and lawmakers to get back to work - and publicly, not behind
 closed doors - to address the many inefficiencies in state government and to adopt a budget that does not further cripple taxpayers.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41f04ee42ab0592f37ec985f511bea044d712fa48dc3104da8" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1TggLDy</a> </p><p><b>ELSEWHERE </b> </p><p><b>INDIGESTION -- &quot;Eater.com Editor Placed On Leave After Apologizing for Racist Punk Past,&quot; by Gawker's J.K. Trotter: 
</b>&quot;Eater.com, a popular food and restaurant website owned by Vox Media, placed an editor named Nick Solares on leave for at least one week, effective immediately, after he apologized for participating in New York City's skinhead punk rock scene in the 1980s, according to several sources with knowledge of the decision. The suspension came a week after former associates of Solares began sending reporters (including several at Gawker) links and photos documenting his past life as a skinhead. On Wednesday, Solares published an apology and explanation of his past on Eater, where he had recently been promoted to the position of Restaurant Editor.&quot;

Some 12 'conservative thought leaders' will join the meeting with Zuckerberg on Wednesday, a Facebook spokesman said.

<b>BIAS, NOW TRENDING -- &quot;Facebook is going to get more politically biased, not less,&quot; by Vox's Ezra Klein: </b>&quot;Gizmodo's report that Facebook's ;trending; box was curated by a liberal-leaning staff that suppressed stories from conservative outlets hit like a bomb. The revelation has been greeted with outrage, and rightly so: 'Trending' shouldn't be an ideological concept ... The CEO's attention to the problem of biased curators should be enough to solve it. But here's the truth: Facebook - at least as people really experience it - is likely to get more biased, not less, as a result of this controversy.&quot;

</b>Strong prevailing wage laws are like a minimum wage for skilled construction workers. Because veterans work in construction at higher rates than non-veterans, prevailing wage laws enable hundreds of thousands of veterans to put their battle-tested leadership and problem solving skills to work building our communities while providing a good life for their families. Unfortunately, in the last two years, at least eleven states (including Illinois) have considered repealing or weakening their prevailing wage laws, which would hurt our economy and drive thousands of veterans out of their jobs and into poverty. Our nation's heroes deserve better from our elected officials. Stand with
 veterans and sign our petition for the strong prevailing wage laws that help our veterans and their families. - <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41a2f739030b3122baec8c54446961a0cdea355b3c2222b974" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/24Kgd0c</a> **</p><p><i><b>SUBSCRIBE to Illinois Playbook: <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41c3287a4a274cd9638bd589bc9a1f504c6732046f84611186" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1NTMQid</a></b></i>   <br><br><b>FOR MORE</b> political and policy news from <b>POLITICO Illinois</b>, visit: <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=a201940a46f07d41e53ec7b9cb6e12badb08dec2e5d8f10805456d754f17e581" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1Ln6sIF </a><br>  <br> <b>SUBSCRIBE</b> to the Playbook family: <b>POLITICO Playbook:</b>
