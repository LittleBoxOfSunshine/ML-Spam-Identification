Hi all =97 A few of these to send next week. Let me know if you have any fl=

When I was just a kid, I learned that a job was about more than just a payc=
heck. It=92s about respect and dignity and knowing that at the end of the d=
ay working hard means having a chance to get ahead.

<LINK>NAME, everyone who works hard and plays by the rules deserves to be p=
aid fairly. And it=92s up to us to make that a reality. </LINK>

Raising the standard of living for working families is one of the most impo=
rtant economic issues facing folks in every corner of this country. It=92s =
why we=92ve fought so hard together for minimum wage increases, why the pre=
sident expanded overtime protections for millions of workers, and why we al=
l work to protect the rights our workers have to unionize and negotiate for=
 a fair wage. We've got all this progress to protect, and a hell of a lot m=
ore work to do to make sure we=92re creating a level playing field.

We=92ve got an opportunity in November to elect leaders who will fight with=
 us to expand opportunity so that every person in this country has a chance=
 to succeed. And we=92ve got to take it, NAME. So if you=92re with me, and =
ready to keep working for our workers, then add your name and say you=92re =
in to do whatever it takes to win on November 8th:

LINK

Our resilience will carry us through to some major breakthroughs for famili=
es all across this country. I know we can make this happen, together.

Thanks, NAME.

Seventy-four straight months of private-sector job growth, nearly 15 millio=
n new jobs in six years, more than 20 million folks with access to affordab=
le health care, our deficit cut in half =97 we=92ve come an awful long way =
through the course of President Obama=92s time in the White House.

But with Donald Trump as the GOP's presumptive nominee for president, every=
 bit of the progress that we=92ve made together these past seven years is o=
n the line. <LINK>The stakes in this election simply could not be higher.<L=
INK>

Trump's values have absolutely no business anywhere near the White House. B=
ut I've gotta tell you, NAME -- with Republican governors and members of Co=
ngress lining up behind Trump, there are a lot of races we need to win on E=
lection Day.

So, NAME, you better believe I'm fired up and ready to do whatever it takes=
 to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot. If you feel the same way, =
then add your name right now [DONORS ALT: then pitch in $10 or more to help=
 us stop Donald Trump right away]:

Thank you so much for this, NAME.

I want to make something very, very clear: Now that Donald Trump will be th=
e Republican nominee, our voices are more important than ever.

We know that the more folks hear what Democrats believe in, the better our =
candidates do. And thanks to the past seven years under president Barack Ob=
ama, we=92ve seen much change we can inspire and make happen when we work t=
ogether in support of those common values.

So I know that, together, we are going to beat Donald Trump. If you=92re re=
ady to put a Democratic president in the White House this November, add you=
r name right now:

This is important work we=92re doing. So thank you, NAME.
