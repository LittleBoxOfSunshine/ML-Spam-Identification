You know best what it takes to grow your business and create jobs.

That's why Congress needs to know what you think are the top business =
priorities they should take up before the end of the year.

> Will you take our quick survey?
> http://action.businessfwd.org/page/s/Priorities

As the Obama Administration and the 114th Congress enter their final =
months, the House and the Senate still have time to act on key legislative =
initiatives. To make the most of these months, Congress needs to know what =
issues business leaders think are the most important.

The voices of business leaders like you can help break the gridlock in =
Congress.=20

Take our quick 2-question survey about the business priorities you think =
Congress should focus on.
> http://action.businessfwd.org/page/s/Priorities

We'll share your responses (anonymously if you wish) with members of =
Congress. They could inform legislation and may even become law to help =
other business leaders like you across the country.

Whether it's healthcare, trade, transportation infrastructure, or =
something else, let us know what issues matter most to you and your =
business's bottom line.

Thanks,

Ami Copeland
Executive Director
Business Forward
