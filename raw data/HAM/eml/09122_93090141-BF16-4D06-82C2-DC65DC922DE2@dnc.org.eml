DNC Chair Statement on Tonight=92s Primary Results

WASHINGTON - DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statem=
ent on tonight=92s Indiana primary results:

=93Next stop, GOP convention chaos. Even a last-ditch VP pick from the desp=
erate Cruz campaign this week couldn=92t derail Dangerous Donald, who picke=
d up another batch of delegates tonight. Now that Trump is just a hair=92s-=
breadth away from the Republican nomination, it=92s official =96 this was t=
he GOP=92s worst week yet.

=93Trump proudly embraced endorsements from Bobby Knight, a chair-thrower w=
ith a history of misogyny, and Mike Tyson, a convicted rapist. Ted Cruz dod=
ged questions about being called =91Lucifer in the flesh=92 by a former Rep=
ublican Speaker of the House. And just this morning, Trump insinuated that =
Cruz=92s father was involved in the assassination of JFK. It=92s no wonder =
the Republican Party is less popular than it=92s been in more than two deca=
des.

=93Meanwhile, Democratic voters are proud of their candidates and it shows =
each time they go to the polls. Last week, in Connecticut and Pennsylvania =
respectively, 67% and 71% of Democrats reported feeling energized by our pr=
imary. I want to congratulate both of our candidates for continuing to run =
spirited, substantive campaigns worthy of the American people. Today it=92s=
 clearer than ever, we must and we will elect a Democrat as our next comman=
der in chief.=94
