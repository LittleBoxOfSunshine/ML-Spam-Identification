Hi Luis,

As you know, we're planning to roll out the narrative at the convention. As
part of that, we want to produce a toolkit with the content that we can
give to Democratic communicators who are going to use it regularly in their
jobs. We're thinking state party staff, comms staffs from the various
committees, and others who would make sense.

Could you help us identify who you think would benefit from something like
that? Not necessarily specific names, but groups/types of people. We want
to get a rough count for printing, so we'd love your help in fleshing out
who we should be producing these for and who could really put them to use.

Let me know. Thanks!
