By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)

Good Monday morning, and huge thanks to the two Celebrity Guest Playbookers -- Ben Smith, one of the great journalistic innovators, and Marc Caputo, master of Florida politics - who held down the fort while I spent a few days in Maine fishing, four-wheeling and eating fried food. 

VEEP INTRIGUE - "Castro moves to stop VP fire from the left," by Isaac Dovere: "Targeted by progressive activists hoping to kill his chances of being picked as Hillary Clinton's running mate, Juli&aacute;n Castro is set this week to announce changes to what's become a hot-button [HUD] program for selling bad mortgages on its books. ... Castro's actions could potentially defuse an issue that activists have been using to question his progressive credentials." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f851763564116ae39a5982d2bf417d39c523e63909d95fee03a 

PLAYBOOK IN-BOX - MATT McDONALD, Hamilton Place Strategies partner, McKinsey alumnus, associate communications director in George W. Bush White House, and senior counselor on GOP campaigns: "I've always thought of establishment as those who put winning #1 and ideology #2, and I've thought of the grassroots as putting ideology #1 and winning #2.

"Now, it's the establishment that seems to be having ideological reservations and the grassroots who are embracing someone who doesn't adhere to the norms of conservative thought. Not sure that winning is actually part of the thinking here at all for anyone."

LOOK FOR A WAVE of stories like this ... "On more than one issue, GOP's Trump sounds like a Democrat," by AP's Jill Colvin, with Lisa Lerer in D.C.: "[O]n ... trade and national defense, the billionaire businessman could even find himself running to the left of Hillary Clinton ... Trump is a classic Republican in many ways. He rails against environmental and corporate regulations, proposes dramatically lower tax rates." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f855a1cbb463a6767d24d8ccd8cd5f058a437b0013fbecef8dc

--Kansas City Star, "Trade policy issues are blurring old lines, turning politics in 2016 inside out," by Dave Helling: "Free-trade Republicans are becoming protectionist, while some Democrats are moving the opposite direction on exports and imports. The flip-flops are making it harder to reach consensus in Washington." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f85d53ed748a44c1e06ff7f060d9a931867b2502701466187a0

MONEY HONEYS -- "In Koch World 'Realignment,' Less National Politics," by National Review's Tim Alberta and Eliana Johnson: "[T]he brothers' political decision-making [is] increasingly being influenced by their business and public-relations interests, and ... their investments in electoral politics at the federal level [ARE] diminishing." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f85f2ffff84b2cfbb97dd66ba5d271b5bfc6578f2f81f14695f

CLINTON STRATEGERY - "Clinton caught in end-of-the-primary trap ... [N]eeds to start focusing on Donald Trump. But she can't ... without alienating Bernie Sanders' supporters," by Gabe Debenedetti: "Republicans are getting a head start on November ... Democrats may have an unprecedented opportunity to win over the significant number of GOP voters ... and the Clinton campaign is unable to take full advantage. ... [S]he has held just two open events in Ohio and Virginia in recent weeks, intent on remaining in places with upcoming primaries lest she appear to be looking too far beyond Sanders." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f85a5148715fee63f721f6fb6e48ac4b83f412f2b42c3223630

JUST POSTED - "The return of John Boehner: The ex-speaker, far from receding into retirement, is making headlines and set to barnstorm the country to elect House Republicans," by Jake Sherman: "The former House speaker will spend late July and all of August on a cross-country bus trip raising money and campaigning for House Republicans ... The trip - on Boehner's bus, dubbed 'Freedom One' - will begin after the [RNC] in Cleveland and end Labor Day weekend."  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f85036922dba611deb83a066e47f3d1bceb3d36699e074dbcdb 

--"Trump backers face 'scam PAC' charges," by Politico Influence's Isaac Arnsdorf and Ken Vogel: "An increasing number of unauthorized groups are invoking the presumptive GOP nominee's name to raise money, suggesting that they'll use the cash to support his campaign, even as some appear to be spending most of their money on contracts with favored consultants. Trump's campaign and its allies worry that the groups are doing little to help the campaign, and may be doing more harm than good by siphoning off cash that would otherwise go to the campaign's fledgling fundraising effort." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f85dd2f3b2757675041ff3a79fc307f8303be4c48578ab2021b

[CEO Mark Thompson:] 'I don't see why we shouldn't aspire to a digital subscriber count [overseas] of many millions' ... NYT Global ... will be looking at developing new editorial products around certain topics with broad global appeal, like climate change, technology, gender identity and urban life." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f850b566035cb9bc351ceb6b58a545de510fd37df1a82060f59

--"60 Minutes' honors correspondent Morley Safer as he retires," by AP Television Writer Frazier Moore: "The tribute marked the close of a 61-year career for Safer, who, according to the program, has had the longest-ever run on prime-time television. CBS announced his retirement last week. ... Safer's first report on '60 Minutes' in 1970 was about the training of U.S. Sky Marshals. His 919th and last, a profile of Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, was broadcast in March. At 84 and dealing with health issues, Safer had cut back on work in recent years. The Toronto-born Safer was the first Saigon bureau chief for CBS News." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f859586cbf26f24db6596a86b60a0b7086175624d34ac0437b8 ... Video of 60 Minutes'

JUICY READ - "Gossip Girl: Fifty years ago, Rona Barrett forged a Hollywood gossip empire. Then she left it all behind, her innovations attributed to others, her legacy almost entirely overlooked. But as she nears 80, there's very little Miss Rona regrets," by BuzzFeed News Features Writer Anne Helen Petersen: "Barrett slowly but fundamentally altered the type of information we consider newsworthy, blurring the distinction between hard and soft 'news' so thoroughly that it's never been rebuilt." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f8544758996b9bbf234605cdf1e18a08244aa25f7b2de23e6de

BEN TERRIS in Columbus, WashPost Style section lead, "Ben Carson as surrogate: First do no harm?": "Not long ago, Donald Trump stood on a stage in front of thousands of Iowans accusing Carson of fabricating parts of his life story, calling him 'pathological' and comparing him to a child molester. No big deal, Carson says today. He didn't take it personally. 'It just means he's like a typical politician,' Carson said ... 'Other politicians might not be as colorful, but they do the same things.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f85c8554168f2184e02a19dc4350b2ae4ed8015722c53ddfbde 

OBAMA's COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS at Rutgers on Sunday where he hit Trump without uttering his name and also urged students to welcome debate and not "shut your ears off" to opposing opinions: "The world is more interconnected than ever before, and it's becoming more connected every day. Building walls won't change that. ... We live in an age of global supply chains, and cargo ships that crisscross oceans, and online commerce that can render borders obsolete. And a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed ... jobs shipped overseas, trade deals that sometimes put workers and businesses at a disadvantage. But the answer isn't to stop trading with other
 countries. In this global economy, that's not even possible. ... 

"Facts, evidence, reason, logic, an understanding of science -- these are good things. (Applause.) These are qualities you want in people making policy. These are qualities you want to continue to cultivate in yourselves as citizens. ... In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. (Applause.) It's not cool to not know what you're talking about. (Applause.) That's not keeping it real, or telling it like it is. (Laughter.) That's not challenging political correctness. That's just not knowing what you're talking about. (Applause.) And yet, we've become confused about this. ... [W]hen our leaders express a disdain for facts, when they're not held accountable for repeating falsehoods and
 just making stuff up, while actual experts are dismissed as elitists, then we've got a problem. ...

"If you disagree with somebody, bring them in -- (applause) -- and ask them tough questions. Hold their feet to the fire. Make them defend their positions. (Applause.) If somebody has got a bad or offensive idea, prove it wrong. Engage it. Debate it. Stand up for what you believe in. (Applause.) Don't be scared to take somebody on. Don't feel like you got to shut your ears off because you're too fragile and somebody might offend your sensibilities. Go at them if they're not making any sense. Use your logic and reason and words. And by doing so, you'll strengthen your own position, and you'll hone your arguments. And maybe you'll learn something and realize you don't know everything. And you
 may have a new understanding not only about what your opponents believe but maybe what you believe. Either way, you win."

THOUGHT LEADERS - "The Skills Schools Aren't Teaching But Must," by Michael Bloomberg and Jamie Dimon on Bloomberg View: "While helping more students go to college has been a topic of discussion and is a vitally important goal, what about those who do not go -- or who drop out of high school? They are largely being ignored ... That must change. We will not solve the critical challenges of poverty, underemployment, wage stagnation and bulging prisons unless we get serious about investing in effective programs that prepare kids who are not immediately college-bound for middle-class jobs."

--GENE SPERLING for Politico Magazine, "Trump's Week of Playing with Financial Fire: If he were president right now, the markets would be reeling and interest rates rising in reaction to his comments about debt": "Trump has long said that his private-sector wheeling and dealing would be beneficial experience ... But that image was dealt a harsh blow ... [W]ords like 'poker,' 'crashed' and 'discount' ... just might not be the best thing to do to enhance economic confidence in locating new jobs and investment in the United States." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f8597350c85cfb756f023a15d50967ffd390e64ebb69dadb7b6

 understanding not only about what your opponents believe but maybe what you believe. Either way, you win.&quot; <b><i>Transcript </i></b><a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f85e24086f83a0ec0a970cb32070e03692a533cffa89d59e2df" target="_blank">http://1.usa.gov/23UvPZa</a><i> ...<b> Video </b></i><a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=33d9d4658cbf5f85132e3e5d52f58bd641e8fbfca1001efc7d79922dae666ef0" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1YutFho</a> </p><p><b>THOUGHT LEADERS - &quot;The Skills Schools Aren't Teaching But Must,&quot; by Michael Bloomberg and Jamie Dimon on Bloomberg View:
