Barack Obama rose to prominence as a different kind of Democrat, an outside=
r who was not part of the establishment and who would chart a separate cour=
se. Eight years later, the president finds himself working hard to restore =
a party from which he was once eager to stand apart.

Obama has presided over a greater loss of electoral power for his party tha=
n any two-term president since World War II. And 2016 represents one last o=
pportunity for him to reverse that trend.

But it is also a challenge for the president who has experimented with esta=
blishing his own political base outside the Democratic National Committee a=
nd has downsized the scale of political operations inside the White House.

The first big tests of the rebuilding efforts comes Tuesday in Pennsylvania=
, where Obama is taking the unusual step of wading into two contested Democ=
ratic primaries, endorsing Senate hopeful Katie McGinty and Josh Shapiro, a=
 Montgomery County official and early supporter of his who is hoping to bec=
ome state attorney general.

Should Democrats claim those two offices in the fall, it would represent a =
small dent in what has become a worrisome decline of power for the party be=
low the presidential level under Obama=92s watch.

Between 2008 and 2015, Democrats lost 13 Senate seats, 69 House seats, 913 =
state legislative seats, 11 governorships and 32 state legislative chambers=
, according to data compiled by University of Virginia professor Larry J. S=
abato. The only president in the past 75 years who comes close is Dwight D.=
 Eisenhower, who saw a similar decline for the GOP during his time in offic=
e.

=93The Republican Party is arguably stronger now than they=92ve ever been i=
n 80 years, despite not having the White House,=94 said Simon Rosenberg, a =
longtime Democratic operative and president of NDN, a liberal think tank.

Democrats also are concerned about whether the coalition Obama galvanized i=
n 2008, and then reassembled in 2012, will turn out when he is no longer on=
 the ballot. The current Democratic presidential primary contest has so far=
 fractured that coalition, with young people flocking to Sen. Bernie Sander=
s of Vermont while many voters of color =97 especially older ones =97 back =
former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.

Many factors have contributed to Republicans=92 gains on the state and fede=
ral level, including a concerted push by their donors to target state races=
 and a midterm election that allowed them to lock in favorable congressiona=
l district lines.

Obama=92s defenders contend that after major victories in 2006 and 2008, it=
 was predictable that Democrats would lose significant ground in the midter=
m elections of 2010 and 2014. But, they add, the president=92s two successf=
ul White House bids have vastly upgraded the party=92s voter outreach infra=
structure by expanding the national voter file the Democratic National Comm=
ittee first started in 2006. And they point to the huge increases in the nu=
mber of Democratic campaign volunteers =97 from roughly 252,000 in 2004 to =
2.2 million in 2012 =97 as evidence of that upgrade.

=93Barack Obama has single-handedly modernized the Democrats=92 ability to =
wage campaigns on the local level,=94 said Jim Messina, who managed Obama=
=92s re=ADelection campaign.

Rosenberg agrees, saying that the president built on the work of Bill Clint=
on, the only other two-term Democratic president of the last generation. =
=93Clinton established the intellectual framework for the Democratic Party =
and Obama modernized its politics,=94 Rosenberg said. =93What isn=92t there=
 yet is a large enough set of leaders from the next generation to carry it =
on.=94

Some of Obama=92s earliest decisions continue to reverberate negatively for=
 Democrats.

Organizing for Action (OFA), the nonprofit group that grew out of Obama=92s=
 campaign operation, has continued to compete with the Democratic National =
Committee for Democratic dollars =97 first as a parallel organization withi=
n the DNC and then as a separate entity. In the first six months of 2013, t=
he DNC raised $30.8 million, while OFA raised $13 million. And this was at =
a time when the DNC was carrying more than $18 million in debt.

Those fiscal constraints meant the DNC had to curtail the money it provided=
 to state parties, a practice that DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fl=
a.) reversed in 2015 by increasing the monthly minimum transfer to each sta=
te from $5,000 a month to $7,500.

Close cooperation has taken time; OFA gave the DNC limited access to its li=
st of supporters starting in 2013, but it turned over the entire list only =
in August 2015. Now, according to Nevada Democratic Party chair Roberta Lan=
ge, =93That voter file is used by everyone in our state.=94

While many OFA volunteers have focused on local referendums and other local=
 political battles, the group has earned the enmity of some party stalwarts=
 for diverting resources. During a 2010 gathering of Democratic governors i=
n Washington, according to multiple attendees, one governor asked a senior =
presidential political adviser, =93Will the OFA please join the Democratic =
Party?=94

But this White House, unlike that of Bill Clinton, has always kept its poli=
tical operation on a separate track.

Under Clinton, the political affairs office boasted roughly a dozen people =
=97 in addition to the deputy chief of staff who oversaw political affairs =
=97 and the president got a political briefing once a week.

By contrast, Obama limited election activity in the White House, a reflecti=
on of both his desire to keep any scandal at bay and the influence of White=
 House chief of staff Denis McDonough, who has little campaign experience o=
utside of working on Obama=92s first presidential bid.

Obama phased out the political affairs office after two years to move the o=
peration to his Chicago campaign headquarters. He appointed David Simas, wh=
o directs the White House Office of Political Strategy and Outreach, to his=
 current position only in January 2014, after congressional Democrats compl=
ained they did not have a direct White House contact for political matters.

Obama=92s senior political advisers from his first term =97 Messina, David =
Plouffe and David Axelrod, among others =97 have left to focus on ventures =
in the private sector and academia and scaled back their involvement in day=
-to-day Democratic politics.

Plouffe said it was natural for veteran strategists to move on, but acknowl=
edged that Obama=92s relationship with his top political operatives didn=92=
t automatically translate to other candidates. =93You don=92t do your best =
work being a mercenary,=94 said Plouffe, now a strategic adviser to the car=
 service firm Uber.

He added that it will take the commitment of wealthy Democratic donors =97 =
not just top party officials =97 to target state contests the way Republica=
ns have. =93I think we all agree something has to be done,=94 he said. =93T=
he question is how. It=92s not going to be the DNC.=94

Obama, for his part, has set limits for what he will do in connection with =
super PACs while in office. While he did fundraising events for the one tha=
t backed his reelection campaign, Priorities USA, McDonough and Obama=92s l=
awyers curtailed what the president would do two years later for the Senate=
 Majority PAC, a similar entity supporting Senate Democrats.

In an April 2014 memo to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.)=
, the PAC=92s counsel, Marc E. Elias, stipulated that to avoid any conflict=
 of interest Obama would not actually ask potential Senate Majority PAC don=
ors for money even when appearing at one of the group=92s events. After mak=
ing this point on the memo=92s first page, he reiterated two pages later, w=
ith underlined emphasis: =93Again, to be clear: the President will not soli=
cit contributions at or in connection with any of these meetings.=94

After a protracted and bitter exchange, Reid=92s aides abandoned their effo=
rt to involve Obama in any more than a few super PAC events, and the presid=
ent agreed to transfer $5 million from the DNC to both the Democratic Senat=
orial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committe=
e in the fall of 2014. During the 2012 cycle, the DNC made no transfers to =
the two committees.

But with his popularity high among Democrats and no election ahead of him, =
Obama has been working to shore up his party, both financially and politica=
lly. And his aides say Obama has turned controversial issues, including imm=
igration, gay rights and climate change, to the Democrats=92 advantage.

=93He will be aggressive, from the presidential level down to the state and=
 local representative level,=94 Simas said. =93There=92s going to be a Demo=
cratic nominee and Democratic candidates. They are the ones who are going t=
o be driving the campaigns, and the president will be there to be as helpfu=
l as possible.=94

Recently in Dallas, before dozens of guests who had each given thousands of=
 dollars to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Obama diagnosed o=
ne of the problems: =93Democrats just aren=92t very good at focusing on dow=
n-ballot races,=94 he said, according to two participants.

The president may have been stating the obvious. But it reflected a shift i=
n thinking among Democrats, who are working furiously to shore up state-lev=
el candidates to avoid getting beaten once again on redistricting. Since 20=
13, Obama has devoted considerable time to fundraising for the DNC and both=
 congressional committees, doing more than 100 events for the DNC alone.

Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, =
said that when he asked Obama to make a series of primary endorsements this=
 cycle, including one of McGinty, =93He just did it with no muss, no fuss, =
in a very great way.=94

In December, the heads of three party committees met to develop a joint red=
istricting strategy, and Obama signed a redistricting fundraising appeal fo=
r the Democratic Governors Association in January. Even former members such=
 as Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) have been asked to attend fundraisers on be=
half of state lawmakers in states such as Ohio.

=93We have to be better and smarter about playing that long game and making=
 those investments,=94 said Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), adding that while H=
ouse Democrats will have =93a very strong wind at their backs=94 this year,=
 =93The day after this election, we have to understand that the wind=92s go=
ing to be in our faces.=94

In 2014, many Democrats in conservative states were eager to tap Obama=92s =
fundraising prowess but were reluctant to appear side-by-side with a presid=
ent with sagging popularity ratings. Already, 2016 is different.

Longtime Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said that for a long time Demo=
crats wanted Obama=92s resources =97 including money and analytics =97 =93b=
ut they didn=92t want his presence.=94 When she called the White House last=
 year to ask if the president would do robocalls to African American voters=
 during Louisiana=92s special election for governor, White House officials =
seemed surprised that Democrat John Bel Edwards even wanted their help. Bra=
zile assured them that he did.

And Democrats increasingly believe that they will need Obama in the fall to=
 regain some of the ground they=92ve lost since 2008.

=93Part of his legacy is to rebuild the bench,=94 Brazile said.

Democratic Congressional Committee Chairman Ben Ray Luj=E1n (N.M.) said in =
an interview that the president will help in unifying the Democratic base.

=93He=92s going to help boost turnout in November, which is critical when y=
ou=92re winning races on the margins,=94 Luj=E1n said.
