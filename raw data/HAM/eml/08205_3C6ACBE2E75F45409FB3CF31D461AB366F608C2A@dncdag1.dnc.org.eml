Roundtable

Most questions we got were negative regarding Cruz picking Carly as his running mate.
Rove - Indiana could be the deciding factor. If Trump won Indiana could be all but over. Nothing better to stop the negativity and stop some of the Trump coverage than by announcing your running mate.
Guilfoyle - you have to make daring attempts to move forward. Hopefully this will motivate women. Pence's endorsement wasn't ringing enough - Bobby Knight's endorsement got more coverage. Right now momentum is with Trump and Fiorina is a game changer.

Indiana primary poll.
Trump - 49
Cruz - 34
Kasich - 13
Isn't this race over?
George Will - another poll as Cruz up 16 points. A lot of people voted early in Indiana before the Kasich-Cruz pact. Indiana politics has been convulsive by social issues. Indiana has the nations highest percentage of manufacturing GDP, so in sum, the state is thriving.

If Trump wins, is the race over?
George Will - yes
Karl Rove - something about delegates

If we do end up with a Clinton Trump general election, conventional wisdom says Clinton wins. But conventional wisdom has been wrong all year.
The polls have been consistent in Trump versus Clinton, and the general election voter is far more diverse.
You have a democratic advantage built into the electoral college.
Rove - its an ugly path to 270 for the republicans
By the time we get to July, 80% of the campaign season is over and most people have developed their opinions

Ted Cruz

I want to start with some unusual steps from your campaign. Kasich deal. You like to rail against the Washington Cartel, but isn't this the essence of a cartel deal?
It is very simple, he made a decision about allocation of resources, and I made a decision about the allocation of resources.
Kasich and I disagree on some policy issues, but we don't want HRC to be president, and a Trump candidacy would guarantee that.

But sir, it is a deal. Kasich's chief strategist called you a liar on twitter.
Look, the people of Indiana care about jobs, coal.
Mike Pence
Pete Wilson, who is going to decide this whole thing

Outsourcing is a big issue in Indiana. Carrier Air Conditioning just announced they are shipping jobs overseas. Is Carly going to do the same as she did at HP?
Carly has an incredible business record.
When it comes to bringing jobs back to America there couldn't be a clearer contrast between me/Carly, Trump/Hillary
It's a travesty they are sending jobs overseas, but its bc of the Obama administration.
It's the response of big government liberals

Plays clip of Carly attacking Ted
Look chris, she was a competitor in the primary. Recalls Reagan / GWHB

Lucifier in the flesh. Pete King says "I hate Ted Cruz." Jugg Craig said XXXXX. You are more polarizing than Trump - (good clip to save for videos)
I don't know John Boehner, and he also praised HRC and Trump in the same sentence
Trump needs to stop pretending to be an outside
Boehner is made at me because I fought against the deals he was cutting with Obama

Cruz fundraising email says that Indiana is absolutely pivotal. If you don't win in Indiana, is this race over?
Indiana is incredibly important, but at the end of the day, Trump isn't going to get to 1237. It's a battle of who is going to get the majority of the delegates. We are both going to go to the convention with a lot of delegates.
Mike Tyson, tough guy - rapists aren't tough guys

Trump

Demonstrations disrupting campaign?
I didn't see the riot,
They were professional agitators
An amazing evening
Where we had 31,000 people
Record setting crowd

You have angered a lot of people. Hispanics have a 15% favorable...
Those numbers are going up
I have knocked off people like Jeb Bush.
Once I start on Hillary these numbers will change
One by one, I won
Watch what happens with Hillary and watch what happens with my numbers
Kasich and Cruz haven't been hit with ads
Last two polls have me tied with Hillary and one has me winning

Women on Trump. 24% favorite, 75% unfavorable. Plays clip of the women card.
I only tell the truth.
With all of the polls coming out, I win with the women

But aren't you being dismissive of her record?
Bernie Sanders has said worse than that.  He shouldn't even be running because of what she said
Even women don't like her
She is playing the women's card
I don't think she will play it well, I will let you know in six months

Foreign policy speech. Mixed reviews. One was a contradiction on how you handle the Middle East.
You have a big fat mess.
We have spent $4B from when the first gunshot was fired.
Our country is becoming third world.
Long Island Railroad is a mess.
Keep the oil. ISIS has Libyan oil.
Every move we have made in the middle east has been wrong.

You sound like a liberal democrat when you want to spend money at home rather than overseas. As a general election candidate, it sounds like you would be criticizing Hillary Clinton from the left.
I want to take care of our country. Education, vets, infrastructure.

Will HRC be the hawk in this race?
No, I will be much tougher than her, and I will have much more respect than her.
We are defending South Korea and others with nothing in return.

POTUS took shots at you last night at WHCD. He said you could close Guantanamo because you are good at running waterfront properties into the ground.
Well I guess I am good at something bc I made $10B with a $1M loan.
He did a nice job, but it was fun.

Plays clip of Cruz discussing Mike Tyson. Which is interesting, reaction?
Just shows what a liar he is. It was just an internet endorsement.
This is why we call him Lyin' Ted Cruz.
Look we have Bobby Knight's endorsement
Mike Pence gave ME more of an endorsement than Ted Cruz

Indiana?
The race is already over
