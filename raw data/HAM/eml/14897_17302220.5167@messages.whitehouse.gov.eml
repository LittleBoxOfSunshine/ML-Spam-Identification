THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate ReleaseMay 6, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

ON THE ECONOMY=20



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room





**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.



12:16 P.M. EDT





 THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, everybody. Seven years ago, in April of 2=
009, our economy lost nearly 700,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate hit =
9 percent on its way to 10 percent.=20



Seven years later, in April 2016, our economy added 160,000 new jobs. Tha=
t makes April the 74th consecutive month of private sector job growth in =
America. Over that record streak of job growth, our businesses have creat=
ed 14.6 million new jobs in all. Wages have been rising at an annual rate=
 of more than 3 percent this year.



So the *unemployment rate [economy] has been growing, unemployment has be=
en falling, and wages have been rising. But the global economy, as many p=
eople here are aware, is not growing as fast as it should be. You're stil=
l seeing lagging growth in places like Europe, Japan, and now China. Here=
 in the United States, there are folks out there who are still hurting. A=
nd so we've got to do everything we can to strengthen the good trends and=
 to guard against some dangerous trends in the global economy. And if the=
 Republican Congress joined us to take some steps that are pretty common-=
sense, then we could put some additional wind at the backs of working Ame=
ricans.



To create new jobs, they should invest in our infrastructure -- our roads=
, our bridges, our schools, our water mains. Some of you joined me when I=
 went to Flint this week. It was a great example of the kind of work that=
 is out there to be done. And we could be putting people all across this =
country back to work, with huge multiplier effects across the economy, if=
 we started investing in the infrastructure that will make us more produc=
tive.



To reward some of the hardest-working people in America, Congress should =
raise the minimum wage. This is something that would not only help those =
individuals who are getting a bigger paycheck, but it also means theyre s=
pending more, and that would be a boost to business.



To level the playing field for American workers and crack down on unfair =
foreign competition, they should pass smart new trade agreements.



And Congress should reform our tax code to promote growth and job creatio=
n, which includes closing wasteful loopholes and simplifying the tax code=
 for everybody.=20



I've been talking about this for a while. Only Congress can fully close t=
he loopholes that wealthy individuals and powerful corporations all too o=
ften take advantage of, often at the expense of middle-class families. If=
 theyre getting out of paying their fair share of taxes, that means that =
the rest of us have to shoulder that burden. And Ive put forward plans re=
peatedly to do exactly that -- close loopholes, make sure that everybody =
is paying their fair share, which would not only give people greater conf=
idence in the system, but would be good for our economy. It would make su=
re that families and small businesses -- who don't have fancy lawyers and=
 fancy accountants -- are being treated the same as big corporations who =
do.



I think it's fair to say the Congress will not act on a big tax reform pl=
an before the election that would shut down some of these loopholes. But =
what my administration has been doing is to look for steps that we can ta=
ke on our own to make the tax system fair.

=20

In recent months, weve seen just how big a problem corruption and tax eva=
sion have become around the globe. We saw what happened with the release =
of the Panama Papers, and we've seen the degree to which both legal pract=
ices of tax avoidance that are still unfair and bad for the economy, as w=
ell as illegal practices that, in some cases, involve nefarious activitie=
s continue to exist and to spread. So combating this kind of tax evasion =
and strengthening the global financial system have been priorities of min=
e since I took office. And theyre part of our broader, ongoing efforts to=
 make sure the rules arent rigged and our economy works for everybody.=20=




Let me give you an example. Here at home, weve made our tax code fairer a=
nd asked the wealthiest Americans to start paying their fair share. And l=
ast month, the Treasury Department took action to prevent more corporatio=
ns from taking advantage of a tax loophole that let them shift their addr=
ess abroad just to avoid paying taxes in America -- taxes that they right=
fully owe.=20



Weve taken several steps to make sure that our law -- our tax laws are en=
forced, including leading efforts to crack down on offshore evasion. And =
as a result, thousands of individuals have come forward to disclose offsh=
ore accounts and pay the taxes that they owe, along with interest and pen=
alties.=20



Today, were building on those efforts. And I believe that youve heard fro=
m Treasury, but I wanted to amplify what theyve told you in detail.=20



Number one, we are requiring banks and other financial institutions to kn=
ow, verify, and report who the real people are behind shell corporations =
that set up accounts at those institutions. One of the main ways that com=
panies avoid taxes, or wealthy individuals avoid taxes, is by setting up =
a bunch of shell corporations and making it harder to trace where monies =
are flowing and what taxes are owed. We're saying to those financial inst=
itutions, youve got to step up and get that information.=20



Second, were plugging a gap in our tax rules that foreigners can exploit =
to hide their assets to evade taxes. The Treasury Department and the IRS =
are issuing a proposed rule to make sure foreigners cannot hide behind an=
onymous shell companies formed inside the United States.=20



Now, these actions are going to make a difference. They will allow us to =
continue to do a better job of tracking financial flows and making sure t=
hat people are paying the taxes that they owe, rather than using shell co=
rporations and offshore accounts to avoid doing the things that ordinary =
Americans, hardworking Americans are doing every day, and that's making s=
ure that theyre paying their fair share.=20



Having said that, we're not going to be able to complete this job unless =
Congress acts as well. So Im calling on Congress to pass new legislation =
that requires all companies formed inside the United States to report inf=
ormation about their real owners to the Treasury Departments Financial Cr=
imes Enforcement Network. Thats going to help law enforcement better inve=
stigate and prevent financial crimes. Im calling on Congress to provide t=
he Justice Department with additional tools to investigate corruption and=
 money launderers. And Im calling on the Senate --in particular, Senator =
Rand Paul, whos been a little quirky on this issue -- to stop blocking th=
e implementation of tax treaties that have been pending for years. And th=
ese treaties actually improve law enforcements ability to investigate and=
 crack down on offshore tax evasion. And I'm assuming that's not somethin=
g that hes in favor of.



So we're going to need to cooperate internationally because tax evasion, =
tax avoidance, money laundering -- these things are all taking place in a=
 global financial system, and if we can't cooperate with other countries =
it makes it harder for us to crack down.=20



If we can combine the actions that we're taking administratively with the=
 new tools that I'm asking Congress to provide the Justice Department and=
 Treasury, these actions will prevent tax evasion, theyll prevent money l=
aundering, theyll prevent terrorist financing. And theyll, most important=
ly, uphold a fundamental principle of our economy -- in America, no matte=
r how wealthy or powerful, you should play by the same set of rules as ev=
erybody else.=20



All right. Thanks. I'm going to take a couple questions with that. Lets s=
ee -- Jeff. Yes -- since you're now the incoming president of the White H=
ouse Correspondents. (Laughter.)=20



Q Thank you, sir. Mr. President, whats your reaction to Donald Trump beco=
ming the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party this week? And given=
 the delegate math, do you think it's time for Bernie Sanders to step asi=
de on the Democratic side?



THE PRESIDENT: Well, with respect to the Republican process and Mr. Trump=
, theres going to be plenty of time to talk about his positions on variou=
s issues. He has a long record that needs to be examined, and I think it'=
s important for us to take seriously the statements hes made in the past.=
=20



But most importantly -- and I speak to all of you in this room as reporte=
rs, as well as the American public -- I just want to emphasize the degree=
 to which we are in serious times and this is a really serious job. This =
is not entertainment. This is not a reality show. This is a contest for t=
he presidency of the United States.=20



And what that means is that every candidate, every nominee needs to be su=
bject to exacting standards and genuine scrutiny. It means that you got t=
o make sure that their budgets add up. It means that if they say they got=
 an answer to a problem that it is actually plausible and that they have =
details for how it would work. And if it's completely implausible and wou=
ld not work, that needs to be reported on. The American people need to kn=
ow that. If they take a position on international issues that could threa=
ten war, or has the potential of upending our critical relationships with=
 other countries, or would potentially break the financial system, that n=
eeds to be reported on.



And the one thing that I'm going to really be looking for over the next s=
ix months is that the American people are effectively informed about wher=
e candidates stand on the issues, what they believe, making sure that the=
ir numbers add up, making sure that their policies have been vetted and t=
hat candidates are held to what theyve said in the past.=20



And if that happens, then I'm confident our democracy will work. And that=
's true whether we're talking about Mr. Trump or Ms. Clinton, or Bernie S=
anders, or anybody else. But what I'm concerned about is the degree to wh=
ich reporting and information starts emphasizing the spectacle and the ci=
rcus, because that's not something we can afford. And the American people=
, theyve got good judgment, theyve got good instincts, as long as they ge=
t good information.=20



All right?



Q And on Sanders dropping out?



THE PRESIDENT: I think on the Democratic side, lets let the process play =
itself out. You mentioned the delegate math. I think everybody knows what=
 that math is. I think Senator Sanders has done an extraordinary job rais=
ing a whole range of issues that are important to Democratic voters as we=
ll as the American people, generally. And I know that at some point there=
s going to be a conversation between Secretary Clinton and Bernie Sanders=
 about how we move towards the convention.=20



The good news is that despite the fact that during the course of primarie=
s everybody starts getting a little chippy -- I've been through this, it'=
s natural, sometimes even more with the staffs and supporters than with t=
he candidates themselves -- the good news is, is that theres a pretty str=
ong consensus within the Democratic Party on the vast majority of issues.=
=20



Theres some disagreement about tactics. Theres some disagreement about po=
litical strategy or policy nuance. But both Secretary Clinton and Bernie =
Sanders believe that every American should have health care. So do I. Bot=
h candidates believe that we should be raising the minimum wage. Both can=
didates believe that we should invest in our infrastructure and put more =
people back to work. Both candidates believe that we should pass a compre=
hensive immigration reform policy that makes sure we're enforcing laws an=
d improving our legal immigration system and making sure our borders are =
secure, but also that we continue to enjoy the incredible boost that we g=
et from attracting talent from all around the world. Both candidates agre=
e that we should be prudent in terms of how we use our military and that =
we should care for our veterans when they come home.



So if you look at 95 percent of the issues, theres strong agreement there=
. You don't see the same kinds of divisions between the two Democratic ca=
ndidates that remain that youve been seeing in some of the Republican deb=
ates.



Yes.



Q Mr. President, what do Speaker Ryans comments tell you about the state =
of the Republican Party? And how would you advise your fellow Democrats w=
ho appear to have to now run against Donald Trump as to how they can win =
in November?



THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think you have to ask Speaker Ryan what the implic=
ations of his comments are. There is no doubt that there is a debate that=
's taking place inside the Republican Party about who they are and what t=
hey represent.=20



Their standard bearer at the moment is Donald Trump. And I think not just=
 Republican officials, but more importantly, Republican voters are going =
to have to make a decision as to whether this is the guy who speaks for t=
hem and represents their values.=20



I think Republican women voters are going to have to decide, is that the =
guy I feel comfortable with in representing me and what I care about. I t=
hink folks who, historically, have been concerned about making sure that =
budgets add up and that we are responsible stewards of government finance=
s have to ask, does Mr. Trumps budgets work. Those are going to be questi=
ons that Republican voters, more than Republican officials have to answer=
.



And as far as Democrats, I think we run on what we're for, not just on wh=
at we're against. For the last seven and a half years, we've been pretty =
clear about what we believe will help working families who are struggling=
 out there. And although it has been difficult to get through Republican =
Congresses to get those things done, the truth is, is that they continue =
to be prescriptions that would really help people.=20



Making sure that families get paid sick leave and family leave and early =
childhood education -- that would help families. Raising the minimum wage=
 would help a lot of people. Rebuilding infrastructure would put back to =
work a whole bunch of guys in hardhats and gals in hardhats that need to =
work. And those are good jobs that can't be exported. Now is the time to =
do it.



So I want Democrats to feel confident about the policy prescriptions we'r=
e putting forward, and the contrast, I think, will be pretty clear. I'll =
leave it up to the Republicans to figure out how they square their circle=
.



All right. I'm going to take two more questions.=20



Q Mr. President, whats your message to Democratic voters who have yet to =
cast their vote, who may be hesitant to vote for the Democratic frontrunn=
er because of the ongoing email scandal and investigation? And also, did =
you see Donald Trumps taco bowl tweet, and your thoughts on it?



THE PRESIDENT: I have no thoughts on Mr. Trumps tweets. As a general rule=
, I don't pay attention to Mr. Trumps tweets. And I think that will be tr=
ue I think for the next six months. So you can just file that one. (Laugh=
ter.)=20



In terms of the Democratic vote coming up, I'm going to let the voters ca=
st their ballots and not try to meddle in the few primaries that are rema=
ining. Let the process play itself out. We'll know soon enough. It's not =
going to be that much longer.



Q I wanted to ask you one on infrastructure. Not long before your nuclear=
 summit where you had 50 world leaders here, the D.C. metro was closed fo=
r over 24 hours. You, at the White House Correspondents Dinner, made note=
 that youll soon be sort of a more ordinary District resident. I'm wonder=
ing what that says that the Nations Capital, their own metro system was c=
losed for 24 hours, and its having a number of safety-related problems. A=
nd what can your administration do, if Republicans are standing in the wa=
y of an infrastructure bill, specifically for the D.C. metro, to potentia=
lly provide more funding or any more support for such a critical service?=




THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I know this is a somewhat self-interes=
ted question, I assume, because a bunch of folks here take the metro. (La=
ughter.) But it is just one more example of the under-investments that ha=
ve been made.=20



Look, the D.C. metro, historically, has been a great strength of this reg=
ion, but over time, we underinvested in maintenance and repair. And the s=
teps that are being taken now I'll refer to the Department of Transportat=
ion. But I can say that obviously safety comes first and we want to make =
sure that if there are safety concerns that theyre addressed.=20



The broader issue, though, is we've got bridges, we've got roads, we have=
 ports, we have airports, we have water mains and pipes -- as we saw in F=
lint -- that suffer from neglect. And in many parts of the country, we're=
 still relying on systems that were built 30, 50, in some cases 100 years=
 ago. And the reason we've been neglecting them is not because we don't k=
now how to fix them. It's not because people haven't been aware of the ne=
ed. We've known for years now that we're a trillion or two trillion dolla=
rs short in terms of necessary infrastructure repair.



I talked about this when I came into office and sought to do more in term=
s of investing in our nations infrastructure. The problem we have is that=
 the Republican Congress has been resistant to really taking on this prob=
lem in a serious way. And the reason is, is because of an ideology that s=
ays government spending in necessarily bad.=20



And I addressed this when I was in Flint. That mindset, that ideology has=
 led to us not investing in those things that we have to do together. As =
you point out, this metropolitan area, the Nations Capital, economically =
is actually doing really well. But it doesnt matter how big your paycheck=
 is if youve been taking the metro and suddenly it's shut down for a mont=
h. And now you're stuck in traffic, trying to drive to work instead.



You can't build your own metro system. You can't build your own highway. =
You can't build your own airport. And so we have a specific problem with =
under-investing in infrastructure. Now is the time, by the way, for us to=
 do so. Interest rates are so low, and there are so many contractors and =
construction workers that are underemployed at the moment that you can ac=
tually get jobs done on time, on schedule. It would give a boost to our o=
verall economy, because we know that when we spend a dollar in infrastruc=
ture, then we actually get a bigger bang for the buck in terms of the eco=
nomy overall.=20



Surrounding businesses, suppliers, food trucks -- everybody does better. =
And it gives a huge boost to the economy and it lasts for a long time. Th=
ink about the investments we made in things like the Hoover Dam, or the G=
olden Gate Bridge, or metro. It's a good thing to do. And it, historicall=
y, was not, and should not be, partisan. But if we have a mindset that sa=
ys whatever government is doing must be bad, then these are going to be t=
he results.=20



And it's going to continue to get worse. It's already tough in poorer com=
munities, like Flint. But we're seeing these kinds of infrastructure prob=
lems spring up in communities all across the country. And it doesnt disti=
nguish by race or by region. Everybody needs roads. Everybody needs airpo=
rts.=20



So, hopefully, this will prompt a conversation. The last thing I'm going =
to say about this -- this is a good example of making sure that the candi=
dates are speaking to this issue as you go into the presidential election=
. I put forward very specific proposals for how I would pay for additiona=
l infrastructure investment. The numbers add up. And so the question is, =
how do the remaining candidates for the presidency intend to tackle this?=
 How do members of Congress intend to tackle this? Whats the Republican a=
genda for infrastructure? Do they have one? How are they going to pay for=
 it? Do they pay for it by cutting Medicare or Medicaid? If they do, that=
 needs to be fleshed out. And the consequences for working families needs=
 to be explained.



All right? Thank you, everybody.

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:<a name=3D"_G=
oBack"></a>&nbsp; Good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; Seven years ago, in Apri=
l of 2009, our economy lost nearly 700,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate =
hit 9 percent on its way to 10 percent.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Seven years later, in Apr=
il 2016, our economy added 160,000 new jobs.&nbsp; That makes April the 74t=
h consecutive month of private sector job growth in America.&nbsp; Over tha=
t record streak of job growth, our businesses
 have created 14.6 million new jobs in all. Wages have been rising at an an=
nual rate of more than 3 percent this year.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the *<s>unemployment r=
ate</s> [economy] has been growing, unemployment has been falling, and wage=
s have been rising.&nbsp; But the global economy, as many people here are a=
ware, is not growing as fast as it should
 be.&nbsp; You're still seeing lagging growth in places like Europe, Japan,=
 and now China.&nbsp; Here in the United States, there are folks out there =
who are still hurting.&nbsp; And so we've got to do everything we can to st=
rengthen the good trends and to guard against some
 dangerous trends in the global economy. And if the Republican Congress joi=
ned us to take some steps that are pretty common-sense, then we could put s=
ome additional wind at the backs of working Americans.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">To create new jobs, they =
should invest in our infrastructure -- our roads, our bridges, our schools,=
 our water mains.&nbsp; Some of you joined me when I went to Flint this wee=
k.&nbsp; It was a great example of the kind of
 work that is out there to be done.&nbsp; And we could be putting people al=
l across this country back to work, with huge multiplier effects across the=
 economy, if we started investing in the infrastructure that will make us m=
ore productive.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">To reward some of the har=
dest-working people in America, Congress should raise the minimum wage.&nbs=
p; This is something that would not only help those individuals who are get=
ting a bigger paycheck, but it also means
 they&#8217;re spending more, and that would be a boost to business.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">To level the playing fiel=
d for American workers and crack down on unfair foreign competition, they s=
hould pass smart new trade agreements.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And Congress should refor=
m our tax code to promote growth and job creation, which includes closing w=
asteful loopholes and simplifying the tax code for everybody.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I've been talking about t=
his for a while.&nbsp; Only Congress can fully close the loopholes that wea=
lthy individuals and powerful corporations all too often take advantage of,=
 often at the expense of middle-class families.&nbsp;
 If they&#8217;re getting out of paying their fair share of taxes, that mea=
ns that the rest of us have to shoulder that burden.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve p=
ut forward plans repeatedly to do exactly that -- close loopholes, make sur=
e that everybody is paying their fair share, which
 would not only give people greater confidence in the system, but would be =
good for our economy.&nbsp; It would make sure that families and small busi=
nesses -- who don't have fancy lawyers and fancy accountants -- are being t=
reated the same as big corporations who
 do.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think it's fair to say =
the Congress will not act on a big tax reform plan before the election that=
 would shut down some of these loopholes.&nbsp; But what my administration =
has been doing is to look for steps that
 we can take on our own to make the tax system fair.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In recent months, we&#821=
7;ve seen just how big a problem corruption and tax evasion have become aro=
und the globe.&nbsp; We saw what happened with the release of the Panama Pa=
pers, and we've seen the degree to which both legal
 practices of tax avoidance that are still unfair and bad for the economy, =
as well as illegal practices that, in some cases, involve nefarious activit=
ies continue to exist and to spread.&nbsp; So combating this kind of tax ev=
asion and strengthening the global financial
 system have been priorities of mine since I took office.&nbsp; And they&#8=
217;re part of our broader, ongoing efforts to make sure the rules aren&#82=
17;t rigged and our economy works for everybody.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Let me give you an exampl=
e.&nbsp; Here at home, we&#8217;ve made our tax code fairer and asked the w=
ealthiest Americans to start paying their fair share.&nbsp; And last month,=
 the Treasury Department took action to prevent more
 corporations from taking advantage of a tax loophole that let them shift t=
heir address abroad just to avoid paying taxes in America -- taxes that the=
y rightfully owe.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We&#8217;ve taken several=
 steps to make sure that our law -- our tax laws are enforced, including le=
ading efforts to crack down on offshore evasion.&nbsp; And as a result, tho=
usands of individuals have come forward to disclose
 offshore accounts and pay the taxes that they owe, along with interest and=
 penalties.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Today, we&#8217;re buildi=
ng on those efforts.&nbsp; And I believe that you&#8217;ve heard from Treas=
ury, but I wanted to amplify what they&#8217;ve told you in detail.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Number one, we are requir=
ing banks and other financial institutions to know, verify, and report who =
the real people are behind shell corporations that set up accounts at those=
 institutions.&nbsp; One of the main ways
 that companies avoid taxes, or wealthy individuals avoid taxes, is by sett=
ing up a bunch of shell corporations and making it harder to trace where mo=
nies are flowing and what taxes are owed.&nbsp; We're saying to those finan=
cial institutions, you&#8217;ve got to step
 up and get that information.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Second, we&#8217;re plugg=
ing a gap in our tax rules that foreigners can exploit to hide their assets=
 to evade taxes.&nbsp; The Treasury Department and the IRS are issuing a pr=
oposed rule to make sure foreigners cannot hide
 behind anonymous shell companies formed inside the United States.&nbsp; <o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, these actions are go=
ing to make a difference.&nbsp; They will allow us to continue to do a bett=
er job of tracking financial flows and making sure that people are paying t=
he taxes that they owe, rather than using
 shell corporations and offshore accounts to avoid doing the things that or=
dinary Americans, hardworking Americans are doing every day, and that's mak=
ing sure that they&#8217;re paying their fair share.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Having said that, we're n=
ot going to be able to complete this job unless Congress acts as well.&nbsp=
; So I&#8217;m calling on Congress to pass new legislation that requires al=
l companies formed inside the United States to
 report information about their real owners to the Treasury Department&#821=
7;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.&nbsp; That&#8217;s going to help =
law enforcement better investigate and prevent financial crimes.&nbsp; I&#8=
217;m calling on Congress to provide the Justice Department
 with additional tools to investigate corruption and money launderers.&nbsp=
; And I&#8217;m calling on the Senate &#8211;--in particular, Senator Rand =
Paul, who&#8217;s been a little quirky on this issue -- to stop blocking th=
e implementation of tax treaties that have been pending
 for years. And these treaties actually improve law enforcement&#8217;s abi=
lity to investigate and crack down on offshore tax evasion.&nbsp; And I'm a=
ssuming that's not something that he&#8217;s in favor of.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we're going to need to=
 cooperate internationally because tax evasion, tax avoidance, money launde=
ring -- these things are all taking place in a global financial system, and=
 if we can't cooperate with other countries
 it makes it harder for us to crack down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">If we can combine the act=
ions that we're taking administratively with the new tools that I'm asking =
Congress to provide the Justice Department and Treasury, these actions will=
 prevent tax evasion, they&#8217;ll prevent
 money laundering, they&#8217;ll prevent terrorist financing.&nbsp; And the=
y&#8217;ll, most importantly, uphold a fundamental principle of our economy=
 -- in America, no matter how wealthy or powerful, you should play by the s=
ame set of rules as everybody else.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All right.&nbsp; Thanks.&=
nbsp; I'm going to take a couple questions with that.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see=
 -- Jeff.&nbsp; Yes -- since you're now the incoming president of the White=
 House Correspondents.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
 you, sir.&nbsp; Mr. President, what&#8217;s your reaction to Donald Trump =
becoming the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party this week?&nbsp; A=
nd given the delegate math, do you think it's time for Bernie Sanders
 to step aside on the Democratic side?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well=
, with respect to the Republican process and Mr. Trump, there&#8217;s going=
 to be plenty of time to talk about his positions on various issues.&nbsp; =
He has a long record that needs to be examined, and
 I think it's important for us to take seriously the statements he&#8217;s =
made in the past.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But most importantly -- a=
nd I speak to all of you in this room as reporters, as well as the American=
 public -- I just want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious t=
imes and this is a really serious job.&nbsp;
 This is not entertainment.&nbsp; This is not a reality show.&nbsp; This is=
 a contest for the presidency of the United States.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And what that means is th=
at every candidate, every nominee needs to be subject to exacting standards=
 and genuine scrutiny.&nbsp; It means that you got to make sure that their =
budgets add up.&nbsp; It means that if they say
 they got an answer to a problem that it is actually plausible and that the=
y have details for how it would work.&nbsp; And if it's completely implausi=
ble and would not work, that needs to be reported on.&nbsp; The American pe=
ople need to know that.&nbsp; If they take a position
 on international issues that could threaten war, or has the potential of u=
pending our critical relationships with other countries, or would potential=
ly break the financial system, that needs to be reported on.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the one thing that I'=
m going to really be looking for over the next six months is that the Ameri=
can people are effectively informed about where candidates stand on the iss=
ues, what they believe, making sure
 that their numbers add up, making sure that their policies have been vette=
d and that candidates are held to what they&#8217;ve said in the past.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And if that happens, then=
 I'm confident our democracy will work.&nbsp; And that's true whether we're=
 talking about Mr. Trump or Ms. Clinton, or Bernie Sanders, or anybody else=
.&nbsp; But what I'm concerned about is the degree
 to which reporting and information starts emphasizing the spectacle and th=
e circus, because that's not something we can afford.&nbsp; And the America=
n people, they&#8217;ve got good judgment, they&#8217;ve got good instincts=
, as long as they get good information.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All right?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And o=
n Sanders dropping out?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I th=
ink on the Democratic side, let&#8217;s let the process play itself out.&nb=
sp; You mentioned the delegate math.&nbsp; I think everybody knows what tha=
t math is.&nbsp; I think Senator Sanders has done an extraordinary
 job raising a whole range of issues that are important to Democratic voter=
s as well as the American people, generally.&nbsp; And I know that at some =
point there&#8217;s going to be a conversation between Secretary Clinton an=
d Bernie Sanders about how we move towards
 the convention.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The good news is that des=
pite the fact that during the course of primaries everybody starts getting =
a little chippy -- I've been through this, it's natural, sometimes even mor=
e with the staffs and supporters than
 with the candidates themselves -- the good news is, is that there&#8217;s =
a pretty strong consensus within the Democratic Party on the vast majority =
of issues.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">There&#8217;s some disagr=
eement about tactics.&nbsp; There&#8217;s some disagreement about political=
 strategy or policy nuance.&nbsp; But both Secretary Clinton and Bernie San=
ders believe that every American should have health care.&nbsp;
 So do I.&nbsp; Both candidates believe that we should be raising the minim=
um wage.&nbsp; Both candidates believe that we should invest in our infrast=
ructure and put more people back to work.&nbsp; Both candidates believe tha=
t we should pass a comprehensive immigration reform
 policy that makes sure we're enforcing laws and improving our legal immigr=
ation system and making sure our borders are secure, but also that we conti=
nue to enjoy the incredible boost that we get from attracting talent from a=
ll around the world.&nbsp; Both candidates
 agree that we should be prudent in terms of how we use our military and th=
at we should care for our veterans when they come home.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So if you look at 95 perc=
ent of the issues, there&#8217;s strong agreement there.&nbsp; You don't se=
e the same kinds of divisions between the two Democratic candidates that re=
main that you&#8217;ve been seeing in some of the Republican
 debates.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Yes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. P=
resident, what do Speaker Ryan&#8217;s comments tell you about the state of=
 the Republican Party?&nbsp; And how would you advise your fellow Democrats=
 who appear to have to now run against Donald Trump as to how
 they can win in November?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well=
, I think you have to ask Speaker Ryan what the implications of his comment=
s are.&nbsp; There is no doubt that there is a debate that's taking place i=
nside the Republican Party about who they are
 and what they represent.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Their standard bearer at =
the moment is Donald Trump.&nbsp; And I think not just Republican officials=
, but more importantly, Republican voters are going to have to make a decis=
ion as to whether this is the guy who speaks
 for them and represents their values.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think Republican women =
voters are going to have to decide, is that the guy I feel comfortable with=
 in representing me and what I care about.&nbsp; I think folks who, histori=
cally, have been concerned about making sure
 that budgets add up and that we are responsible stewards of government fin=
ances have to ask, does Mr. Trump&#8217;s budgets work.&nbsp; Those are goi=
ng to be questions that Republican voters, more than Republican officials h=
ave to answer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And as far as Democrats, =
I think we run on what we're for, not just on what we're against.&nbsp; For=
 the last seven and a half years, we've been pretty clear about what we bel=
ieve will help working families who are struggling
 out there.&nbsp; And although it has been difficult to get through Republi=
can Congresses to get those things done, the truth is, is that they continu=
e to be prescriptions that would really help people.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Making sure that families=
 get paid sick leave and family leave and early childhood education -- that=
 would help families. Raising the minimum wage would help a lot of people.&=
nbsp; Rebuilding infrastructure would put
 back to work a whole bunch of guys in hardhats and gals in hardhats that n=
eed to work.&nbsp; And those are good jobs that can't be exported.&nbsp; No=
w is the time to do it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I want Democrats to fe=
el confident about the policy prescriptions we're putting forward, and the =
contrast, I think, will be pretty clear.&nbsp; I'll leave it up to the Repu=
blicans to figure out how they square their
 circle.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All right.&nbsp; I'm goin=
g to take two more questions.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. P=
resident, what&#8217;s your message to Democratic voters who have yet to ca=
st their vote, who may be hesitant to vote for the Democratic frontrunner b=
ecause of the ongoing email scandal and investigation?&nbsp; And
 also, did you see Donald Trump&#8217;s taco bowl tweet, and your thoughts =
on it?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I ha=
ve no thoughts on Mr. Trump&#8217;s tweets.&nbsp; As a general rule, I don'=
t pay attention to Mr. Trump&#8217;s tweets.&nbsp; And I think that will be=
 true I think for the next six months.&nbsp; So you can just file that
 one.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In terms of the Democrati=
c vote coming up, I'm going to let the voters cast their ballots and not tr=
y to meddle in the few primaries that are remaining.&nbsp; Let the process =
play itself out.&nbsp; We'll know soon enough.&nbsp;
 It's not going to be that much longer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wan=
ted to ask you one on infrastructure.&nbsp; Not long before your nuclear su=
mmit where you had 50 world leaders here, the D.C. metro was closed for ove=
r 24 hours.&nbsp; You, at the White House Correspondents Dinner,
 made note that you&#8217;ll soon be sort of a more ordinary District resid=
ent.&nbsp; I'm wondering what that says that the Nation&#8217;s Capital, th=
eir own metro system was closed for 24 hours, and it&#8217;s having a numbe=
r of safety-related problems.&nbsp; And what can your administration
 do, if Republicans are standing in the way of an infrastructure bill, spec=
ifically for the D.C. metro, to potentially provide more funding or any mor=
e support for such a critical service?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well=
, first of all, I know this is a somewhat self-interested question, I assum=
e, because a bunch of folks here take the metro.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Bu=
t it is just one more example of the under-investments
 that have been made.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Look, the D.C. metro, his=
torically, has been a great strength of this region, but over time, we unde=
rinvested in maintenance and repair.&nbsp; And the steps that are being tak=
en now I'll refer to the Department of Transportation.&nbsp;
 But I can say that obviously safety comes first and we want to make sure t=
hat if there are safety concerns that they&#8217;re addressed.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The broader issue, though=
, is we've got bridges, we've got roads, we have ports, we have airports, w=
e have water mains and pipes -- as we saw in Flint -- that suffer from negl=
ect.&nbsp; And in many parts of the country,
 we're still relying on systems that were built 30, 50, in some cases 100 y=
ears ago.&nbsp; And the reason we've been neglecting them is not because we=
 don't know how to fix them.&nbsp; It's not because people haven't been awa=
re of the need.&nbsp; We've known for years now
 that we're a trillion or two trillion dollars short in terms of necessary =
infrastructure repair.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I talked about this when =
I came into office and sought to do more in terms of investing in our natio=
n&#8217;s infrastructure.&nbsp; The problem we have is that the Republican =
Congress has been resistant to really taking on
 this problem in a serious way.&nbsp; And the reason is, is because of an i=
deology that says government spending in necessarily bad.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I addressed this when=
 I was in Flint.&nbsp; That mindset, that ideology has led to us not invest=
ing in those things that we have to do together.&nbsp; As you point out, th=
is metropolitan area, the Nation&#8217;s Capital, economically
 is actually doing really well. But it doesn&#8217;t matter how big your pa=
ycheck is if you&#8217;ve been taking the metro and suddenly it's shut down=
 for a month.&nbsp; And now you're stuck in traffic, trying to drive to wor=
k instead.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">You can't build your own =
metro system.&nbsp; You can't build your own highway.&nbsp; You can't build=
 your own airport.&nbsp; And so we have a specific problem with under-inves=
ting in infrastructure.&nbsp; Now is the time, by the way,
 for us to do so. &nbsp;Interest rates are so low, and there are so many co=
ntractors and construction workers that are underemployed at the moment tha=
t you can actually get jobs done on time, on schedule.&nbsp; It would give =
a boost to our overall economy, because we
 know that when we spend a dollar in infrastructure, then we actually get a=
 bigger bang for the buck in terms of the economy overall.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Surrounding businesses, s=
uppliers, food trucks -- everybody does better.&nbsp; And it gives a huge b=
oost to the economy and it lasts for a long time.&nbsp; Think about the inv=
estments we made in things like the Hoover Dam,
 or the Golden Gate Bridge, or metro. It's a good thing to do.&nbsp; And it=
, historically, was not, and should not be, partisan.&nbsp; But if we have =
a mindset that says whatever government is doing must be bad, then these ar=
e going to be the results.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And it's going to continu=
e to get worse.&nbsp; It's already tough in poorer communities, like Flint.=
&nbsp; But we're seeing these kinds of infrastructure problems spring up in=
 communities all across the country.&nbsp; And it doesn&#8217;t
 distinguish by race or by region.&nbsp; Everybody needs roads.&nbsp; Every=
body needs airports.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, hopefully, this will =
prompt a conversation.&nbsp; The last thing I'm going to say about this -- =
this is a good example of making sure that the candidates are speaking to t=
his issue as you go into the presidential
 election.&nbsp; I put forward very specific proposals for how I would pay =
for additional infrastructure investment.&nbsp; The numbers add up.&nbsp; A=
nd so the question is, how do the remaining candidates for the presidency i=
ntend to tackle this?&nbsp; How do members of Congress
 intend to tackle this?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the Republican agenda for infras=
tructure?&nbsp; Do they have one?&nbsp; How are they going to pay for it?&n=
bsp; Do they pay for it by cutting Medicare or Medicaid?&nbsp; If they do, =
that needs to be fleshed out. And the consequences for working
 families needs to be explained.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All right?&nbsp; Thank yo=
u, everybody.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
