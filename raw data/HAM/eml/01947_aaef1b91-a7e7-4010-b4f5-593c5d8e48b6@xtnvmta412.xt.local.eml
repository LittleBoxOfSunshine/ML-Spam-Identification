TED LETTER DAY: And then there were two. 

TED CRUZ left the GOP nomination fight tonight, a move that leaves Republicans' presidential hopes in the hands of DONALD TRUMP. As POLITICO's Katie Glueck and Shane Goldmacher report, Cruz's exit makes it a near certainty Trump will be the Republican nominee, even as Ohio Gov. JOHN KASICH pledged to stay in the race until Trump received the number of pledged delegates he needs to secure the nomination. 

Cruz's exit came after a furious fight for survival in Indiana, an effort that blended political tactics with some of his harshest, most visceral attacks of the campaign. In the end, Cruz conceded it wasn't enough: "From the beginning I've said that I would continue on as long as there was a viable path to victory," Cruz said, with his wife Heidi by his side. "Tonight I'm sorry to say it appears that path has been foreclosed."

It's Tuesday, Indiana votes and your 2016 Blast is back at it again. Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through the day's campaign news, so send your tips, complaints and your hoop dreams to hjackson@politico.com.

WHAT MATTERS: Here are four more things to do we're watching today - and why they matter. 

2) HOOSIER NOMINEE: Very, very likely DONALD TRUMP. POLITICO's Kyle Cheney breaks down a night of triumph for the nearly presumptive GOP nominee. The contest was called for Trump as soon as polls closed. And he watched TED CRUZ, who launched his most aggressive personal attacks just hours earlier, exit the race. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039fc5f4b53cce7794944efd1f717a94608de26fc1edc17bb6dc In fact, Cruz couldn't even bring himself to mention Trump's name: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039f75183c95fec1b8a901ecf81daf647b64f7bfe52189b73dc8 Trump was more conciliatory: "I have met some of the most incredible competitors that I have ever competed against right here on the Republican Party," the real estate mogul said. "Just so you understand, Ted Cruz, I don't
 know if he likes me or if he doesn't like me, but he's one hell of a competitor." Meanwhile, the Never Trump movement seemed to sink further, as POLITICO's Matthew Nussbaum reports. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039f496ba7ba217780cd280e56f8c954873384cee46584947139 

3) A DURABLE BERN: Just when you think the Democratic race is settling, behold another BERNIE SANDERS upset. The Vermont senator bested HILLARY CLINTON in Indiana, a victory that will not dramatically alter the delegate calculus but may cool calls for him to leave the Democratic race. Speaking in Louisville, Ky., Sanders praised his most loyal constituency: young voters. "I'll tell you what is extremely exciting for me, and that is that in primary after primary, caucus after caucus, we end up winning the vote of people 45 years of age and younger," Sanders said. The calendar also looks pretty good for Sanders, POLITICO's Nick Gass reports, with West Virginia up next on May 10, followed by
 Kentucky and Oregon on May 17. Clinton did not have any election night remarks, but is set to appear in Washington tomorrow. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039f120f175aed6fad3d05e69c592bbb0480a1d7177f6401af53 

BLAST NOTE: It's been said, but let's repeat it: DONALD TRUMP is set to lock up the Republican nomination before HILLARY CLINTON secures the Democratic one. Politics are funny sometimes. 

4) STILL MAKING HIS KAS?: So, TED CRUZ and his more than 500 delegates are gone. But JOHN KASICH, who now trails two candidates no longer running (MARCO RUBIO and TED CRUZ), says he's plowing forward. "Tonight's results are not going to alter Gov. Kasich's campaign plans," read a memo from Kasich chief strategist John Weaver. "Our strategy has been and continues to be one that involves winning the nomination at an open convention." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039ffa4d4eae258beddaaf449f3aacb5710a8a6cfd2aa1b07120 

5) TRUMP FOR JOY: Democrats seemed thrilled at the nearly realized prospect of DONALD TRUMP as the GOP nominee. POLITICO's Daniel Strauss reports the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee immediately pressed Republican Senate candidates to announce whether they support Trump. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039fd04738849a953e9d3e2f433b6da124635691e022cc4f20f1 The first flurry of comments is probably just a preview: Democrats believe that, with Trump at the top of the ticket, they can make gains across the board in November.  

TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Reince Preibus calls for unity, Mark Salter's seen enough, TED CRUZ gets memed and MITT ROMNEY isn't talking about you know who. 

THREE POINT SHOT? POLITICO's Glenn Thrush explains why a potential third party candidacy is one of the possibilities after tonight's election. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039ffd38c3d021ac4bf28d05ae70a1bae5e5a888ce0d6354d5b0 

UNITY TIME: Reince Priebus says it's time for the party to rally around DONALD TRUMP. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039f4058350aeb77d0761402e35cfd710a4b1d99dca1f27b7085 

CANTOR CANDOR: Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor says he underestimated DONALD TRUMP. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039f1c11675f5adfa8591bbc04445cb0d1610a3e5247f84cc460 

BLAST NOTE: He's not alone!

NEVER TWEET: MITT ROMNEY, leader of the Never Trump vanguard, thanks TED CRUZ and doesn't mention you know who. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039f1cf89924bc2c0c827dd009277d0fc0aff009a12f99a899ae 

STILL SALTER: Former John McCain adviser Mark Salter says he'll vote for HILLARY CLINTON. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039fbe5409051c04aad8b6e556362668abe0c761e8e21ccea182 

SLAM DUNK: A retreating TED CRUZ met one of the Internet's most pervasive sports memes. Aye. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039f0be094879278e42b5081ec4c60ebc53a49a0c68bb66d7602 

WHAT'S NEXT: A whole new day. DONALD TRUMP, presumptive Republican nominee, marches forward. JOHN KASICH, still in the race for now, heads West. HILLARY CLINTON and BERNIE SANDERS begin to focus on West Virginia and California, but first Clinton speaks in Washington on Wednesday.

THEY SAID IT: "We gave it everything we got, but the voters chose another path." - TED CRUZ, dropping out of the presidential race. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=05a8ab813b6d039ffb0a88fbba80a29ebab90fcc6075403d6f58dbdde3b8a9dc 

MAGIC NUMBER: 18. That's MARCO RUBIO's delegate lead on JOHN KASICH. Rubio got out of the race almost two months ago.
