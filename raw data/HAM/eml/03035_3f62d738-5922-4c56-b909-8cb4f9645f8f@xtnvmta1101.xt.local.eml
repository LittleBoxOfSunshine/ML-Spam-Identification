Happy Kentucky Derby day! Post time is 6:34 p.m. It's Gold Cup in Virginia. TOMORROW is Mother's Day. It's 72 days to Cleveland, 79 days to Philly, 185 days to election.

PLAYBOOK BREAKFAST - "The GOP's 24-hour meltdown: Trump's promise to unify the Republican Party is in tatters, as an all-out civil war grips the GOP," by Nolan McCaskill, with Katie Glueck, Daniel Strauss, Nick Gass and Brianna Gurciullo: "[A] full-bore GOP civil war has broken out, dividing the party into factions that are providing fresh headaches for Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. Priebus on Friday tried to encourage his fellow Republicans to put down their arms. 

"Sitting down for a one-hour conversation with POLITICO's Mike Allen, [Priebus] repeatedly stated that it's just been three days since Trump became the presumptive nominee, and that it's going to take time for Republicans to absorb their new reality. Priebus said Trump understands that the party has to unify wide blocs of voters, and he dismissed the latest furor over Trump's tweet celebrating Cinco de Mayo with a picture of him tucking into a taco bowl.

"'He's trying, and honestly, he's trying and I will tell you what, I honestly think he understands that building and unifying and growing the party is the only way we're going to win ... I think he gets that.' Playing the role of chief GOP diplomat, Priebus empathized with Ryan." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7aceb2f420f475a000188eb0e441f98fb63bcea980215d14579d

--"Top allies break with Ryan over Trump," by Rachael Bade: "Reps. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia and Dennis Ross of Florida - who, as House whips, help Republican leaders muster support to pass legislation - told POLITICO ... they disagreed with Ryan's decision ... Both lawmakers said they believe their leader is in denial about how Republican voters feel about the real-estate tycoon." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7ace4c960a7a85d6ae8f37c3f813d30401f680f80794bb81af44

--Tampa Bay Times lead story, "Jeb Bush won't vote for Trump ... says he won't vote for Hillary Clinton in November either," by Alex Leary - Bush wrote on his Facebook page: "There is no doubt that he successfully tapped into the deep sense of anger and frustration so many Americans around the country rightfully feel today ... [But he] has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7acec82e56fc4405dc144e61758d7f92cbed73eb73c2545d1211 ...

--N.Y. Times A1, top of col. 1, "RIFT GROWS WIDE AS REPUBLICANS ABANDON TRUMP: PEACE EFFORTS SPURNED -- Senate Candidates Told They Can Skip the Convention," by Alex Burns: "Ward Baker, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said [at a briefing for lobbyists and donors on Thursday that] conventions were a distracting spectacle every four years [and] told Republican lawmakers that they would be better off talking to voters in their home states." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7ace967357f9023a92aa7791e406454a3f2b8199a91009d760ec

--Charleston, S.C. Post and Courier, Sen. Lindsey "Graham: 'Cannot in good conscience support Donald Trump' or Clinton," by Schuyler Kropf: "Graham, R-S.C., is the highest-ranking D.C. lawmaker to reject Trump ... Ryan said ... he cannot yet support Trump's presidential campaign, but he left the door open to come around at a later date. ... 

"Graham expanded on his anti-Trump stance later Friday during an interview with Dana Bash on CNN. 'Eating a taco is probably not going to fix the problems we have with Hispanics.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7acecbf0444e107faf3e619c8a72d833854041dc80f5a81a1729

EPIC CLAPBACK ... "DONALD J. TRUMP RESPONSE TO LINDSEY GRAHAM": "I fully understand why Lindsey Graham cannot support me. If I got beaten as badly as I beat him, and all the other candidates he endorsed, I would not be able to give my support either. Every time I see Lindsey Graham spew hate during interviews I ask why the media never questions how I single-handedly destroyed his hapless run for President. As a candidate who did not receive 1% in his own state -- compared to my victory at nearly 40% with many others in the race -- he has zero credibility. 

"He was a poor representative and an embarrassment to the great people of South Carolina. Judging by the incompetent way he ran his campaign, it is easy to see why his military strategies have failed so badly -- we can't even beat ISIS! While I will unify the party, Lindsey Graham has shown himself to be beyond rehabilitation. And like the voters who rejected him, so will I!"

--Dole statement, released by Trump campaign: "The voters of our country have turned out in record numbers to support Mr. Trump.

NEVER MIND -- @dansenor, re WashPost online story saying Romney "is being courted" by Bill Kristol to run as an independent: "Completely overblown story. The meeting WAS NOT about Romney & an indy run. It WAS Kristol badgering folks abt Sasse." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7ace24ce8209e8bf33f250e747b94b08e38b74edb72f64f2ec5f 

VEEPSTAKES - Atlanta Journal-Constitution p. A1, "Gingrich emerges as a potential VP pick: Former U.S. House speaker has been a forceful advocate for Trump," by Greg Bluestein: "Gingrich has repeatedly said he'd be honored to be considered ... 'I have no idea what his thinking is right now. I don't have any interest in the sense that I'm going to go out and try to become his vice president,' Gingrich told Channel 2 Action News. 'I would obviously have to listen carefully if he called. He's an old friend, and I think any time a potential president calls a citizen, a citizen owes them an obligation.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7ace129f2ab650de2021cb929cc59d05321a3491b961c35f28d2

OBAMA POUNCES -- L.A. Times 2-col. lead, "Trump is the face of GOP, Obama says: President, Clinton and other Democrats seize upon the split among Republicans to attack presumptive nominee," by Christi Parsons: "The fusillade ... has opened the general election with Democrats rushing to frame Trump in a way that his primary opponents aimed for, but mostly stopped short of, to avoid alienating Republican voters.

"'The main mistake for the primary season was assuming that Donald Trump was someone else's responsibility, someone else's fight,' said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist who advised 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney. 'There's little chance the Democrats make that same mistake.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7ace49e0a995165eaf812abd8c4be9c7c24917ec83f5aefe437b

WHAT OBAMA SAID, in response to questions after he made remarks on the economy in the White House press room: "I think you have to ask Speaker Ryan what the implications of his comments are. There is no doubt that there is a debate that's taking place inside the Republican Party about who they are and what they represent. Their standard bearer at the moment is Donald Trump. And I think not just Republican officials, but more importantly, Republican voters are going to have to make a decision as to whether this is the guy who speaks for them and represents their values."

--Asked about Trump's "taco bowl" tweet on Cinco de Mayo: "I have no thoughts on Mr. Trump's tweets. As a general rule, I don't pay attention to Mr. Trump's tweets. And I think that will be true I think for the next six months. So you can just file that one. (Laughter.)"

TIM MILLER on HuffPo's "Candidate Confessionals" podcast -- Sam Stein: "[W]hat stood out to [Tim] Miller was the type of issues that the Bush donors obsessed over. They worried about his clothes. 'It was honestly sartorial ... Donors had a lot of thoughts about his cable TV look. Donors are obsessed with cable TV. The most feedback we got was with regards to cable TV: Why aren't you on enough? When you are on? Why is he not wearing a suit coat rather than a sweater? Can he get a new suit coat jacket?'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7acebd3e63608f928b2601cfbf55137964e799b856952f8b1e78

TAMMY/BETSY PODCAST: On the Bloomberg Politics "Masters in Politics" Podcast, Tammy Haddad and Betsy Fischer Martin speak with Trump senior advisor Barry Bennett Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver. Bennett: "People will be shocked to know this, but Donald Trump's personality offstage is very much like Bill Clinton's. They both have never met a stranger. When they talk to you they just own you. They're staring right into your soul. You make an immediate connection. He's asking you about your family and everything else. They have very much the same personality, they're very engaging people. The first time I met him, I went up in January right after I left the Ben Carson campaign. I liked
 his policies, but I loved his personality." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7ace3cd28dd579b5bc407ece4c922128b095bde5a737d14215a9 ... Listen and subscribe http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7ace8b3cfcbb6408cfd92b7242d52661283323737a7983613428

DESSERT - "When it comes to baby names, Emma and Noah reign supreme," by AP's Mary Clare Jalonick: "The administration released its annual list of top baby names Friday, and the top five names for girls and boys in 2015 remained unchanged from the previous year. Noah was followed by Liam, Mason, Jacob and William. Emma was followed by Olivia, Sophia, Ava and Isabella. Ava and Isabella switched spots from 2014, with Ava climbing to number 4. One major change was the girls' name Isis, which had remained steadily in the middle of the pack of the country's top 1,000 names for the last 15 years. In 2015 ... it dropped completely off the list." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7ace84b2efc9beb4134ccaac4c9158afe6faa0506be2feeb2412 ...

</b> a Republican strategist who advised 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney. 'There's little chance the Democrats make that same mistake.'&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5082bd7c91ad7ace49e0a995165eaf812abd8c4be9c7c24917ec83f5aefe437b" target="_blank">http://lat.ms/1XdRxHM</a></p><p><b>WHAT OBAMA SAID,
</b> in response to questions after he made remarks on the economy in the White House press room: &quot;I think you have to ask Speaker Ryan what the implications of his comments are. There is no doubt that there is a debate that's taking place inside the Republican Party about who they are and what they represent. Their standard bearer at the moment is Donald Trump. And I think not just Republican officials, but more importantly, Republican voters are going to have to make a decision as to whether this is the guy who speaks for them and represents their values.&quot;</p><p><b>--Asked about Trump's &quot;taco bowl&quot; tweet on Cinco de Mayo:
</b> &quot;I have no thoughts on Mr. Trump's tweets. As a general rule, I don't pay attention to Mr. Trump's tweets. And I think that will be true I think for the next six months. So you can just file that one.

Bennett: &quot;People will be shocked to know this, but Donald Trump's personality offstage is very much like Bill Clinton's. They both have never met a stranger. When they talk to you they just own you. They're staring right into your soul. You make an immediate connection. He's asking you about your family and everything else. They have very much the same personality, they're very engaging people. The first time I met him, I went up in January right after I left the Ben Carson campaign. I liked his policies, but
