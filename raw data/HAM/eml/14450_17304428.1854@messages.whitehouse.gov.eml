THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 13, 2016

**

*Remarks for Denis R. McDonough*

*Israel Independence Day Celebration*

*Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium, Washington, D.C.*

*Thursday, May 12, 2016*



Good evening, everyone. "Erev tov. "Thank you, Ambassador Dermer, for tha=
t kind introduction. And thanks to you and Rhoda for inviting me to share=
 Yom Haatzmaut with you. Its great to see so many distinguished Members o=
f Congressfrom both sides of the aisleas well as members of the diplomati=
c community. And to any Minnesotans in the audience, I want to give a sho=
ut-out to the Frozen Chosen.=20



I have to admit, for a guy named McDonough, I feel very much at home. As =
many of you know, Ive been fortunate to work closely with the Jewish comm=
unity during my time at the White House. Last December, Kari, two of our =
kids and I even had the great privilege of celebrating Hannukah on the So=
uth Lawn of the White House. I got to ride in a cherry picker with Rabbis=
 Abraham and Levi Shemtov, 30 feet up in the air, to light the national m=
enorah. That was pretty neatand more than a little bit reassuringeven cel=
estialbeing surrounded by clergy as I elevated from the earth.=20



Im honored to join you to mark this anniversary of Israels independence. =
It was 68 years ago, as the Sabbath sun set, that David Ben-Gurion procla=
imed to the world a state based on freedom, justice and peace as envisage=
d by the prophets of Israel. Persevering through centuries, the people of=
 Israel have created a vibrant and diverse democracy. They have forged a =
future of astounding possibilities. They have truly made the desert bloom=
. **



For as long as the state of Israel has existed, the United States has bee=
n Israels unwavering friend and ally. It took President Truman only 11 mi=
nutes to recognize Israel after it declared independenceover the objectio=
ns of some of his own advisers. I cant recall anything in Washington happ=
ening in just 11 minutes. It is a testament to the deep and enduring bond=
s between our two countriesbonds that stretch across administrations and =
political parties, across oceans and generations, across families and fai=
ths. Im not the first to observe that the United States and Israel are, i=
n many ways, a family. And, like any big and boisterous family, Americans=
 and Israelis disagree at times. As the ninth of eleven children, I speak=
 from vast experience. But I also know that, at the end of the day, we ca=
re for each other, look out for each other, and protect each other.=20



Im proud to serve a President who understands thata President whose commi=
tment to Israel has been unprecedented. For President Obama, Israel is no=
t just another foreign policy issue. Its not a political football. He fee=
ls this in his "kishkes"in his gut. I was with then-Senator Obama when he=
 traveled to the holy city of Jerusalem in 2008. I watched him bow his he=
ad in prayer at the Western Wall. He also traveled to Sderot, where he sa=
w the devastation wrought by Hamas-launched rockets and met with Israelis=
 living under the threat of attack. Israel is not an abstraction to him. =
Earlier this year, President Obama became the first sitting U.S. presiden=
t to speak at the Israeli Embassy, where he honored the Righteous Among t=
he Nations.=20



It was my favorite speech by the President, maybe ever. Of Master Sergean=
t Roddie Edmonds, who refused to tell the Nazis which of his fellow soldi=
ers were Jews, the President said:=20

Its an instructive lesson, by the way, for those of us Christians. I cann=
ot imagine a greater expression of Christianity than to say, I, too, am a=
 Jew. I remember thinking as I listened to that speech, If I get that cal=
l, I hope I have the courage of Sergeant Edmonds. In that speech, the Pre=
sident also reaffirmed that Americas commitment to Israels security remai=
ns, now and forever, unshakeable.=20



These are not just words. We are backing up that unshakeable commitment w=
ith unparalleled action. Since President Obama took office, the United St=
ates has provided Israel almost $24 billion in military aid to ensure Isr=
aels qualitative military edge. Weve invested in missile defense systems,=
 like Iron Dome, that have saved Israeli lives. Later this year, well beg=
in delivering the cutting-edge F-35 fighter jet, making Israel the only M=
iddle Eastern nation to obtain this advanced aircraft. And were in the pr=
ocess of discussing a new agreement to guide our military assistance for =
the next decade. This would be the largest military aid package in Americ=
an historywith any countryand this Administration continues to work it ha=
rd. And even as we acknowledge that the Iran deal has stirred strong pass=
ions, we firmly believe that continuing to implement this deal is the bes=
t way to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and keep Israel saf=
e.=20



Americas commitment to Israel motivates the United States to speak out an=
d take action whenever anti-Semitism and bigotry arise. Thats true on the=
 floor of the United Nations, in the streets of Europe, or here in our ow=
n country. Because, as Secretary Pritzker said so powerfully last week, h=
ate speech has a friend in silence. Each of us has a responsibility to co=
ntinue calling out and working against hatred wherever we see it. And we =
will.=20



Our commitment to Israel and its long-term security also calls us to cont=
inue pursuing a path to peaceto seek two states for two peoples, living s=
ide by side in peace and security. We are under no illusions that this wi=
ll be easy. History has proven otherwise. For both Israelis and Palestini=
ans, the hurt and heartache run deep. At the same time, we continue to be=
lieve that peace is necessary, that it is justand that it is possible. We=
 will continue urging both sides to take meaningful action towards this v=
ision of two states. That is our solemn promise, and the future we hope t=
o help build together.=20



Just a few weeks ago, the President hosted his eighth and final Seder at =
the White House. Like so many Jews here and around the world, the Preside=
nt and his guests ate the bread of affliction and dipped greens into salt=
 water. They retold the tale of the Exodusof an oppressed people wanderin=
g for years before finding redemption. Because of Theodor Herzls dream an=
d Ben-Gurions determination, because of Golda Meir and Chaim Weizmann and=
 so many others, that yearning to return to Israel was fulfilled. That 2,=
000-year-old hope for a homeland has become reality. Israel is now strong=
, and independent, and thriving. And, together, we will continue working =
to keep Israel flourishing in the years to come. "Toda rabah", and "chag =
sameach".

as 68 years ago, as the Sabbath sun set, that David Ben-Gurion proclaimed
 to the world a state &#8220;based on freedom, justice and peace as envisag=

te of Israel has existed, the United States has been Israel&#8217;s unwaver=
ing friend and ally.&nbsp; It took President Truman only 11
 minutes to recognize Israel after it declared independence&#8212;over the =
objections of some of his own advisers.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t recall anything=
 in Washington happening in just 11 minutes.&nbsp; It is a testament to the=
 deep and enduring bonds between our two countries&#8212;bonds
 that stretch across administrations and political parties, across oceans a=
nd generations, across families and faiths.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not the first t=
o observe that the United States and Israel are, in many ways, a family.&nb=
sp; And, like any big and boisterous family, Americans
 and Israelis disagree at times.&nbsp; As the ninth of eleven children, I s=
peak from vast experience.&nbsp; But I also know that, at the end of the da=
y, we care for each other, look out for each other, and protect each other.=

srael has been unprecedented.&nbsp; For President Obama, Israel is
 not just another foreign policy issue.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not a political fo=
otball.&nbsp; He feels this in his
<i>kishkes</i>&#8212;in his gut.&nbsp; I was with then-Senator Obama when h=
e traveled to the holy city of Jerusalem in 2008.&nbsp; I watched him bow h=
is head in prayer at the Western Wall. &nbsp;He also traveled to Sderot, wh=
ere he saw the devastation wrought by Hamas-launched
 rockets and met with Israelis living under the threat of attack.&nbsp; Isr=
ael is not an abstraction to him.&nbsp; Earlier this year, President Obama =
became the first sitting U.S. president to speak at the Israeli Embassy, wh=
ere he honored the Righteous Among the Nations.&nbsp;

ction.&nbsp; Since President Obama took office, the United
 States has provided Israel almost $24 billion in military aid to ensure Is=
rael&#8217;s qualitative military edge.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve invested in missi=
le defense systems, like Iron Dome, that have saved Israeli lives.&nbsp; La=
ter this year, we&#8217;ll begin delivering the cutting-edge
 F-35 fighter jet, making Israel the only Middle Eastern nation to obtain t=
his advanced aircraft.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re in the process of discussing a=
 new agreement to guide our military assistance for the next decade.&nbsp; =
This would be the largest military aid package in
 American history&#8212;with any country&#8212;and this Administration cont=
inues to work it hard.&nbsp; And even as we acknowledge that the Iran deal =
has stirred strong passions, we firmly believe that continuing to implement=
 this deal is the best way to prevent Iran from obtaining
 a nuclear weapon and keep Israel safe.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

never anti-Semitism and bigotry arise.&nbsp; That&#8217;s true on
 the floor of the United Nations, in the streets of Europe, or here in our =
own country.&nbsp; Because, as Secretary Pritzker said so powerfully last w=

his will be easy.&nbsp; History has proven otherwise.&nbsp; For both Israel=

 it is just&#8212;and that it is possible.&nbsp; We will continue urging bo=
