Cruz on Boehner - that reveals everything that's wrong with Washington. I don't know John Boehner. I'd be surprised if I said 50 words to him. We've never worked together. During the government shutdown, me and Mike Lee offered to sit down with Boehner, he said he had no interest. He recently revealed he was texting and golfing buddies with Trump. Trump, Hillary and Boehner are all part of the same system.

Cruz: There's a reason why Trump gave 100,000 to Boehner's superPAC. There's a reason why he and Trump are golfing buddies.

Cruz: media is trying to paint Donald Trump is standing up to the system. Donald Trump, John Boehner and HRC are the system.

On Carly Fiorina and naming her as a running mate -

Carly is fantastic and she's a phenomenal leader. Naming her as my VP ensures we have a clear choice. Donald Trump and HRC are flip sides of the same coin. They both are the system. Donald Trump and HRC agree on many issues with one another. They both are buying and selling influence in Washington.

Donald Trump and HRC are pretending to be something they're not.

On the convention and uniting the party -

Cruz: nobody is going to get to 1237. Says Donald is not going to win Indiana and CA. Says the poll question is biased on the issue. Adds that people should be asked should nominee have to earn a majority.

Dismisses Trump's victory in the NE.

On Indiana, Cruz says he hopes they will do well.
