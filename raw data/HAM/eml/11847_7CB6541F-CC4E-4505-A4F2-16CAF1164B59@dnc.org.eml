In this May 7, 2016 file photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Tr=
ump speaks during a rally in Spokane, Wash. (Photo: Ted S. Warren, AP)

Maybe Donald Trump never learned the phrase =93put your money where your mo=
uth is.=94 Upon review of his Personal Financial Disclosure<https://www.doc=
umentcloud.org/documents/2838696-Trump-2016-Financial-Disclosure.html> it t=
urns out that presumed Republican nominee has invested and profited from mu=
ltiple companies he=92s slammed on the trail.

Mondelez International

Trump invested in the parent company of Nabisco, which he has has brought u=
p a lot foroutsourcing jobs to Mexico<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/20=
16/03/23/nabisco-begins-layoffs-at-chicago-plant-despite-criticism-from-tru=
mp-clinton/82159194/>.

=93I=92m never eating Oreos again ...  I love Oreos. I will never eat them =
again. Nabisco closes the plant in Chicago and they are moving the plant to=
 Mexico.=94 (Fortune<http://fortune.com/2015/08/26/donald-trump-oreos/>, Au=
gust 2015)

Ford

Trump has called the automobile company=92s decision to build a plant in Me=
xico an =93absolute disgrace=94 and said it would never happen under a Trum=
p administration. At one rally he told supporters he'd call the CEO of Ford=
 and threaten a 35% tax on any car made in Mexico.

=91Let me give you the bad news. Every car, and every truck and every part =
manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we=92re going to c=
harge you a 35% tax. Okay? And that tax is going to be paid simultaneously =
with the transaction, and that=92s it.=92=94 (Fortune<http://=93=91let%20me=

9D>, December 2015)

General Electric

Trump has put money into General Electric. But while campaigning in Connect=
icut, he called General Electric=92s move of jobs outside the state =93deva=
stating.=94

"It's so devastating to lose a company like General Electric ... I'm going =
to bring jobs back to Connecticut and to the country. We're not going to le=
t them go to Mexico. =85 They're going everywhere but here because we have =
people that don't know how to deal, they don't know how to make deals.=94 (=
Hartford Courant<http://www.courant.com/politics/hc-altimari-trump-intervie=
w-20160415-story.html>, April 2016)

Disney

Trump bashed the company over a lawsuit<http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/25/tec=
hnology/disney-h1b-workers/> that accused them of replacing American worker=
s with foreigners using H1-B visas =97 and then requiring them to train the=
ir replacements. But his anger at the company didn't stop him from investin=
g.

=93I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse=
 and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in F=
lorida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I wi=
ll end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute =
an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and i=
mmigration program. No exceptions." (Donald J. Trump<https://www.donaldjtru=
mp.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-position-on-visas>, March 2016)

Apple

After the technology company refused to unlock the phones of the shooters i=
n the San Bernardino massacre, Trump called on his supporters to ban Apple =
products. Yet, his financial disclosures show he invested in Apple.

=93I like the idea of a boycott of Apple until such time as they give that =
information.=94 (Politico<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/donald-trum=
p-apple-boycott-219507>, February 2016)

United Technologies Corporation

Trump also invested in the parent company to Carrier Corp., an Indiana-base=
d air-conditioning manufacturer that is in the process of outsourcing thous=
ands of jobs<http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/02/10/carrier-move-in=
dy-unit-mexico-eliminate-1400-jobs/80181804/> to Mexico. In an interview wi=
th Breitbart News after Carrier's announcement, Trump spoke broadly about t=
he need to lower taxes.

=93First of all, you=92re going to have to look to lower taxes [for those w=
ho do business inside the United States] =97 and we may very well have to c=
harge taxes at the border, when somebody drives a car through the border to=
 sell it in the United States. But look, we=92ve closed our plants. We=92ve=
 lost our jobs. They=92re not going to build cars in Mexico and sell them i=
n the United States, OK? We can lower our taxes, and we=92re probably going=
 to have to charge a surtax at the border. Otherwise we=92re going to lose =
a fortune. And that will help Ford and other people make a decision to buy =
in the United States, to build in the United States.=94 (Breitbart News<htt=
p://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/12/exclusive-donald-trump-on-f=
ord-carrier-shipping-jobs-to-mexico-im-the-only-one-who-understands-whats-g=
oing-on/>, February 2016)

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to request for comment.
