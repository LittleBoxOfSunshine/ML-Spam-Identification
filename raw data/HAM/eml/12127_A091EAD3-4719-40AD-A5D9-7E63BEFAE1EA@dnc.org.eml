Excerpts from DNC Chair Rep. Wasserman Schultz at the ASDC Meeting in Phila=
delphia

PHILADELPHIA, PA -- Today, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz addresse=
d a meeting of the Association of State Democratic Chairs. Below you will f=
ind excerpts as prepared for delivery:



=93I=92m excited to join you all here in Philadelphia, the home of our upco=
ming convention where we will show the world a Democratic Party ready for o=
ne of the most important General Elections of our time. I=92m proud of the =
work that each and every one of you is doing in your states, managing what =
is never an easy delegate selection process, but one that will bring the va=
lues and diversity of our party and our country to this city in just 66 day=
s!

=85



=93When Democrats from all across this great country come to the City of Br=
otherly Love and Sisterly Affection, we will be energized, united and focus=
ed on making sure that we continue to build upon the progress we=92ve made =
under President Obama by electing a Democrat as the 45th President of the U=
nited States of America.



=93And that=92s really what this is all about. Making sure that together we=
 launch our nominee into the White House with the support of a Democratic H=
ouse and Senate and State Houses across the country so that we can continue=
 to: Build a strong and safe future for our children and grandchildren, gro=
w our economy and create good paying jobs; and move our country forward for=
 all Americans, not just the wealthy and well connected!

=85



=93In just the last week, the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump =
has backpedaled away from his own pledge to release his tax returns, vowed =
to slash taxes for those at the top like himself, and seemingly lied about =
pretending to be his own publicist. He refused to address his well-document=
ed history of misogyny and insulted one of our country's most important all=
ies, Great Britain. His campaign called their selection of a white supremac=
ist delegate a =91database error.=92



=93I don=92t know about you, but it didn=92t exactly put me at ease either,=
 when Trump suggested we could always resolve debt by printing more money, =
and he legitimized a despotic North Korean dictator. Every day there=92s a =
new example of his knee-jerk recklessness, lack of judgment and unstable te=
mperament.



=93But we cannot gloss over the genuine concern that too many Americans are=
 still feeling about their own pocketbooks and our place in the world. Dona=
ld Trump is promoting anxiety as a way to ease people=92s concern. We need =
to listen to them because our candidates have the most thoughtful solutions=
. That's why your work is so crucial. That=92s why, at the DNC, we=92re doi=
ng everything we can to support you and help you bring people into the gene=
ral election energized, understanding what's at stake, and championing the =
values and priorities that make our party and our country great.

=85

=93Nearly 23 million people have participated in our primaries and both cam=
paigns have worked so hard to advance ideas that will improve the lives of =
Americans. Supporters of both Clinton and Sanders deserve respect for the w=
ork they have put into their campaigns. That is a stark contrast with the d=
ivisive policies that have come from the Republicans. I will always stand u=
p for party activists because they bring us energy and ideas. I will always=
 stand up for the leaders of this party because they volunteer their precio=
us time to guide our progressive future. We are Democrats and we welcome ev=
eryone in. More importantly, our agenda, unlike Republicans, is inclusive a=
nd welcomes everyone!

...

=93Because of Democratic leadership: 20 million Americans have health insur=
ance who didn=92t before. We=92ve seen 74 straight months of private sector=
 job growth creating over 14 million new jobs and we all remember the Great=
 Recession, when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month when George W Bush lef=
t office. Well, we are not going back by allowing a Trump presidency.
=85



=93By working together as Democrats, we can accomplish great things for hon=
est, hard-working people from every walk of life. Our record shows we can s=
et and pass an agenda that promotes economic growth, fairness and opportuni=
ty. Yes, fellow Democrats: America=92s future is bright. When we stick toge=
ther, anything is possible.  I=92m excited for the future of our party, and=
 I=92m proud of your work that I know will carry us forward into a brighter=
 future. On to victory!=94
