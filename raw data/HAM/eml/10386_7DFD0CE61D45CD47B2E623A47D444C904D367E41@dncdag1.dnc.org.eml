Trump=92s business booms as he runs for president, financial disclosures sh=

Business has boomed in Donald Trump=92s financial empire during the time he=
 has run for president, according to an analysis of his federal disclosure =
forms.

The documents, including a lengthy filing released Wednesday and one from l=
ast July, show that revenue has increased by almost=AD $190=AD=AD million, =
with gains coming from golf courses to branded merchandise to book royaltie=
s.

At his tony Florida resort Mar-a-Lago, revenue nearly doubled, climbing fro=
m about $16 million in 2014 and the first half of 2015 to about $30 million=
 since the start of his campaign, according to the forms.

Sales of his licensed bottled-water brand, Trump Ice, are up as well =97 fr=
om $280,000 last year to $413,000 this year, the forms show.

=93Crippled America,=94 his book published in November, made between $1 mil=
lion and $5 million in royalties, he reported.

The flood of cash highlights one of the most unusual aspects of Trump=92s c=
andidacy =97 the potential that a private businessman can benefit financial=
ly from a run for the White House. And it shows how his fortunes have evolv=
ed since last year, when his controversial comments about immigration and M=
uslims threatened to tarnish his business brand even if they boosted his po=
litical campaign.

Trump announced the new filing Tuesday, saying he is =93proud=94 that it =
=93is the largest in the history of the FEC.=94 Government officials declin=
ed to confirm Trump=92s assertion.

Presidential candidates are required to provide, under oath, an annual fina=
ncial disclosure listing their business interests.

To gauge the effect of the campaign on Trump=92s companies, The Washington =
Post compared his two disclosure forms, which were released by the Federal =
Election Commission.

Last year=92s form reported that Trump=92s holdings brought in revenue of $=
362 million in 2014 and the first half of 2015.

The form released Wednesday =97 which shows revenue spiking to $557 million=
 =97 covers a shorter period of time but encompasses the life of his presid=
ential campaign, from July 2015 until Monday.

The new disclosure comes amid swirling questions about Trump=92s income and=
 net worth. This week, although Trump has not provided independent evidence=
 to back up the claim.

His refusal to release his tax returns, which would provide detailed inform=
ation about his income, has drawn fire from some Republican critics and lik=
ely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Wednesday=92s disclosure did little to shed light on his actual income.

While Trump=92s campaign issued a statement referring to the form as a tall=
y of his personal =93income,=94 it is actually a list of his companies=92 g=
ross revenue =97 a figure that does not factor in the costs of paying emplo=
yees and running the companies. In addition, the FEC form does not account =
for debt interest payments, a potentially significant expenditure for Trump=
, who lists five loans of more than $50 million each.

When asked if Trump believed the campaign had been good for business, campa=
ign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, =93Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization ha=
s always owned and operated the most successful and iconic properties.=94

Trump said this week he used the added revenue to fund =93construction proj=
ects at various multimillion-dollar developments,=94 reduce his debt and fu=
nd his campaign.

The revenue jump appeared especially pronounced at Trump=92s golf courses.

At Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla., where in March the mogul used=
 his Super Tuesday victory speech to promote Trump Steaks and other product=
s, revenue jumped from $12 million to $18 million, Trump reported.

He said revenue at his course in Bedminster, N.J., increased from $16 milli=
on to $21 million. And, he said, it jumped from $14 million to $17 million =
at his Virginia course.

Trump National Doral, a four-course golf complex near Miami, was again the =
Trump empire=92s largest gross moneymaker, with revenue exploding from $50 =
million to $132 million, according to Trump=92s disclosures.

Although a number of companies that licensed Trump=92s name for consumer pr=
oducts announced they were cutting ties because of his campaign trail rheto=
ric, Trump nevertheless reported his revenue from licensing deals was littl=
e changed in the past year.

For instance, he reported that he received from $1 million to $5 million fr=
om Trump-branded mattresses over the past 12 months, although Serta Mattres=
s announced last July that it was winding down its Trump line. A spokeswoma=
n for Serta said the company=92s contract with Trump ended Dec. 31, 2015, a=
nd that, typically in licensing deals, =93royalties are paid in periodic in=
stallments over the course of the contract.=94

Some aspects of Trump=92s business empire have sagged during his campaign.

Revenue from his menswear line, which was pulled from the shelves of Macy=
=92s after his campaign began, declined. In 2015, he reported that it earne=
d between $1 million and $5 million, whereas he now reports it brought in b=
etween $100,000 and $1 million.

Commissions at Trump=92s New York modeling agency, Trump Model Management, =
fell by about $300,000, the forms show. Royalties for the accessory and ski=
n-care lines of Trump=92s wife, Melania, dropped from up to $1 million to l=
ess than $50,000.

Trump=92s new report shows that he has invested in companies that he has cr=
iticized on the campaign trail, including with stock holdings in Ford, GE a=
nd Disney.

Trump reported making up to $20,000 from interest on bonds he holds in the =
makers of Carrier air conditioners and Oreo cookies, both of which he has b=
lasted for shipping American manufacturing jobs overseas.

The report says he received more than $100,000 in income from dividends and=
 capital gains as a shareholder in Apple. Trump called for a boycott of the=
 tech giant because of its reluctance to cooperate with efforts to break in=
to the phones of alleged terrorists.

Trump also owns between $50,000 and $100,000 worth of Amazon stock. He has =
criticized the company and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos for =93getting =
away with murder tax-wise=94 and for having a =93huge antitrust problem.=94=
 Bezos also owns The Washington Post.

Trump reported that he earned $49.3 million from the sale of the Miss Unive=
rse pageant to the talent agency WME-IMG. The terms of the sale were not di=
sclosed when it was announced in September 2015, the culmination of a fight=
 between Trump and NBC that erupted after the start of his campaign when NB=
C announced it would no longer air the annual event.

Trump listed board positions on 564 different entities, most of them small =
partnerships or one-owner companies tied to Trump real estate. Trump said h=
e also collected $168,584 as part of a pension from the Screen Actors Guild=
.

The filing adds another chapter to the shifting story of Trump=92s wealth. =
Last June, when Trump descended the escalators of Trump Tower to say he was=
 =93really rich=94 and would run for president, his aides passed around a o=
ne-page summary asserting he was worth more than $8.7 billion.The report sh=
owed that his marquee project to build a luxury hotel down the street from =
the White House has prompted Trump to tack on some additional debt =97 a lo=
an of $170 million from Deutsche Bank.The disclosure also showed that Trump=
 had over the last year opened new advisory, licensing and management corpo=
rations for ventures in foreign cities such as Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Ko=
lkata, India.

A month later, Trump=92s campaign released a new statement, saying Trump=92=
s net worth was now =93in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.=94

When Trump submitted his FEC disclosure last July, his campaign released a =
statement saying the document =93was not designed for a man of Mr. Trump=92=
s massive wealth.=94
