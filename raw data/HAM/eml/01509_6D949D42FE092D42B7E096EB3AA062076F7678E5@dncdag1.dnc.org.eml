Hi Tim, 

Great to hear from you! I'm looping in Meagan here from the Jefferson. It sounds like Thursday's a pretty busy day for them. Would it be possible to meet at 5pm at the Jefferson? Meagan, does that work best for your team? 

Thanks!

Thanks Jordan,

Alex, how's things? If it would be possible to schedule a walkthrough for 2pm or earlier on Thursday at the Jefferson, that would be ideal, so just let me know what works for you.

Thanks!

Hey Jordan,

Bobby tells me that you'd be the right POC for the upcoming DNC roundtable with POTUS on the 18th, correct? We'd ideally like to setup a walkthrough this Thursday the 12th at the Jefferson if that works for you? If so, just let me know a good time to schedule the walkthrough, and who you'd like our Advance team to link up with for the meeting.

Thanks a lot,

Tim
