My Turn: Why Democrats are suing Arizona over its election<http://www.azcen=
tral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2016/05/06/arizona-primary-election-lawsuit-de=
mocrats/83854264/>

The reason the Democratic National Committee filed a lawsuit<http://www.azc=
entral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/04/14/democrats-sue-arizona-o=
ver-voter-access/83034630/> against Arizona this month is simple: the right=
 to vote is sacred, and it is under attack in Arizona =96 a state with a pa=
rticularly poor record of discrimination and disenfranchisement in minority=
 communities.

It=92s certainly no accident that so many of the long waiting lines to vote=
 in the March primary election occurred in Maricopa County, which is home t=
o a large minority population. The state closed 70 percent of its polling l=
ocations, citing =93cost-cutting=94 as the reason.

But this is far more serious than a careless oversight, or a bureaucratic m=
ix-up.

Arizona is a state where conservatives banned bilingual education in 2000, =
where Sheriff Joe Arpaio has run roughshod over the rights of Hispanics wit=
h illegal traffic stop detentions, and where Hispanic, African American and=
 Native American voters have long faced undue burdens in exercising their m=
ost basic rights as citizens.

The issue isn=92t just that voting locations were severely cut back. Many p=
olling locations have been moved or changed, causing more unnecessary confu=
sion. In fact, almost half of all Maricopa County polling locations changed=
 between 2006 and 2008, and election officials actually have more changes p=
lanned before Election Day in November.

These Republican laws and changes disproportionately burden students and yo=
ung people who are more likely to move within a district, and those depende=
nt on public transportation and the elderly, who are more likely to need as=
sistance voting by mail.

This is part of a much broader, deliberate and concerted effort by Republic=
ans to reduce turnout among particular groups of voters who are inconvenien=
t to them on Election Day. And those voters are more vulnerable today than =
they have been in the past.

When the Supreme Court decided a case called Shelby v. Holder three years a=
go, it gutted a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that has protec=
ted voters since the height of the Civil Rights movement. Before the Shelby=
 decision, Arizona was considered a =93covered jurisdiction,=94 which meant=
 that the Department of Justice would review any changes to voting rules th=
ere to protect against precisely the type of irregularities voters faced la=
st month.

But since the Supreme Court poked a major hole in the Voting Rights Act, Re=
publicans have used the opportunity to attack voting rights among groups wh=
o traditionally do not vote for Republicans in those previously covered jur=
isdictions.


If no one steps in now, Maricopa County would become one of their greatest =
disenfranchisement success stories.

This is completely wrong, and it=92s why this lawsuit is absolutely necessa=
ry.

When teacher Luz Magallanes arrived at her polling place to vote in the Ari=
zona primary before work, she hoped to share her voting story with her stud=
ents later that day. But looking at the long lines, she decided to go to wo=
rk and vote in the evening instead. When she returned, she had to wait in l=
ine for nearly five hours before finally casting her ballot.

When Leslie Feldman arrived at her polling location with her two young daug=
hters, she didn=92t expect an ordeal. In the course of waiting for nearly f=
ive hours, she found the voting center=92s one working bathroom was overwhe=
lmed and leaking raw sewage onto the sidewalk. When she finally reached the=
 front of the voting line, she was told they had run out of Democratic ball=
ots. And when new ballots finally arrived and she cast her vote, she passed=
 hundreds of people still waiting.

These stories prompted those of us at the Democratic National Committee to =
file suit<http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/04/14=
/democrats-sue-arizona-over-voter-access/83034630/> in the U.S. District Co=
urt of Arizona against the state officials responsible. The Democratic Sena=
torial Campaign Committee, Kirkpatrick for Senate, the Arizona Democratic P=
arty and eight individual voters, including Magallanes and Feldman, joined =
the suit.

If successful, the lawsuit will restore federal election oversight of Maric=
opa County and make it easier for voters to vote in locations near their ho=
mes or workplaces.

It would also reverse a new Arizona state law that made it a felony for abs=
entee voters to have signed and sealed ballots turned in for them, rather t=
han having to mail them in =96 a practice used widely among minority groups=
 to vote early. So this case isn't just about responding to what happened i=
n March =96 this case is about the future. It=92s about restoring election =
protections long-needed and relied upon by Arizonans in time for the Genera=
l Election.

Democrats believe our country is stronger when every voice is heard and eve=
ry vote is counted, and we will keep fighting to make sure the sacred right=
 of every American to vote is protected.

It=92s impossible to know how many people didn=92t vote because they couldn=
=92t spend the long hours waiting in line. But it is possible to make sure =
long lines, convoluted rules and unnecessary barriers to the ballot become =
a thing of the past. That=92s what this lawsuit is about.

Every voter deserves a voice. Every election matters. And when a state pass=
es laws that make it unduly difficult to cast a ballot, that state is out o=
f step with American values, the law, and the Constitution. As Democrats, w=
e=92re sending a clear signal that we will not stand for it.

 Arizona over its election</font></a></h1>

<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Th=
e reason the Democratic National Committee
<a href=3D"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/04/1=

filed a&nbsp;lawsuit</a> against Arizona this month&nbsp;is simple: the rig=
ht to vote is sacred, and it is under attack in Arizona =96 a state with a =
particularly poor record of discrimination and disenfranchisement in minori=
ty communities.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">It=
=92s certainly no accident that so many of the long waiting lines&nbsp;to v=
ote in the March primary election&nbsp;occurred in Maricopa County, which i=
s home to a large minority population.&nbsp;The state closed
 70 percent of its&nbsp;polling locations, citing =93cost-cutting=94 as the=
 reason.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Bu=
t this is far more serious than a careless oversight, or a bureaucratic mix=
-up.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Ar=
izona is a state where conservatives banned bilingual education in 2000, wh=
ere Sheriff Joe Arpaio has run roughshod over the rights of Hispanics with =
illegal traffic stop detentions, and where
 Hispanic, African American&nbsp;and Native American voters have long faced=
 undue burdens in exercising their most basic rights as citizens.</font></p=
>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Th=
e issue isn=92t&nbsp;just that voting locations were severely cut back. Man=
y polling locations have been moved or changed, causing more unnecessary co=
nfusion. In fact, almost half of all Maricopa County
 polling locations changed between 2006 and 2008, and election officials ac=
tually have more changes planned before Election Day in November.</font></p=
>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Th=
ese Republican laws and changes disproportionately burden students and youn=
g people who are more likely to move within a district, and those dependent=
 on public transportation and the elderly,
 who are more likely to need assistance voting by mail.</font></p>

<div class=3D"">
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Th=
is is part of a much broader, deliberate and concerted effort by Republican=
s to reduce turnout among particular groups of voters who are inconvenient =
to them on Election Day. And those voters
 are more vulnerable today than they have been in the past.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Wh=
en the Supreme Court decided a case called
<em class=3D"">Shelby v. Holder</em> three years ago, it gutted a key provi=
sion of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that has protected voters since the heig=
ht of the Civil Rights movement. Before the
<em class=3D"">Shelby </em>decision, Arizona was considered a =93covered ju=
risdiction,=94 which meant that the Department of Justice would review any =
changes to voting rules there to protect against precisely the type of irre=
gularities voters faced last month.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Bu=
t since the Supreme Court poked a major hole in the Voting Rights Act, Repu=
blicans have used the opportunity to attack voting rights among groups who =
traditionally do not vote for Republicans
 in those previously covered jurisdictions.</font></p>

<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Th=
is is completely wrong, and it=92s why this lawsuit is absolutely necessary=
.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Wh=
en&nbsp;teacher Luz Magallanes arrived at her polling place to vote in the =
Arizona primary before work, she hoped to share her voting story with her s=
tudents&nbsp;later that day. But looking at the long
 lines, she decided to go to work and vote in the evening instead. When she=
 returned, she had to wait in line for nearly five hours before finally cas=
ting her ballot.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Wh=
en Leslie Feldman arrived at her polling location with her two young daught=
ers, she didn=92t expect an ordeal. In the course of waiting for nearly fiv=
e hours, she found the voting center=92s one
 working bathroom was overwhelmed and leaking raw sewage onto the sidewalk.=
 When she finally reached the front of the voting line, she was told they h=
ad run out of Democratic ballots. And when new ballots finally arrived and =
she cast her vote, she passed hundreds
 of people still waiting.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Th=
ese&nbsp;stories prompted those of us at the Democratic National Committee&=
nbsp;<a href=3D"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016=
/04/14/democrats-sue-arizona-over-voter-access/83034630/" class=3D"">to
 file suit</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. District Court of Arizona against the state=
 officials responsible. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Kirkp=
atrick for Senate, the Arizona Democratic Party&nbsp;and eight individual v=
oters, including Magallanes and Feldman, joined
 the suit.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">If=
 successful, the lawsuit will restore federal election oversight of Maricop=
a County and make it easier for voters to vote in locations near their home=
s or workplaces.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">It=
 would also reverse a new Arizona state law that made it a felony for absen=
tee voters to have signed and sealed ballots turned in for them, rather tha=
n having to mail them in =96 a practice used
 widely among minority groups to vote early. So this case isn't just about =
responding to what happened in March =96 this case is about the future. It=
=92s about restoring election protections long-needed and relied upon by Ar=
izonans in time for the General Election.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">De=
mocrats believe our country is stronger when every voice is heard and every=
 vote is counted, and we will keep fighting to make sure the sacred right o=
f every American to vote is protected.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">It=
=92s impossible to know how many people didn=92t vote because they couldn=
=92t spend the long hours waiting in line. But it is possible to make sure =
long lines, convoluted rules and unnecessary barriers
 to the ballot become a thing of the past. That=92s what this lawsuit is ab=
out.</font></p>
<p class=3D""><font face=3D"Times" style=3D"font-size: 16px;" class=3D"">Ev=
ery voter deserves a voice. Every election matters. And when a state passes=
 laws that make it unduly difficult to cast a ballot, that state is out of =
step with American values, the law,&nbsp;and
 the Constitution. As Democrats, we=92re sending a clear signal that we wil=
l not stand for it.</font></p>
