The president's motorcade left the Washington Hilton at 11:07 p.m. and re=
turned to the White House at 11:11 p.m. after delivering remarks at the W=
hite House Correspondents' Dinner.
POTUS spoke for roughly 32 minutes, addressing many of the candidates loo=
king to succeed him. Below is a list of some of his jokes (please check a=
gainst the final White House transcript):
On the future of the WHCD: "It is an honor to be here at my last - and pe=
rhaps the last - White House Correspondents' Dinner. You all look great. =
The end of the republic has never looked better."
On Hillary Clinton: "Here we are, my eighth and final address at this uni=
que event, and I am excited. If this material works well, I'm going to us=
e it for Goldman Sachs."
After praising Clinton: "You've got to admit, though, Hillary trying to a=
ppeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative just signing up =
to Facebook. ...'Did you get my poke?'... 'I'm not sure I'm using this ri=
ght. '" He also called her "Aunt Hillary."
On Sanders: "Bernie, you look like a million bucks - or we'll put it in t=
erms you'll understand: You look like 37,000 donations of $27."
On Trump: "I am a little hurt that he's not here tonight. We had so much =
fun the last time. And it is surprising. We've got a room full of reporte=
rs, celebrities, cameras, and he says no. Is this dinner too tacky for Th=
e Donald? What could he possibly be doing instead? Sitting at home eating=
 a Trump Steak, tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel?"
On Cruz: "Ted had a tough week. He went to Indiana - Hoosier country - st=
ood on a basketball court and called a hoop a 'basketball ring.' What els=
e is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? But sure, I'm the fo=
reign one."
On Kasich: "Some candidates aren't polling high enough to qualify for the=
ir own jokes tonight." (Images of Kasich eating were displayed.)
On GOP: "Just look at the confusion over invitations to tonight's dinner.=
 Guests were asked to check whether they wanted steak or fish, but instea=
d a whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan."
On RNC: "GOP Chairman Reince Priebus is here as well. Glad to see that yo=
u feel that you've earned a night off. Congratulations on an already succ=
essful Republican Party nominating process. It's all going great."
On the media: "I don't want to spend too much time on Donald. Following y=
our lead, I'm going to show some restraint, because I think we can all ag=
ree that from the start he's gotten the appropriate amount of coverage be=
fitting of the seriousness of his candidacy. You all ought to be proud of=
 yourselves."
POTUS concluded his remarks with: "Obama out" and a microphone drop.
White House has called a lid.
