<span></span><br>
<span></span><br>
<span>I hope the timing works out, it would be great to have you there! As =
for the ticket levels, we=E2=80=99ve found this election season that some f=
olks have wanted to max out in light of our opposition. The difference is m=
ostly in name only, but it also allows your
 name to be listed on the invitation as part of the host committee. In your=
 case, attending at the co-host level would also qualify you for the Main L=
ine convention package. I=E2=80=99ve attached our convention package descri=
ptions for your reference, but please feel
 free to reach out if you have any questions.</span><br>
