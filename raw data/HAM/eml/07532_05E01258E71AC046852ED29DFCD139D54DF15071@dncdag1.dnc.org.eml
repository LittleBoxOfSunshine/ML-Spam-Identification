Pablo, you're not supposed to be engaging directly with the Chair's office and this is exactly an example of why.  Tell me you didn't give out her desk number.

Pablo we do not give out the Chairwoman's desk line ever. Do not provide that to any producer or anyone. What interview are you referring to?
