Hi All,

Once we have a host and date confirmed, I can get an invite through the approval process in a couple of hours. 

As for a list of invitees, Julia did keep a list of names who we might be open to attending. I can blast the invite to that list and anyone else you can think of. 

Thanks,
Scott
