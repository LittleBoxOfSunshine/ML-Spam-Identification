One more suggestion - concerned that the first sentence below could be misi=
nterpreted as the DNC accusing the Sanders campaign deliberately mischaract=
erizing this.  Do we want to go that far?  We could consider resting our ar=
gument more on the rules.  "The rules governing the Democratic Party have b=
een in place for decades and the specific procedures for this cycle were ag=
reed upon 2014..." +LDD too.



"We are also asking both campaigns to be forthright in their characterizati=
on of the primary process. In Nevada on Saturday, the state party's credent=
ials committee was made up of an equal number of members representing both =
campaigns. The proceedings were appropriately managed, open to the public, =
transparent, and inclusive. The process for nominating a Democratic Preside=
ntial candidate is not something taken lightly, it is a four-year endeavor =
that is closely scrutinized and determined in public forums just as it has =
been in past election cycles. There is no excuse for what happened in Nevad=
a, and it is incumbent upon all of us in positions of leadership to speak o=
ut."

A couple of thoughts for consideration

In the first paragraph, the second sentence states that the DNC is reaching=
 or has reached out to the campaigns and asked them to condone the behavior=
.  Has that happened?  I sent the letter to them but that was it so just fl=
agging in case that specific ask has not yet been made.

In the second paragraph, sentences two and three, we are restating the fact=
s provided by the Party.  I just don't know that we want to be as forward a=
s saying it was "appropriately managed, open to the public, transparent, an=
d inclusive" particularly when we like to say these events are run by the s=
tate party.

Here's a first draft on a statement to respond. Thoughts?

For Immediate Release
May 17, 2016

Contact: DNC Press - 202-863-8148

DNC Statement on Nevada Democratic Party Letter

WASHINGTON - DNC [Chair or spokesperson] today issued the following stateme=
nt on a letter from the Nevada Democratic Party regarding threatening and v=
iolent behavior among some participants around their state party convention=
 this weekend:



"We are deeply concerned about the troubling details laid out in the letter=
 from the Nevada Democratic Party. We are immediately reaching out to the l=
eadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic=
 Party in denouncing the type of behavior on display over the weekend in La=
s Vegas. Our democracy is undermined any time threats, intimidation, physic=
al violence or damage to property are present. If there are legitimate conc=
erns, they must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner.



"We are also asking both campaigns to be forthright in their characterizati=
on of the primary process. In Nevada on Saturday, the state party's credent=
ials committee was made up of an equal number of members representing both =
campaigns. The proceedings were appropriately managed, open to the public, =
transparent, and inclusive. The process for nominating a Democratic Preside=
ntial candidate is not something taken lightly, it is a four-year endeavor =
that is closely scrutinized and determined in public forums just as it has =
been in past election cycles. There is no excuse for what happened in Nevad=
a, and it is incumbent upon all of us in positions of leadership to speak o=
ut."

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">WASHINGTON &#8211; DNC [Chair or spokesperson] today=
 issued the following statement on a letter from the Nevada Democratic Part=
y regarding threatening and violent behavior among some participants around=
 their state party convention this weekend:<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&#8220;We are deeply concerned about the troublin=
g details laid out in the letter from the Nevada Democratic Party. We are i=
mmediately reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask t=
hem to stand with the Democratic Party in
 denouncing the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas. =
Our democracy is undermined any time threats, intimidation, physical violen=
ce or damage to property are present. If there are legitimate concerns, the=
y must be addressed in an orderly,
 civil and peaceful manner. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText">&#8220;We are also asking both campaigns to be fo=
rthright in their characterization of the primary process. In Nevada on Sat=
urday, the state party&#8217;s credentials committee was made up of an equa=
l number of members representing both campaigns.
 The proceedings were appropriately managed, open to the public, transparen=
t, and inclusive. The process for nominating a Democratic Presidential cand=
idate is not something taken lightly, it is a four-year endeavor that is cl=
osely scrutinized and determined
 in public forums just as it has been in past election cycles. There is no =
excuse for what happened in Nevada, and it is incumbent upon all of us in p=
ositions of leadership to speak out.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p>
