The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friends-

We are excited to announce that President Obama will be in Miami on =
Friday, June 3rd for a dinner benefitting the Democratic National =
Committee! This is a great opportunity to support the DNC and ultimately =
stop Donald Trump from reaching the White House in 2016.

President Obama has built a tremendous legacy during his time in office =
and it is extremely important that we keep the White House and elect a =
Democrat to further his legacy.  We need to build on President Obama's =
hard work and continue to make progressive change that will benefit =
generations to come.=20

This may be the last time President Obama visits Miami as a sitting =
President, making it a truly special event.=20

We hope that we can count on your support for this special evening at one =
of the following levels:

=E2=80=A2	Contribute $10,000 per person to attend as a dinner guest and =
receive a photo
=E2=80=A2	Contribute $33,400 per couple to attend as a co-host and receive =
a photo

To RSVP directly, please visit: =
https://finance.democrats.org/page/contribute/MiamiDinnerJune3=20

For more information please contact Karina Marquez at marquezk@dnc.org  or =
202-488-5018.=20

We look forward to seeing you on June 3rd!

Best,

Karina
