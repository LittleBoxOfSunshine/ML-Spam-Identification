Hey, so I called Friedrike Merck to wish her a great time, etc., and she
mentioned that she's coming with her friend Ann Spitzer, whose name I don't
see on that list.  

It's probably all fine . . . I casually said, "Oh, great -- so the Secret
Service has all her info, etc.?" . . . and she said yes.

But it's awful when there are problems at the door, so can you check to be
sure Friedrike's guest is indeed on the list?  (Not certain of the spelling
Ann or Anne, pretty sure Spitzer but might just sound that way.)

Thanks,

Andy
