Now, with Trump's GOP takeover fully underway, interviews with four co-auth=

Trump kills GOP autopsy<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/donald-trump-=
gop-party-reform-220222>
Politico // Kyle Cheney

Reeling from a second straight loss to Barack Obama, a flailing Republican =
Party in 2013 found its culprit: Mitt Romney's callous tone toward minoriti=
es. Instead of being doomed to irrelevance in a changing America, the party=
 would rebrand as a kinder, more inclusive GOP. They called their findings =
an "autopsy," and party leaders from Paul Ryan to Newt Gingrich welcomed it=
 with fanfare.

But even then, Donald Trump was lurking.

"New @RNC<https://twitter.com/RNC> report calls for embracing 'comprehensiv=
e immigration reform,'" he wrote in a little-noticed tweet<https://twitter.=
com/realDonaldTrump/status/313744229774008322?lang=3Den>, nestled alongside=
 digs at Mark Cuban<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/313745912906=
276865?lang=3Den> and Anthony Weiner<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/st=
atus/313756518631747584?lang=3Den> on the day of the report's release. "Doe=
s the @RNC<https://twitter.com/RNC> have a death wish?"

Pundits laughed it off as the buffoonish ramble of a fringe New York billio=
naire on that March 2013 day, but what Trump didn't say - and what the part=
y establishment couldn't have imagined - is that, three years later, he wou=
ld be the one on the verge of making that death wish come true. The billion=
aire has not only ignored the report's conclusions, he has run a campaign t=
hat moved the party in the exact opposite direction.

Now, with Trump's GOP takeover fully underway, interviews with four co-auth=
ors of the 2012 autopsy and 10 other Republican leaders reveal a party esta=
blishment terrified that Trump is not only repeating the party's failures -=
 he's destroying the party in the process. And while the leaders continue t=
o insist that their report laid out the Republican Party's best chance of v=
ictory, they fear Trump's dominance will tear the party apart before they e=
ver get a chance to put it in play.

"Swing voters would flock away from him in droves," said Henry Barbour, one=
 of the autopsy's authors. And as for Trump's claim that his working-class =
appealing will bring back Reagan Democrats, the veteran Mississippi Republi=
can operative is unmoved: "He's chasing some ghost that I don't think exist=
s anymore."

After mounting for months, tension exploded Thursday with the return of Rom=
ney himself, who ripped Trump as a "fraud" and declared him anathema to wha=
t the Republican Party aspired to be. It's part of a last-ditch effort by R=
omney, 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain and other party leaders to=
 snatch the primary back from Trump before he rolls through to the general =
election.

But members of the GOP establishment concede that they have little influenc=
e over Trump, and have thus far been unable to exert much leverage in their=
 party's primary: "The party itself is less consequential than ever before,=
 and since our shellacking in 2012, the tribal differences are increasingly=
 irreconcilable," said former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. "If Trump prevails, h=
e will have single-handedly upended the old Republican order and built a ne=
w movement in its place. The question then will be, is it sustainable?"

For GOP leaders, what's so vexing about Trump's campaign is that it's a pho=
to-negative of everything the autopsy said was needed to win a general elec=
tion.

The report - the product of 2,600 interviews with voters, experts, party of=
ficials and business leaders, as well as a poll of Hispanic Republicans and=
 an online survey of 36,000 stakeholders - was remarkable for its blunt cri=
ticism of Republican politics. The party, the report's five authors argued,=
 had become the realm of "stuffy old men" and spent too much time "talking =
to itself" rather than engaging new voters. Backing immigration reform, the=
 authors concluded, would be necessary to shed that image. "If we do not, o=
ur Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only,"=
 the authors wrote.

Trump trashed that advice on Day One and never looked back. His campaign op=
ened with a speech describing undocumented Mexican immigrants as rapists an=
d murderers<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-donald-trump-defends-=
calling-mexican-immigrants-rapists/>, which Trump followed with a call for =
a ban Muslims entering the U.S.<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/donal=
d-trump-shutdown-of-muslims-216504> And just days ago, he went on national =
television and refused to condemn the Ku Klux Klan<http://www.politico.com/=
story/2016/02/trump-declines-to-condemn-ku-klux-klan-219927>. (He later dis=
avowed the group and support from former KKK grand wizard David Duke, but h=
is critics say he has still been far too close to white supremacist groups =
and rhetoric.)

Trump's campaign declined to comment on the lessons of the GOP autopsy. But=
 the day after its release in 2013, he expanded on his critique, delivering=
 a pointed attack that previewed a theme he'd deploy in his primary run. ".=
@RNC<https://twitter.com/RNC> report was written by the ruling class of con=
sultants who blew the election," he tweeted<https://twitter.com/realDonaldT=
rump/status/314085754307497985?lang=3Den>. "Short on ideas. Just giving exc=
uses to donors."

Trump insists his rise is an alternative path to growing the GOP. "Why can'=
t the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters =
by the millions - we are creating a larger, stronger party!" he tweeted<htt=
ps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/705148300064907265> Wednesday.

And indeed, in the primary, Trump has defied his caricature as solely the c=
andidate of old, arch-conservative men - building a coalition that stretche=
s across the party's ideological and demographic fault lines<http://www.pol=
itico.com/story/2016/03/5-myths-about-trump-supporters-220158>.

But that argument hasn't quelled the panic among veteran Republicans, who i=
nsist that regardless of how far the strategy takes Trump, it's ultimately =
a dead end for the party as a whole. Ari Fleischer, an autopsy coauthor and=
 former press secretary to President George W. Bush, added that a Trump los=
s in November would be validation for the autopsy. "If Trump's the nominee =
and he loses spectacularly, I think you'll actually have a story that says =
we were right," he said.

"The fact remains, America's demography is changing and that won't stop ...=
 So let's just say Donald Trump wins the election because of his unique app=
eal to blue-collar Democrats. The report will be valid for his successor mo=
st likely," Fleischer continued. "Demographics is demographics, and what we=
 said remains important."

Barbour was similarly skeptical about the party's fate if it disregarded th=
e autopsy's advice.

"What we advocated for is that the Republican Party be the conservative par=
ty, but that we be a welcoming party. That's always going to be a good idea=
," said Barbour. "Could we have advocated more that Republicans needed to d=
o a better job engaging with working-class Americans? Sure, absolutely. But=
, look, we tried to be very candid in the report, and I think we tried to c=
all a spade a spade."

It's not just Trump. The rhetoric on immigration, even from candidates othe=
r than Trump, has jolted to the right. Ted Cruz recently pledged<http://vid=
eo.foxnews.com/v/4768820071001/ted-cruz-on-his-illegal-immigration-stance/?=
intcmp=3Dhpbt1#sp=3Dshow-clips> to root out and deport undocumented immigra=
nts on a large scale aftersuggesting in January<http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/=
10/politics/ted-cruz-immigration-deportation-guns-terrorism/> that he'd tak=
e a softer approach. And Marco Rubio, who once embraced immigration reform =
and embodied much of what the report recommended the GOP become, is also ru=
nning on an anti-amnesty program - and pledging to rescind Obama's executiv=
e orders on deferred deportation for certain undocumented immigrants.

And there's another group the report touted that has been largely rejected =
by the party's voters: governors.

The autopsy described Republican governors as models for inclusive politics=
, pointing to their sweeping victories in 2010. But primary voters have pro=
ven that their appetite for governors - and for striking a deal on immigrat=
ion reform - is virtually nonexistent. Of the seven current and former Repu=
blican governors who ran for president this cycle, only Ohio Gov. John Kasi=
ch remains, and he's dramatically behind in the race.

If the autopsy proves prophetic and the party loses big in 2016, some fear =
the current Republican coalition won't get another chance to act on the rep=
ort's advice.

A Trump primary win "would precipitate the breakup of the Republican Party.=
 I wouldn't be a part of it and a lot of people I know wouldn't be a part o=
f it," said Pete Wehner, an aide to the last three Republican presidents. "=
It would take decades to undo it, potentially. The Republican Party is beco=
ming redefined by Trump, and the question is, Can we jerk it back?"

One RNC leader even suggested the party's destruction is already underway.

"The 2012 autopsy is just what you called it - a case study on the dead rat=
her than a clinical review for lessons to be learned with preventive measur=
es outlined for healing/averting future cases of the disease which caused o=
ur demise," said Ada Fisher, a committeewoman from North Carolina. "A rebel=
lion is at hand. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump both reflect this new dire=
ction."

What's all the more frustrating for the report's authors is that other part=
s of the party are following their blueprint closely.

The autopsy recommended sweeping changes to the Republican primary process,=
 from fewer debates to a more condensed calendar of nominating contests to =
reforms to polling. The authors pleaded with Republican leaders to invest i=
n a robust digital strategy and a data program to help target potential vot=
ers. It recommended coordinating outside spending to ensure consistent mess=
ages among allied PACs and nonprofits.

On these technical counts, the party has mostly gotten high marks. But with=
out solving the riddle of how to coax more minorities into the fold, it may=
 all be for nothing, argued co-author Sally Bradshaw, a senior adviser to J=
eb Bush's failed presidential campaign.

"I think the jury is still out, but it's not looking encouraging," she said=
. "I believe the RNC has made great strides on the data, analytics and mech=
anics front, and for that [RNC Chairman] Reince Priebus and his team deserv=
e great credit. But if we can't bring women and minorities to our party wit=
h a hopeful and optimistic message about the future - if we can't show vote=
rs how conservative principles will help them rise up out of poverty and pr=
ovide an opportunity for a better life - then no amount of good data will m=
ake a damn bit of difference."

Some in the establishment are so dismayed at what Trump means that they're =
openly musing that a Trump loss in November would be potential step forward=
 for the party, forcing Republicans to accept the conclusions of the 2012 a=
utopsy.

"I'm not prepared to say it would be 'better' for the party to lose, only t=
hat it might hasten a modernization that I think is already a couple electi=
on cycles overdue," said Fergus Cullen, former chairman of the New Hampshir=
e Republican Party, who said he wouldn't support Trump under any circumstan=
ces. "Sometimes, it takes multiple defeats before a majority of a party rea=
lizes it needs to adapt to changing times in order to stay relevant. Half t=
he party seems stuck in 1980."

"The Republican Party has to make its own inner peace with the changing dem=
ographics in America," added Wehner. "If it runs against Hispanics and othe=
r minorities, that ultimately can't be sustained."

Where some operatives foresaw doom for the party, others described opportun=
ity. Trump may not speak from the same playbook as Republican insiders, the=
y argue, but he's bringing new energy to a party desperate for it.

"I reject that the thesis that Trump is necessarily divisive in the long te=
rm. He is divisive in the GOP primary largely because he is challenging the=
 status quo of both the consulting and governing classes," said Jesse Bento=
n, a longtime aide to Ron and Rand Paul. "But as this campaign moves forwar=
d, I think it will be up to existing leaders to get over it and work togeth=
er with Mr. Trump to grow what appears to be a burgeoning movement and make=
 sure that it has a positive, not negative, tone. For example, they must st=
ress that no one is mad at Latinos. The Trump movement must do due diligenc=
e to show that they embrace Latinos."

Tim Albrecht, an Iowa based Republican PR consultant and former adviser to =
Gov. Terry Branstad, suggested Republicans at all levels could benefit if t=
he party can "harness the passion" of Trump voters and turn them into into =
straight-ticket GOP voters.

Some operatives argued that the party itself is at fault for failing to con=
nect with voters the way Trump has, that leaders should learn from his abil=
ity to communicate a persuasive message to grass-roots voters and speak the=
 language of ordinary Americans.

"We needed to find a better message," said Barry Bennett, former campaign m=
anager to Ben Carson who has informally offered advice to Trump. "As Republ=
icans, we always have the inclination to fight the last cycle's wars all ov=
er again. We need to be better at listening. Only then will we get better a=
t talking."

Trump, Bennett added, is bringing new voters into the GOP fold, even if the=
y're not the ones the party envisioned. "He is making the tent larger, whic=
h is the goal," he said.

Fisher, the North Carolina committeewoman, said it's for that reason that p=
arty leaders should embrace Trump if he becomes the GOP nominee.

"I spend a lot of time in beauty/barbershops, on the block and where ordina=
ry people are," she said. "They like Trump and his in-your-face style. He i=
s viewed as sticking it to 'em. If Trump becomes the nominee then we should=
 accept it and help him win and become a great president. In no case should=
 the party ever hope to lose."

ily:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Tim Albrecht, an Iowa ba=
sed Republican PR consultant and former adviser to Gov. Terry Branstad, sug=
gested Republicans at all levels could benefit if the party
 can &quot;harness the passion&quot; of Trump voters and turn them into int=
o straight-ticket GOP voters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN" style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-fam=
ily:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Some operatives argued t=
hat the party itself is at fault for failing to connect with voters the way=
 Trump has, that leaders should learn from his ability to
 communicate a persuasive message to grass-roots voters and speak the langu=
age of ordinary Americans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN" style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-fam=
ily:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&quot;We needed to find =
a better message,&quot; said Barry Bennett, former campaign manager to Ben =
Carson who has informally offered advice to Trump. &quot;As Republicans,
 we always have the inclination to fight the last cycle's wars all over aga=
in. We need to be better at listening. Only then will we get better at talk=
ing.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN" style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-fam=
ily:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Trump, Bennett added, is=
 bringing new voters into the GOP fold, even if they're not the ones the pa=
rty envisioned. &quot;He is making the tent larger, which is the
 goal,&quot; he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ily:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Fisher, the North Caroli=
na committeewoman, said it&#8217;s for that reason that party leaders shoul=
d embrace Trump if he becomes the GOP nominee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ily:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&quot;I spend a lot of t=
ime in beauty/barbershops, on the block and where ordinary people are,&quot=
; she said. &quot;They like Trump and his in-your-face style. He is viewed
 as sticking it to 'em. If Trump becomes the nominee then we should accept =
it and help him win and become a great president. In no case should the par=
ty ever hope to lose.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
