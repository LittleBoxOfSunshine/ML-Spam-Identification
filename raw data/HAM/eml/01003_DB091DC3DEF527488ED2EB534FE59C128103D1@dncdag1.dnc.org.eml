5.10.16 - West Virginia, Nebraska Primary Talking Points


Topline Message:


*         With his lock on the Republican nomination, Donald Trump has ensu=
red that his Party's problems won't be limited to convention chaos -- he's =
going to force GOP races big and small across the country to have to own hi=
s ugly, divisive and dangerous rhetoric all the way to the general election=
.



*         That's why the party faithful -- from senior leaders to the voter=
s of Nebraska and West Virginia today -- have started to fret publicly abou=
t their party's deepening divides, and stumble with no real strategy for em=
bracing their divisive and dangerous standard bearer. Democrats, on the oth=
er hand, have shown in state after state that our voters are excited about =
our primary, and optimistic about both of our candidates.



*         But we're not taking anything for granted, we're going to hold Tr=
ump and Republicans up and down the ballot accountable for their repeated p=
romises to drag our country right back to the reckless policies that were i=
n place in 2009 when the last Republican president left office; when we wer=
e losing 800,000 jobs a month; and, when countless Americans lost their hom=
es and savings. The American people can't afford to let a Republican into t=
he White House.


Key Points

*         Today Ted Cruz refused to throw his support behind Trump, adding =
his name to the growing list of GOP leaders distancing themselves from the =
party's nominee - a list that includes former presidential candidates Mitt =
Romney and John McCain, and the entire Bush family, who all said they won't=
 attend their own convention this year.



*         And as we look toward Trump's upcoming meeting with Republican Se=
nate Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan this Thursday at th=
e RNC, it's clear that any signs they'll show of camaraderie on the way out=
 will be purely cosmetic.



*         That division isn't just happening at the top --- it's visible al=
l the way down to the grassroots of the Republican Party. In exit polls tod=
ay, just ten percent of Republican voters in West Virginia and three percen=
t in Nebraska said they think their party is united.



*         While Republican candidates across the country up and down the ba=
llot are tearing out their hair trying to decide between standing beside Tr=
ump -- the dangerous and reckless candidate they created -- or avoiding the=
ir own convention to distance themselves, Democrats are poised to ride enth=
usiasm and support for our candidates into November.



*         In contest after contest, Democratic voters are reporting their e=
nthusiasm for both of our candidates, while Republicans report that their p=
rimary has divided their party.



*         The national trend favors Democrats, who have seen in exit polls =
week after week that our voters are excited about our primary.



o    In Indiana last week, three-quarters of Democrats said they've been en=
ergized by the nomination contest, while nearly six in ten Republicans said=
 they think their party has been divided.

o    In Pennsylvania the week before, the story was the same, as it was in =
New York the week before that, and Wisconsin before that.



*         Democrats are building the infrastructure for the general electio=
n, and we're doing it with voters enthusiastic because they see our candida=
tes have the right ideas to build on the progress of the last seven years.



*         We've seen a record 74 straight months of private-sector job grow=
th creating over 14 million new jobs, and 20 million people have health car=
e who didn't before. We must elect a Democrat as our next president to keep=
 America on the right track and moving forward.


Divisive, Reckless and Dangerous:

Donald Trump Lacks the Judgment or Temperament to be President


Donald Trump's recklessness would hurt our economy, diminish our standing i=
n the world, and make our communities less safe. Trump is divisive and dang=
erous, and he lacks the judgment and temperament to be president.


*         Trump's impending nomination is a reminder that for years the Rep=
ublican Party has elevated extreme voices, using divisive campaigns that so=
ught to exploit unfounded fears for political gain.


*         Just like Republicans in Washington have done for years, Trump is=
 only looking out for himself. His plans would benefit those at the very to=
p and economists have predicted that his policies could cause a global rece=
ssion. He would drag our country back to where we were when the last Republ=
ican president left office, when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. The A=
merican people can't afford to let Trump bully his way into the Oval Office=
.

*         Trump has already damaged America's relationships across the glob=
e. His record of denigrating women has only gotten worse throughout this ca=
mpaign. His divisive rhetoric has made our communities less safe. And his b=
usiness record is riddled with embarrassing failures that make it clear the=
 American people can't afford to let him get anywhere near the White House.



National Security: Even as a candidate, Donald Trump has damaged America's =
relationships across the globe. In the White House, he would undeniably mak=
e America less safe.



*         Donald Trump has no foreign policy experience and rather than see=
king the advice of well-respected experts, Trump relies on his own misinfor=
med ideas and in his own words, on his "good brain."

*         Trump has falsely claimed that he knows "more about ISIS than the=
 generals" and recommended that the U.S. military commit international war =
crimes.

*         Trump's threat to pull back from our most important military alli=
ances<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-and-the-end-of-n=
ato/2016/03/04/e8c4b9ca-e146-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html> like NATO, =
pull aid from our allies like Israel, and his gushing praise for dictators =
would put our country on a dangerous path.

*         Trump has refused to rule out using nuclear weapons on European t=
erritory, and wants to allow countries that don't currently have nuclear we=
apons to get them, reversing long-held goals of international nuclear disar=
mament.

Wrong on Women: Donald Trump has a decades-long record of denigrating women=
 and promoting misogyny. His policies would make it harder for women to mak=
e their own choices when it comes to their health care or their career.



*         Trump once said you had to  treat women "like s**t" and has spent=
 decades doing so himself by calling women names - "fat pig," "slob," or "b=
imbo" - and saying a man needs a woman to support him at home rather than a=
lways be "griping and bitching."

*         Trump would take away a woman's right to make her own healthcare =
choices and has said women who had abortions should be punished - but not t=
he doctors that performed them - and opposed exceptions for health of the m=
other because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to have an abo=
rtion.

*         Trump thinks ensuring equal pay for women should just be left up =
to "the marketplace" and once suggested family leave policies should actual=
ly be scaled back and noted pregnancy was "an inconvenience for a business.=
" Trump complained that when he employed mothers, they were not giving him =
"100 percent."



Divisive and Dangerous: Donald Trump exploited racial anxieties and cultura=
l fears in the pursuit of getting elected - to the point where his rallies =
have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the media.



*         Trump spouts hateful and dangerous lies about Muslims and called =
to surveil mosques, to ban Muslims from entering the country and to create =
a database of all Muslims in America - including U.S. citizens - and could =
not answer when pressed on how this would be any different from Nazi German=
y.

*         Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" and criminals and said =
they brought disease into the country, said you needed to check if Native A=
mericans were "real Indians," and claimed that a "well-educated black has a=
 tremendous advantage" - but apparently not an advantage in finding housing=
 in Trump properties, because in the 1970s, the Trump Organization was sued=
 for discriminating against Blacks and Puerto Ricans.

*         Trump has been endorsed by former  KKK leader David Duke, and his=
 candidacy has been used as a recruiting tool for the white supremacist mov=
ement, which is no surprise since Trump refused to disavow David Duke and t=
he KKK four times in one interview.

*         Trump has fostered violence against protestors at his rallies, su=
ggesting that a Black Lives Matter protester maybe "should have been roughe=
d up," promising to pay the legal fees if someone would "knock the hell" ou=
t of a protester and reminiscing about the old days when a protester would =
be "carried off on a stretcher."

*         Trump repeatedly threatened the First Amendment by calling to "op=
en up" libel laws so he could sue reporters whenever they printed a story h=
e did not like, made it a practice of banning media outlets he did not like=
 from covering his rallies, and thought "closing" parts of the Internet was=
 a rational strategy to combat ISIS.



Reckless on the Economy, Making Millions at the Expense of Hardworking Amer=
icans: Though he plays the part of a wealthy and successful businessman, Do=
nald Trump's real life record is a reminder that he would endanger the enti=
re global financial system and promote policies that hurt everyday American=
s.



*         Despite his tough talk on trade deals and the loss of American jo=
bs, Donald Trump manufactured his clothing line in countries he rails again=
st, like China and Mexico - a reminder that he made millions at the expense=
 of American workers and on the backs of foreign labor.

*         His Trump "University" fleeced thousands of Americans simply look=
ing to get ahead.

*         Trump's businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt, leaving investo=
rs, contractors and small businesses holding the bag for his bad business d=
ecisions.

*         Trump's unfounded predictions<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/03/trum=
p-predicts-very-massive-recession-in-us.html> of recession under President =
Obama and warnings against investing in the stock market are reckless.

*         Economists have actually predicted Trump's policies could start a=
n international trade war and even destabilize the global economy<http://ww=
w.cbsnews.com/media/is-donald-trump-a-menace-to-the-global-economy/>.

*         Trump's tax plan would overwhelmingly benefit the rich while cost=
ing the country $9.5 trillion to implement -- more than any other Republica=
n plan proposed. It also violates his pledge to eliminate the national debt=
.

*         Trump actually said at one of the Republican Party's debates that=
 wages were "too high" and opposed raising the federal minimum wage

*         Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would jeopar=
dize health care for 20 million Americans who've been able to get coverage =
under Obamacare.


How Democrats Will Win


Republicans couldn't unite against Trump and failed to stand up to him duri=
ng their primary because they were playing to the same extreme base of thei=
r party. Democrats will be united and hold Donald Trump accountable every d=
ay until November 8th.



*         Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been clear they'll w=
ork hard in November to ensure we don't let a Republican like Trump drag ou=
r country backward.

*         While we recognize that any campaign will see the intensity level=
 rise down the stretch, we expect our candidates to maintain a tone that he=
lps us build toward the general election.

*         Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have drawn sharp differences w=
ith one another, but overwhelmingly they've been focused on substance and h=
ow to best move America forward.

*         Because the Party's platform is a statement of our values, the DN=
C is committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both of ou=
r campaigns will be represented on the Platform Drafting Committee, and jus=
t as we did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to partici=
pate.

*         Democrats know that we're stronger when more voices are heard, an=
d when we stand together to move our country forward, we'll see that in Phi=
ladelphia at our convention.
