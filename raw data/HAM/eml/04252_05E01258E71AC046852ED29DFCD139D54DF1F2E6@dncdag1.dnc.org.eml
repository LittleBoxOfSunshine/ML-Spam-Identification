Yup, we need bullets on DWS as progressive champion, combined with bullets about how she has lifted up the Democratic Party and invested in state parties -- so to the extent it actually gives examples that would be useful. Not just --- fought for women's right to choose but how she did it, not just extending health care but secured funding for x, y. 

Tom had provided the DVTF/investment points yesterday. We need them in a clean and concise format so that the state party can think through and push back on BS locally, as well as to provide to the person introducing her. Some of it is right out of her speech but tighter,. Adding Tom here.

The purpose of these are to highlight my progressive record for this crowd. Unless I am misunderstanding what these are for. Can you guys rewrite these and make them a narrative that has some passion behind it, please?
