WASHINGTON POST // ROSALIND S. HELDERMAN



As Marco Rubio considered his options for a new career after stepping down =
as Florida House speaker, he found that the housing bust had depleted deman=
d for the kind of land-use law he had practiced in the past.



But Rubio quickly discovered that his experience as a high-ranking lawmaker=
 could be a lucrative calling card.



Even before he left office in late 2008, his longtime aide sent a letter on=
 behalf of a new private consulting group Rubio was launching, seeking busi=
ness from a potentially major client: Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami=92s =
busy public medical center.



That was an initial step in what became a profitable two-year stretch for R=
ubio between his time as a state legislator and his 2010 election to the U.=
S. Senate. Although he spent much of his time on the campaign trail, Rubio =
built a consulting and legal practice that made more than half a million do=
llars.



=93People who achieve those kind of positions have a lot of juice, to use a=
 fairly vulgar term,=94 said Marvin O=92Quinn, the former Jackson chief exe=
cutive, during a recorded interview with a state ethics official who invest=
igated Rubio=92s business deals. O=92Quinn said it was a =93no-brainer=94 t=
o extend a $96,000-a-year contract to a firm led by someone with the kind o=
f connections of a former speaker.



Another client, Miami Children=92s Hospital, hired Rubio=92s firm on a $102=
,000-a-year contract seeking guidance from a well-known Cuban American on c=
ultural questions, the hospital=92s chief executive told an investigator. O=
ne example: Whether Hispanic customers might prefer an emphasis on diabetes=
 or dentistry.



=93They=92re far more interested in teeth,=94 chief executive Narendra Kini=
 recalled Rubio advising the hospital.



Rubio=92s business deals during the period between his Tallahassee and Wash=
ington chapters demonstrated the ways he leveraged his enduring power insid=
e government to make a profit on the outside. And they add to the contradic=
tory picture of his personal finances that has emerged as his presidential =
campaign has gained traction =97 of a young man who struggled financially e=
ven as his personal income soared along with this political success.



This account is based on a Washington Post review of public records as well=
 as previously unreported depositions recorded by Florida ethics officials =
who investigated a complaint filed by a political critic who, among other t=
hings, alleged that the former speaker had scored clients as remuneration f=
or his legislative support. The inquiry found no evidence to support the al=
legation.



In a 2012 sworn affidavit, Rubio called the complaint =93frivolous=94 and =
=93politically motivated.=94 He said that he secured the contracts as a pri=
vate citizen and that the deals had =93absolutely no bearing on any officia=
ls decisions I made at any time during my service as an elected official in=
 the Florida House of Representatives.=94



Asked whether Rubio=92s political profile played a role in building his cli=
ent base, spokesman Todd Harris said, =93You would have to ask the people w=
ho hired him.=94



Several of Rubio=92s clients said the benefits of hiring a former speaker w=
ere clear.



Kini told an investigator that it was Rubio=92s =93exposure=94 in office th=
at led him to conclude he=92d be a =93good connection to the community.=94 =
Describing Rubio as his personal =93think tank,=94 Kini said Rubio would pr=
ep him before meeting with local organizations. He said he and Rubio spoke =
frequently over the phone, including in evenings, but that Rubio produced n=
o =93written document or work product.=94



Another client, Court Options, a firm that contracts with prosecutors to pr=
ovide classes to people facing legal problems, hired Rubio because he =93un=
derstood the landscape=94 of government, said company co-founder Ruben Vald=
ivia in an interview with The Post.

Rubio initially launched his consulting career through his law firm, Broad =
and Cassel, which had employed Rubio during his speakership to help provide=
 advice and recruit more Hispanic partners. With the housing market falteri=
ng and Rubio looking for new opportunities, the firm then tapped Rubio to h=
ead a newly opened practice called Florida Strategic Consulting, Rubio reca=
lled in his 2012 memoir.



=93I agreed, and began looking for new clients who needed help building str=
onger relationships with local business and civic leaders,=94 he wrote.



An early target client was Jackson Health Systems, parent of the crowded, c=
ash-strapped hospital that serves Miami=92s poor and uninsured residents an=
d had looked to Speaker Rubio for help.



In his final year as speaker in 2008, Rubio backed inserting $20 million fo=
r Jackson into the state budget =97 in effect making up for a 2006 decision=
 by then-Gov. Jeb Bush to veto a $20 million line item for the hospital.



In October 2008 =97 about three weeks before Rubio stepped down =97 his lon=
gtime aide, Viviana Bovo, wrote a proposal on behalf of the new firm to the=
 Jackson Memorial chief executive.



=93With the prospect of even more budget reductions and rate cuts looming o=
n the horizon, our advocacy efforts will assist you in keeping JHS at the f=
orefront of all legislative and budgetary decisions,=94 she wrote.



The hospital accepted the proposal on Dec. 1, just after Rubio left office,=
 agreeing to pay the firm $8,000 a month. Officials told the investigator t=
hat the payment was split, $5,000 to Rubio and $3,000 to Bovo.



Through a spokeswoman at the California hospital where he now works, O=92Qu=
inn declined to discuss Rubio. He told an ethics investigator that he decid=
ed to hire the former House Speaker because =93the stature he held througho=
ut the state=94 meant the young former politician could get the hospital me=
etings with community leaders and donors who could assist it.



=93To have someone like Marco introduce you and get you into to see people =
who might be able to help your organization, I saw as a tremendous benefit =
to us,=94 he said.



O=92Quinn acknowledged that Rubio=92s legislative support had been critical=
 for boosting Jackson=92s funding but said that was unrelated to the decisi=
on to hire Rubio as a private citizen. =93I did not give him a contract bec=
ause he had done something for us,=94 O=92Quinn said. =93That would not hav=
e been the right thing to do.=94



Still, Rubio=92s work for the hospital proved controversial.



Jorge Arrizurieta, who sat on the hospital=92s governing board at the time,=
 told The Post he was angry when he learned from a news account about the d=
eal to hire Rubio. He felt O=92Quinn had purposely agreed to pay Rubio=92s =
firm $96,000 to avoid the required board approval for contracts exceeding $=
100,000.



Arrizurieta is now supporting Bush for president over Rubio, serving as Bus=
h=92s Miami-Dade chairman. At the time of the contract, Arrizurieta said he=
 backed Rubio in the Senate race and feared the contract could hurt his cha=
nces. He said he met with Rubio at his office, shared with Bush at the Bilt=
more Hotel, to warn him off the contract.



=93My message was that, politically, this is crazy,=94 Arrizurieta said. =
=93It=92s been maybe hours since you signed your last bill as speaker and y=
ou=92re going after the bankrupt public health system that got your help?=
=94



Harris, the Rubio spokesman, called Arrizurieta=92s account =93false,=94 no=
ting that his role with Bush=92s campaign means he is =93hardly an impartia=
l source.=94



=93No one ever suggested the contract was anything other than completely pr=
oper, which it was,=94 Harris said.



The Jackson contract shows how Rubio=92s business model initially circumven=
ted a state-imposed two-year ban on former lawmakers lobbying the legislatu=
re. Though Rubio=92s new firm=92s contract required it to =93advocate the i=
nterests of JHS before the Florida legislature and local governments,=94 ho=
spital officials told the ethics investigator that Rubio had promised to wo=
rk only with municipal and community leaders. Bovo would handle the state l=
obbying.



Bovo did not return a call for comment. She told the ethics investigator th=
at she and Rubio kept their jobs separate, with the lobbying ban in mind.



=93Speaker Rubio had his responsibilities with Florida Strategic Consultant=
s. I had mine,=94 she said. =93Like a law office. You have different employ=
ees and they all work in different fields.=94



Even so, O=92Quinn=92s testimony suggests he saw Rubio as the draw. He said=
 he was familiar with Bovo before the contract because she was widely seen =
as a gatekeeper to the speaker. =93You had to go through her to get to him,=
=94 O=92Quinn said.



Harris said the arrangement was not intended to skirt the lobbying ban. =93=
Marco had nothing to do with the lobbying contract,=94 he said.



The setup changed in April 2009, when Rubio and Bovo left Broad and Cassel =
=97 a change that came about, he later wrote in his memoir, as Rubio decide=
d to enter the Senate race and his partners were =93understandably annoyed=
=94 that he would be distracted from the business.



Bovo launched her own firm and continued lobbying for Jackson. Rubio create=
d another firm, Marco Rubio P.A., and signed a new contract indicating he w=
ould assist the hospital in =93developing its community and public affairs =
strategy.=94 His monthly pay was cut, from $5,000 to $3,000, until he termi=
nated the contract in September 2009, citing the demands of his Senate camp=
aign.



While he worked for Jackson, records show that Rubio advised the hospital o=
n at least one major policy issue: whether to ask voters and the Miami-Dade=
 County Commission to approve a tax hike to fund operations.



Rubio suggested during a June 2009 meeting of the governing board that hosp=
ital officials meet with community leaders and =93political partners=94 to =
explain Jackson=92s dire financial status, according to written minutes of =
the meeting.



Harris said Rubio advised hospital leaders that they should not seek a tax =
increase.



But Jackson records show that Rubio submitted a memo to the hospital=92s ch=
ief lobbyist advising that the only solutions to the financial troubles wer=
e a =93combination of serious internal changes and new sources of revenue. =
Both changes will create substantial political and community resistance eff=
orts.=94



He went on to suggest a list of community leaders with whom hospital offici=
als should meet to build sympathy for their cause. The list was largely com=
posed of Rubio=92s longtime political supporters, including Norman Braman a=
nd Benjamin Leon Jr., whose company is among the largest donors to a super =
PAC backing Rubio=92s presidential bid.



Also on the list was Jeb Bush.
