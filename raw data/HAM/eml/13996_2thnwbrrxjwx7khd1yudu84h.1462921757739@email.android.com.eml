ill that come in another statement?

DNC Chair Statement on Tonight=92s Primaries in Nebraska and West Virginia

=93Donald Trump is the Republican Party, and tonight=92s primaries didn=92t=
 do anything to change that fact. That=92s why Republican leaders across th=
e country are tearing out their hair trying to decide between standing with=
 the dangerous and reckless candidate at the top of their ticket, or ditchi=
ng him and their own upcoming convention in a desperate move to save face.

=93Today, Ted Cruz refused to throw his said he would not support behind Tr=
ump, adding his name to the growing list of GOP leaders distancing themselv=
es from the party=92s nominee Trump =96 a list that includes former preside=
ntial candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, and the entire Bush family, w=
ho all said they won=92t attend their own convention this year. That divisi=
on at the top is tearing apart the Republican Party all the way down to the=
 grass roots. In exit polls today, just ten percent of Republican voters in=
 West Virginia and three percent in Nebraska said they think their party is=
 united.

=93By contrast, Democrats are proud of our candidates, who continue to run =
substantive campaigns worthy of the American people, and who understand tha=
t there=92s more that unites us than divides us. In our Indiana primary las=
t week, three-quarters of Democrats said they=92ve been energized by the no=
mination contest. In Pennsylvania the week before, the story was the same, =
as it was in New York the week before that.

=93As we gear up for the general election, we=92re doing it with the confid=
ence that our candidates and our party have the right ideas to build on the=
 progress of the last seven years under President Obama. We=92ve seen a rec=
ord 74 straight months of private sector job growth, more than 14 million n=
ew jobs, and 20 million people have health care who didn=92t before. We mus=
t elect a Democrat as our next president to keep America on track.=94
