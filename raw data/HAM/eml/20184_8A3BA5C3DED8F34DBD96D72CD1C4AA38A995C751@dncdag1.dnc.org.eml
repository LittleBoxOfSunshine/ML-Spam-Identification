Done! Do you want me to send the Allred blast? It should be all set, but you might want to check it (haven't done one in a while).

I'm out again today, but Clayton requested this link on Monday. I made it last night in BSD. All it needs is a source code. Would you mind going into NGP and making it DC378? It's a reception with Simas on Tuesday, June 14th at 5:30pm. Location is Rooftop of Hogan Lovells. 

Thank you!
