Hi Graham,

Ken Vogel at Politico is doing a follow up story on the Hillary Victory Fund and wants us to get back to him by Sunday. Bolded and underlined below are his questions. I've inserted draft answers to some but have left others blank. Appreciate in advance your feedback.

Best,
Mark


______________________________________________________________

We're finally revisiting this subject, and I was hoping you could give me an on-the-record statement about why this is a good deal for state parties and help me answer the following specific questions (I'm also emailing the questions to the Clinton campaign and, in the case of #6, Amalgamated Bank):


1.) Of the $3.8 million that HVF has transferred to the state parties through 3/31/16, $3.3 million has been transferred almost immediately to the DNC. That means that through 3/31 the state parties have kept $500k - or less than 1 percent - of the $61 million raised by the HVF. Why so little?

2.) Based on these numbers, are Hillary Clinton and her allies overstating their support for state parties?

1+2: (on background/please paraphrase) The money from the JFAs is used for critical investments in infrastructure, maintaining the DNC's national voter file, and bolstering our research, communications and digital capabilities, all of which will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November and help strengthen state parties across the country. You can find some of our efforts in the overview of our Democratic Victory Task Force report<https://www.democrats.org/Post/dnc-unveils-2016-democratic-victory-task-force-report-and-action-plan> that came out in November 2015.


3.) Will the HVF allow them to keep more of the overall cash raised going forward?

(off the record) For these questions re strategic considerations, I would direct you to the Clinton campaign. Again, the JFAs help strengthen state parties across the country.


4.) We understand that the DNC has provided the state parties with talking points on how to respond to media inquiries about the joint fundraising committee. Why is that?


5.) Some state party sources have expressed concern that the arrangement could actually hurt participating state parties by keeping them from accepting cash from donors whose checks to the HVF counted towards their $10,000 limit to participating state parties that never got to spend the cash because it was transferred to the DNC. Does that concern you?

(possible off-the-record answer) At this giving level, these are sophisticated donors; they know what they are doing.  If they don't want to give to a state party through HVF and would rather give direct they certainly can.  They are allowed under the JFA agreement to omit any state they want to.  Most state parties do not have access to the level of donors who are writing huge checks.


6.) Sources also tell us that some participating state parties didn't even know the money had been transferred into and out of their accounts until after the fact, despite the fact that some of those parties had actually stipulated in the banking documents that their affirmative consent was required before such transfers could be made from their accounts (using the space on the signature card that asks for "Number of signatures required for withdrawal"). Have any state parties complained to you or the HVF about this and have you taken steps to make sure that they're kept apprised in real time of transfers?


7.) Among the online ads paid for by the HVF, many urge readers to "Stop Trump" or to support Clinton. Are those electioneering?
