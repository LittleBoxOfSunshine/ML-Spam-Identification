All- This email is NOT about the platform stuff. It is about Party Unity. Amy and I just spoke and she raised valid concerns about DWS' 2008 experience which is very compelling in a delivery format being placed in a medium post or in excerpts without context.   I agree with Amy's concerns and want her to weigh in BEFORE we move forward.
