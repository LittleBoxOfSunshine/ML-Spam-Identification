Tax Plans of G.O.P. Favor the Rich Despite Populist Talk<http://www.nytimes=

t-talk.html?smid=3Dtw-share&_r=3D0>
NEW YORK TIMES // JOHN HARWOOD

Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman appointed by President Ge=
orge W. Bush, recently expressed regret about the government's response to =
the 2008 financial crisis. He wished some Wall Street executives had gone t=
o jail.
Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate, isn't so sure. "I=
'm not necessarily a person who's looking for that sort of thing," he said =
in an interview at the New York Stock Exchange.
The reticence of Mr. Rubio, who casts himself as a champion for Americans "=
living paycheck to paycheck," underlined a striking reality of the 2016 cam=
paign. For all their talk of anger and angst among working-class voters, Re=
publican candidates have shied away from economic populism.
Mr. Rubio, in New York for fund-raising at the time of the interview, offer=
s an example. He proposes a significant new tax credit for households with =
children. But he would also cut the top federal income tax rate to 35 perce=
nt, from nearly 40 percent, and eliminate levies on capital gains, dividend=
s and multimillion-dollar estates.
All told, the conservative Tax Foundation estimates that Mr. Rubio's plan w=
ould cut taxes an average of 17.8 percent for all taxpayers - but 27.9 perc=
ent for the top 1 percent of earners.
Mr. Rubio's rivals would also deliver disproportionate gains to the most af=
fluent. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida would adjust tax brackets so that t=
he number of families that owe no income tax would rise to 81 million, from=
 66 million. But he would cut the top income tax rate of 39.6 percent more =
than twice as much as his brother did as president, to 28 percent, while re=
ducing the top capital gains rate to 20 percent and eliminating the estate =
tax.
The Tax Foundation estimates that Mr. Bush's plan would raise the after-tax=
 incomes of top earners 16.4 percent, more than any other group. The founda=
tion says the proposal from the real estate magnate Donald J. Trump, who le=
ads Republican polls, would raise incomes of the top 1 percent of earners 2=
7 percent - also the most of any group.
That pattern reflects a party still wedded to the theories of supply-side e=
conomics 35 years after President Ronald Reagan championed them under far d=
ifferent circumstances, when the top income tax rate was 70 percent. And th=
e reaction to Mr. Bernanke's suggestion reflects deferential instincts towa=
rd financial executives, despite voters' anger after Washington bailed out =
Wall Street.
Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, represents an exception. In=
 his recent book, "God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy," Mr. Huckabee emphasized th=
e vast cultural and economic distance between Middle America and the cosmop=
olitan coastal giants of Los Angeles and New York.
Still stung by opposition on Wall Street to his previous presidential bid, =
in 2008, he seconds Mr. Bernanke in suggesting that some finance executives=
 should have gone to jail.
"Absolutely, they should have," he said. "These were all Ivy Leaguers and t=
hey knew darn well what they were doing - shuffling paper around and gettin=
g paid ridiculous sums of money.
"If the same kind of shell game had been practiced on the street," he concl=
uded, "do you think the cops in the bunco division wouldn't have gone down =
and busted 'em?"
The absence of prosecutions, Mr. Huckabee said, reflects the flow of campai=
gn contributions more than the intricacies of the law.
"Washington is like a strip club," he said. "You've got people tossing doll=
ars, and people doing the dance."
Blunt talk aside, Mr. Huckabee also favors a tax plan that analysts say als=
o disproportionately benefits the affluent. The so-called fair tax, a natio=
nal 23 percent sales levy, would tax consumption instead of income - shield=
ing savings that the wealthy can afford to set aside but that the working c=
lass cannot.
Rand Paul, a Kentucky senator whose proposed 14.5 percent flat tax the Tax =
Foundation says would most benefit incomes above $1 million, reacted to Mr.=
 Bernanke's regret by turning the tables. "He should also admit that he was=
 part of the problem and that his policies led to a great deal of this, too=
," said Mr. Paul, a persistent critic of Fed policy.
In his newly published memoir, Mr. Bernanke dismissed such criticism while =
lamenting the "know-nothingism of the far right." He no longer considers hi=
mself a Republican.
