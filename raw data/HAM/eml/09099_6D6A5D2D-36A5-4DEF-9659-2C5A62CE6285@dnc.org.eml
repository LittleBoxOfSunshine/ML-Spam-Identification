He has made similar comments on CNBC on Thursday about his tax plan being o=
pen to negotiation.

Trump Explained That His Tax Plan Favoring The Wealthy Did Not Match Up Wit=
h His Populist Rhetoric Because It Was Just An Opening Bid In A Negotiation=
. QUESTION: =93Mr. Trump, on the tax front, given that you have championed =
the middle class in so many of your speeches, one of the critiques of the t=
ax plan is that 40% -- about 40% of the tax cuts end up going to the top 1%=
 under the current plan, at least as I understand it. How do you square tha=
t?=94=85 TRUMP: =93I am so much more into the middle class, who have just b=
een absolutely forgotten in our country. You know, when you put out a tax p=
lan, you are going to start negotiating. You don't say, okay, this is our t=
ax plan, lots of luck, folks. There will be negotiation back and forth. And=
 I can see that going up, to be honest with you. I know I am talking to you=
r folks but in all fairness we are cutting. During a negotiation I could se=
e that going up. I don't want middle to go up at all. But I could see that =
going up. And I think that probably will happen, because it's a cut for eve=
rybody. And, you know, the wealthy have done well. I am not complaining. I =
will tell you, this has been an unbelievable period of time for me. It's be=
en an unbelievable period of time for other people that I know that are ver=
y wealthy. It's, you know, but the middle class -- people haven't had a wag=
e increase. One of the reasons I have 25,000 people showing up to hear me s=
peak at one night -- and we turn away 15,000 people -- is because these wor=
kers, these incredible workers, these middle class -- many of them haven't =
had an effective wage increase in 20 years. And some of them are making les=
s money, many of them are making less money now than they made 20 years ago=
 and they're being taxed at a much higher rate and they're working much har=
der. It's supposed to be the opposite. You're getting older, you're suppose=
d to be working a little bit less maybe. But these are people who work hard=
er, they have two jobs in some cases and they're making less money than the=
y made 20 years ago. That's why you're wondering what's going on and why th=
ey're not liking Republicans or Democrats. I mean, they're not liking eithe=
r, to be honest with you. They don't like anybody. They don't like conserva=
tives. They don't like liberals. They're people who work very hard. You got=
 a glimpse -- it was a famous clip where Ted Cruz went to a group of people=
 who were trump supporters, and they were -- these were smart people, and I=
 guess you saw the little debate they had on the street.=94 [Squawk Box, CN=
BC, 5/5/16]

Trump: =93When You Put Out A Tax Plan, You Are Going To Start Negotiating. =

I missed the beginning of the Trump interview but came in when he was argui=
ng that his tax plan will be negotiated and not look like what he put out. =
He claimed it would be a boon for the middle class and raise his taxes. We =
could/maybe should do a hit on  this. Sounded like he didn=92t know his own=
 plan.


On a Fox panel one of the commentators (Kim something?) hit Trump for chang=
ing his mind on his tax plan this week.

He was asked about his flip flop on the minimum wage and he said he was ope=
n to changing it but he really wanted to bring jobs where people could earn=
 more.

He was asked how he could keep Carrier and other companies here when the pr=
oducts for the Trump Collection aren=92t made in the US. He said that the i=
tems for his collection aren=92t made here and didn=92t think it was hypocr=
itical=85.


There is probably more from this interview so someone should take a second =
look.
