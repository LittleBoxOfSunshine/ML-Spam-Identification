We're back for good on the 8th. I plan on going to the convention and, of c=
ourse, want the best package but, in the scheme of everything, it's less im=
portant than Hillary becoming President. Happy to talk with you but my incl=
ination is to give to the Victory Fund. Also, I'm curious who asked you to =
reach out. They usually call me directly. In any event, let's talk, either =
by phone or over lunch, as I always value your opinion.

Glad the kids are doing well. That's most important.


Be well

Bob
