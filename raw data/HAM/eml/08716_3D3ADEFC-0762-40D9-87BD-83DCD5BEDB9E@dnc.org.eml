Just an Internet endorsement re: Tyson is bullshit. He's bragged about it a=

Trump

Demonstrations disrupting campaign?
I didn=92t see the riot,
They were professional agitators
An amazing evening
Where we had 31,000 people
Record setting crowd

You have angered a lot of people. Hispanics have a 15% favorable=85
Those numbers are going up
I have knocked off people like Jeb Bush.
Once I start on Hillary these numbers will change
One by one, I won
Watch what happens with Hillary and watch what happens with my numbers
Kasich and Cruz haven=92t been hit with ads
Last two polls have me tied with Hillary and one has me winning

Women on Trump. 24% favorite, 75% unfavorable. Plays clip of the women card=
.
I only tell the truth.
With all of the polls coming out, I win with the women

But aren=92t you being dismissive of her record?
Bernie Sanders has said worse than that.  He shouldn=92t even be running be=
cause of what she said
Even women don=92t like her
She is playing the women=92s card
I don=92t think she will play it well, I will let you know in six months

Foreign policy speech. Mixed reviews. One was a contradiction on how you ha=
ndle the Middle East.
You have a big fat mess.
We have spent $4B from when the first gunshot was fired.
Our country is becoming third world.
Long Island Railroad is a mess.
Keep the oil. ISIS has Libyan oil.
Every move we have made in the middle east has been wrong.

You sound like a liberal democrat when you want to spend money at home rath=
er than overseas. As a general election candidate, it sounds like you would=
 be criticizing Hillary Clinton from the left.
I want to take care of our country. Education, vets, infrastructure.

Will HRC be the hawk in this race?
No, I will be much tougher than her, and I will have much more respect than=
 her.
We are defending South Korea and others with nothing in return.

POTUS took shots at you last night at WHCD. He said you could close Guantan=
amo because you are good at running waterfront properties into the ground.
Well I guess I am good at something bc I made $10B with a $1M loan.
He did a nice job, but it was fun.

Plays clip of Cruz discussing Mike Tyson. Which is interesting, reaction?
Just shows what a liar he is. It was just an internet endorsement.
This is why we call him Lyin=92 Ted Cruz.
Look we have Bobby Knight=92s endorsement
Mike Pence gave ME more of an endorsement than Ted Cruz

Indiana?
The race is already over
