These look great, just a couple small things. Sorry, couldn't put this in a=
 word doc. Eds below.


DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz

Remarks =96 Alaska State Convention

May 14th, 2016 | 10-15 minutes

Intro



Good evening!



Thank you Sheila [Selkregg] for that kind introduction.


Thank you Chairwoman Casey Steinau, and Kay Brown, our Alaska Dems Executiv=
e Director, for your leadership and the invitation to be here with Alaska D=
emocrats this evening.

And thank you everyone for your hospitality in welcoming me to "The Last Fr=
ontier" [Alaska's nickname].



Let me just start by congratulating all of tonight=92s awardees =96 the leg=
endary Alaskans who will be recognized a little later in the program for th=
eir contributions to the State, for shaping its history, and fighting for i=
ts future =96 in some cases even before Alaska became a state=85



Champions like Vic Fischer =96 one of the authors of the state constitution=
 =96 and his extraordinary wife Jane Angvik, who I know has worked tireless=
ly to help women campaign for public office.

Let=92s give them a hand.


These awardees represent the optimism, enthusiasm, and rugged determination=
 that have given Alaska the special reputation it has across the lower fort=
y-eight.


I hope everyone here will give them the warm reception they deserve in a fe=
w minutes.



As chair of the DNC, I=92ve committed myself to getting to know my fellow D=
emocrats with visits to all fifty states =96 and I=92ll be honest, it=92s b=
een a little easier to reach those lower forty-eight.



So this is my first time visiting Alaska.

And although I=92m still in love with my Florida sunshine, I totally get it=
=85

The views from the flight as we landed last evening were simply breathtakin=
g.


This morning I took my daughter, Shelby, who is here with me tonight, on a =
hike to the Kenai Fjords National Park to see the Harding Icefield.



And while I was disappointed that I couldn=92t actually see Russia from the=
re, <pause>



It was absolutely spectacular=85 if I didn=92t have to be back in Washingto=
n to make sure our team at the DNC is doing everything possible to keep Don=
ald Trump from painting the White House Gold,


I could easily postpone the long flight home to stay longer and explore.

But I know I=92m not the only one here tonight who travelled a great distan=
ce to be at the convention =96 I heard there are even as many as 40 high sc=
hool students coming all the way from Juneau, and registered to be delegate=
s =96 let=92s give them a hand for being the future of the party.



And let me just thank everyone else here who has travelled from across our =
country=92s largest state to show your support.



Your enthusiasm, energy, your commitment, and your dedication to our party =
will make all the difference on Election Day.




That=92s going to be critical =96 we cannot take anything for granted, and =
we must take our opponents seriously from now all the way until November.

And when we unify around our shared goals we will be unstoppable, because w=
e celebrate our diversity. We welcome Americans of every race, gender, reli=
gious background =96 and that means we can all rally around a core of commo=
n values.



So I want to talk briefly tonight about what we=92re doing at the DNC to ma=
ke sure all of you have the resources you need to win our fight against Don=
ald Trump here in Alaska, and to win Democratic seats all the way down the =
ticket on Election Day.


What the DNC Does for Alaska Dems



I became Chair of the DNC in 2011. It was after the rise of the Tea-Party W=
ave handed us some tough losses in the 2010 election and we lost our majori=
ties in congress.



In fact, since 2008, even though we=92ve done a great job of holding on to =
the White House, we=92ve lost 69 House seats, 13 Senate seats, more than 90=
0 state legislative seats, 30 state legislative chambers and 11 governorshi=
ps.





So at the National Party, I=92ve been focused on making sure we=92re doing =
everything we can in every state to make sure that as a party, we aren=92t =
just good at winning presidential races =96 which we have been for four of =
the last six races =96



We want to make sure we=92re good at supporting state parties so they can s=
top the destruction and obstruction Republicans are so fond of at the state=
 and local level =96



Whether that=92s cutting benefits for low-income seniors, fighting against =
the Medicaid expansion, making it harder for families to send their kids to=
 college,

and stifling innovation by cutting scholarships and university funding whil=
e subsidizing corporations like you=92ve seen Republicans doing here in Ala=
ska,



Or in congress, blocking every piece of legislation at every turn, shutting=
 down the Federal government to the tune of $24 billion as Ted Cruz did, an=
d blocking the Supreme Court nominating process instead of doing their jobs=
.



So we=92re engaged in a 50-state strategy to make sure we hold Republicans =
in office and in elections accountable.



That means that here in Alaska the DNC helps fund direct the mail campaigns=
 to reach voters and help get them to the polls on Election Day.



We fund salaries for critical staff under our state party partnerships. In =
fact, Kay Brown can tell you, she was one of the first State Party Partners=
hip employees we ever hired.


Since 2009, the DNC has directly given the Alaska Democratic Party more tha=
n $625,000 in direct support.



But it=92s not just the funding -- the DNC has been out-pacing the GOP in h=
ow we offer direct support to our state parties with training, and bench-bu=
ilding; we share our deep research and communications capabilities in Alask=
a and across the country.



Since 2013, we have quintupled the size of our digital team, to boost fundr=
aising and provide training and support to our state parties.



We=92ve organized a team of experts in messaging, branding, and polling to =
review the way we communicate, and we=92ve built an in-house Communications=
 team to hold Republicans accountable every single day.



We=92ve built out a state-of-the-art media monitoring operation to track an=
d inform our rapid response operation.





Our teams are providing training, disseminating best practices, sharing tec=
hnology and design assets, and building community among State Party staff a=
nd the rest of the Democratic family.



And combined with our national, state-of-the-art voter file, which we=92ve =
been building out for years, we have a real edge that=92s going to help car=
ry us to victory.


And we=92ve done it all while paying off more than $20 million in debt from=
 winning the 2012 presidential election.



Our Candidates



But of course, our number one advantage comes from our candidates, and the =
contrast they=92re offering Alaska voters and the American people.



I couldn=92t be more proud of the two candidates at the top of our ticket.



From Day One, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have been running smart, s=
ubstantive campaigns focused on the issues that matter to voters.



We=92ve watched them engage honestly with voters, answer thoughtfully at to=
wn halls and debates, and deliver an aspirational message that speaks to th=
e hopes and dreams of the American people=85



And no matter which one of our candidates becomes the nominee, we will be u=
nited coming out of our convention and headed toward Election Day.



In the words of To echo Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders =
=93Trump will not be president.=94 [couldn't find a clear example of HRC sa=
ying this, does this phrasing work instead?]



Trump



So, can we talk about "the Donald" - the big red king crab at the top of th=
e GOP ticket that Alaska Democrats are going to cook in November.



As much as he makes for an easy punchline, let me be clear: at the DNC we a=
re not going to make the same mistake the other Republican candidates made.



We=92re ready for Mr. Trump.

Ready to hold him accountable for the damage he=92s doing as a candidate an=
d the damage he=92s promising he would do as president.



And while some of the Republican elites will try to tell you that Trump is =
hijacking their Party, that=92s not true.



His primary victory was years in the making.  The GOP set the stage for =93=
The Rise of Trump=94 with years of divisive, hateful rhetoric.



=95 When Republican leaders plotted to block President Obama=92s progress a=
t every turn on Inauguration Day in 2009, they set the stage for Trump.

=95 When Mitch McConnell said that his primary goal was to make Barack Obam=
a a one-term president, they set the stage for Trump.


=95 When Republicans in Congress voted more than 60 times to take away heal=
thcare from millions of people, when they shut down the federal government =
costing us twenty-four billion dollars, when they relied on dog-whistle pol=
itics to inflame the electorate, they set the stage for Trump.



Before that, Republicans used affirmative action as their wedge issue in 20=
02 2008.



In 2004 it was gay marriage. In 2005 they tried to criminalize the families=
 of immigrants and even clergy, and they have been blocking a fix to the br=
oken immigration system in Congress ever since.



So even though during their primary GOP leaders like Mitt Romney stepped ou=
t of the shadows to say things like, and I=92m quoting:



=93Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a deg=
ree from Trump University=85 His domestic policies would lead to recession.=
 His foreign policies would make America and the world less safe. He has ne=
ither the temperament nor the judgment to be president. And his personal qu=
alities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill=
=85=94



Even then=85 it doesn=92t change the fact that Republicans are still going =
to do everything in their power to prevent our nominee from winning.



Just this week, Trump met with Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell to show that d=
espite their nasty, mud-slinging primary, they=92re getting ready to sing =
=93kumbaya=94 and give us everything they=92ve got.



And what they=92ve got is the same old playbook: the same failed trickle-do=
wn economic policies that preceded the Great Recession under the last Repub=
lican president.



So Trump isn=92t something new =96 he=92s just the old Republican brand wit=
h a little extra bronzer on =96





He only looks out for himself. He lacks the temperament and judgment to be =
commander in chief. And every aspect of his presidency would harm our count=
ry and damage our standing in the world.



Even as a candidate, Trump has damaged America=92s relationships across the=
 globe. In the White House, he would make America less safe.


He has no foreign policy experience =96 but don=92t worry about that - he s=
aid he=92ll rely on his =93good brain,=94 instead of listening to experts.

He has a decades-long record of denigrating women. Seven out of ten women d=
isapprove of his candidacy.


He exploits racial anxieties and cultural fears to the point where his rall=
ies have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the medi=
a.



Recent reports found that bullying at schools is on the rise as a result of=
 his hateful rhetoric. He=92s making our communities less safe and he hasn=
=92t even gotten into office.


And while he tries to paint a picture of his wealth and business success, h=
is record is riddled with examples that he prefers to turn a quick buck eve=
n when it comes at the expense of workers.


But even the same old playbook is one that gave George W. Bush two terms, s=
o we have to treat Trump=92s candidacy as a real threat because it is!!!



Conclusion



The good news is that as Democrats, we=92re giving voters a clear choice.



Our two candidates continue to campaign with the seriousness and depth of k=
nowledge that voters deserve on issues that matter to hardworking American =
families.



We=92ve had 74 straight months of private sector job growth under President=
 Obama, 20 million more people have health insurance who didn=92t before, a=
nd our candidates have ideas for building on that progress.



They have ideas for how to increase wages for hard-working Americans.



They have ideas for fixing our broken immigration system that don=92t featu=
re insulting and degrading relations with one of our strongest allies and e=
conomic partners.



They have discussed the importance of ensuring every child in America gets =
an education that makes them and our nation more competitive, expanding opp=
ortunity and giving everyone a fair shot.



And on the campaign trail, the substance gap between our policies and the G=
OP=92s isn=92t our only advantage =96 the fact that our candidates have kep=
t up their energetic campaigns means we=92ve built an enthusiasm gap that=
=92s going to carry us through November.






With the edge we=92ve worked to build from our national party through our s=
tate parties when it comes to data analytics, means the down-ballot impact =
on our House, Senate, state and local races has the potential to be tremend=
ous.



But most importantly, no component of a political campaign has ever been mo=
re important than party unity and Get-Out-The-Vote participation on the gro=
und.



I know I=92m preaching to the choir a little here, but we need every resour=
ce to win this. Every vote, every phone call. We need people knocking on do=
ors and spreading the word that the consequences this November will be enor=
mous.



I=92m inspired here tonight =96 I wish everyone could see how much dedicati=
on the delegates of Alaska have.



Don=92t let anyone you know believe for a second that just because the pund=
its like to paint Alaska red and say it isn=92t a battleground state means =
you=92re sidelined.



In every presidential election since 2000, the percentage of Alaskans casti=
ng their vote for the Democrat has increased =96 from 27% in 2000 to more t=
han 40% in 2012.



This has already been a historic election year nationally =96 and with your=
 help, I know we can Dump Trump and turn Alaska Blue.



I know we can count on you to keep working hard throughout this election.



So thank you for all you=92ve done to support our party, and thank you for =
everything you will do to bring us all the way to victory in November.



Thank you for your hospitality tonight.



Now on to victory! Thank you, Alaska Democrats!
