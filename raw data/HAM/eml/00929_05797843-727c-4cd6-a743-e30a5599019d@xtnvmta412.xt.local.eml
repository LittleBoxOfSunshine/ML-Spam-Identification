EXCLUSIVE: MITCH McCONNELL in his forthcoming book, "The Long Game: A Memoir," out May 31, re Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid: "Harry is rhetorically challenged. If a scalpel will work, he picks up a meat ax. He also has a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde personality. In person, Harry is thoughtful, friendly, and funny. But as soon as the cameras turn on or he's offered a microphone, he becomes bombastic and unreasonable, spouting things that are both nasty and often untrue, forcing him to then later apologize. 

"For example, [in 2005] he'd called then-Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan a political hack and later decided to enlighten a group of sixty students by calling President Bush a loser during a speaking engagement at their high school. This lack of restraint goes against what is expected from a party leader, and I was skeptical, at best, about the direction of the Senate under his leadership."

'The one thing that I've seen across the country are change agents getting involved,' said Maryland's David Bossie, the Trump ally and Citizens United CEO who ousted a 12-year member of the committee Saturday." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=209a2cff4925617341d72585507a1d40d13a94bafeda316a8dec870422903f00

In a series of interviews at the campaign's New York headquarters, Clinton's tech team conceded it was caught off guard by Sanders, whose enterprise started miles behind in money and organization but has bested the front-runner at nearly every turn." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=229fc6c246069ef73de8dedb9b7dd1ced846de41f108bcdfc72bf048315caba1

"[Barnett said:] 'Senator Rubio has already received many ... inquiries from interested individuals and entities.

TOP TALKER -- "Have Female Journalists Ended the Boys-on-the-Bus Era of Campaign Reporting?" by Irina Aleksander in Vogue: "Of the reporters who dip in and out of the [Clinton press corps], there are 26 women and only three men. ... [Annie] Karni and [Amy] Chozick lead lives that are at once prestigious and entirely unglamorous. Though they're on arguably the biggest story in modern politics, their days are spent jammed into buses and planes and the aggressively air-conditioned Marriotts and DoubleTrees of the intercoastal states, where they eat out of plastic containers and file stories from the carpeted floors of countless event spaces. ... 

"To maintain energy levels, Karni and Chozick have taken power-yoga classes in Des Moines and boxing classes in the suburbs of Las Vegas. In Miami, everyone kept quiet so that NPR's Tamara Keith and the AP's Lisa Lerer, who both have young children back home, could read them 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar' via FaceTime.

"A few days before the March 15 primary, Jen Palmieri makes a rare appearance on the press plane to Cleveland and idly scrolls through her iPhone. 'I'm so sick of my clothes,' she says. 'Are you guys so sick of your clothes?' Chozick replies without looking up from her laptop. 'I want to burn them.'" With cameos from Ruby Cramer, Sara Murray, Gwen Ifill, Jill Abramson, Colleen McCain Nelson, Beth Harpaz, Jenna Johnson http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=cfc713ab48f43c9614e7a231a82df92a50ebc7abee1e024858d9c56f59d1552e

FUTURE FIRST LADY? "Lady and the Trump: Melania Trump might speak softly, but in this rare, candid interview, she comes through loud and clear," by Mickey Rapkin in DuJour: "I ask what Bill and Hillary Clinton got the Trumps for a wedding present in 2005, and Melania says innocently: 'I don't think they sent a gift.' Really? She nods. 'Some people didn't send gifts.' ... 'I like beautiful stuff. I live the life. It's funny when we go and travel. They don't have five-star hotels [in Iowa], but you go with it.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c332b33993ff6641530c1d37f99b717127784b6ef25068ff40d8d7bb541cad28

LIFE ONLINE - N.Y. Times Business front, "State of the Art" column by Farhad Manjoo, "The Trouble With Twitter: Trump's Favorite Tool Is a Blunt Weapon. Now He Needs Nuance" (online: "Twitter, Trump's Trusty Weapon, Could Backfire"): "Twitter is like a partisan primary election. From Mr. Trump's slogan to many of his policy ideas - build a wall, ban Muslims - his message has been perfectly tailored to the medium. But now, if he tries to expand his message beyond red-meat issues for the right, Mr. Trump may feel caged in by a platform that takes a dim view of self-restraint." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d20200de6353952197dbcba2dec161fc39e6089e96f1e3bd087afef77613f7c2

DAILY DONALD - USA Today banner, "TRUMP'S TAX TROUBLES: More than 100 disputes are tied to billionaire candidate's companies," by Nick Penzenstadler and David McKay Wilson: "Trump's companies have been engaged in disputes over taxes almost every year from the late 1980s until as recently as March." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=75adf8ab2b49c5f20d5e9c5c4a532022b85e15a0748f253ae32bcbcf595f30aa 

2016 PLAYERS - "Trump Taps Washington Lawyer to Help Vet Potential Running Mates," by Bloomberg's Kevin Cirilli and Jennifer Jacobs: "He ran the vetting process for Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008 that ultimately selected Sarah Palin. ... From 1987 to 1989, Culvahouse served as White House counsel to President Ronald Reagan, helping to handle the failed Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork. He is currently a lawyer in the Washington, D.C. law firm O'Melveny & Myers." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=6035a7e8469cdf5652628c44f3fd090ca087db0df7b82566e5178b5673dd96ad

MEDIAWATCH - WashPost Style front, bottom of page, "Bezos [in on-stage interview with Marty Baron] responds to Trump's criticism, defends campaign coverage," by Paul Farhi (online: "'Not an appropriate way for a presidential candidate to behave': Bezos fires back at Donald Trump"): "He declined to address each of Trump's allegations specifically, but observed, 'Some people would say this is very tactical, to immunize against the media. ... But I'm very, very comfortable with all of Amazon's approaches and behaviors, [such as] the way we pay taxes.' ...

"Trump's latest criticism of Bezos was sparked by comments made by Post reporter Bob Woodward last week during a speech to a business group. Woodward said, accurately, that the paper had assigned some 20 reporters to produce a biography of Trump."

Woodward told the group that Bezos said: "Look, the job at The Washington Post has to be tell us everything about who the eventual nominee will be in both parties - 15-part, 16-part series, 20-part series, we want to look at every part of their lives, and we're never going get the whole story, of course, but we can get the best attainable." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=f67b341d99b901358a6107fef13bb3a5209a2245168c61aeb1b72d528eee3c0f

Names Elizabeth Spayd Public Editor" -- Release: "Since joining [Columbia Journalism Review], Ms. Spayd has led its transition from a print-centric bimonthly magazine to a digital-first publication that is more timely, sophisticated and smart in its coverage and analysis of news and media industry trends and journalistic ethics. Ms. Spayd spent the largest part of her career at the Washington Post in a multitude of reporting and editing positions. In 2006, she became the managing editor for the Post's digital operations and in 2008, was named the paper's managing editor.

DAILY DONALD -- "Donald Trump accuses Bill Clinton of rape," by Nick Gass: "The allegations raised against Donald Trump in a recent New York Times article are nothing compared to the Clintons' history, the presumptive Republican nominee said in an interview with Fox News' 'Hannity' aired Wednesday night. 'For example, I looked at The New York Times. Are they going to interview Juanita Broaddrick? Are they going to interview Paula Jones? Are they going to interview Kathleen Willey?' Hannity asked Trump ... 'In one case, it's about exposure. In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.' Trump replied, 'And rape.'"

INSIDE TRUMP'S COURT LIST -- Nick Gass: "Of the 11 names, ... all are white and none ... from Harvard - the law school that has churned out the most justices in Supreme Court history. Only one graduated from an Ivy League institution - Yale." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=b963e760014dd4812b2e80eff1db8a14fbe3892d9704c4380e411b8ae70edfc4 

RICH LOWRY on Politico, "The Trump-Sanders Two-Step": "If the grass-roots movement that Sanders has built will pressure Democrats all the way to the Philadelphia convention and beyond, Trump has arguably done more to pull the country's politics leftward. He has, for now, managed to do what the Democrats and the media have been attempting for most of the Obama era: to kill off the tea party as a national force. By dividing it, eclipsing it and making its animating concerns of limited government and constitutionalism into after-thoughts, Trump has neutered a heretofore potent vehicle against Big Government." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=10a33cee7e877b9e6a11c0e4a7dfe59481b33a155a553a057994128f41956a9a 

ROBERT KAGAN in WashPost, "This is how fascism comes to America": "The Republican Party's attempt to treat Donald Trump as a normal political candidate would be laughable were it not so perilous to the republic. If only he would mouth the party's 'conservative' principles, all would be well. But of course the entire Trump phenomenon has nothing to do with policy or ideology. It has nothing to do with the Republican Party, either, except in its historic role as incubator of this singular threat to our democracy. Trump has transcended the party that produced him. ... Their allegiance is to him and him alone." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=3bafd2a9fae555da28f3a8096c28f7d3b53ae6450cb5435148d8415eac681c11 

--"Dying GOP Senator Apologizes to Muslims for Donald Trump," by Daily Beast's Tim Mak: "Former GOP senator Bob Bennett lay partially paralyzed in his bed on the fourth floor of the George Washington University Hospital. ... 'Are there any Muslims in the hospital? ... I'd love to go up to every single one of them to thank them for being in this country, and apologize to them on behalf of the Republican Party for Donald Trump." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=86dd210294c61db65a3e2632ff62738d0ce3308e01b570b0403449631b4d4b1d 

--"When Trump made a pass at me. And why it matters," by Yahoo's Lisa Belkin: "In the early months of 1987, I was a 26-year-old reporter at the New York Times and I went to a party at the newly opened Wollman Rink in Central Park. ... I had interviewed Trump once for an article and was somehow invited to this event, which I attended with my now husband. I introduced him to Trump, we all chatted briefly, and then Bruce went off to get some hot chocolate or somesuch. After he'd walked away, Trump said there would be an even better afterparty and I was welcome to join him, but only if I came alone." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d2e5c3c3ef60d406da88df46fc809bdda58ef3d348ad245d454432770abc51e4 

KARL ROVE column in WSJ (with top-of-A1, tease), "What If Clinton Gets Indicted? It would scramble the campaign if Hillary or her aides lose the vital FBI primary": "If there are indictments, Team Clinton will dismiss them as an overreaction to unintentional, minor mistakes and try pushing on through. But that may be unacceptable to the party's hierarchy, especially if indictments occur before the Democratic convention in Philadelphia opens July 25. The party establishment might balk at having the ticket led by someone mired in a national-security scandal or by Mr. Sanders, ... who has never ... attended a ... national convention.

"Instead, the party establishment might move to replace Mrs. Clinton with Vice President Joe Biden, a sentimental favorite, or Secretary of State John Kerry, whom many in the party's leadership think more substantive, less prone to gaffes and, because of his 2004 loss against President George W. Bush, more deserving. The legally unbound superdelegates hold the balance of power." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2ed8488c9a1311661b2b4ecff6f084a024141549b88eff7687f985c73bcec116

OFFICE TENANTS CAN BE CHOOSY - WashPost A1, at fold, "Many office towers around nation's capital sit empty: As employers focus on urban centers, downturn hits suburbs [including office parks] hardest," by Jonathan O'Connell: "Buildings began to empty during the recession, and they took another punch when the government shut down and federal spending slowed. The local economy began to pick up last year, but the recovery has been spotty, with construction cranes dotting the Washington skyline but absent from many parts of the suburbs, particularly areas far from mass transit." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=84e021b9debcbe30e6e399864a51aa9e17599a3493a68efc36b2328d83242140

HOLLYWOODLAND -- "Robin Wright Demanded The Same Pay As Kevin Spacey For 'House of Cards,'" by HuffPost's Emily Peck: "'I was like, "I want to be paid the same as Kevin," said Wright, who plays Claire Underwood ... 'I was looking at the statistics and Claire Underwood's character was more popular than [Frank's] for a period of time. So I capitalized on it. I was like, "You better pay me or I'm going to go public,"' Wright said with her trademark blinding-white grin. 'And they did.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=19b3b95b175e671dbeb90bcbf2e8516ac3008544657b9d4197212bd0bccdd0b0

REMEMBERING KAREN FINNEY's dad: "James Nathaniel Finney, a longtime civil rights activist, died May 5 at his residence in Washington ... after an extended battle with cancer. He was 79. Finney, a former member of the Columbia University Law Students Civil Rights Research Council, was revered for his commitment and tenacity on behalf of those treated unfairly by society and his passion for social justice. A graduate of Columbia University School of General Studies and Columbia Law School, Finney also served in the U.S. Army, receiving an honorable discharge after a successful tour of duty in Germany.

"Finney continued his commitment to civil rights and social justice as a staff attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund for six years, then at the New York Community Legal Services Agency until he was recruited to be associate general counsel of the trial division at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, prompting a move to Washington in 1980."

** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Two years ago, we announced our $100 million investment in Detroit's recovery, but already the city offers lessons in creating inclusive growth. At the heart of the turnaround? Collaboration-between the public sector, nonprofits and private companies. "Businesses need to be involved, and they need to think differently about how they contribute," notes Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO. For minority-owned small businesses like House of Pure Vin, that means we've got their future in mind when we forge innovative funding partnerships. Learn more about the partnerships that are working in Detroit, and what they can teach us about creating more widely shared
 economic opportunity in cities around the world. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7157105290825b8f27b5ac87bbf57fde558208e0ffd7bdf2a0cc4a4ea75c17e9 **

He has, for now, managed to do what the Democrats and the media have been attempting for most of the Obama era: to kill off the tea party as a national force.<b> </b>By dividing it, eclipsing it and making its animating concerns of limited government and constitutionalism into after-thoughts, Trump has neutered a heretofore potent vehicle against Big Government.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=10a33cee7e877b9e6a11c0e4a7dfe59481b33a155a553a057994128f41956a9a" target="_blank">http://politi.co/23Y39OW</a> </p><p>

I had interviewed Trump once for an article and was somehow invited to this event, which I attended with my now husband. I introduced him to Trump, we all chatted briefly, and then Bruce went off to get some hot chocolate or somesuch.
