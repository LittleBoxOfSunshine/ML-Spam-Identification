Trump Said He "Gave Up A Tremendous Amount" To Run For President. TRUMP: "I don't need publicity. I gave up a lot to do it.

You know, got a little controversial for a little while and I lost certain licenses, which is not the biggest deal in my life, but it's -- Macy's didn't want to renew me because they thought I was a little controversial which was I think a big mistake that they made, not very loyal. Pretty costly think that I did, not just the cost of the campaign which is frankly less, it's the cost of what I do. Now it's worked out well, I'm just very happy with the way it all worked out."

I don't know why because all I want to do is have really strong trade deals, already. And frankly, if people are going to be taking advantage of us like China does and like almost every country does." [Squawk Box, CNBC, 5/5/16] [33:00]

Don't you think you need a higher standard than to get involved in this kind of stuff?" TRUMP: "Here is what happened. Ted Cruz's father seems like a nice guy, I don't know him, but seems like a nice guy, he made horrible statements about me, you know, pray -- praying for bad things to happen to me. Okay, essentially. I said that's horrible. And I was on a show, one of your competitors, and they showed me the clip. I said, wow, that's horrible. It's not just a one-way street, you know, where I do something. It was a horrible statement. I was actually surprised by it. And during that and when I said how bad it was that a man would say something like that I said, well, why don't you read the various magazines because it's not only there, it was put in numerous where he has a picture of himself with Lee Harvey Oswald."

Now that you have the Republican presumptive nominee you have to have a higher standard than to repeat theories like that." TRUMP: "First of all, I wasn't at the time.

'I really feel that it's important that I do what's right as opposed to necessarily cater to what's going to play to the voters,' Trump said.

'So now I'm going to be focused on Hillary and you'll be dealing with me and we'll see what happens,' he said, predicting most of the Republican Party would unify behind him. 'And I think we have a very strong case against Hillary.

Vice President
Trump: "I Want A Vice President Who Will Help Me Have A Major Impact Quickly On Capitol Hill, And The Message Will Be Clear To The Nation And To People Abroad That The American Government Will Be Using Its Power Differently." "While professing some surprise at his success, Mr. Trump increasingly sounds like a man who thinks he knows where he will be eight months from now, and the unrivaled power he will hold. He talked of turning the Oval Office into a high-powered board room, empowering military leaders over foreign affairs specialists in national security debates, and continuing to speak harshly about adversaries. He may post on Twitter less, but everyone will still know what he thinks. 'As president, I'll be working from the first day with my vice president and staff to make clear that America will be changing in major ways for the better,' Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview on Saturday. 'We can't afford to waste time. I want a vice president who will help me have a major impact quickly on Capitol Hill, and the message will be clear to the nation and to people abroad that the American government will be using its power differently.'"

QUESTION: "I know you've been peppered with vice president selection questions over the past couple of days. They're requisite, don. No way around it. I'll start differently. In your heart of hearts, do you think it will be someone from the 16 fallen, from the probably not miss Fiorina, I imagine but will it be from the group of people who also ran for president?" TRUMP: "Well, I would say probably a 40% chance within the group. I've gotten to be friends with a lot of those people, and I guess perhaps enemies with a couple, but I've gotten to be friends with quite a few, and I would say there is a good 40% chance." [Squawk Box, CNBC, 5/5/16]

Trump Said It Was Unlikely He Would Choose John Kasich As His Running Mate. QUESTION: "I also saw something, Donald, that you said about John Kasich which may or may not be what people were expecting. I didn't know you talked to him during all the breaks, during the debates, and had a very good relationship with him, because all is fair in love and war, as we know. And the rhetoric that gets thrown back and forth. But you actually made the comment that his -- your view of him has been rising in recent days as far as possibly selecting him." TRUMP: "Well, I have had a good relationship with him, and I really get along with him pretty well. I would say probably it's unlikely that it will be John. I am not sure that John even wants it. But I think it's unlikely that it will be John, but his -- I do have a good view of him, and I do have a good opinion of him. But I -- I think it's probably unlikely."


Trump: "I Would Be Interested In Vetting John [Kasich]." TRUMP: "I would be interested in vetting John. I like John. I've had a good relationship with John. Whether he is vice president or not, he will be very helpful with Ohio." [Situation Room, CNN, 5/4/16]

I have a lot of respect--" BLITZER: "Even people who have said nasty things about you?" TRUMP: "Well, you know, I feel differently about that.

And I may put Ben Carson on the committee. I may put Chris Christie on the committee. They came out early. They were very strong. They are very good people, very good people."

Potential Appointees
Trump Said His Daughter Ivanka, And Son-In-Law Jared Kushner Would Be Close Advisers, And Jared Kushner Could Serve In His Administration. "Mr. Trump did seem aware that his early months could be consumed with trying to win confirmation for his cabinet and perhaps a new Supreme Court justice and with making appointments throughout the bureaucracy. He made it clear that he was not interested in delegating these tasks and that he wanted to make sure his appointees shared his governing philosophy. One of his closest advisers, his daughter Ivanka, would probably stay with his company, but he said he would seek counsel from her and her husband, the businessman Jared Kushner, and noted that family members had served in administrations before. Even jobs that might seem incidental in a Trump universe, like a United States ambassador to the United Nations, have apparently crossed his mind. 'I think about a U.N. ambassador, about a secretary of defense and secretary of treasury, but I think more about winning first,' Mr. Trump said. 'Otherwise I'm wasting time. I want people in those jobs who care about winning. The U.N. isn't doing anything to end the big conflicts in the world, so you need an ambassador who would win by really shaking up the U.N.'"

Trump Said He Would Give Key Roles In His Administration To Military Generals, Executives, And Family Members. "Donald J. Trump is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but he is also keenly aware that many in his own party - and many Americans, frankly - are scared and anxious about the idea of him in the Oval Office. Even he is not sure how a deeply divided nation would adjust to the first 100 days of a Trump presidency. What he does know, however, is what he wants to do in those early months. In a series of recent interviews, he sketched out plans that include showdowns with business leaders over jobs and key roles for military generals, executives and possibly even family members in advising him about running the country."

Trump Agreed Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie, And Ben Carson Would Be "Very Wise" Choices As Potential Appointees. O'REILLY: "And I said last night, yes, and this isn't going to surprise you what I'm about to say to you. I said last night that I believe before you get to Cleveland you are going to try to consolidate the Republican establishment support by doing the following, appointing Rudy Giuliani the Homeland Security chief. Appointing Governor Christie the Attorney General, and Ben Carson in charge of Health and Human Services. I said I think that Trump's going to do that. Would I be wrong?" TRUMP: "Well, I have not made that decision but certainly they would be three very wise choices. I think they would be popular but more importantly I think they would do a phenomenal job all three of them. No, I haven't, you know, thought about that. But I will tell you all three would be very good choices and very good positions for themselves. I think it would be good." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 5/4/16]

Trump: "You Take Somebody Like Jeff Sessions, Though I Think He Is Very Happy Where He Is. He Is A Very Important Senator. That's A Very Good Position. It's Hard To Say Leave The Senate And Do This, Right, Run An Agency." QUESTION: "I have heard you intimate that you might go into the convention with some, you know, already with a team selected for certain positions. Could you tell us anything for sure at this point about, you know, whether there is Chris Christie as A.G. Or Giuliani as homeland security?" TRUMP: "I have had great support from Rudy Giuliani. I have had great support from Chris Christie, Dr. Ben Carson. You take somebody like Jeff Sessions, though I think he is very happy where he is. He is a very important senator. That's a very good position. It's hard to say leave the Senate and do this, right, run an agency. But I have had great support from certain people, and I like that. Rudy Giuliani has been fantastic. Newt Gingrich has been amazingly supportive." [Squawk Box, CNBC, 5/5/16]



Trump Warned "If We Don't Pick The Correct Supreme Court Justices, This Country Is Going To Be Forever Changed." TRUMP: "But the single most important thing right now, after those two subjects, is Supreme Court. And Supreme Court justices. And I will tell you that, if I don't win, you will have more of the people that have been put on over the last number of years, and we will have a Supreme Court that will change this country to a level like you have never seen. You will have Bernie Sanders types put on the Supreme Court. And this country will be a totally different country. This country will be Argentina. This country will be something that is so different. It will be Venezuela. You have no idea what's going on in the Supreme Court. When you look at the differences in decisions, when you look at the horrendous decisions being made. And wanting to be made and will be made. Now, the only thing holding them back is the fact that, you know, we lost a great justice recently, and -- but the only -- who has to be replaced. And you know, this president, whoever this president is, is going to be making perhaps as many as four and maybe even as many as five choices, picks, and if we don't pick the correct Supreme Court justices, this country is going to be forever changed. So when I hear all of these people saying, well, we're going to sit it out, I'm going to put on great conservative, smart, wonderful, respected judges. And I will tell you, if somebody isn't there to do that and to counter-balance what's going on, it's so important. And it's going to be a country that you won't recognize in ten years."

Tax Returns

Trump Claimed He Could Not Release Any Of His Older Tax Returns That Had Already Been Audited "Because They're Called Linking Returns. They Link." BLITZER: "Hillary Clinton says she's released all of her tax returns; you haven't. Are you going to do that?" TRUMP: "I will. I really look forward to doing it. But I am under order. When you are under order, you just don't do it. Any lawyer--" BLITZER: "Under order from who?" TRUMP: "From the government." BLITZER: "They're auditing some of the -- but what about tax returns that have already been audited?" TRUMP: "We go -- I go back a long time, because they're called linking returns. They link. So, when I am under order, I don't want to do it. Now, I hope to be able to do it." [Situation Room, CNN, 5/4/16]



Trump Claimed He Was Being Targeted By The IRS For Audit Because Of Political Reasons. BLITZER: "So, once the audit ends, you will release them?" TRUMP: "By the way, and I will tell you what's very unfair." BLITZER: "Yes." TRUMP: I have been audited every year for many years, beyond Obama." BLITZER: "Well, you make a lot of money." TRUMP: "I do make a lot of money, but I am audited every year. I have friends that make a lot of money, they have never been audited. I say to friends of mine, how often are you audited, very wealthy people?" BLITZER: "So, you think this is political, that they're aiming at you?" TRUMP: "I would say yes. I would say yes." BLITZER: "The IRS is doing this?" TRUMP: "I am -- I don't know. I can't tell you. But I am audited every single year. I have friends that are very wealthy people. When I talk about audit, they don't know even what I am talking about. So, I am almost used to it, almost like a normal thing. But so many people never get audited, and I'm audited every year. So, while I'm under audit, I am not going to release tax returns. No lawyer would let you do that. It is routine ordered stuff, but no lawyer would let you do that." [Situation Room, CNN, 5/4/16]



Women

Trump Said His Favorability With Women Would Improve "Because Women Want Security. Women Want Strong Military. They Want To Know That They're Secure In Our Nation. Women Want Women's Health Issues Taken Care Of." BLITZER: "There's a new CNN poll that is out shows 61 percent of female voters nationwide, Republicans, Democrats, independents, they say they back Hillary Clinton. Only 35 percent of women nationally say they back you. How are you going to change that?" TRUMP: "I think we are going to change that. I think it will change. I think it will change rapidly, because women want security. Women want strong military. They want to know that they're secure in our nation. Women want women's health issues taken care of. And Hillary is not going to do it like me, because I am going to make our country rich again. I am going to bring back our jobs. We are going to have a good economy again, which we don't now. We have a horrible economy right now. And again, remember this. NAFTA has been a total disaster for our country. NAFTA was signed by the Clinton administration. What NAFTA has done to this country -- and I have gone through it -- I won New York big. And, by the way, speaking of winning New York big, if you look at the polls, the exit polls, I was number one with women by a long shot. Nobody was even close to me."

He also made clear that case will rest heavily on trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed by her husband in the 1990s. 'The NAFTA is the worst trade deal in the history of any country anywhere in the world at any time,' he said. 'And it was a Clinton trade deal. NAFTA was Clinton.

TRUMP: "Well I don't think they understand my immigration policy. I want people to come in and we want people to come in even rapidly, but they have to come in through the system, they have to come in legally... We want people to have in. We certainly don't want to shrink our economy, and I think you folks know me very well for many years. I'm not a shrinker of economies, I'm a grower of economies.

I will tell you, I have so many friends who are very good business people, and it's impossible for them to do business with the bankers that get big salaries and that are very capable and all of that, but they're not running the banks. The regulators are running the banks. You know that, Bob. It's very tough for people to borrow money. They're petrified of making a loan to a really good business person who is going to pay it back, but there is that chance that maybe the loan won't be good someday, and therefore they don't get the money. So many people are calling me, can I help them with a bank. The banks are, you know -- I am not even blaming the bankers. I am blaming the fact that the regulations, the regulatory climate is so bad that the banks just aren't loaning to businesses." [Squawk Box, CNBC, 5/5/16]

Trump: "I Have Nothing Against Janet Yellen Whatsoever.... But She Is Not A Republican.

QUESTION: "But you have made some comments about Janet Yellen. Number one, do you think that she is not the right person right now for the job? Would you not reappoint her?

She has people who I know have high regard for her. But she is not a Republican. She is not a person that, you know, when her time is up, I would most likely replace here because of the fact that I think it would be appropriate. She is a low-interest-rate person.

She has always been a low interest rate person. I must be honest. I am a low interest rate person. If we raise interest rates and if the dollar starts getting too strong, we're going to have some major problems. You look at what's happening with our trade. I mean, you look at what China is doing to their currency with de-valuations. They're killing us on trade. Trade is the single -- and de-valuation. If you want to really take a hard look at what's going on, the de-valuation is the single greatest tool that these other countries are using to absolutely kill us, assuming they have capability, manufacturing capability, et cetera. And China is like a grand master. They are the grand master of all grand masters. And if we start raising rates, I have always been a low interest rate person. Now, if inflation starts coming in and we don't see any signs of that, but inflation starts coming in, that's a different story. Then you have to go up and you have to slow things down. But right now I am for low interest rates, and I think we keep them low, and we have to compete. We have to compete in many ways. But when the dollar started going up recently, that was not -- you looked at what happened, and we're going to lose all our business. It's wonderful. It's a funny thing. I love the concept of a strong dollar. In many respects obviously I like a strong dollar. But when you look at the havoc that a strong dollar causes, and I can tell you I have friends in China. All they do is watch the dollar. They love to see it go up. They love to see that dollar go up. So actually, while there are benefits, it sounds better that have a strong dollar than in actuality it is." [Squawk Box, CNBC, 5/5/16]

Trump Advocated Refinancing Long Term Federal Debt At Low Interest Rates To Fund Infrastructure Investment. TRUMP: "I think there are times for us to refinance. We refinance debt with longer term. Because we owe so much money. Nobody talks about it. Nobody talks about it until the bubble pops. And the bubble could pop. And it could pop. It could be ugly. You have seen it a couple of times but you haven't seen it as bad as it could be. I could see long-term renegotiations where we borrow long term at very low rates. Frankly, we do need money to rebuild the infrastructure of our country." [Squawk Box, CNBC, 5/5/16]

Trump: "I Am The King Of Debt. I Do Love Debt. I Love Debt. I Love Playing With It."

Two, three, four, five points more. It's a real dilemma. We have to be very, very careful, and I am the king of debt. I do love debt. I love debt. I love playing with it. Of course, now you are talking about, you know, you're talking about something that's very, very fragile." [Squawk Box, CNBC, 5/5/16]

Trump Bragged About Having Borrowed Money Knowing He Would Not Pay It All Back: "I Have Borrowed Knowing You Can Pay Back With Discounts...

Of course, I was swash buckling and it went well for me. Debt was always interesting to me. Now we're in a different situation with the country. I would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal. And if the economy was good, it was good. You can't lose.

Many of the top people in my category use the laws. I know more about debt than practically anybody, I love debt. I also love reducing debt, and I know how to do it better than anybody. I will tell you with Puerto Rico they have too much debt. You can't just restructure; you have to use the laws, cut the debt way down, and get back to business, because they can't survive with the kind of debt they have. I would not bail out if I were - if I were in that position I wouldn't bail them out." [Situation Room, CNN, 5/4/16]

Trump Said It Would Be "Devastating For Our Country" If Interest Rates Rose By Even Just 1%. TRUMP: "I'm not talking about with a renegotiation but you can buy back at discounts, do things with discounts. I am not even suggesting that we don't borrow at low rates long term. Part of the problem is when the debt comes due, what happens if the rates are high and we have no budget that can even conceivably take care of this. This is bigger than any line item. It's bigger than anything we can think of, the debt. If interest rates go up 1%, 1%, it's devastating. If they go up two or three or four percent, that's impossible. Start figuring those numbers and put them onto your balance sheet and cost them out. And it would be devastating for our country." [Squawk Box, CNBC, 5/5/16]


Tax Policy
Trump Explained That His Tax Plan Favoring The Wealthy Did Not Match Up With His Populist Rhetoric Because It Was Just An Opening Bid In A Negotiation. QUESTION: "Mr. Trump, on the tax front, given that you have championed the middle class in so many of your speeches, one of the critiques of the tax plan is that 40% -- about 40% of the tax cuts end up going to the top 1% under the current plan, at least as I understand it. How do you square that?"... TRUMP: "I am so much more into the middle class, who have just been absolutely forgotten in our country. You know, when you put out a tax plan, you are going to start negotiating. You don't say, okay, this is our tax plan, lots of luck, folks. There will be negotiation back and forth. And I can see that going up, to be honest with you. I know I am talking to your folks but in all fairness we are cutting. During a negotiation I could see that going up. I don't want middle to go up at all. But I could see that going up. And I think that probably will happen, because it's a cut for everybody. And, you know, the wealthy have done well. I am not complaining. I will tell you, this has been an unbelievable period of time for me. It's been an unbelievable period of time for other people that I know that are very wealthy. It's, you know, but the middle class -- people haven't had a wage increase. One of the reasons I have 25,000 people showing up to hear me speak at one night -- and we turn away 15,000 people -- is because these workers, these incredible workers, these middle class -- many of them haven't had an effective wage increase in 20 years. And some of them are making less money, many of them are making less money now than they made 20 years ago and they're being taxed at a much higher rate and they're working much harder. It's supposed to be the opposite. You're getting older, you're supposed to be working a little bit less maybe. But these are people who work harder, they have two jobs in some cases and they're making less money than they made 20 years ago. That's why you're wondering what's going on and why they're not liking Republicans or Democrats. I mean, they're not liking either, to be honest with you. They don't like anybody. They don't like conservatives. They don't like liberals. They're people who work very hard. You got a glimpse -- it was a famous clip where Ted Cruz went to a group of people who were trump supporters, and they were -- these were smart people, and I guess you saw the little debate they had on the street."

"Donald Trump won't self-fund his general-election campaign, and will instead create a 'world-class finance organization,' the presumptive Republican nominee said in an interview on Wednesday.

The New York businessman, who did receive some mostly, small unsolicited donations, lent his campaign $36 million of the $47 million he spent through March.

"British Prime Minister David Cameron has toned down his comments on Donald Trump, saying the Republican presidential hopeful deserves respect - but was wrong to call for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. After Trump proposed the temporary ban on Muslims last year in the wake of attacks by extremists, Cameron called the comments 'divisive, stupid and wrong.' Asked at a news conference Thursday if he wanted to apologize for calling Trump's remarks stupid, Cameron said that anyone who came through the 'grueling' race to select their party's nominee 'certainly deserves our respect.' But on Trump's suggestion about banning Muslims, Cameron said 'I'm very clear that the policy idea that was put forward was wrong, is wrong and will remain wrong.'"[Associated Press, 5/5/16<http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/05/05/world/europe/ap-eu-britain-trump.html>]

Trump Stood Behind His Proposal To Ban Foreign Muslims From Entering The United States. "Also in his interview with NBC's Lester Holt, Trump said he stood by his proposal to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States. 'I do. We have to be vigilant. We have to be strong.'"

Hillary Clinton

Trump Compared Hillary Clinton's Inability To Lock Up The Democratic Nomination To "A Football Team That Can't Get It Over The Line." TRUMP: "Well, I think what has happened, there's been a little flip. And I'm even surprised by it. I thought that I would be going longer and she would be going shorter. She can't put it away. That's like a football team that can't get the ball over the line. I put it away. She can't put it away. So, I thought that I would be out there and she'd be campaigning against me. I didn't realize. So, yes, I will be campaigning against her while she's campaigning" [Situation Room, CNN, 5/4/16]


Trump Said "[Hillary Clinton] Is Unqualified Because Of The Fact That Her Judgement Is So Bad." "Now finding himself the nominee, Trump immediately pivoted to the general election. 'So now I'm going to be focused on Hillary and you'll be dealing with me and we'll see what happens,' he said, predicting most of the Republican Party would unify behind him. 'And I think we have a very strong case against Hillary. As far as the Republican Party coming together, it will, maybe not 100%, but it'll come together 99% and the 1% I don't want and it won't have any impact.' Trump made clear that he would echo Bernie Sanders' criticism of Hillary Clinton in the coming race. 'Bernie actually said she's unqualified because she's got bad judgement and it's true,' Trump said. 'She's unqualified because of the fact that her judgement is so bad.'"

Trump On Campaigning Against Hillary Clinton: "If She Wants To Go The Low Road, I'm Fine With That." O'REILLY: "All right. Now, tone, tone, if history is any barometer, the Clinton campaign will go after you through surrogates. Move On, these sleazy left wing websites are going to tear you up. Are you going to respond to that if Hillary Clinton takes the high road and doesn't do any of that?" TRUMP: "Well, I'm going to be able to figure it out. I mean, we have had 17 people just now and I figured that out and I will be able to figure it out with Hillary. It depends on where she is coming from. If she wants to go the low road, I'm fine with that. And if she wants to go the high road, which probably I would prefer, I would be fine with that." O'REILLY: "All right. Wait, wait, wait, but, wait, you're fine with the low road? Most people don't want to go on the low road?" TRUMP: "No, I can handle the low road if I have to do it. I mean, we've had some low roads over the last few months." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 5/4/16]

Trump: "I'm A Counterpuncher More Than Anything Else... Like Certain Boxers, They Are Better Counterpunchers. I Have Been Very Successful." BLITZER: "The same strategy that you used to get rid of the other Republican candidates, you want to use now against Hillary Clinton?" TRUMP: "Well, I would say yes. I mean, and, again, a lot is going to depend how they treat me. If they treat me in a certain level, I am not looking to do more. You have seen I'm a counterpuncher more than anything else. I don't like -- I don't really like hitting people first, because I don't know how. I guess I have always felt that I am better -- like certain boxers, they are better counterpunchers. I have been very successful. I have only been doing it for 10 months, Wolf. Somebody in your world gave me credit the other day. They said, he has really been effective. We have never seen anything like it every before." [Situation Room, CNN, 5/4/16]

Trump Claimed Hillary Clinton Started The Birther Movement Against Obama. TRUMP: "Do you know who started the birther movement? Do you know who started it? Do you know who questioned his birth certificate? One of the first? Hillary Clinton. She's the one that started it. She brought it up years before it was brought up by me. And, you know, so she can talk. Look, here is a person under investigation by the FBI, she's only going to get the nomination because it's a rigged deal and frankly maybe she won't even be able to run. I think she probably will because I think the Democrats will work it so that nothing happens to her even though everything happened to other people that did far less." [Situation Room, CNN, 5/4/16]

TRUMP: "I don't talk about it anymore. I don't want to waste my time talk being it anymore." BLITZER: "She's going to raise this issue against you." TRUMP: "I'm going to raise it against her." [Situation Room, CNN, 5/4/16]

Trump Said He Had Confidence In James Comey In Handling The Clinton Investigation. TRUMP: "Hillary Clinton. She's the one that started it. She brought it up years before it was brought up by me.

BLITZER: "James Comey the FBI director he is a serious guy. You have confidence in him. If he thinks there are allegations that she may have violated, broken the law he will recommend that." TRUMP: "I hope so." BLITZER: "You have confidence in him." TRUMP: "I do have confidence in him. I don't know him." [Situation Room, CNN, 5/4/16]

Trump: Hillary Clinton "Will Be Easier To Beat Because She Has Got So Much Baggage." TRUMP: "I am watching now Hillary fighting Bernie. This will go on for a long time. I was supposed to go out into July and everything collapsed on the other side and I ended up winning. Long prior to what it was thought I would. So I am now watching her fight it out. She's going to win again because the system is rigged and he cannot win. Unless she gets indicted which is a possibility but I think she is being protected by the Democrats. I don't think she'll be indicted even though she should be. She should be because she is so guilty. Other people, as you know, who did far less, have had their lives destroyed. She did as much as you can possibly do on that front, and she will skate away with it. It's a disgrace, okay. But that's the only thing that's going to stop her, if the system is honest and if the Democrats don't protect her. Otherwise she is going to win the -- she is going to win the nomination over the next month or so because he can't win. It is such a crooked system. And again, she is fighting -- he is fighting crooked Hillary. So whether I want to go against him or her, it doesn't matter. I will say this. She, I think, in a certain way, will be easier to beat because she has got so much baggage." [Squawk Box, CNBC, 5/5/16]

Trump Said There Should Be More Than The Three Scheduled General Election Debates. TRUMP: "Well, you know, I had the debates, and I never debated professionally before. And a lot of these guys were debate champions and all of that. That's why they're politicians. All talk, no action. I had the debates. And every single poll -- there are seven polls. They polled the debates. Who won the debates. Like drudge, a fantastic guy, by the way. Drudge and 'Time' magazine and 'Slate.' They have only polls. And every single -- I had 11 debates, and every single debate and every single poll, I won. In other words, every single poll had me winning every single debate. I sort of like debating, I have to be honest. I was on center stage on every debate, meaning I was the number one person. And I mean, for -- this is since like July. And after the debate started. I was on center stage. I don't mind the debates. I think the debates are a good thing. Hillary is not a bad debater. I watched her. She is not a bad debater, but I think the debates will be positive for me. I sort of wish we had more than three. We have three. There are three scheduled. I think we should perhaps have more than three if you want to know the truth, because there is a lot going on." [Squawk Box, CNBC, 5/5/16]


Infrastructure
Trump: "I Am An Infrastructure Person. I Know About Infrastructure Like Nobody That's Ever Run For Office In The History Of The Presidency." TRUMP: "I am an infrastructure person. I know about infrastructure like nobody that's ever run for office in the history of the presidency. If there is a strength with me. Maybe my greatest strength is the economy, jobs and building. I know how to build! I know how to build quickly and on budget and all of that. And you know, I look at the way they give out their contracts for these jobs. It's -- it's just -- I mean, I know people they get a road contract and they end up going out and buying a mansion because they're going to make a fortune on it. It's ridiculous. There is so much waste, fraud and abuse in our system. I will be able to stop it." [Squawk Box, CNBC, 5/5/16]

Trump Said The Military Bought Equipment From Politically-Connected Companies "That They Didn't Even Want." TRUMP: "I am an infrastructure person. I know about infrastructure like nobody that's ever run for office in the history of the presidency. If there is a strength with me. Maybe my greatest strength is the economy, jobs and building. I know how to build! I know how to build quickly and on budget and all of that. And you know, I look at the way they give out their contracts for these jobs.

There is so much waste, fraud and abuse in our system. I will be able to stop it. Nobody else even knows really what I am talking about, but I will be able to stop it. And I think it will be one of my strengths. I think the military will be my strength. Speaking of the military, when they bid out, they bid out and it's so much politics in that. They bid out to companies that are politically connected and they get equipment that they don't even want. They want to get other equipment but that company -- it might make better equipment but the company isn't politically as astute and therefore they get the equipment that they don't even want. The whole thing is -- it's got to be -- it's got to be redone. And it -- it can be -- it could be such a beautiful picture, but we are really behind the eight-ball. But we do have to rebuild our infrastructure. And one of the things we should be doing and thinking about doing is buying back debt, really buying back debt, doing a great job with it, but we have to fund in some way the infrastructure."

HEADLINE: "NBC Relocates 'Nightly News' To Trump Tower, For A Night." [New York Times, 5/4/16<http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/business/media/nbc-relocates-nightly-news-to-trump-tower.html>]

NBC Relocated Its Nightly News Broadcast To Trump Tower, An Unusual Move For An Evening News Program. "On the day that Donald J. Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee for president, NBC came to him. In an unusual move on Wednesday, NBC relocated its flagship 'Nightly News' broadcast six blocks north to Trump Tower, where Lester Holt conducted a live interview with Mr. Trump in his 26th-floor executive office. Mr. Holt anchored the rest of the broadcast from the building's gold-and-marble lobby- a signature Trump tableau - introducing segments about a Canadian wildfire and defective airbags as tourists milled behind him. NBC plans to extend the same offer of broadcasting 'Nightly News' from the home or headquarters of the eventual Democratic nominee, a network spokesman said Wednesday night. News anchors frequently interview presidential candidates in their homes or campaign offices. Earlier Wednesday, Wolf Blitzer taped a conversation with Mr. Trump in the downstairs bar of the Trump Tower atrium, which was broadcast later in the day on CNN. But few in the industry could recount another instance where an evening newscast - considered the symbol of a network news brand - shifted its entire broadcast to a candidate's home turf."

TRUMP: "As far as the campaign, I'm making decisions right now, but will work with the Republican National Committee, raise a lot of money and go out and beat Hillary. We'll try to raise over $1 billion, which is what is going to be necessary. I hear the Democrats want to raise up to $2 billion. But we want to raise up to $1 billion, maybe even over that. I'm not even sure that is necessary because I have a big voice. I go on shows like yours. I explain the truth. And people seem to along with it." [NBC Nightly News, NBC, 5/4/16]

Trump Said He Was Open To Raising The Federal Minimum Wage: "I'm Looking At That Because I'm Very Different From Most Republicans. You Have To Have Something That You Can Live On." BLITZER: "American workers, you say they deserve to earn more money, right?" TRUMP: "I want them to earn more money." BLITZER: "Bernie Sanders says he wants $15 an hour minimum wage. And he has really gone after you lately for saying you're happy with $7.25 the current federal minimum wage." TRUMP: "I'm looking at that because I'm very different from most Republicans. You have to have something that you can live on, but what I'm really looking to do is get people great jobs so they make much more money than that, so they make more money than the $15. If you start playing around too much with the lower level, the lower level number, you're not going to be competitive." BLITZER: "Hillary Clinton says she's ready to go to $12, Bernie Sanders says $15." TRUMP: "She's doing that because she's -- she's--" TRUMP: "If you were president what would you recommend?"

Trump Was Unaware That Puerto Rico Could Not Legally File For Bankruptcy. "Trump is so busy here being defensive about his business record that he's not understanding what the question is. He seems to think that Puerto Rico legally can file for bankruptcy and the problem is they haven't done so, and that what they need is a smarter leader/negotiator at the helm who can clean up the balance sheet the way he would have in one of his real estate deals. But the whole political issue is that a) Puerto Rico can't do this, legally speaking, and b) the political party that Trump leads is blocking the Obama administration from changing the law. But Trump has no idea what's going on and doesn't seem to be listening to Blitzer's questions." [Vox, 5/5/16<http://www.vox.com/2016/5/5/11595610/puerto-rico-debt-crisis-trump>]

TRUMP: "As a very successful person I would buy companies, throw them in a chapter, bankrupt it, negotiate - I would do great deals, I didn't use them for myself, I used them as a businessperson. Many of the top people in my category use the laws. I know more about debt than practically anybody, I love debt. I also love reducing debt, and I know how to do it better than anybody. I will tell you with Puerto Rico they have too much debt. You can't just restructure; you have to use the laws, cut the debt way down, and get back to business, because they can't survive with the kind of debt they have.

You can't - you know, the expression you can't take it out of the grave if they don't have it. Whether they officially declare or not, but ultimately what they have to do is cut the debt way down. They're never going to pay that debt off, they have to cut it way down, and the United States is going to be in that position very soon because they have too much debt."

 class, who have just been absolutely forgotten in our country. You know, when you put out a tax plan, you are going to start negotiating. You don't say, okay, this is our tax plan, lots of luck, folks. There will be negotiation back and forth. And I can see
 that going up, to be honest with you. I know I am talking to your folks but in all fairness we are cutting. During a negotiation I could see that going up. I don't want middle to go up at all. But I could see that going up. And I think that probably will happen,
 because it's a cut for everybody. And, you know, the wealthy have done well. I am not complaining. I will tell you, this has been an unbelievable period of time for me. It's been an unbelievable period of time for other people that I know that are very wealthy.
 It's, you know, but the middle class -- people haven't had a wage increase. One of the reasons I have 25,000 people showing up to hear me speak at one night -- and we turn away 15,000 people -- is because these workers, these incredible workers, these middle
 class -- many of them haven't had an effective wage increase in 20 years. And some of them are making less money, many of them are making less money now than they made 20 years ago and they're being taxed at a much higher rate and they're working much harder.
 It's supposed to be the opposite. You're getting older, you're supposed to be working a little bit less maybe. But these are people who work harder, they have two jobs in some cases and they're making less money than they made 20 years ago. That's why you're

 an unbelievable period of time for other people that I know that are very wealthy. It's, you know, but the middle class -- people haven't had a wage increase. One of the reasons I have 25,000 people showing up to hear me speak at one night -- and we turn away
 15,000 people -- is because these workers, these incredible workers, these middle class -- many of them haven't had an effective wage increase in 20 years. And some of them are making less money, many of them are making less money now than they made 20 years
 ago and they're being taxed at a much higher rate and they're working much harder. It's supposed to be the opposite. You're getting older, you're supposed to be working a little bit less maybe. But these are people who work harder, they have two jobs in some
 cases and they're making less money than they made 20 years ago. That's why you're wondering what's going on and why they're not liking Republicans or Democrats. I mean, they're not liking either, to be honest with you. They don't like anybody. They don't
 like conservatives. They don't like liberals. They're people who work very hard. You got a glimpse -- it was a famous clip where Ted Cruz went to a group of people who were trump supporters, and they were -- these were smart people, and I guess you saw the

</b>&#8220;On the day that Donald J. Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee for president, NBC came to him. In an unusual move on Wednesday, NBC relocated its flagship &#8216;Nightly News&#8217; broadcast six blocks north to Trump Tower, where Lester Holt conducted
 a live interview with Mr. Trump in his 26th-floor executive office. Mr. Holt anchored the rest of the broadcast from the building&#8217;s gold-and-marble lobby&#8212; a signature Trump tableau &#8212; introducing segments about a Canadian wildfire and defective airbags as tourists
 milled behind him. NBC plans to extend the same offer of broadcasting &#8216;Nightly News&#8217; from the home or headquarters of the eventual Democratic nominee, a network spokesman said Wednesday night. News anchors frequently interview presidential candidates in their
 homes or campaign offices. Earlier Wednesday, Wolf Blitzer taped a conversation with Mr. Trump in the downstairs bar of the Trump Tower atrium, which was broadcast later in the day on CNN. But few in the industry could recount another instance where an evening
 newscast &#8212; considered the symbol of a network news brand &#8212; shifted its entire broadcast to a candidate&#8217;s home turf.&#8221; [New York Times,

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Trump Was Unaware That Puerto Rico Could Not Legally File For Bankruptcy.</b> &#8220;Trump is so busy here being defensive about his business record that he's not understanding what the question is. He seems to think that Puerto Rico legally
 can file for bankruptcy and the problem is they haven't done so, and that what they need is a smarter leader/negotiator at the helm who can clean up the balance sheet the way he would have in one of his real estate deals. But the whole political issue is that
 a) Puerto Rico can't do this, legally speaking, and b) the political party that Trump leads is blocking the Obama administration from changing the law. But Trump has no idea what's going on and doesn't seem to be listening to Blitzer's questions.&#8221; [Vox,

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Trump Said He Would Not Bail Out Puerto Rico.</b>&nbsp; WOLF BLITZER: &#8220;They're prevented from using the bankruptcy laws, Puerto Rico, as opposed to all the US states. You've used those bankruptcy laws over the years.&#8221; TRUMP: &#8220;I'm the king
 &#8212; I understand. By the way--&#8221; BLITZER: &#8220;Should Puerto Rico have an opportunity to use the bankruptcy laws?&#8221; TRUMP: &#8220;As a very successful person I would buy companies, throw them in a chapter, bankrupt it, negotiate &#8212; I would do great deals, I didn't use them
 for myself, I used them as a businessperson. Many of the top people in my category use the laws. I know more about debt than practically anybody, I love debt. I also love reducing debt, and I know how to do it better than anybody. I will tell you with Puerto
 Rico they have too much debt. You can't just restructure; you have to use the laws, cut the debt way down, and get back to business, because they can't survive with the kind of debt they have. I would not bail out if I were &#8212; if I were in that position I wouldn't
 bail them out.&#8221; WOLF BLITZER: &#8220;Would you let them have a bankruptcy option?&#8221; TRUMP: &#8220;They're going to have no choice. if they're not going to pay the bill they're not going to pay the interest on the bonds--&#8221;&nbsp; BLITZER: &#8220;They can't.&#8221; TRUMP: &#8220;They can't. You
 can't &#8212; you know, the expression you can't take it out of the grave if they don't have it. Whether they officially declare or not, but ultimately what they have to do is cut the debt way down. They're never going to pay that debt off, they have to cut it way
 down, and the United States is going to be in that position very soon because they have too much debt.&#8221; [Situation Room, CNN, 5/4/16]
