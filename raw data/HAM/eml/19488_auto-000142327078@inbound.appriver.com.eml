Debbie W. Shultz is the problem and Trump will take advantage. Hillary will=

Win in the end. Our Country is more important to me that the Clintons! They=

Frankly I am sick of Party Politics!  I look for good moral character in th=

Every day the Democratic Party fights for people of all stripes, because we=
 know that America is at its best when each of us has the opportunity to fu=
lfill our God-given potential. That's why we fought to expand healthcare to=
 millions of Americans, ensure equal pay for women, and protect the middle =
class.=20
The values we share as Democrats could not stand in starker contrast to tho=
se of Republicans and their presumptive nominee for president, Donald Trump=
.=20
Their dangerous vision for America threatens all of the progress we have ma=
de under President Obama, which is why we must stand up and fight for his l=
egacy and our future. We have the opportunity to take a stand when DNC Chai=
r Debbie Wasserman Schultz rallies Democrats in Knoxville on Thursday, June=
 2nd. To RSVP for this important event, please click the link below:=20
