Trump Rally in Wilkes Barre PA at 7pm

PA losing jobs
- We support natural gas

Rigged System
- Like the boxers say, to be sure you win, you have to knock them on their ass

Cruz and Kasich ought to drop out

Haven't even started on Crooked Hillary
- She wants open borders
- More people are pouring across than ever before

Connections to PA
- I went to school in PA. I'm a product of PA

PA economic stats
- Says Kasich was "the big vote on NAFTA"
- "Here's something I don't like. The foreign born population in Pennsylvania has flooded in"

Citing his statement on Cruz/Kasich collusion

Complaining about Florida and Ohio poll

Hitting Kasich
- Stubborn like a child who is a spoiled brat
- Rubio still has more delegates than Kasich
- Eating. Stuffing pancakes. Son says it's disgusting

I will win on the first ballot

I have one of the great endorsements coming up in Indiana.
- I Refuse to say it's Bobby Knight. But it's Bobby Knight.

Tied with Hillary in a poll and I haven't even hit her yet.

Says he will be at a dinner tomorrow night for TIME's 100 most influential

Others should drop out so we can beat Hillary big league
- Mixes up Kasich and Sanders
- We're all qualified. But she has bad judgement.

Hitting Cruz and Kasich
- Cruz is a horrible Senator. Done nothing.

I have the slowest trigger on FP
- But no one will mess with me
- I opposed Iraq when I was a civilian

We have to get back to our country
- Building schools in Middle East but infrastructure here is terrible

Iraq and Iran were equal powers
- Saddam would hit people with gas and people would complain

We protect many nations for practically nothing and they are wealthy nations
- Order many TVs from South Korea
- Many friends in Saudi Arabia. They buy my apartments

Obama goes to Saudi Arabia and no one greets him
- Just like Cuba
- If King didn't greet me, I'd turn the plane around

Obama making pitch on the olympics
- that's fine. But he didn't get it.
- As the president, you have to know ahead of time that you will win or you don't go
- Incompetent.

We have to change NATO.
- NATO has never been high on my list.
- They don't pay because they think we are stupid
- They have to pay us for back years.

Pundit said: He beat senators and governors. Why would I pivot to be presidential?
- We will unify
- African American unemployment
- Obama is a divider. Done nothing for African Americans.

Taxing Carrier for bringing units in from Mexico
- Need smart leaders to have free trade

Tax plan cuts more than anybody else's.
- Politicians can't make deal on Corporate inversion.
- Don't need loans or incentives, just a good old fashioned tax... They won't leave

Winning again. You'll be proud of your president
