SL: Trump Tax Plan 3: Offer Wealthiest Americans Huge Tax Breaks To Negotia=
te Tax Increase With Same Wealthiest Americans

This morning on This Week with George Stephanopoulus, the anchor broached t=
he subject of Dangerous Donald half-baked tax =93plan=94 whereby the buffoo=
nish magnate promised massive tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans at the c=
ost of the middle class and working people.

In some sense, Dangerous Donald's tax =93plan=94 is par for the course. The=
 Republican Party he now leads has clung to the failed policy obsession on =
of burdening future generations with gratuitous and unfunded tax breaks for=
 Americans in the very top income brackets. In broad stokes this has been t=
he tax plan of every Republican presidential candidate since President Clin=
ton, a Democrat and one of the greatest job creators this country has ever =
seen. Clinton left the American people a booming economy when he left after=
 his presidency=92s second term.

George W. Bush left us pretty much the exact opposite. True to form, the Re=
publican administration that immediately succeeded Clinton in the White Hou=
se barely had time to unpack before unveiling their iteration of the same f=
ailed tax policy obsession that Dangerous Donald now proposes inflicting on=
 today=92s middle class and working families, another GOP-led burden on the=
 American Dreams of future generations.

On paper, Trump=92s plan looks good for a GOP candidate in that it is undis=
tracted by things like math or=85math. Trump=92s tax plan would reduce gove=
rnment revenues by $9.5 trillion<http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2016/05/0=
5/3775761/trump-tax-plan-reversal/> with nothing articulated to offset cost=
s. Enter George Stephanopoulus, who=92s interview with Trump this morning t=
ook an unexpected turn<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DcIV-TzPb3EQ&featur=
e=3Dyoutu.be> when the great John Dickerson of CBS News asked Trump, "Do yo=
u want taxes on the wealthy to go up or down?=94

Trump: They will go up a little bit and they go up=85you know.

Stephanopoulus: But in your plan they=92ll go down...

Dangerous Donald: On my plan they=92ll go down but by the time it=92s negot=
iated they=92ll go up.

And it was all down hill from there, as you can see in these two clips from=
 the same interview:

t)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D2Jbhg8R0JBk&feature=3Dyoutu.be (screensho=
t)


=93We have to be careful when we talk about what Donald Trump says about ta=
xes as being a =91plan=92. It=92s not a plan. From a policy perspective it =
reads like something three drunk bros wrote on a napkin for an undergrad to=
 turn into a Word Doc. Like his entire candidacy, his brand, his properties=
, his hairpiece, even the man himself=85everything Trump does, says, sells,=
 is, from now until election night a national joke. The same can and should=
 be said of any official, consultant, operative, or, god-forbid, candidate =
running under the GOP party banner during this cycle. Republicans have only=
 themselves to blame for their shattered party establishment. Frankly, the =
rest of us have only Republicans to blame, too, for the brave new worlds th=
is election cycle is taking our people.=94 - Luis/Mark
