*Hillary Clinton Pledges to Fight for Gun Reforms to Protect Communities*

At the 3rd annual Circle of Mothers event hosted by Sybrina Fulton and
the Trayvon Martin Foundation, Hillary Clinton addressed about 50
mothers who have lost their children to gun violence and other
tragedies. Clinton vowed to continue to fight for gun reforms and ways
to reduce violence and prevent incidents that are costing lives in
communities all across the country. She also called out Donald Trump
for his dangerous ideas that would only hurt families and make our
children less safe. The Circle of Mothers gathering is meant to
empower women and ignite change.

*Below are Clinton's full remarks:*

=E2=80=8B"=E2=80=8B
Good evening.  What a great honor it is for me to be here with all of you,
and to have a chance to see some of the mothers that I=E2=80=99ve gotten to=
 know
over the last months and to meet others of you who are here for this
weekend.  I think it=E2=80=99s fair to say that the program has already bee=
n
amazing.  Just here during dinner =E2=80=93 and I know you had other sessio=
ns this
weekend =E2=80=93 but here during dinner, I have to say that Rebecca Vaughn=
s was
just astonishing. And Jill Tracey kept us all in line.   I don=E2=80=99t kn=
ow if
you could notice where you were sitting, but she has on the coolest-looking
red tennis shoes =E2=80=93 underneath that elegant, long, flowing black dre=
ss.  And
=E2=80=8BQueene
 Thompson Brown spoke to our hearts. Just unleash that, because you have a
powerful message.

I want to thank
=E2=80=8BLa Vie
.  I want to thank Minister Wanda Johnson and Pastor Gregory Williams and
Kat Tynes.  Kat Tynes has on the highest high heels I think I=E2=80=99ve ev=
er seen.
I was just knocked over when Kat came up here.  They sparkle, but they=E2=
=80=99re
like a foot high. I had to give up wearing high heels 10 years ago.  I am
so jealous.

But the sisterhood that is here is so overwhelming in its love, and I am
grateful to see all of you and it in action.  I want to thank Sybrina and
her entire family, who stand behind her, for bringing us together.
Trayvon=E2=80=99s parents, Sybrina and Mr. Tracy Martin, and his brother, J=
ahvaris,
and his grandmother =E2=80=93 because as Sybrina said, she=E2=80=99s from a=
 line of strong
women, and I=E2=80=99ve met Marion Evans, for the first time in South Carol=
ina, and
am happy to see her again tonight =E2=80=93 have demonstrated what it reall=
y means
to have a family in the worst of times.

I appreciate the elected officials who are here, including my longtime
friend, Congressman Alcee Hastings, who I=E2=80=99ve known a long, long tim=
e. And
Barbara Jordan and Dennis Moss and Oliver Gilbert and Dorothy Bendross
Mindingall.

But most of all, I thank all the mothers and fathers, but mostly the circle
of mothers, who are turning your grief into action, and so importantly,
reaching out to support other parents who face the unimaginable.

I=E2=80=99ve had the great privilege of getting to know Sybrina over the la=
st
months.  Even before I met her, I knew something important about her.  Like
a lot of people, I watched =E2=80=93 I watched in disbelief and horror =E2=
=80=93 when her
son was killed.  But then I saw her talking about her love for Trayvon,
urging people who were devastated by his death to make America a more
peaceful place.  She was joined by Trayvon=E2=80=99s father.  I can remembe=
r seeing
that on television.  One reporter described them as
=E2=80=8B'
models of grace and fortitude.
=E2=80=8B'=E2=80=8B


When I met Sybrina for myself, that=E2=80=99s exactly what I saw.  It takes=
 a
special kind of person to endure a loss like all of you, and then find a
way to turn it into service.

That=E2=80=99s what Sybrina has done.  That=E2=80=99s what many of you have=
 done.

Sybrina said,
=E2=80=8B'=E2=80=8B
=E2=80=8B
This is not something I ever wanted to do,
=E2=80=8B'=E2=80=8B
 She said,
=E2=80=8B'=E2=80=8B
I can=E2=80=99t help Trayvon, but there are a lot of other Trayvon Martins =
I can
help.
=E2=80=8B'=E2=80=8B
 That=E2=80=99s true for all of us.  There are a lot of other young men and=
 young
women we all can help.

You see, I believe we have a moral obligation to protect our children no
matter what ZIP code they live in =E2=80=93 to reduce violence, especially =
gun
violence.  To stand up against systemic racism and to promote justice and
equality.  I believe we owe that to our children, and we owe it to the
parents who love their children more than anything, especially those whose
love persists after they were so tragically taken from them.

Sybrina and I were talking at the table about the weekend that has been
provided for the mothers who are here, and I had the great honor of meeting
each of the mothers, the =E2=80=9C
=E2=80=8BC=E2=80=8B
ircle of
=E2=80=8BM=E2=80=8B
others,=E2=80=9D before we came in.  Some lost their children to gun violen=
ce.
Others died after encounters with police, or because of domestic violence.
Each mother handed me a letter.  Actually, they put it in a basket =E2=80=
=93 put it
in a basket that Sybrina=E2=80=99s mother, I think, made possible.  They ha=
nded me
that letter, and I=E2=80=99m going to read every single word of these lette=
rs,
because

each of the mothers is telling us something that we all need to hear, not
just about their tragedies, but about our country.

Something is wrong when so many young people just starting their lives are
dying.  Something is wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe
that our country doesn=E2=80=99t consider their children as precious and wo=
rthy of
protection as other children because of the color of their skins.
Something is wrong when so many parents live in fear that their child will
be hurt or killed, just for being a young black man in a hooded sweatshirt,
like Trayvon; or listening to music in a car, like Jordan Davis, whose
mother Lucy is here; or for standing in a park with her friends, like
Hadiya Pendleton, whose mother Cleo is here; or simply going to first
grade, like Ben Wheeler=E2=80=99s mother knows, a student at Sandy Hook Ele=
mentary
School =E2=80=93 Ben=E2=80=99s mother Francine is here too.

Something is very wrong, my friends.  And this election gives us a chance
to keep trying to make it right.

I come here tonight as a mother and a grandmother.  I love my daughter and
my granddaughter more than anything, and I worry about them like every
mother does.  I want them always to be safe.  But I also come here as
someone who=E2=80=99s been fighting for children my entire life.  And I=E2=
=80=99m going to
keep talking about these issues every chance I get, because there=E2=80=99s=
 nothing
more important than protecting our children.  If we
=E2=80=8B =E2=80=8B
fail at that, it really doesn=E2=80=99t matter what else we get right.

So we have got to face up to all of the barriers that are denying children
the opportunities they deserve, that enable people to see some children as
less than what they truly are =E2=80=93 talented, beautiful, and beloved.  =
We=E2=80=99ve
got to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline that wrongly diverts too
many kids into the criminal justice system. We=E2=80=99ve even seen an upti=
ck =E2=80=93 a
significant uptick =E2=80=93 in police involvement in school discipline, es=
pecially
in communities of color.  We=E2=80=99re seeing an overreliance on suspensio=
ns and
expulsions.  Some of you may remember that video of the girl in South
Carolina being thrown out of her desk and dragged across her classroom
floor by a school officer.  Classrooms should be safe places for all
children.  That should go without saying.

And yes, we need to continue to fight for criminal justice reform.  Our
legal system is often stacked against those who have the least power and
are the most vulnerable.  Let=E2=80=99s get back to that fundamental princi=
ple:
everyone benefits when there is respect for the law and when everyone is
respected by the law.  And this is actually an area where a lot of
Democrats and Republicans agree =E2=80=93 we need to end the era of mass
incarceration; rebuild the bonds of trust between law enforcement and
communities; and do something about the horror, the tragedy of too many
young African Americans being killed by police or dying in custody.  The
mothers of Dontre Hamilton and Eric Garner are here tonight.  They, along
with Sandy Bland=E2=80=99s mother and so many others across the country, ar=
e doing
their part to make sure no one else=E2=80=99s children die like theirs did.=
  They
deserve our complete and total support.

And we need to protect the health of our children, and that includes their
mental health.  Nearly 17 million children in America experience mental
health problems. Some of those kids don=E2=80=99t get treatment.  They grow=
 up to
adults, and then they cause harm to others.  We need to make sure the next
generation grows up in a country where there=E2=80=99s no shame or stigma, =
no
barriers to anyone seeking and needing mental health care.

And at long last, we must do something about the gun violence that stalks
communities and terrorizes families. This is on the minds of every one of
us here tonight as we remember all of the young people who have been lost.
This problem isn=E2=80=99t going away.  Even toddlers are getting their han=
ds on
guns and shooting themselves or someone else.  There have been, by last
count, 23 cases of toddlers getting guns so far this year.  I don=E2=80=99t=
 know
what more evidence anybody needs in our country to know that somebody has
gone terribly wrong.

We are smart enough and strong enough as a nation to figure out how to
protect the rights of responsible gun owners while keeping guns out of the
hands of domestic abusers, other violent criminals, gang members, the
severely mentally ill.  I know we can do this.  And despite all the
political noise, we are actually united on this issue.  The vast majority
of Americans support comprehensive background checks.  In fact, the
conservative pollster Frank Luntz found that 82 percent of gun owners and
74 percent of NRA members support background checks for anyone buying a
gun.  Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly support them.  So do leaders
in law enforcement.  So this isn=E2=80=99t a matter of building popular sup=
port.
We already have it.  This is a matter of making elected officials do their
jobs to keep our children safe.

Now, we know the gun lobby is powerful.  I believe it=E2=80=99s the most po=
werful
lobby in Washington.  And we know that some candidates will say or do
anything to keep them happy.  Just yesterday at the NRA=E2=80=99s annual
convention, Donald Trump said that in his very first hour as president,
heaven forbid, he would overturn President Obama=E2=80=99s actions to stren=
gthen
background checks.  Remember, President Obama took those steps after the
massacres at Mother Emanuel in Charleston and Sandy Hook Elementary in
Newtown, Connecticut.

Then Mr. Trump went further.  He said that also on his first day in office,
he=E2=80=99d mandate that every school in America allow guns in classrooms.=
  Every
school, he said.  That idea isn=E2=80=99t just way out there, it=E2=80=99s =
dangerous.
 33,000 people die from guns every year, nearly 3,000 children and
teenagers among them.  Parents, teachers, and schools should have the right
to keep guns out of classrooms, just like Donald Trump does at many of his
hotels, by the way.

This is someone running to be president of the United States of America, a
country facing a gun violence epidemic, and he=E2=80=99s talking about more=
 guns in
our schools.  He=E2=80=99s talking about more hatred and division in our st=
reets,
even about more nuclear weapons in the world.  That=E2=80=99s no way to kee=
p us
safe.

If you want to imagine what Trump=E2=80=99s America will look like, picture=
 more
kids at risk of violence and bigotry.  Picture more anger and fear.  Ask
any of the mothers here tonight if they want to live in that kind of
America. Enough is enough. Unlike Donald Trump, I will not pander to the
gun lobby.  And we will not be silenced.  And we will not be intimidated.
As long as children anywhere are being killed by gun violence, we will keep
fighting for our kids because they deserve a president who stands up for
them and stands with the mothers here.  Their lives are valuable.

Now, there=E2=80=99s a lot more I could say tonight about what we need to d=
o to
better serve our kids, from education to health care to jobs.  But here=E2=
=80=99s
the bottom line.  Anyone asking for your vote owes it to you to fully
grapple with the real challenges facing our families and communities.  We
owe it to you to listen and come up with solutions =E2=80=93 not scapegoats=
,
solutions =E2=80=93 that would make a difference in your children=E2=80=99s=
 lives.  And to
the mothers and fathers who have lost children, we owe you our love, our
support, our gratitude, and our promise that we will carry the memories of
your sons and daughters in our hearts every day, just like you do.

One of the best experiences of this campaign for me has been getting to
know Mothers of the Movement, Sybrina and so many of the other women here
tonight.  They are turning their sorrow into a strategy and their mourning
into a movement.  I=E2=80=99ve had the opportunity to sit and listen as the=
y talk
about their kids and their families. And I=E2=80=99ve seen how you gain str=
ength
from each other.

That=E2=80=99s why tomorrow I hope you will take what you have gotten here =
this
weekend back to your communities, to your families, to your loved ones,
because it really does take a village.  It takes a village to raise a
child, to protect a child, to mourn a child, and to honor a child.  So
we=E2=80=99ve got to stand together and lift each other up and draw strengt=
h from
each other.  Running for president=E2=80=99s hard, I got to tell you.  But =
it=E2=80=99s
nothing like what I have seen the mothers do and what I have learned from
every one whom I have met.  Your courage and your commitment and your
leadership is inspirational to me.

I want to close with a passage from Scripture that means a great deal to
me, and I know has meant a great deal to Sybrina.
=E2=80=8B'=E2=80=8B
Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own
understanding.  In all your ways submit to Him, and He will make your paths
straight.
=E2=80=8B'=E2=80=8B


We may never, never be able to understand the senseless violence that has
affected the lives in this room and so many others who you are standing for
across our country.  But there is a path ahead of us.  There is work for us
to do.  And it is up to us to do that work, and to walk that path, with
trust that progress is possible; with love for all our children, no matter
their race or background; and with the memory of those we=E2=80=99ve lost l=
ighting
our way toward the future every child in this country deserves.  I am here
tonight to say thank you to this circle of mothers, and to say God bless
you all and God bless your families. Thank you so very much.

 of Mothers event hosted by Sybrina Fulton and<br>the Trayvon Martin Founda=
tion, Hillary Clinton addressed about 50<br>mothers who have lost their chi=

fight for gun reforms and ways<br>to reduce violence and prevent incidents =
that are costing lives in<br>communities all across the country. She also c=
alled out Donald Trump<br>for his dangerous ideas that would only hurt fami=

v>Good evening.&nbsp; What a great honor it is for me to be here with all o=
f you, and to have a chance to see some of the mothers that I=E2=80=99ve go=
tten to know over the last months and to meet others of you who are here fo=
r this weekend.&nbsp; I think it=E2=80=99s fair to say that the program has=
 already been amazing.&nbsp; Just here during dinner =E2=80=93 and I know y=
ou had other sessions this weekend =E2=80=93 but here during dinner, I have=
 to say that Rebecca Vaughns was just astonishing. And Jill Tracey kept us =
all in line. &nbsp; I don=E2=80=99t know if you could notice where you were=
 sitting, but she has on the coolest-looking red tennis shoes =E2=80=93 und=
erneath that elegant, long, flowing black dress.&nbsp; And <div class=3D"gm=

leash that, because you have a powerful message.<br><br>I want to thank <di=
v class=3D"gmail_default" style=3D"font-family:georgia,serif;font-size:smal=
l;display:inline">=E2=80=8BLa Vie</div>.&nbsp; I want to thank Minister Wan=
da Johnson and Pastor Gregory Williams and Kat Tynes.&nbsp; Kat Tynes has o=
n the highest high heels I think I=E2=80=99ve ever seen. I was just knocked=
 over when Kat came up here.&nbsp; They sparkle, but they=E2=80=99re like a=
 foot high. I had to give up wearing high heels 10 years ago.&nbsp; I am so=
 jealous. &nbsp;<br><br>But the sisterhood that is here is so overwhelming =
in its love, and I am grateful to see all of you and it in action.&nbsp; I =
want to thank Sybrina and her entire family, who stand behind her, for brin=
ging us together.&nbsp; Trayvon=E2=80=99s parents, Sybrina and Mr. Tracy Ma=
rtin, and his brother, Jahvaris, and his grandmother =E2=80=93 because as S=
ybrina said, she=E2=80=99s from a line of strong women, and I=E2=80=99ve me=
t Marion Evans, for the first time in South Carolina, and am happy to see h=
er again tonight =E2=80=93 have demonstrated what it really means to have a=
 family in the worst of times.<br><br>I appreciate the elected officials wh=
o are here, including my longtime friend, Congressman Alcee Hastings, who I=
=E2=80=99ve known a long, long time. And Barbara Jordan and Dennis Moss and=
 Oliver Gilbert and Dorothy Bendross Mindingall.<br><br>But most of all, I =
thank all the mothers and fathers, but mostly the circle of mothers, who ar=
e turning your grief into action, and so importantly, reaching out to suppo=
rt other parents who face the unimaginable.<br><br>I=E2=80=99ve had the gre=
at privilege of getting to know Sybrina over the last months.&nbsp; Even be=
fore I met her, I knew something important about her.&nbsp; Like a lot of p=
eople, I watched =E2=80=93 I watched in disbelief and horror =E2=80=93 when=
 her son was killed.&nbsp; But then I saw her talking about her love for Tr=
ayvon, urging people who were devastated by his death to make America a mor=
e peaceful place.&nbsp; She was joined by Trayvon=E2=80=99s father.&nbsp; I=
 can remember seeing that on television.&nbsp; One reporter described them =
as <div class=3D"gmail_default" style=3D"font-family:georgia,serif;font-siz=

rson to endure a loss like all of you, and then find a way to turn it into =
service. &nbsp;<br><br>That=E2=80=99s what Sybrina has done.&nbsp; That=E2=

taken from them.<br><br>Sybrina and I were talking at the table about the w=

=8B</div>others,=E2=80=9D before we came in.&nbsp; Some lost their children=
 to gun violence.&nbsp; Others died after encounters with police, or becaus=
e of domestic violence.&nbsp; Each mother handed me a letter.&nbsp; Actuall=
y, they put it in a basket =E2=80=93 put it in a basket that Sybrina=E2=80=
=99s mother, I think, made possible.&nbsp; They handed me that letter, and =
I=E2=80=99m going to read every single word of these letters, because<br><b=
r>each of the mothers is telling us something that we all need to hear, not=
 just about their tragedies, but about our country.<br><br>Something is wro=
ng when so many young people just starting their lives are dying.&nbsp; Som=
ething is wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our coun=
try doesn=E2=80=99t consider their children as precious and worthy of prote=
ction as other children because of the color of their skins.&nbsp; Somethin=
g is wrong when so many parents live in fear that their child will be hurt =
or killed, just for being a young black man in a hooded sweatshirt, like Tr=
ayvon; or listening to music in a car, like Jordan Davis, whose mother Lucy=
 is here; or for standing in a park with her friends, like Hadiya Pendleton=
, whose mother Cleo is here; or simply going to first grade, like Ben Wheel=
er=E2=80=99s mother knows, a student at Sandy Hook Elementary School =E2=80=
=93 Ben=E2=80=99s mother Francine is here too.<br><br>Something is very wro=
ng, my friends.&nbsp; And this election gives us a chance to keep trying to=
 make it right. <br><br>I come here tonight as a mother and a grandmother.&=
nbsp; I love my daughter and my granddaughter more than anything, and I wor=
ry about them like every mother does.&nbsp; I want them always to be safe.&=
nbsp; But I also come here as someone who=E2=80=99s been fighting for child=
ren my entire life.&nbsp; And I=E2=80=99m going to keep talking about these=
 issues every chance I get, because there=E2=80=99s nothing more important =
than protecting our children.&nbsp; If we<div class=3D"gmail_default" style=
=3D"font-family:georgia,serif;font-size:small;display:inline">=E2=80=8B =E2=
=80=8B</div>fail at that, it really doesn=E2=80=99t matter what else we get=
 right.<br><br>So we have got to face up to all of the barriers that are de=
nying children the opportunities they deserve, that enable people to see so=
me children as less than what they truly are =E2=80=93 talented, beautiful,=
 and beloved.&nbsp; We=E2=80=99ve got to dismantle the school-to-prison pip=
eline that wrongly diverts too many kids into the criminal justice system. =
We=E2=80=99ve even seen an uptick =E2=80=93 a significant uptick =E2=80=93 =
in police involvement in school discipline, especially in communities of co=
lor.&nbsp; We=E2=80=99re seeing an overreliance on suspensions and expulsio=
ns.&nbsp; Some of you may remember that video of the girl in South Carolina=
 being thrown out of her desk and dragged across her classroom floor by a s=
chool officer.&nbsp; Classrooms should be safe places for all children.&nbs=
p; That should go without saying. <br><br>And yes, we need to continue to f=
ight for criminal justice reform.&nbsp; Our legal system is often stacked a=
gainst those who have the least power and are the most vulnerable.&nbsp; Le=
t=E2=80=99s get back to that fundamental principle: everyone benefits when =
there is respect for the law and when everyone is respected by the law.&nbs=
p; And this is actually an area where a lot of Democrats and Republicans ag=
ree =E2=80=93 we need to end the era of mass incarceration; rebuild the bon=
ds of trust between law enforcement and communities; and do something about=
 the horror, the tragedy of too many young African Americans being killed b=
y police or dying in custody.&nbsp; The mothers of Dontre Hamilton and Eric=
 Garner are here tonight.&nbsp; They, along with Sandy Bland=E2=80=99s moth=
er and so many others across the country, are doing their part to make sure=
 no one else=E2=80=99s children die like theirs did.&nbsp; They deserve our=
 complete and total support. <br><br>And we need to protect the health of o=
ur children, and that includes their mental health.&nbsp; Nearly 17 million=
 children in America experience mental health problems. Some of those kids =
don=E2=80=99t get treatment.&nbsp; They grow up to adults, and then they ca=
use harm to others.&nbsp; We need to make sure the next generation grows up=
 in a country where there=E2=80=99s no shame or stigma, no barriers to anyo=
ne seeking and needing mental health care.<br><br>And at long last, we must=
 do something about the gun violence that stalks communities and terrorizes=
 families. This is on the minds of every one of us here tonight as we remem=
ber all of the young people who have been lost.&nbsp; This problem isn=E2=
=80=99t going away.&nbsp; Even toddlers are getting their hands on guns and=
 shooting themselves or someone else.&nbsp; There have been, by last count,=
 23 cases of toddlers getting guns so far this year.&nbsp; I don=E2=80=99t =
know what more evidence anybody needs in our country to know that somebody =
has gone terribly wrong.<br><br>We are smart enough and strong enough as a =
nation to figure out how to protect the rights of responsible gun owners wh=
ile keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, other violent crimin=
als, gang members, the severely mentally ill.&nbsp; I know we can do this.&=
nbsp; And despite all the political noise, we are actually united on this i=
ssue.&nbsp; The vast majority of Americans support comprehensive background=
 checks.&nbsp; In fact, the conservative pollster Frank Luntz found that 82=
 percent of gun owners and 74 percent of NRA members support background che=
cks for anyone buying a gun.&nbsp; Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly=
 support them.&nbsp; So do leaders in law enforcement.&nbsp; So this isn=E2=
=80=99t a matter of building popular support.&nbsp; We already have it.&nbs=
p; This is a matter of making elected officials do their jobs to keep our c=
hildren safe. <br><br>Now, we know the gun lobby is powerful.&nbsp; I belie=
ve it=E2=80=99s the most powerful lobby in Washington.&nbsp; And we know th=
at some candidates will say or do anything to keep them happy.&nbsp; Just y=
esterday at the NRA=E2=80=99s annual convention, Donald Trump said that in =
his very first hour as president, heaven forbid, he would overturn Presiden=
t Obama=E2=80=99s actions to strengthen background checks.&nbsp; Remember, =
President Obama took those steps after the massacres at Mother Emanuel in C=
harleston and Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut.<br><br>Then Mr=
. Trump went further.&nbsp; He said that also on his first day in office, h=
e=E2=80=99d mandate that every school in America allow guns in classrooms.&=
nbsp; Every school, he said.&nbsp; That idea isn=E2=80=99t just way out the=
re, it=E2=80=99s dangerous. &nbsp;33,000 people die from guns every year, n=
early 3,000 children and teenagers among them.&nbsp; Parents, teachers, and=
 schools should have the right to keep guns out of classrooms, just like Do=
nald Trump does at many of his hotels, by the way.<br><br>This is someone r=
unning to be president of the United States of America, a country facing a =
gun violence epidemic, and he=E2=80=99s talking about more guns in our scho=
ols.&nbsp; He=E2=80=99s talking about more hatred and division in our stree=
ts, even about more nuclear weapons in the world.&nbsp; That=E2=80=99s no w=
ay to keep us safe.<br><br>If you want to imagine what Trump=E2=80=99s Amer=
ica will look like, picture more kids at risk of violence and bigotry.&nbsp=
; Picture more anger and fear.&nbsp; Ask any of the mothers here tonight if=
 they want to live in that kind of America. Enough is enough. Unlike Donald=
 Trump, I will not pander to the gun lobby.&nbsp; And we will not be silenc=
ed.&nbsp; And we will not be intimidated.&nbsp; As long as children anywher=
e are being killed by gun violence, we will keep fighting for our kids beca=
use they deserve a president who stands up for them and stands with the mot=
hers here.&nbsp; Their lives are valuable.<br><br>Now, there=E2=80=99s a lo=
t more I could say tonight about what we need to do to better serve our kid=
s, from education to health care to jobs.&nbsp; But here=E2=80=99s the bott=
om line.&nbsp; Anyone asking for your vote owes it to you to fully grapple =
with the real challenges facing our families and communities.&nbsp; We owe =
it to you to listen and come up with solutions =E2=80=93 not scapegoats, so=
lutions =E2=80=93 that would make a difference in your children=E2=80=99s l=
ives.&nbsp; And to the mothers and fathers who have lost children, we owe y=
ou our love, our support, our gratitude, and our promise that we will carry=
 the memories of your sons and daughters in our hearts every day, just like=
 you do.<br><br>One of the best experiences of this campaign for me has bee=
n getting to know Mothers of the Movement, Sybrina and so many of the other=
 women here tonight.&nbsp; They are turning their sorrow into a strategy an=
d their mourning into a movement.&nbsp; I=E2=80=99ve had the opportunity to=
 sit and listen as they talk about their kids and their families. And I=E2=
=80=99ve seen how you gain strength from each other. <br><br>That=E2=80=99s=
 why tomorrow I hope you will take what you have gotten here this weekend b=
ack to your communities, to your families, to your loved ones, because it r=
eally does take a village.&nbsp; It takes a village to raise a child, to pr=
otect a child, to mourn a child, and to honor a child.&nbsp; So we=E2=80=99=
ve got to stand together and lift each other up and draw strength from each=
 other.&nbsp; Running for president=E2=80=99s hard, I got to tell you.&nbsp=
; But it=E2=80=99s nothing like what I have seen the mothers do and what I =
have learned from every one whom I have met.&nbsp; Your courage and your co=
mmitment and your leadership is inspirational to me.<br><br>I want to close=
 with a passage from Scripture that means a great deal to me, and I know ha=
