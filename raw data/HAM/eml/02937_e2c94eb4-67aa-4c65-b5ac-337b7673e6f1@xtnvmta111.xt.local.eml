With help from Brianna Gurciullo, Mary Lee and Daniel Lippman

EXCLUSIVE ... UNCOVERED: PI is at last able to reveal the force behind "Protect America's Consumers," the secretive group that has already spent more than $130,000 on TV and radio ads attacking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The campaign is being run by Lincoln Strategy Group, a political consulting firm Tempe, Ariz. Its founder, Nathan Sproul, has been linked to several instances of suspected voter fraud and barred from Republican Party contracts. The company also worked with Steve Gates, the only person previously identified with Protect America's Consumers, on the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity's 2009 "astroturf" campaign, when it was busted for sending fake letters to Congress.

At a field hearing on the CFPB's arbitration rule earlier this month in Albuquerque, N.M., a man who identified himself as Chuck Bowman rose to challenge the agency's director, Richard Cordray, on whether the policy would enrich trial lawyers and if he'll renounce support from trial lawyers in a future run for governor or attorney general. The moderator cut him off because the comment forum was not a Q&A. The outburst echoed Protect America's Consumers' talking points, replete with a website posing as Cordray running for office in Ohio.

Outside the event, five women held a banner and handed out fliers, obtained by PI, criticizing Cordray and linking to the fake website. But when these protesters were asked for their affiliation, they said they were day laborers paid to be there, according to Mikki Anaya, the New Mexico director of the Center for Economic Integrity, a community development organization, who attended the meeting. Anaya saw Bowman speak with the protesters as the meeting wrapped up. "It's not authentic at any level," Anaya told PI. "It's an intentional distraction from the true issue."

Another consumer advocate in attendance saw Bowman texting with Dan Centinello, an executive vice president at Lincoln Strategy Group who says he's worked for Mitt Romney, Chris Christie, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer. 

Sure enough, a report to be released today by left-wing research group Allied Progress will show that Centinello owns a web address redirecting to Protect America's Consumers. 

Centinello and Sproul didn't answer requests for comment. We still don't know who's paying them to mount the campaign.

HAPPY THURSDAY! PI runs on tips. Ping me at iarnsdorf@politico.com.

TOP TALKER: How did two witnesses opposing the Medicare Part B proposal on prescription drug costs come up with nearly identical written statements before a House subcommittee hearing? Because the lobbying firm representing both of them goofed, Jeffrey Young scoops for the Huffington Post. Hart Health Strategies President Vicki Hart called it a "clerical error." The firm represents both witnesses: Marcia Boyle, president of the Immune Deficiency Foundation; and Michael Schweitz, a rheumatologist speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Specialty Medicine and the Coalition of State Rheumatology Organizations. Hart also represents the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Groups
 siding with the Obama administration include AARP, Medicare Rights Center, Aetna and other health insurers, and labor unions including the AFL-CIO.

Hart told PI that in the future her firm will keep an eye out for identical passages when they help prepare witnesses. She also emphasized that the verbatim word was describing the background process, not the witness's experiences. "Who do people think writes testimony?" she said. "I don't think its so unusual for a health care lobbying firm to have health care clients use our assistance. What's the rub? That's our job."
