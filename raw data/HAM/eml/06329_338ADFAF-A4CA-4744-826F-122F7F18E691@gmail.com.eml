See below. Didn't we hear yesterday that the Sanders campaign had accepted t=
he result? This headline needs to be changed. This convention was not run by=
 the DNC or DNC leaders. It was run by the Nevada Democratic Party.=20

> Adryenn Ashley posted several live videos (below) from inside the Paris Ho=
tel in Las Vegas, where arcane secondary rounds of the delegate selection pr=
ocess of Nevada's Democratic caucus erupted into chaos Saturday night. Berni=
e Sanders supporters demanded 64 rejected pro-Sanders delegates listed in a "=
minority report" prepared by their campaign be allowed to participate in sel=
ecting delegates for the national convention.=20
>=20
> DNC leaders refused to reconsider their decision not to allow this, adjour=
ned, and fled the building amid a chorus of boos; leaving hotel security and=
 local police officers to handle the angry Sanders supporters.
>=20
> Earlier in the day, the Sanders camp objected to several of their delegate=
s being disqualified from voting for administrative reasons, and booed Sen. B=
arbara Boxer when she called for unity. "If you're booing me, you're booing B=
ernie Sanders," she told them. "Go ahead, boo yourselves out of this electio=
n."
>=20
> A member of the rules committee called the act of disallowing votes for pu=
rely administrative reasons a violation of the spirit of the values of our n=
ation.
>=20
> The longest of Ashley's videos is the most consequential, others posted fu=
rther below:=20
>=20
>=20
>=20
> Sanders supporters are observed considering a sit-in in Ashley's video, bu=
t hotel security forced them out, saying "it is now in the hands of the atto=
rneys."
>=20
> "Please leave peacefully," the security officers said. "Please leave, it i=
s not safe here."
>=20
> "If we do not leave, it becomes a big issue," said one Sanders supporter. "=
I'm not leaving."
>=20
> At one point, Ashley loses the video connection, but audio remains. "I don=
't know if you can see this," she says. "I don't know if you can hear this, b=
ut there are twenty armed sheriffs here to help them steal the election... T=
hey're saying leave now or else."
>=20
> After minute nine of the above video, Ashley asks someone what is going on=
: "We've got 620 viewers here, you have nothing to say?"
>=20
> "The guy that is speaking is not a member of the DNC, he is head of securi=
ty for Paris [hotel]. He says he is a dedicated --I don't know if he is a De=
mocrat," someone responds. "But the election process, and please leave. It i=
s not safe here. And by it is not safe here, I expect he means all those she=
riffs at the front of the room... They are asking us to 'leave the private p=
roperty at this time.' This should be national news. This needs to be nation=
al news."
>=20
> Eventually they shut the lights off to get the Sanders supporters out.
>=20
> The ignored the vote, turned lights off, turn sound WAY up. Truly bullshit=
. Ignoring our voices. #TeamBernieNV

> Update: "Roberta Lange stole this," said someone named Matt in the comment=
s section of this article, about Chairwoman of the Nevada State Democratic P=
arty & member of the DNC Executive Committee Roberta Lange: "It was not demo=
cracy. We had a motion for Recount on the Floor, Roberta ignored it, and cal=
led a motion to adjurn the meeting and then Ran out, even though the Nays wo=
n it. She did that on purpose, she is a crook, and needs to be kicked out of=
 her position as Nevada Democratic Chair Woman. I am officially registering a=
s an Independent, I was considering voting Hillary if I had to over Trump, s=
he just changed my mind. She just proved Democrats are Crooks."

<h1 class=3D"title">Chaos At Nevada Democratic Convention; DNC Leaders Flee=
 Building As Sanders Supporters Demand Recount</h1>
<!-- video-top --><br>
<!-- body-photo-inline -->
<div class=3D"clear">
<p><a href=3D"https://www.facebook.com/AdryennAshley/videos?fref=3Dphoto">A=
dryenn Ashley</a> posted several live videos (below) from inside the Paris =
Hotel in Las Vegas, where arcane secondary rounds of the delegate selection=
 process of Nevada's Democratic caucus
 erupted into chaos Saturday night. Bernie Sanders supporters demanded 64 r=
ejected pro-Sanders delegates listed in a &quot;<a href=3D"https://lasvegas=
sun.com/news/2016/may/14/at-democratic-convention-in-las-vegas-rules-divide=
/">minority report</a>&quot; prepared by their
 campaign be allowed to participate in selecting delegates for the national=
 convention.
<br>
<br>
DNC leaders refused to reconsider their decision not to allow this, adjourn=
ed, and fled the building amid a chorus of boos; leaving
<i>hotel security</i> and local police officers to handle the angry Sanders=
 supporters.<br>
<br>
Earlier in the day, the Sanders camp objected to several of their delegates=
 being

disqualified from voting for administrative reasons</a>, and <a href=3D"htt=

booed Sen. Barbara Boxer</a> when she called for unity. &quot;If you're boo=
ing me, you're booing Bernie Sanders,&quot; she told them. &quot;Go ahead, =
boo yourselves out of this election.&quot;<br>
<br>
A member of the rules committee called the act of disallowing votes for pur=
ely administrative reasons

tic_credentials_committee_co-chair_actions_to_exclude_sanders_supporters_vi=
olate_the_spirit_of_the_values_of_our_nation.html">
a violation of the spirit of the values of our nation</a>.<br>
<br>
The longest of Ashley's videos is the most consequential, others posted fur=
ther below:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sanders supporters are observed considering a sit-in in Ashley's video, but=
 hotel security forced them out, saying &quot;it is now in the hands of the=
 attorneys.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Please leave peacefully,&quot; the security officers said. &quot;Plea=
se leave, it is not safe here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If we do not leave, it becomes a big issue,&quot; said one Sanders su=
pporter. &quot;I'm not leaving.&quot;<br>
<br>
At one point, Ashley loses the video connection, but audio remains. &quot;I=
 don't know if you can see this,&quot; she says. &quot;I don't know if you =
can hear this, but there are twenty armed sheriffs here to help them steal =
the election... They're saying leave now or else.&quot;<br>
<br>
After minute nine of the above video, Ashley asks someone what is going on:=
 &quot;We've got 620 viewers here, you have nothing to say?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The guy that is speaking is not a member of the DNC, he is head of se=
curity for Paris [hotel]. He says he is a dedicated --I don't know if he is=
 a Democrat,&quot; someone responds. &quot;But the election process, and pl=
ease leave. It is not safe here. And by it is not
 safe here, I expect he means all those sheriffs at the front of the room..=
. They are asking us to 'leave the private property at this time.' This sho=
uld be national news. This needs to be national news.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eventually they <i>shut the lights off</i> to get the Sanders supporters ou=
t.<br>

Chairwoman of the Nevada State Democratic Party &amp; member of the DNC Exe=

tion for Recount on the Floor, Roberta ignored it, and called a motion to a=
djurn the meeting and then Ran out, even
 though the Nays won it. She did that on purpose, she is a crook, and needs=
 to be kicked out of her position as Nevada Democratic Chair Woman. I am of=
ficially registering as an Independent, I was considering voting Hillary if=
 I had to over Trump, she just changed
 my mind. She just proved Democrats are Crooks.&quot;</blockquote>
