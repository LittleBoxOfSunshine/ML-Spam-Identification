Passing this one along since I don't know what vet comm said. Let me know what I should respond to her. I mean, looks like she's a delegate and this email seems fine. But that's just me! 

Thanks, 

Nick

Hi! So - I accidentally donated twice for a ticket to the same event, so I've paid for two tickets which both have my name on them.

I'm going to use my extra ticket for a friend, but I'm not sure yet which friend can go - when do I need to let you know by to make sure we both get our tickets? Just to make sure you have both our names, I mean.

PS- Someone else said somewhere that the event would be happening on 6/2 - is it 6/2 or 6/3? I think it was originally scheduled for Saturday
