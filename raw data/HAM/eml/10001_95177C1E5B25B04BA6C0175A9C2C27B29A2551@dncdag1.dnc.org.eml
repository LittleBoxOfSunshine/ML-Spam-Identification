Donald Trump's Strange World View<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/opinion/donald-trump-to-world-im-willing-to-walk.html?ref=opinion>
THE NEW YORK TIMES // THE EDITORIAL BOARD
After landslide Republican primary victories, Donald Trump delivered a speech on Wednesday in Washington intended to clarify his foreign policy positions. That was needed, because his views on America's role in the world have until now been expressed in tweets, interviews and remarks at rallies that have alarmed nearly every foreign ally of the United States. No one's fears are likely to be allayed by this speech, which was clearly worked up by his new campaign advisers and read from a teleprompter. It did not exhibit much grasp of the complexity of the world, understanding of the balance or exercise of power, or even a careful reading of history. When one has a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And when one's experience is limited to real estate deals, everything looks like a lease negotiation. Hearing Mr. Trump describe his approach to foreign relations, one imagines a group of nations sitting at a table with him at its head, rather like a scene from "The Apprentice," with him demanding more money, more troops and policy changes in exchange for American protection, trade and friendship. And if he doesn't get what he wants? "In negotiation, you must be willing to walk," Mr. Trump said.

GOP Aides in Despair Over Election, CQ Roll Call Survey Finds<http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/gop-aides-despair-election-cq-roll-call-survey-finds>
ROLL CALL // SHAWN ZELLER
 Republican aides are growing increasingly despondent about their party's prospects in the 2016 presidential election, according to CQ Roll Call's most recent Capitol Insiders Survey. A majority of the GOP staffers who responded to the April survey now expect either Donald Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to win the party's nomination and nearly half of them -  a solid plurality -  think the Republican nominee will lose. "The people I talk to can't believe we are where we are at," says former New Hampshire GOP Sen. Judd Gregg. Republicans had expected public fatigue with President Barack Obama to take hold and carry them to victory this year. But then Trump and Cruz started winning primaries, even as both are viewed negatively by most Americans, opinion polls show. "The two leading candidates are viewed without all that much enthusiasm," says Gregg. It could be that the aides are worried about Trump's effect down the ballot. "It should be a Republican year but the big question mark is Donald Trump," says Don Nickles, the former Senate Republican whip from Oklahoma. "He's unlike any Republican we've ever seen before," since the public views him so negatively, Nickles said. GOP fretting about the Senate majority has grown throughout the year.

Clinton, Kasich - not Cruz - endorsed by nation's largest Hispanic business group<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/28/john-kasich-not-ted-cruz-endorsed-by-nations-largest-hispanic-business-group/>
WASHINGTON POST // ED O'KEEFE
The nation's largest Hispanic business group is diving into the presidential campaign for the first time -- and is skipping over the only Latino still running. The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce plans to formally endorse former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) for president on Thursday, a shot in the arm for both campaigns at critical moments for each bid. The move will be seen as a rebuke of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), the only remaining Latino contender, who isn't held in high regard anyway by most Hispanic business and political leaders. Word of the endorsements leaked out after Kasich dropped hints during a private meeting with supporters on Tuesday in Indiana. The support should help bolster the governor's argument that he has the best general election appeal even if he trails far behind Cruz and GOP front-runner Donald Trump. Recent national polls show that Kasich is the only GOP candidate that could beat Clinton.

History Suggests Ted Cruz's Early Running-Mate Gambit Won't Work<http://time.com/4310237/ted-cruz-carly-fiorina-early-running-mate-announcements-history/>
TIME // KATIE REILLY
Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz's unusual move Wednesday to announce a running mate, Carly Fiorina, without securing the party nomination is not unprecedented in American political history - but it is rare, and similar attempts in the past have been largely unsuccessful. Previous presidential candidates who have announced a running mate before achieving the nomination have done so in an attempt to draw in new voters and rejuvenate a struggling campaign. But in at least three instances they've been unsuccessful efforts, often dismissed as acts of desperation. In 1952, U.S. Senator Robert Taft, then a Republican presidential candidate, had privately planned to select General Douglas MacArthur for his running mate and give him national-security responsibilities if Taft received the nomination, according to General Courtney Whitney, who was familiar with the discussions. MacArthur, whose recent firing by President Harry Truman had been unpopular in some quarters, later accepted that offer and gave the keynote address at the Republican convention. The Taft-MacArthur pairing, which became public knowledge among party insiders, aimed to "ignite Republicans with the kind of oratory MacArthur had used to wow Congress as well as the millions who heard him by ad and television," Stanley Weintraub wrote in his book 15 Stars.

Trump fails to impress foreign-policy experts<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/donald-trump-foreign-policy-speech-reaction-222544>
POLITICO // MICHAEL CROWLEY
In his address to an elite, invitation-only Washington foreign policy audience Wednesday, Donald Trump promised that, as president, he would restore a "coherent" vision to America's role in the world. But across the ideological spectrum, and even among natural allies, Trump's speech received a failing grade for coherence and drew snickering and scorn from foreign policy insiders who remain unconvinced that Trump is up to the job. "It struck me as a very odd mishmash," said Doug Bandow, a foreign policy scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, who shares many of Trump's beliefs about scaling back America's role abroad. "He called for a new foreign policy strategy, but you don't really get the sense he gave one." Trump's speech was "lacking in policy prescriptions," and its "strident rhetoric masked a lack of depth," said Robert "Bud" McFarlane, a former national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan who attended the speech. Speaking at Washington's Mayflower hotel, Trump mostly repeated familiar themes from his campaign, including promises to cut better trade deals with China, swiftly defeat the Islamic State, rebuild the military and reduce the expense America incurs in upholding international security from Europe to Asia. Trump spoke from a teleprompter and in tones that were subdued by the standards of his raucous rallies. He also unveiled a new theme, saying that the U.S. would "finally have a coherent foreign policy" based on narrow self-interest, economic gain and global stability.
