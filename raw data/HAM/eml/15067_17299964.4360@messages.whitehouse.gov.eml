THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release April 29, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20



**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.



12:52 P.M. EDT

=20

 MS. JANNEY: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. I was going to tell you all to=
 be seated, but I see you are already seated, so we can begin. Josh is ou=
t today. He has, I believe, it's a root canal. (Laughter.) Yes, he has a =
root canal. But let's be honest, I'm better at this than he is anyway. Ju=
st between us.



 First, I have two announcements and then I'll take questions. First, the=
 President is still working on his jokes for the White House Corresponden=
ts' Dinner. I don't have any details on that other than he intends to be =
funny -- very funny. Okay, and second, it is Friday, which means at half-=
past five I will be performing The Jackal in my office for anyone who is =
interested or remembers or cares. (Laughter.)



 So now I'll take your questions.



 Oh, Josh! You're back!



 MR. EARNEST: This is not your show anymore!



 MS. JANNEY: Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry. I just -- I was in town and I jus=
t wanted to take a moment. Totally, this is your office.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, you're standing at the podium, so you might as well u=
se it.



 MS. JANNEY: All right. In all seriousness -- what do you mean? This is j=
ust happening.=20



In all seriousness, my name is Allison Janney and I am here today to draw=
 attention to the opioid epidemic and to celebrate those who are working =
to help others combat substance-use disorder. And I'm actually on a show =
now called "Mom," which deals with people in recovery. And I'm here with =
my co-creator and executive producer, Chuck Lorre, who is -- this issue i=
s very important to both of us. He's in the back there.



 Today, here at the White House, 10 individuals from across the country w=
ill be honored as White House Champions of Change. They've been selected =
from over 900 nominations for their leadership in preventing prescription=
 drug abuse and heroin use, and for increasing access to treatment and to=
 support their fellow Americans in recovery -- for supporting their fello=
w Americans in recovery.=20



 This is a disease that can touch anybody, and all of us can help reduce =
drug abuse through evidence-based treatment, prevention, and recovery. Re=
search shows it works. And courageous Americans show it works every day. =
I'm so nervous I can't believe. (Laughter.) So thank you for the opportun=
ity to be here today, and to highlight this important issue. And now I re=
turn the podium to its rightful owner, Josh. Thank you.



 Q Can I ask C.J. a question? (Laughter.)



 MS. JANNEY: Yes, sure.



 Q Who is President Bartlett supporting in the Democratic Primary? (Laugh=
ter.)



 MS. JANNEY: I think you know the answer to that question. (Laughter.)



 MR. EARNEST: Thank you, Allison. Nice job.



 MS. JANNEY: Thank you. (Applause.)



 MR. EARNEST: You're welcome to stay.=20



 Q Josh, when is the fun part? (Laughter.)



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I was going to say, who says we don't have some fun a=
round here? So, obviously Allison thinks -- feels very passionately about=
 the work that she's spending some time here at the White House focused o=
n today. And so we obviously owe her a debt of gratitude for really takin=
g on this cause and it's something that she passionately believes in. And=
 we obviously are pleased that we can work with somebody who is as commit=
ted and as talented as she is on something that's that important.



 All right, the fun stuff is out of the way now. We can go back to our re=
gular Friday afternoon briefing. But we'll try to keep it short, Mark. I =
know you're ready to start your weekend. (Laughter.)



 Q Aren't we all? (Laughter.)



 MR. EARNEST: That is true.



 Kathleen, do you want to start?



 Q Sure, sure. Well, I feel like a bit of a downer here. I wanted to ask =
about the report that came out on the helicopter attack on the hospital i=
n Kunduz. I know you mentioned yesterday that the President planned to re=
ad it. I'm wondering if he's either been briefed or read it, and if he fe=
els that justice has been served in this case at this point, and if the a=
ppropriate reforms and changes have been made.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Kathleen, you're right, this is a very serious topic.=
 And it is certainly a topic that the Commander-in-Chief has made a prior=
ity. The United States goes to tremendous lengths to avoid civilian casua=
lties. And when those casualties occur, as they did in this instance, the=
 President called for a transparent, thorough, and objective accounting o=
f what exactly transpired.=20



 As you point out, this objective accounting was put forward by the Depar=
tment of Defense today. The President has been briefed on the report. The=
 report is available -- or at least a redacted, declassified version of t=
he report is available on Central Command website, and that is consistent=
 with the President's view of transparency.



 The report goes into some detail about what exactly transpired. The conc=
lusion of the investigation is that there were human error that causes tr=
agedy. Now, that human error was compounded by systems and procedural fai=
lures. The Department of Defense has announced a set of steps that will b=
e taken to provide accountability for those who were involved. The Depart=
ment of Defense has also laid out some specific reforms moving forward th=
at will prevent this kind of tragedy from occurring again in Afghanistan =
or anywhere else. And, again, all of this is consistent with the priority=
 that President Obama places on avoiding civilian casualties.=20



 Our adversaries certainly don't go to these lengths. In some cases, our =
adversaries target civilian populations. But these are the kinds of refor=
ms that are consistent with our values as a country and are consistent wi=
th the priorities that are established by the Commander-in-Chief.



 Q So someone looking at it at a distance, how exactly then does the Pres=
ident sort of explain how something like this could happen, given all of =
these safeguards and assurances he gives about civilian casualties? That =
42 people died in a hospital could be hit and there's no criminal charges=
 filed, it's just administrative punishment. How does explain the justice=
?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, what the President called for from the beginning was =
a thorough, objective, and transparent accounting of what transpired. And=
 that's what the Department of Defense has put forward. This is an invest=
igation that was conducted by military officers that were outside of the =
chain of command. These were individuals -- the individuals who led this =
investigation are professional investigators, and they're individuals who=
 are not involved in the incident. So they were able to provide an object=
ive perspective on what transpired.



 And obviously they've spent months interviewing people who were involved=
, reviewing relevant facts and material to understand exactly what happen=
ed, to understand exactly what led to the failures, including the human e=
rror that led to this tragedy. And based on their own working knowledge o=
f how these kinds of military operations are carried out, they made speci=
fic suggestions for reforms that could be instituted to prevent something=
 like this from happening again.=20



 But there's no denying that what's occurred here is a genuine tragedy, a=
nd when this incident occurred, you heard the President and others expres=
s their profound sorrow at the loss of innocent life, including individua=
ls who had put themselves in harm's way to try to treat the wounds of inn=
ocent people caught in the crossfire.=20



So there are multiple dimensions of this tragedy. And the significance an=
d scale of what transpired explains why such a detailed investigation has=
 been conducted and made public. All of that is consistent with our value=
s. It's consistent with the priorities that the President has established=
. It's consistent with our commitment to avoiding civilian casualties. An=
d it's consistent with our values as a country.



 Q Okay, on another topic. There seems to be a little bit of new momentum=
 behind the criminal justice reform effort on the Hill. I just thought I'=
d give you an opportunity to see whether (inaudible) you felt that moment=
um here or is there any prospects for this actually happening?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I know there was a bipartisan announcement that was m=
ade on Capitol Hill, I believe at the end of the day or at least yesterda=
y afternoon. And what we have been saying for months is that the White Ho=
use role has been to try to nurture and facilitate bipartisan cooperation=
 on this issue on Capitol Hill.



 Fortunately, the bipartisan interest in this legislation has been there =
at the beginning. Democrats and Republicans observed that common-sense re=
forms to our criminal justice system could not just save taxpayer dollars=
 but it could actually make our communities safer, lower recidivism rates=
, and give those who have paid their debt to society a better chance at r=
eentering American life and making a substantive contribution to it.



 So what we have done all along is to try to encourage both sides to cont=
inue to find common ground, to present ideas for making that common groun=
d more easily recognized, and there have been some strange bedfellows, gi=
ven the context of these efforts. There have been representatives from co=
nservative political organizations that had been interested in contributi=
ng to this effort as well.



 So I think it does reflect that what is the subject of some debate is no=
t necessarily something that should provoke a partisan or ideological obj=
ection, but rather a more common-sense, practical approach to recognizing=
 the potential benefits of reforms like this. So, sometimes, that kind of=
 pragmatic approach gets drowned out by the partisanship and ideology and=
 occasional histrionics that are endemic on Capitol Hill.=20



But in this case, we're going to continue to work with Democrats and Repu=
blicans to try to navigate those cross-currents and hopefully emerge on t=
he other side with a genuine bipartisan reform bill that would have enorm=
ous positive consequences for our country. And the President identified t=
his as a top legislative priority of his last year, and we've been workin=
g since then to try to make it a reality. And I do anticipate that the Pr=
esident will devote a significant portion of his eight months that remain=
 here in office to getting this legislation passed through Congress an on=
to his desk.

=20

 Hi, there.

=20

 Q In Syria, there was the short-term truce announced earlier today, and =
it doesnt seem like it addresses the fighting in Aleppo. So I wanted to s=
ee what more information you could give us and what the plan is to addres=
s fighting there. And also, are you confident that a date could be set fo=
r peace talks to resume?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, let's first talk about the agreement that was announc=
ed today. Since the beginning of the cessation of hostilities, fighting h=
as continued in the area of north Latakia and eastern Ghouta, putting arm=
ed opposition groups there and in other areas controlled by the oppositio=
n under pressure. Persistent violations in this area are unacceptable and=
 damaging. As a result, the U.S. government and Russia have been working =
to secure a general recommitment to the cessation of hostilities by all p=
arties in Latakia and eastern Ghouta to be implemented beginning at midni=
ght tonight, Damascus time.=20



 It's our view that this essentially would be a refreshment of the cessat=
ion of hostilities, and getting both sides to commit to refreshing the co=
mmitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities c=
ould have potentially a catalyzing effect. And what we would like to see =
is a return to the situation on the ground that prevailed a couple of wee=
ks ago, which was not an all-out end to the fighting, but rather a broad =
acceptance of the terms of the cessation of hostilities. And that agreeme=
nt was only possible because the United States and Russia used our influe=
nce with the relevant groups to bring about that agreement and that cessa=
tion of hostilities.=20



 And we acknowledged all along that there were likely to be violations of=
 the cessation of hostilities. But what's happened over the last week or =
so is that the frequency of violations has increased, and that's been a s=
ource of significant concern. So our hope is that by refreshing this agre=
ement, focusing our attention on these two particular areas, we can build=
 momentum again toward a broadly observed cessation of hostilities.



 Q And how confident are you that this refreshment is going to help push =
forward these talks?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the thing that we know is that the opposite is true. =
The thing that we know is that the weakening of the cessation of hostilit=
ies, or the repeated violations of the cessation of hostilities have tang=
ibly undermined efforts to reach -- or at least to advance political talk=
s. So the question is, can we give some more momentum to those political =
talks by expanding the area in Syria where the cessation of hostilities i=
s once again observed. And again, our goal of trying to refresh the cessa=
tion of hostilities is motivated by a desire to advance the political tal=
ks.



 The other benefit -- and this is another important benefit of refreshed =
cessation of hostilities, particularly in these two areas -- is it could =
create space for the delivery of additional humanitarian relief. This par=
t of Syria has been subject to quite intense fighting for a long time now=
. And there are communities and innocent people there that are suffering.=
 And bringing much-needed humanitarian relief in the form of food and wat=
er and medicine could relieve, at least a little bit, so much of the wide=
spread suffering that we've seen in that country.



 Q On another topic, on the Korean Peninsula, China and Russia today said=
 that they wanted the United States to back off its possible plan to put =
in an anti-missile defense system near South Korea. What's your reaction =
to that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the reaction to that is that the United States' commi=
tment to South Korea's security is rock-solid. The Republic of Korea is a=
 close ally of the United States, and that means the United States is pre=
pared to invest resources in keeping them safe. We have seen repeated pro=
vocations, particularly in just the last few months, from North Korea, vo=
wing to use their military might against our allies. And we've begun -- t=
here already has been a significant commitment of military firepower and =
manpower by the United States to defend South Korea. And the assessment o=
f our military and national security experts is that additional resources=
 could be necessary to ensure the safety and security of the Republic of =
Korea.=20



So that's why the United States has engaged in conversations with our Sou=
th Korean allies about deploying what's called a THAAD battery. This is e=
ssentially a sophisticated anti-ballistic missile system that would enhan=
ce our ally's security. Those discussions are ongoing. I'll just point ou=
t that that equipment would be oriented toward the threat that is posed b=
y North Korea, not oriented toward China or Russia. That's been our conte=
ntion all along, and those are the facts. And it's certainly changes in t=
he environment, at least in the behavior of the North Korea government, t=
hat is prompting this consideration of increasing our posture on South Ko=
rea. It's not a result of changes that are made by Russia or China.



Q So talks are ongoing with South Korea. Can you give us any sense of tim=
ing or when you expect the talks to conclude?



MR. EARNEST: I dont have an updated sense of timing at this point. But ob=
viously these conversations have been occurring for several weeks now. Bu=
t I dont have an announcement to make yet about a particular decision.



Michelle.



Q Thanks, Josh. More than once, China has now expressed its annoyance at =
this THAAD possibility. So if that's going to go through -- and you do ex=
pect that to be completed, is that right?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldnt prejudge the outcome. Obviously we would def=
er to the preferences of our allies in South Korea about whether or not t=
hey would like to have this additional equipment located on their territo=
ry. The assessment of our military and national security experts is that =
it could be a good idea for them to do that. But ultimately, this is a so=
vereign country, and because theyre an ally of the United States, were lo=
oking for ways to help them. And this is one potential way we could offer=
 some assistance to them and enhance their security. But ultimately, they=
 would make the final call.



Q But at this point, theres no reason to think that that wouldnt be compl=
eted, right?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldnt prejudge what the outcome here would be. I w=
ould just note that our officials have concluded it might be prudent, and=
 well have a conversation with the Koreans about that.



Q Okay. So if we already know that China is not happy about this, and the=
yve expressed it more than once, if this does go through and that system =
is deployed there, is that going to affect Chinas pressure on North Korea=
, which many feel is the only way to eventually get North Korea to change=
 its behavior?



MR. EARNEST: Well, it shouldnt. Let me explain a couple reasons why.



The first is, of course, the THAAD battery would be oriented to the threa=
t in North Korea, not oriented to China in any way.



Q What if they dont like it, though?



MR. EARNEST: They dont, but those are the facts. The second fact is that =
we already know that China is understandably concerned about the behavior=
 of the North Korean government. These repeated provocations and violatio=
ns of U.N. Security Council resolutions are destabilizing. And its not at=
 all in Chinas interest to have that kind of destabilizing activity right=
 on their doorstep.



So the point is, China, using its influence on the North Korean governmen=
t to get them to end their provocative acts, is not something that they d=
o as a favor to the United States. Theyre focused on getting North Korea =
to end their provocations is rooted in their own self-interest, which is =
that having all this provocative behavior and this conflict and this dest=
abilizing activity on their doorstep is not in their interest.



Q Do you expect THAAD to affect the relationship between the U.S. and Chi=
na in any way, though? Or do you expect it to prompt China to, I dont kno=
w, keep on militarizing or militarizing faster the islands that the U.S. =
disagrees with?



MR. EARNEST: I mean, obviously, theres a reference to the situation on th=
e South China Sea. That is obviously an entirely -- I mean, it is an enti=
rely different part of the world, both literally and figuratively here.



Q But do you expect some tit for tat if this goes through?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldnt predict what the Chinese response would be, =
even if this is something that were eventually decided.=20



I think what I would say is that theres an opportunity for the United Sta=
tes and China to work together -- and we have, effectively -- to increase=
 the pressure on the North Korean government to change their behavior. We=
ve ramped up the pressure, but thus far we have not seen the change that =
we are both seeking. And as a result, we have felt that its necessary to =
begin at least talking to our allies in South Korea about enhancing their=
 national security. But that is not going to in any way diminish our inte=
rest in trying to make the Korean Peninsula more stable and less a source=
 of tension in the region.



Q Okay. And looking at the way the campaigns are playing out, it was just=
 a few days ago that Hillary Clintons communications director called Bern=
ie Sanders destructive, said that hes not productive for Democrats, not p=
roductive for the country. Does the President feel like Democrats are uni=
ted right now?



MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, were still in the midst of a primary. And o=
bviously, the Democratic Party has been engaged in a competitive process.=
 Thats appropriate. Thats a way we can -- thats the way the party can eva=
luate who the strongest candidate is. And obviously, the party has a stro=
ng interest in choosing the strongest candidate to represent the party in=
 the general election.



But these are decisions for voters to make. And the President, as a voter=
, has cast a ballot, but has not weighed in publicly about who his prefer=
ence is.=20



So at some point, I think the President will make a strong case about the=
 need for the Democratic Party to come together in support of the policie=
s that hes fought so hard to put in place. That will be a fundamental que=
stion in the election.



Q So you said multiple times that you welcome robust debate, this is just=
 what happens with the election; its good for the country. But at the sam=
e time, weve heard the President say at a private event that Democrats re=
ally need to come together right now. So would you disagree with words li=
ke that, that Sanders has been a destructive influence not only on Democr=
ats but on the country?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Ive done my best to stay out of the middle of the deba=
te between the two Democratic candidates, and Im going to try to do that =
in this case.=20



I think what the President is focused on is ensuring that when the genera=
l election does roll around -- and it hasnt yet -- but when we get knee-d=
eep in a general election, it will be important for Democrats to keep in =
mind what their priorities are. And obviously, the President has spent th=
e better part of seven and a half years fighting for a set of priorities,=
 and hell, Im confident, make a case in the general election about the wi=
sdom of continuing that fight. But the time for that part of the debate h=
as not yet arrived.



Q So Sanders being called destructive and not productive for Democrats, n=
ot productive for this country, you dont want to weigh in on whether you =
agree or disagree with that?



MR. EARNEST: I dont. Because part of working on a campaign is engaging in=
 charges and counter-charges, and I think it is a fair observation to not=
e the difference in tone and tenor between the debate on the Democratic s=
ide and the debate on the Republican side. Many Republicans have made tha=
t observation. I dont think Im saying anything particularly controversial=
.



But the President does believe in the value of a robust debate. And polit=
ics are tough. But I think what the President is focused on is a general =
election, and making sure that the people that have been so strongly supp=
ortive of his policies over the last seven or eight years realize the sta=
kes of the general election. And the President will have ample opportunit=
y to make that case.



Q And not sure if he knows, but this weekend is the White House Correspon=
dents' Dinner.=20



MR. EARNEST: I was aware.



Q This being the Presidents last year, is he going to do anything differe=
nt? Or can you sort of give us a little foreshadowing of what he plans to=
 do with his time? I mean, its always -- kind of follows the routine, he =
has a lot of jokes. Is he going to try to put his stamp on it? Anything l=
ike that you can say?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I dont want to give away any surprises, but --



Q Will there be surprises?



MR. EARNEST: I wouldnt rule out a couple of surprises. I think surprise i=
s a key element in humor, and the President is certainly -- I want to pro=
tect his ability to surprise you with some good jokes.=20



The President does enjoy this opportunity, that it is something -- the Pr=
esident, over the course of eight years, has given thousands of speeches =
in public in one form or another. The vast majority of them are dealing w=
ith very serious topics. And this is one unique opportunity that he has e=
very year to poke a little fun at himself, poke a little fun at the proce=
ss, maybe even poke a little fun at a political adversary or two, but it'=
s also a reminder of how in one way or another, we all have a role to pla=
y in our democracy. And obviously the President has an important role to =
set the agenda, but you all have an important role, too, to hold those in=
 power accountable. And the President is respectful of that role, and I'm=
 confident that the President will acknowledge that in the serious portio=
n of his speech because he believes in the value of professional, indepen=
dent media.



 But, look, the other way that we can reflect the importance of political=
 journalism in our country is to poke a little fun at the process, and th=
ere are ample opportunities to do so this year.



 Q Is he just going to let loose this year, is basically what I'm asking.=
 (Laughter.)



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think I'll let you judge, based on his comments, ab=
out whether or not he took advantage of the opportunity to let loose, as =
you described it.



 Go ahead, JC.



 Q To misquote Richard M. Nixon, the President won't have Donald Trump to=
 kick around anymore. The last time he appeared, I believe, was 2011. He =
will not be in the audience. Look, does the President regret that opportu=
nity?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm going to preserve the element of surprise =
here. And I don't think that ducking in the room means that you are going=
 to avoid some attention in the speeches. But we'll see.



 Laura.



 Q Is the President concerned about the protestors -- again last night, t=
ook the street, protesting Donald Trump? That's the first question.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Laura, I think in general there is a long history of =
and a long tradition of protest in the American political system. In fact=
, this country was started by a bunch of protestors, some of whom decided=
 that they were pretty unhappy about taxes and threw some barrels of tea =
in the Boston Harbor. So there's a history of protest in this country.



 What the President believes is that we also have a system of government,=
 and there is an opportunity for voters to make their voices heard at the=
 ballot box. And there should be a debate, and there should be a public d=
ebate. And that debate is likely to be filled with some emotion. These ar=
e serious issues that are being discussed.=20



So while people surely should take advantage of the history and tradition=
 in this country of engaging in political protest, they need to do so wit=
h some respect for the system and for our country and for our government,=
 and to ensure that that protest isn't a source of violence, it doesn't i=
ncite violence. The protest should not be used to drown out the ability o=
f other people to participate in our political system or to participate i=
n the political debate. But there's a strong history of protest in this c=
ountry -- that's a good thing. That's something we're proud of as America=
ns.



 Q But in a presidential election, outside the United States, the whole w=
orld now is watching with quite astonishment what's happening when Donald=
 Trump is speaking. You don't think the President has a responsibility to=
 do something about the potential of violence, which is happening now eac=
h time Donald Trump is speaking?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I'll just say, as a general statement, the President =
has been outspoken on a number of occasions about how our political syste=
m, our form of politics in the United States was geared toward resolving =
conflicts. This is a big, diverse country, and people are going to have d=
ifferent points of view. And we resolve those differences not through vio=
lence, not by taking up arms against one another, not by questioning some=
one else's patriotism or judging someone based on their religion or their=
 color or who they are, but rather through our system of government, wher=
e every citizen has an opportunity to cast a vote and make their voices h=
eard at the ballot box. And that's how our system of government was desig=
ned. And that's the way that it should work.



 Q On Donald Trump again. Yesterday in California, he was talking about h=
is solution to fight ISIS, referring to General Pershing, and it was quit=
e astonishing also for a lot of foreign observers. And on NBC News, he wa=
s talking about the possibility to a nuclear ISIS. He said that he won't =
exclude, if he is elected President, to use the nuclear weapon against IS=
IS. What's the White House reaction on that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let all of you sort of conclude the wisdom of th=
at kind of strategy. I think the President has been pretty clear about wh=
at our strategy is. And that is a strategy that is mindful of the need to=
 protect the American people, and that our success in the effort to degra=
de and ultimately destroy ISIL is not unrelated to how those efforts are =
carried out.=20



 For example, we make it a priority in this country to avoid civilian cas=
ualties. That certainly is going to be a lot harder to do if you're using=
 nuclear weapons, or advocating the use of nuclear weapons. In this count=
ry, we have made clear that people are included and not discriminated aga=
inst just because of their religion or what their name is, or how they ma=
y have entered the country, but rather they're judged based on their cont=
ributions to the country and their contributions to the political debate.=
 And that's not just a reflection of our values, but our commitment to ou=
r values is also an important part of advancing our interests around the =
world and protecting our national security.



 Q You don't see the need to quiet down the tone at this moment due to wh=
at's happening -- the level of anger, frustration, and what's happening i=
n this country? You don't think there's a responsibility to quiet down th=
is tone?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, there's a long history of tough political deba=
te and protest in this country. And, again, that kind of protest and deba=
te was present at the creation of our country. At the same time, leaders =
in both parties have a responsibility not to incite violence, not to prom=
ote discrimination, but rather to, even in the midst of tough political d=
ebates, remind us all that there's a whole lot more that we have in commo=
n than divides us. And that certainly has been part and parcel of the Pre=
sident's leadership style, even before he entered the Oval Office. And th=
at is a legacy -- certainly an aspect of his legacy that President Obama =
is quite proud of.



Ron.



Q I was reading through the MSF response to the DOD investigation, and wi=
thout going through all the details, they point out that they've been ask=
ing for the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission to look in=
to this. And they say that that has so far gone unanswered. Is there an a=
nswer to that request? Or is this the final word on this from the United =
States?



MR. EARNEST: I think at this point this is the final word. This is the tr=
ansparent, thorough, and objective accounting that the President asked fo=
r.



Q There were other investigations, though, right? There was one involved =
in the Afghan government, wasnt there? There were other investigations.



MR. EARNEST: I dont remember. I guess you could check with the Afghan gov=
ernment about that.



Q So why not have an international body, a more impartial body? Obviously=
, the U.S. military has a vested interested in this. Why not have an inte=
rnational nonpartisan? Why not have that?



MR. EARNEST: Because the President has confidence that the investigation =
that was conducted was objective. It was conducted by people who were not=
 involved in the particular operation, and it was conducted --



Q These are commanders, though.=20



MR. EARNEST: No, the investigation was conducted by individuals who are n=
ot involved in the investigation. They were outside of the chain of comma=
nd of those who were involved in the investigation. So that's why we woul=
d describe it as an objective investigation and an objective accounting o=
f what exactly transpired. What's also clear here, Ron, is that an invest=
igation that includes suggestions for reforms needs to be conducted by in=
dividuals that have their own working expertise of how U.S. military oper=
ations are conducted.=20



So I understand sort of the case that you're making for the benefits of a=
n investigation that's conducted by someone outside of the United States =
military, but I think it's important that you dont overlook the value of =
choosing somebody who understands how the U.S. military works, who unders=
tands how these kinds of operations are carried out, but is also somebody=
 who can be objective because they werent involved in the operation, they=
're not in the chain of the command with the individuals who were involve=
d in the operation. They're professional investigators, and they can put =
forward a clear rendering of what transpired of what steps toward account=
ability should be taken and what reforms should be implemented to prevent=
 something like this from happening again.=20



Q This internationally renowned and respected organization does not think=
 that this is justice when there are 42 people dead and there's no one he=
ld criminally responsible. How do you reconcile that?



MR. EARNEST: I reconcile that by saying the United States goes to great l=
engths to avoid civilian casualties. And when those casualties do occur a=
s a result of human error that was compounded by systemic and procedural =
failures, the United States of America owns up to it. The United States o=
f America conducts an independent investigation to determine what exactly=
 happened. The United States of America, consistent with our values, is t=
ransparent about those failures. They're published on a website that all =
of you can see right now. We've owned up to it. The individuals who were =
involved and do bear some accountability are held accountable. That's our=
 system. And that is a system that's consistent with our values. It's als=
o a system that follows through on implementing reforms that makes someth=
ing like this much less likely to ever happen again. And that's what the =
Commander-in-Chief asked for, and that's what he got.



Q Another thing I'd point out is that they believe this focus on intent i=
s not a valid answer to the question of responsibility in determining a c=
rime or a war crime. Clearly, you dont agree with that. But do you see th=
e point, that this idea of intent is not -- it's the result, it's what ha=
ppened -- and intent is not a way to essentially explain away someone's r=
esponsibility.



MR. EARNEST: I think the passion that's evident in the arguments that are=
 being made by MSF is entirely understandable, and this is a tragedy. And=
 this is an organization that does heroic work around the world. And in t=
his case, some of the individuals that they employ, or at least support, =
were killed while they were trying to attend to wounds of innocent people=
 who were injured in this conflict.



So I think their response is entirely human; one that's entirely understa=
ndable, one that's entirely reasonable. But what's also true is that the =
investigation that was conducted by the Department of Defense is consiste=
nt with the orders they received from the Commander-in-Chief. And the Ame=
rican people and people around the world can go and decide for themselves=
 whether or not this investigation was serious. I think when you take a l=
ook at a report that extends beyond 100 pages, there's ample detail in th=
ere, and it does discuss what transpired and what steps could be taken to=
 prevent these errors from happening somewhere else. And I think that's w=
hat the President has been focused on, even in the midst of this terrible=
 tragedy.



Q On a much lighter note, the Correspondents' Dinner, when you answered t=
he question before, you said "ducking the room." Were you referring to Mr=
. Trump in that?



MR. EARNEST: No, I was just suggesting that --



Q Or generally anybody who doesnt show up.



MR. EARNEST: Even people who dont show up are not necessarily guaranteed =
to be spared from some good-natured ribbing by the President of the Unite=
d States or by anybody else who speaks tomorrow night.

 Q And just one other thing. The Invictus Games -- there's a video going =
around. Did the Royal Family ask -- how did that come about, I guess is t=
he question that some folks want to know.



MR. EARNEST: Well, the Invictus Games is obviously an international compe=
tition by our men and women in uniform. And there's a friendly rivalry be=
tween the United States and our allies in the United Kingdom. And the off=
ices of the President and First Lady coordinated closely with the Royal F=
amily to tape these videos and to organize this effort to show their supp=
ort for our citizens who will be competing in those games.



Q And there was what be called some transatlantic trash-talking involved =
-- (laughter) -- where the Obamas said, "Bring it on," or something to th=
at effect. And the Queen's response was, "Oh, please," or something like =
that. What is their response?



MR. EARNEST: (Laughter.) I was going to say, that was quite a reenactment=
 there, Ron.=20



Q I spent a lot of time on it.



MR. EARNEST: I encourage everybody to go take a look at the video.=20



Q The "Oh, please," from the Queen -- what is the -- you're not frightene=
d by that, I guess.



MR. EARNEST: Not frightened at all. This is just an attempt to show our s=
trong support for the American and British heroes who will be participati=
ng in the Invictus Games. And obviously -- I guess no pun intended -- the=
 Queen was a good sport about it. And so people should check out the vide=
o. But obviously, this is a competition to really highlight the service a=
nd sacrifice of the best that the United States has to offer, and its als=
o the best that our allies in the UK have to offer. And it should be a gr=
eat set of games. Theyre hosted next weekend in Orlando, Florida.



Q Is he going to make fun of the Queen during the dinner?



MR. EARNEST: I doubt it. She probably does spare some ridicule by not att=
ending the dinner.=20



Angela.



Q Thanks, Josh. You said that the President has been briefed on the repor=
t about the accidental hospital bombing. You mentioned yesterday that he =
might read the entire report. Do you know if he plans to do that?



MR. EARNEST: I dont know whether or not he plans to read the entire repor=
t. I know that he hasnt so far, but he was briefed on the details of the =
report earlier today.



Q And has he or does he plan to reach out to anybody within Doctors Witho=
ut Borders now that the report has been released?



MR. EARNEST: Youll recall the President did have an opportunity to speak =
to one of the leaders of that organization shortly after this incident oc=
curred. I know that the Department of Defense, including General Votel, t=
he newly installed commander of Central Command, has been in touch with s=
enior officials at MSF to discuss the report.=20



At this point, Im not sure and I dont know of any planned phone calls fro=
m the President to MSF officials at this point.



Q And then on one other topic, the Supreme Court this morning declined to=
 block Texass voter ID law. The President has talked frequently about vot=
er access this year. Whats his reaction to that action by the Supreme Cou=
rt?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I didnt see the announcement from the Supreme Court. T=
he President has expressed his significant concern with politically motiv=
ated efforts to make it harder for people to vote. As the President obser=
ved I believe at this podium yesterday, the United States is the only gen=
uine democracy in the world that actually makes it harder for its citizen=
s to vote than it should be. And theres increasing evidence to indicate t=
hat Republicans engage in these kinds of tactics to make it harder for pe=
ople to vote because they perceive a political interest in doing so. They=
 somehow believe that if fewer people vote, that thats good for Republica=
ns. Its not exactly a motto to be proud of, I dont think.=20



And so the President obviously believes that when cities and states, and =
even the federal government, are considering voting laws, that they shoul=
d do so with an eye toward making it easier and more convenient for citiz=
ens who are registered to vote. And thats a principle that hes going to k=
eep fighting for. But its hard for me to comment directly on a Supreme Co=
urt decision without having seen.



Kevin.



Q Thanks, Josh. Does the President support the idea that some of the wome=
n and men who are involved in the accident in Afghanistan should in fact =
lose their jobs?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, Im not in a position to comment specifically on=
 the accountability measures that were announced by the Department of Def=
ense. As the Commander-in-Chief, and as the spokesman for the Commander-i=
n-Chief, I need to avoid even the appearance of any potential undue comma=
nd influence.



So the President was clear that an objective accounting of the facts and =
circumstances of this tragedy needed to be brought forward, and thats wha=
t the Department of Defense did. And commanders at the Department of Defe=
nse took a look at the evidence, they took a look at the report, and they=
 made a decision about the appropriate accountability measures to be impo=
sed. But Id refer you to the Department of Defense to speak to those.



Q But just to put a fine point on it, the President would support their d=
ecision should those commanders decide to relieve someone of duty?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I just cant speak in any detail about the speci=
fic accountability measures that have been imposed or any potential accou=
ntability measures that could be announced at a later date. This is somet=
hing that was decided by the Department of Defense.=20



But what I can tell you is that the report that was made public today by =
the Department of Defense is consistent with the Presidents expectations =
about the need for a thorough, transparent and objective accounting of th=
e facts.



Q Can I ask you about smart guns? The federal government, from my researc=
h, is still the largest purchaser of weapons in the United States. Is thi=
s an area where the President would like to get more smart guns in the ha=
nds of the federal government and make that part of his mandate to push f=
orward this technology?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, earlier today, the White House actually did ann=
ounce the moving forward on an executive action that the President announ=
ced actually early this year. And this is an executive action that would =
essentially allow law enforcement officials at the Department of Justice =
and the Department of Homeland Security to begin developing guidelines an=
d standards for smart gun technology.



And the idea is there are a set of standards and guidelines that can be d=
eveloped that would ensure that smart gun technology could effectively be=
 used by law enforcement officers. And the idea is that, yes, the federal=
 government is a bulk purchaser of firearms, and so it does raise questio=
ns about that potential. But that is not the announcement that we made to=
day.



The announcement that we made today was this question about specific guid=
elines and standards, and whether or not those could be developed consist=
ent with the needs of law enforcement officials.



Q How concerned is the President about the notion from some gun owners th=
at this is yet another intrusion by the federal government to try to get =
regular, law-abiding gun purchasers and gun owners to purchase a technolo=
gy that theyre not interested in, which is, somehow mandate this in the f=
uture?



MR. EARNEST: I think this is consistent with the kind of wild-eyed conspi=
racy theories that weve heard on this issue for years now. I think what i=
s true is I couldnt think of another industry off the top of my head that=
 isnt interested in looking at new technology that could make their produ=
ct safer. Just about every other industry that I can think of, thats what=
 people do. Thats what manufacturers do. That is a source of innovation i=
n a variety of fields.



I think the best example of this is in the auto industry. Auto manufactur=
ers actually market the degree to which they use new technology to make t=
heir products safer, to make cars and trucks safer. And it is surprising =
to me that so many gun manufacturers shirk that responsibility.



I think one of the other questions that can be answered by this effort to=
 try to devise a set of standards and guidelines is whether or not a mark=
et would emerge for a gun manufacturer that deploys smart gun technology.=
 Is there a manufacturer that comes forward and says, hey, I can adopt th=
ose standards that the federal government has said would be consistent wi=
th the needs of law enforcement officials and maybe I can make some money=
 by marketing to people who are interested in actually being safer, but a=
ll of that is an open question and a question that will ultimately be det=
ermined by the free market. But it certainly is a question that's been an=
swered in the affirmative by the free market in just about every other pr=
oduct imaginable.



 Q Lastly, let me ask you about Puerto Rico. You and I spoke yesterday ab=
out the ticking of the clock. May 1st is around the corner now. Can you d=
iscuss the restructuring of the debt effort that is ongoing for Puerto Ri=
co and the possibility that American taxpayers can end up having to if no=
t be on the hook for the problems there, responsible for trying to mitiga=
te the damage?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the problem right now, Kevin, is that the government =
of Puerto Rico does not have the authority that they need to effectively =
restructure their debt. The kind of authority that the federal government=
 has proposed giving the Puerto Rican government is the kind of restructu=
ring authority that's available to cities all across the country. So this=
 is not a strategy that had to be designed from scratch -- there's a temp=
late for giving the government the authority that they need -- the local =
government the authority that they need to restructure their debt.=20



 Now, what's also true is the Obama administration, at least, is interest=
ed in making sure that that restructuring authority is paired with a comm=
itment on the part of the Puerto Rican government to implement long-overd=
ue economic, financial and fiscal reforms. And we should write into the l=
aw oversight that ensures the Puerto Rican government makes good on their=
 commitment to implement those reforms.



 Q So where are we in the process then? Because May 1st is around the cor=
ner.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, where we are in the process is that now for 191 days =
we've seen Republicans in Congress fail to act on the common-sense propos=
al that the administration put forward back on October 21st. And that del=
ay has allowed the situation in Puerto Rico to only get worse. And that's=
 why the case that I've made is that Republicans who are falsely suggesti=
ng that the proposal that I've outlined is a bailout. That's wrong; it's =
not a bailout. But the more they delay, and the more that Republicans dra=
g their feet, the more likely it is that a bailout becomes the only optio=
n. So it's irresponsible for Republicans to be handling this in the way t=
hat they have thus far. Frankly, their false accusations only further gum=
 up the process in a way that makes the worst possible outcome even more =
likely.



 Q Any chance that there will be work on this over the weekend? Because b=
etween now and Monday, something has got to give.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there have been extensive conversations a=
lready between administration officials, mostly at the Treasury Departmen=
t, and officials on Capitol Hill. Obviously Puerto Rican officials have b=
een involved in this, too. Look, this is an island that is inhabited by 3=
 million Americans, and these are American citizens who are increasingly =
at risk because of the dire fiscal situation of the local government.



 So this is where Congress has to step in and act, show some leadership, =
and act in a way that is not just in the best interest of the Americans i=
n Puerto Rico, but actually act in the best interests of the 300 million =
Americans that live here on the mainland to make sure we're not on the ho=
ok for bailing out Puerto Rico.



 Mark.



 Q Josh, have the Russians ever responded to the U.S. complaint about the=
 buzzing of the U.S. naval vessel?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't know how the Russians responded to the concerns tha=
t were expressed by our military attach.



 Q Never responded?



 MR. EARNEST: I just don't know whether or not, or how the Russians commu=
nicated or responded to the concerns that we raised. But obviously those =
concerns were raised by the military attach at the U.S. embassy in Moscow=
 to his military counterpart.



 Q Do you know if there was another complaint after the incident with a U=
.S. reconnaissance plane?



 MR. EARNEST: I do not know whether or not additional concerns were raise=
d about that incident, but you could check with the Department of Defense=
 about that.



 Q Also, I saw that there's a movie coming out about the Obamas' first da=
te. Do you know whether the President and First Lady have cooperated in t=
he making of that movie?



 MR. EARNEST: I've read a little bit of the news coverage about this. It =
was a couple of months ago that I first saw the first story about it. I'm=
 not aware of any cooperation on the part of the White House or the Obama=
 family in the making of that movie, but I do know that the President and=
 the First Lady have heard of the movie. I don't know if they've seen it.=




 Q You don't know. Could you find out?



 MR. EARNEST: I'll look into it.



 Margaret.



 Q Josh, apologies if you talked about this at the beginning. On Afghanis=
tan, with this incident in Kunduz, there was a reference at the briefing =
at the Pentagon that there was some combat fatigue that played a role in =
all this. And it made me wonder if the White House has any timeline or an=
y update on when you're going to move from that 9,800 down to 5,500 U.S. =
troops.



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have an update on our troop posture at this point. =
Obviously the President has laid out a strategy, one that he spoke about =
as recently as the end of last year. And the strategy that he's laid out =
is consistent with the recommendations that he's received from our milita=
ry leaders, both here in Washington and on the ground in Afghanistan.=20



Our men and women in uniform have two missions. The first is continuing t=
o fight terrorism. We know there are extremist elements that could be try=
ing to use the chaos in Afghanistan as cover to establish a safe haven th=
ere. We want to make sure that they're not able to do that. But in additi=
on to that, our military servicemembers are also providing some advice an=
d assistance to Afghan security forces whose capacity is only improving.



 So those dual missions will continue, and I don't have any update at thi=
s point about whether or not a change in our posture is imminent.



 Q Is it fair to say that the troop position is still under review as is =
the consideration of allowing U.S. troops more of what their requesting, =
in terms of leeway to engage on the battlefield?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, what the President has said about this is that it is =
important for the broader strategic decisions that are made about things =
like force posture to be influenced, at least, by conditions on the groun=
d. We need to be mindful of what's happening on the ground, even as we ar=
e making higher-level strategic decisions. That certainly is why the Comm=
ander-in-Chief gets regular updates from his military and civilian leader=
ship at the Department of Defense about what's happening in Afghanistan.



 He understands that as he's setting the broader strategic direction, it =
needs to reflect the changing situation on the ground. At this point, I'm=
 not aware of any changes that are being contemplated with respect to the=
 mission that our men and women in uniform are fulfilling.



 Q On Syria, I wanted to ask you, some of the friendly groups to the U.S.=
, rebel groups have come out and really strongly hit back, saying why isn=
't the White House condemning specifically the Russian build-up around Al=
eppo and the regime's -- what they believe were regime strikes on medical=
 personnel and hospitals, believing that it is, to them, obvious who did =
it, and wondering why the White House isn't condemning it, saying that th=
at makes you complicit in allowing this sort of thing to continue to happ=
en.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that this particular incident about --=
 I'm referring to the MSF facility in Syria -- was not the result of any =
action taken by the United States or our coalition partners. I noted yest=
erday that the tactics used in that incident were consistent with tactics=
 that we've seen used by the Assad regime in other parts of the country.



 But at this point, I'm not aware of any analysis that has concluded defi=
nitively that the Assad regime or associated forces are directly responsi=
ble. But like I said, the early evidence that is already available indica=
tes that it is quite similar to the tactics that have been used by the As=
sad regime in other places.



 And this administration, from the President on down, have repeatedly and=
 forcefully condemned the immoral tactics of the Assad regime. We've note=
d that this blood-thirsty dictator has time and time again used the milit=
ary might of that nation to attack innocent citizens. That is, in fact, w=
hy the Obama administration believes that he has lost the legitimacy to l=
ead that country. And it's why we believe a political transition is neces=
sary to try to bring an end to the chaos, and to try to address the serie=
s of consequences that have stemmed from President Bashar al-Assad's fail=
ed political leadership.



 Q But the opposition sees that hedging as a defense of a broken peace an=
d a desperate attempt to save a faltering -- didn't really even get start=
ed -- a peace process here, saying that this is some political theater; c=
all it what it is and say directly what it is. How do you put that concer=
n to rest?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I would say is simply that the observati=
ons that we have made are based on available information and available ev=
idence. And there's no denying that the United States of America has, on =
a variety of occasions, starting at the level of the President on down, h=
as repeatedly and forcefully condemned the attacks that the Assad regime =
has launched against innocent civilians.=20



What's also true is that this administration has made reaching a politica=
l settlement and a political transition inside of Syria a top priority. T=
here's no military solution that can be imposed successfully on Syria. Th=
e way to resolve the chaos in that country --



Q What if the Russians dont believe that?=20



MR. EARNEST: Well, actually, the Russians themselves have acknowledged th=
at a political transition is necessary. They've indicated that they share=
 that view. And what we have challenged the Russians to do is to use thei=
r influence with the Assad regime to get them to participate on those tal=
ks more constructively. And look, the fact that those talks convened, and=
 the fact that there was, at least for several weeks, a cessation of host=
ilities that largely held, was a testament to the efforts of the United S=
tates and our ability to persuade the Russians to influence the Assad reg=
ime.=20



So this is a strategy that has shown at least a little glimmer of progres=
s, a glimmer of hope. And that's why the administration continues to push=
. That's why you see the dogged engagement of Secretary Kerry in this eff=
ort. His repeated calls to Foreign Minister Lavrov and other participants=
 in these talks are an indication that we're trying to capitalize on a ve=
ry, very narrow opening. Because, as the President observed during his tr=
ip last week, all the options in Syria are bad. There are no good options=
 there.=20



So we might as be focused on the one thing that we know can address the w=
ide array of problems in that country, and that is seeking a political tr=
ansition that would bring leadership to Syria that reflects the will and =
ambition of the Syrian people, that can unite that country, that can rest=
ore some order, that can be a partner of the United States and our coalit=
ion partners to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and begin to try to =
govern that country once again. This is long-term goal. It's not going to=
 happen overnight. And there will be lots of starts and stops to try to a=
chieve that end.



But that is the path that we're trying to carve out. And it's painstaking=
 work, and it is -- goodness knows it's frustrating. But that is the path=
 to an outcome that reflects the best interest of the United States, and =
the path to an outcome that reflects the best way to resolve a conflict t=
hat has contributed to tensions in an already volatile part of the world.=




Q So this isnt a failure to confront on the part of the U.S. in an attemp=
t to rescue what remains a hopeful idea but not a real political process =
at this point?



MR. EARNEST: Well, again, the United States has willingly and forcefully =
condemned the immoral and bloodthirsty actions of the Assad regime. They =
have repeatedly used grotesque military tactics to attack innocent men, w=
omen and children. And we have forcefully condemned those actions more ti=
mes than I can count.



And yes, the United States has been focused on trying to bring along poli=
tical talks -- and not because it's easy, but because we recognize that p=
olitical talks are the best path to resolving the chaos and turmoil and v=
iolence inside of Syria.=20



Q And lastly, on North Korea. Is the U.S. open to doing what they've done=
 in the past and perhaps entertain the idea of sending an envoy to bring =
back the two Americans who are now in prison there, one of them sentenced=
 today?



MR. EARNEST: Well, what we have said, particularly as it relates to Mr. W=
armbier, the college student who was detained in North Korea back in Janu=
ary, is we've called on the North Korean government to release him on hum=
anitarian grounds so that he can be reunited with his family. Our engagem=
ent with the North Koreans has been through the Swedish government. The S=
wedes are our protecting power in North Korea, and we're going to continu=
e to work through Swedish diplomats to secure the release of these Americ=
an citizens.



Q But as for sentencing today, can you say anything about that?



MR. EARNEST: As for the sentencing today, I dont have much to say about i=
t. We continue to go to great lengths to try bring home Americans that we=
 believe are wrongfully held around the world. And those efforts will con=
tinue, and those efforts in North Korea are done through our Swedish prot=
ecting power there.



John.



Q Talking about the Zika funding, the bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, it i=
ncreased discretionary caps -- $80 billion over two years, including non-=
defense discretionary spending, about $40 billion over the next fiscal ye=
ar. Does that money give the administration any flexibility to work with =
appropriators to try to come up with a way to fund the emergency for Zika=
?=20



MR. EARNEST: Well, I'm certainly no expert when it comes to the intricaci=
es of the congressional budget process. What I do know, and what requires=
 no expertise to include, is that the budget process that's being run by =
Republicans in the House and Senate right now is totally broken. The pros=
pects of any sort of budget agreement, even by the strong Republican majo=
rities in the House and Senate, are basically nil -- which is why it is t=
otally irresponsible for Republicans to suggest that this broken budget p=
rocess should be pursued to meet an urgent need. Our public health profes=
sionals have called this a public health emergency. It has prompted an em=
ergency response by the CDC and the NIH and other public health professio=
nals all across the country. And it's time for Congress to treat it accor=
dingly.=20



Democrats in Congress are certainly committed to addressing this emergenc=
y, but Republicans arent. And, frankly, I dont know why. I dont know what=
 their explanation is. There's no -- it's not as if the Zika virus only a=
ffects Democrats. Pregnant women in both parties are affected by the Zika=
 virus and are at risk. Its time for Congress to do something to protect =
them.=20



And every day that goes by that Republicans in Congress fail to act is an=
other day lost to our efforts to prepare for this emergency. And thats th=
e subject of intense disappointment. And it is highly irresponsible, and =
I dont know how Republicans who are in the majority in Congress right now=
 are going to explain that to their constituents as they spend the next 1=
0 days not in Congress.



So I dont know if these members of Congress are planning a vacation or if=
 theyre planning town hall meetings, but I suspect theyre going to get so=
me pretty direct questions from their constituents asking them why they h=
avent done anything to address a public health emergency. And I suspect t=
hat Republicans at some point later this summer, when the television netw=
orks and the newspapers are warning of this public health crisis, the Rep=
ublicans themselves are going to be wondering why they didnt do something=
 earlier. And I dont know what the answer to that question will be, eithe=
r.



Q And then quickly on the White House Correspondents Dinner. In 2011, the=
 President really went after Donald Trump, but since then hes said that t=
he rhetoric hes using is dangerous and it's making our allies nervous. Is=
 Donald Trump still a laughing matter? Can he still prove to be the butt =
of jokes at the dinner this weekend?



MR. EARNEST: Tune in on Saturday night and well all find out.=20



Q And Bernie Sanders is the only presidential candidate that will be in a=
ttendance. You said before that he would be going after his adversaries, =
but do you expect Democrats to also be on the receiving end?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I know that the President will certainly poke a little=
 fun at himself, and I suspect a little good-natured ribbing of his frien=
ds will occur as well.



Q Okay. Lastly, after the party, is the President planning any sort of af=
ter-party here at the White House with his friends and supporters?



MR. EARNEST: Not that Im aware of, but that would be a pretty hot ticket =
if he were, wouldnt it?



John, in the back.



Q Thanks, Josh. Ive noticed on Donald Trump a reluctance -- especially on=
 Wednesday I noticed you wouldnt say his name. Look back and it seems to =
be a pattern. And when asked about some of his proposals and pronouncemen=
ts, you talk about the Presidents record, especially on foreign policy. W=
hy is that? And as he moves closer to being the nominee, will the White H=
ouse have to change that approach?



MR. EARNEST: Well, look, over the course of the last nine months or so, I=
ve been asked frequently about presidential candidates in both parties. A=
nd I think Ive been pretty candid about the fact that there are some oppo=
rtunities that Ive taken to weigh on that debate, but mostly Ive tried to=
 stay out of it.



And I think as the general election advances, Im going to try to fulfill =
what responsibilities I have here, which is to obviously help all of you =
understand exactly whats happening at the White House, but also to be an =
advocate for the Presidents policies and the Presidents values and the Pr=
esidents priorities. That will be the subject of some debate in the gener=
al election.=20



And so I anticipate that Ill be asked about what some of the other candid=
ates have to say about it. And that will be a -- Ill have to make some st=
rategic decisions about how to most effectively make the case for the Pre=
sident. Obviously the President himself is going to be out there making h=
is case too, and hell do that here at the White House but also as he trav=
els across the country. And its going to be an interesting fall, I suspec=
t.



Q And on Zika, Senator Blunt says the Zika gang in the Senate, theyre try=
ing to produce something that can move to final passage.



MR. EARNEST: Is Zika gang a thing now?=20



Q Im giving it a shot.=20



MR. EARNEST: There you go. I imagine they all have, like, black leather j=
ackets and maybe a certain color of bandana or something. Hey, man, were =
the Zika gang. Its got a good ring to it.



Q They're trying to produce something. (Laughter.)=20



MR. EARNEST: Maybe it should be. Ill call Cody and let him know we have s=
ome edits.



Q So Senator Blunt says theyre trying to produce something that can get t=
o final passage in both chambers and the Presidents desk. Senator Graham,=
 yesterday, whos part of the gang, mentioned possibly offsetting the fund=
s, whatever additional funds that they might come up with. Is the White H=
ouse open to some offsets, some or all of it? And might that be a way to =
pass it with a majority of the majority in the House?



MR. EARNEST: Well, look, I dont want to prejudge the process. What I will=
 say is the process has already been delayed for too long by Republicans =
who have not recognized that this needs to be a priority.=20



One of the reasons that emergency funding is typically not offset is that=
 funding bills can often get bogged down in debates about the pay-fors. T=
he essence of an emergency is that Congress should act quickly. So what w=
e would like to see is Congress to act quickly, to act consistent with th=
e urgent needs that our public health professionals say exist.=20



So if there were a way to design a package that had strong bipartisan sup=
port that could be quickly and easily resolved that included pay-fors, I =
wouldnt rule that out of hand. But given how long it has taken to just di=
scuss the funding in and of itself, I find it hard to imagine a scenario =
in which there isnt a protracted debate about the pay-fors. That protract=
ed debate at this point is frankly not something that we can afford.



The fact is there is no debating among scientists that Congress needs to =
act urgently so that we can prepare for this emergency. But Republicans i=
n Congress have failed to do it, and were going to continue to make the c=
ase that they should.



Dave.



Q Thanks, Josh. On the Garland nomination with these progressive groups s=
tarting a campaign this weekend to push for the hearing, nine states they=
've planned in nine days. I wanted to talk a little bit about --



 MR. EARNEST: I guess they're calling it the 9-9-9 plan, huh?



 Q And speaking of the congressional delays, you've been speaking about -=
-



 MR. EARNEST: It has a little ring to it, doesn't it?



 Q It does. It's going on seven weeks since the President made this nomin=
ation. It doesn't appear like you're any closer to a hearing. And the con=
gressional calendar, you might call it less than robust for the rest of t=
he year. Do you view this campaign coming up as the last best shot you've=
 got at getting a hearing?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, no, not necessarily. Look, I think we've made a force=
ful case for why Chief Judge Garland deserves to be treated fairly by the=
 Senate. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility to offer their ad=
vice and consent of a presidential nominee.



 President Obama has taken that advise and consent responsibility quite s=
eriously. The President conducted extensive negotiations and conversation=
s with members of Congress prior to putting Chief Judge Garland's name fo=
rward. And it's not a coincidence that the President actually nominated s=
omebody that even leading Republicans have described as a consensus nomin=
ee.



 Chief Judge Garland is somebody who has served on the second-highest cou=
rt in the land for 19 years. He's got more federal judicial experience th=
an any other Supreme Court nominee in American history. He is an individu=
al who spent his life in public service. He is somebody who has demonstra=
ted that he understands that a judge should interpret the law, not advanc=
e a political agenda.



 That's why it's particularly disappointing that somebody with a set of c=
redentials and experience like this is being treated so unfairly by Repub=
licans in the Senate. So we're going to continue to press upon Republican=
s and make the case that they should do what every other Supreme Court no=
minee since *1975[1875] has gotten, which is a hearing and/or a vote. Tho=
se are just the facts.



 And those arguments have gotten some traction. Certainly there's ample p=
ublic evidence to indicate that Republicans' political standing has suffe=
red as a result of the unreasonable position they've taken with respect t=
o Chief Judge Garland's nomination. I saw some polling just yesterday tha=
t the approval rating of the Republican Party as a whole is as low as it =
has been since I was in high school. This is despite the fact that there =
are strong Republican majorities in the House and Senate in Congress.=20



I think that's an indication that people aren't particularly pleased in e=
ither party by the way that Republican leaders in Washington, D.C. have h=
andled the people's business. I think in many cases they've refused to ha=
ndle the people's business. They've refused to move on emergency funding =
for Zika. They've refused to consider restructuring authority for Puerto =
Rico, despite the dire financial situation there. They've refused to even=
 give a hearing, let alone a vote, to the President's consensus Supreme C=
ourt nominee -- consensus is a word that is often used by Republicans -- =
to say nothing of the budget process that Republicans have previously des=
cribed as critically important and a basic function of Congress, but yet =
we've seen that process utterly break down in both the House and the Sena=
te.



 So there are some difficult questions for Republicans to answer. And cer=
tainly moving forward with fair consideration of the President's Supreme =
Court nominee is one way that Republicans could try to restore confidence=
 in their ability to do the simplest, most basic thing. This is a respons=
ibility to consider these Supreme Court nominees, it's a responsibility t=
hat's outlined in the Constitution.=20



And the President could have chosen somebody who is outside the mainstrea=
m, somebody who is a strong progressive that has political views that are=
 far different than any Republican senator. But that's not what he's done=
. He's actually chosen somebody that even Republicans have described as a=
 consensus nominee; somebody that's demonstrated time and time again that=
 he has what it takes to serve on the Supreme Court.=20



In fact, I made note of an op-ed that was written by Ted Olson today. Ted=
 Olson is certainly no liberal. Hes a conservative, and a widely respecte=
d legal mind, frankly on both sides of the aisle. But his conservative cr=
edentials are well-known. He wrote, By temperament, character and qualifi=
cations, Judge Garland is precisely the kind of jurist we want on the Sup=
reme Court. For Republicans, there is much to recommend giving Mr. Garlan=
d a good look, a respectful hearing, and a vote on the merits. Thats a co=
nservative lawyer whos making that argument.



So this is an argument thats gotten traction. And I think the pressure on=
 Republicans who refuse to do their job is only going to increase.



Q Given the calendar realities, arent they succeeding in running out the =
clock on you guys?



MR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think it is clear that they are stalling, that=
 they arent doing their jobs, and theyre hoping that no one will notice. =
I think, unfortunately, theyre going to be wrong about that. If they want=
ed to reverse course, theres still ample time for them to do so. There is=
 no reason that Republicans couldnt act quickly to schedule a hearing, pu=
t Chief Judge Garland through his paces.



Again, Im not expecting that -- Im not suggesting or in any way expecting=
 that Chief Judge Garland should get a pass. He should just get what ever=
y other Supreme Court nominee has gotten since 1875, and thats a fair hea=
ring, a tough hearing. Every year since television was invented, those Su=
preme Court justices have gone on in front of the cameras to answer quest=
ions under oath, and those are tough questions that theyve gotten from se=
nators on both the right and the left.



Thats all were asking for Chief Judge Garland to get. And I think the rea=
son that Republicans dont want to give him that venue is theyre concerned=
 that hes going to actually perform well in that venue. And thats the rea=
son that they dont even want to invite that possibility. It would only se=
rve to increase pressure on them to confirm his nomination.



And were going to keep the pressure up. This is a powerful argument. And =
the effective functioning of our Supreme Court with the full complement o=
f justices depends on it. And thats an important thing because we know th=
at the Supreme Court has a rather full docket next term. And they should =
have a full complement of justices up there to consider it.



Let me see if Ive got a week ahead here and well try to move on. I dont k=
now if I have a week ahead in here. Do we not? Oh, I do. Look at this! Br=
ian Gabriel never lets me down. (Laughter.)=20



On Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.=20



On Tuesday, the President will honor the 2016 National Teacher of the Yea=
r and other finalists here at the White House. The President will thank t=
hem for their hard work and dedication each and every day in the classroo=
m.



On Wednesday, the President will travel to Flint, Michigan, to hear first=
hand from Flint residents about the public health crisis, receive an in-p=
erson briefing on the federal efforts that are in place to help respond t=
o the needs of the people of Flint, and deliver remarks to members of the=
 community. Additional details about the Presidents travel to Michigan wi=
ll be available in the coming days. That evening, the President will deli=
ver remarks at the Asia Pacific American Institute of Congressional Studi=
es 22nd annual awards gala dinner. Thats here in Washington.



On Thursday, the President will host a Cinco de Mayo reception at the Whi=
te House. In the afternoon, the President will be joined by the Vice Pres=
ident, First Lady and Dr. Biden to kick off the fifth anniversary of Join=
ing Forces and the 75th anniversary of the USO. The event thats called "A=
 Celebration of Service" will include nearly 1,500 servicemembers and the=
ir families.



On Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.=20



And then on Saturday, the President will deliver the commencement address=
 to the 2016 graduating class of Howard University here in Washington, D.=
C. As one of the nations top historically black colleges and universities=
, Howard University is recognized for its rigorous education and legacy o=
f building lasting bridges of opportunity for young people. And I know th=
e President is certainly looking forward to giving that speech next weeke=
nd.



So with all of that, have a great time this weekend, everybody. And well =
see you on Monday.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JANNEY:&nbsp; Hi, every=
one.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; I was going to tell you all to be seated, =
but I see you are already seated, so we can begin.&nbsp; Josh is out today.=
&nbsp; He has, I believe, it's a root canal.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Yes, h=
e has a root canal.&nbsp;
 But let's be honest, I'm better at this than he is anyway.&nbsp; Just betw=
een us.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I have two announcem=
ents and then I'll take questions.&nbsp; First, the President is still work=
ing on his jokes for the White House Correspondents' Dinner.&nbsp; I don't =
have any details on that other than he intends to be funny -- very
 funny.&nbsp; Okay, and second, it is Friday, which means at half-past five=
 I will be performing The Jackal in my office for anyone who is interested =
or remembers or cares.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now I'll take your quest=
ions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, Josh!&nbsp; You're back=
!<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; This is =
not your show anymore!<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JANNEY:&nbsp; Oh, my go=
sh!&nbsp; I'm so sorry.&nbsp; I just -- I was in town and I just wanted to =
take a moment.&nbsp; Totally, this is your office.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, yo=
u're standing at the podium, so you might as well use it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JANNEY:&nbsp; All right=
.&nbsp; In all seriousness -- what do you mean?&nbsp; This is just happenin=
g.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In all seriousness, my na=
me is Allison Janney and I am here today to draw attention to the opioid ep=
idemic and to celebrate those who are working to help others combat substan=
ce-use disorder.&nbsp; And I'm actually on
 a show now called &quot;Mom,&quot; which deals with people in recovery.&nb=
sp; And I'm here with my co-creator and executive producer, Chuck Lorre, wh=
o is -- this issue is very important to both of us.&nbsp; He's in the back =
there.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, here at the White Ho=
use, 10 individuals from across the country will be honored as White House =
Champions of Change.&nbsp; They've been selected from over 900 nominations =
for their leadership in preventing prescription drug abuse
 and heroin use, and for increasing access to treatment and to support thei=
r fellow Americans in recovery -- for supporting their fellow Americans in =
recovery.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a disease that can =
touch anybody, and all of us can help reduce drug abuse through evidence-ba=
sed treatment, prevention, and recovery.&nbsp; Research shows it works.&nbs=
p; And courageous Americans show it works every day.&nbsp; I'm so nervous
 I can't believe.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So thank you for the opportunity =
to be here today, and to highlight this important issue.&nbsp; And now I re=
turn the podium to its rightful owner, Josh.&nbsp; Thank you.<o:p></o:p></p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I a=
sk C.J. a question?&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JANNEY:&nbsp; Yes, sure=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is =
President Bartlett supporting in the Democratic Primary?&nbsp; (Laughter.)<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JANNEY:&nbsp; I think y=
ou know the answer to that question.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Thank yo=
u, Allison.&nbsp; Nice job.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. JANNEY:&nbsp; Thank you=
.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; You're w=
elcome to stay.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, w=
hen is the fun part?&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
was going to say, who says we don't have some fun around here?&nbsp; So, ob=
viously Allison thinks -- feels very passionately about the work that she's=
 spending some time here at the White House focused on today.&nbsp; And
 so we obviously owe her a debt of gratitude for really taking on this caus=
e and it's something that she passionately believes in.&nbsp; And we obviou=
sly are pleased that we can work with somebody who is as committed and as t=
alented as she is on something that's
 that important.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right, the fun stuff is=
 out of the way now.&nbsp; We can go back to our regular Friday afternoon b=
riefing.&nbsp; But we'll try to keep it short, Mark.&nbsp; I know you're re=
ady to start your weekend.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aren't =
we all?&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That is =
true.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen, do you want to st=
art?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, s=
ure.&nbsp; Well, I feel like a bit of a downer here.&nbsp; I wanted to ask =
about the report that came out on the helicopter attack on the hospital in =
Kunduz.&nbsp; I know you mentioned yesterday that the President planned to =
read it.&nbsp;
 I'm wondering if he's either been briefed or read it, and if he feels that=
 justice has been served in this case at this point, and if the appropriate=
 reforms and changes have been made.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ka=
thleen, you're right, this is a very serious topic.&nbsp; And it is certain=
ly a topic that the Commander-in-Chief has made a priority.&nbsp; The Unite=
d States goes to tremendous lengths to avoid civilian casualties.&nbsp; And
 when those casualties occur, as they did in this instance, the President c=
alled for a transparent, thorough, and objective accounting of what exactly=
 transpired.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you point out, this obje=
ctive accounting was put forward by the Department of Defense today.&nbsp; =
The President has been briefed on the report.&nbsp; The report is available=
 -- or at least a redacted, declassified version of the report is
 available on Central Command website, and that is consistent with the Pres=
ident's view of transparency.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report goes into some d=
etail about what exactly transpired.&nbsp; The conclusion of the investigat=
ion is that there were human error that causes tragedy.&nbsp; Now, that hum=
an error was compounded by systems and procedural failures.&nbsp; The
 Department of Defense has announced a set of steps that will be taken to p=
rovide accountability for those who were involved.&nbsp; The Department of =
Defense has also laid out some specific reforms moving forward that will pr=
event this kind of tragedy from occurring
 again in Afghanistan or anywhere else.&nbsp; And, again, all of this is co=
nsistent with the priority that President Obama places on avoiding civilian=
 casualties.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our adversaries certainly d=
on't go to these lengths.&nbsp; In some cases, our adversaries target civil=
ian populations.&nbsp; But these are the kinds of reforms that are consiste=
nt with our values as a country and are consistent with the priorities
 that are established by the Commander-in-Chief.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So some=
one looking at it at a distance, how exactly then does the President sort o=
f explain how something like this could happen, given all of these safeguar=
ds and assurances he gives about civilian casualties?&nbsp; That 42 people
 died in a hospital could be hit and there's no criminal charges filed, it'=
s just administrative punishment.&nbsp; How does explain the justice?<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, wh=
at the President called for from the beginning was a thorough, objective, a=
nd transparent accounting of what transpired.&nbsp; And that's what the Dep=
artment of Defense has put forward.&nbsp; This is an investigation that
 was conducted by military officers that were outside of the chain of comma=
nd.&nbsp; These were individuals -- the individuals who led this investigat=
ion are professional investigators, and they're individuals who are not inv=
olved in the incident.&nbsp; So they were
 able to provide an objective perspective on what transpired.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And obviously they've spent=
 months interviewing people who were involved, reviewing relevant facts and=
 material to understand exactly what happened, to understand exactly what l=
ed to the failures, including the human error that led
 to this tragedy.&nbsp; And based on their own working knowledge of how the=
se kinds of military operations are carried out, they made specific suggest=
ions for reforms that could be instituted to prevent something like this fr=
om happening again.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there's no denying that=
 what's occurred here is a genuine tragedy, and when this incident occurred=
, you heard the President and others express their profound sorrow at the l=
oss of innocent life, including individuals who had put
 themselves in harm's way to try to treat the wounds of innocent people cau=
ght in the crossfire.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So there are multiple dim=
ensions of this tragedy.&nbsp; And the significance and scale of what trans=
pired explains why such a detailed investigation has been conducted and mad=
e public.&nbsp; All of that is consistent with
 our values.&nbsp; It's consistent with the priorities that the President h=
as established.&nbsp; It's consistent with our commitment to avoiding civil=
ian casualties.&nbsp; And it's consistent with our values as a country.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, o=
n another topic.&nbsp; There seems to be a little bit of new momentum behin=
d the criminal justice reform effort on the Hill.&nbsp; I just thought I'd =
give you an opportunity to see whether (inaudible) you felt that momentum h=
ere
 or is there any prospects for this actually happening?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
know there was a bipartisan announcement that was made on Capitol Hill, I b=
elieve at the end of the day or at least yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; And wha=
t we have been saying for months is that the White House role has
 been to try to nurture and facilitate bipartisan cooperation on this issue=
 on Capitol Hill.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the bipartisan=
 interest in this legislation has been there at the beginning.&nbsp; Democr=
ats and Republicans observed that common-sense reforms to our criminal just=
ice system could not just save taxpayer dollars but it could
 actually make our communities safer, lower recidivism rates, and give thos=
e who have paid their debt to society a better chance at reentering America=
n life and making a substantive contribution to it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what we have done all al=
ong is to try to encourage both sides to continue to find common ground, to=
 present ideas for making that common ground more easily recognized, and th=
ere have been some strange bedfellows, given the context
 of these efforts.&nbsp; There have been representatives from conservative =
political organizations that had been interested in contributing to this ef=
fort as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think it does reflect =
that what is the subject of some debate is not necessarily something that s=
hould provoke a partisan or ideological objection, but rather a more common=
-sense, practical approach to recognizing the potential
 benefits of reforms like this.&nbsp; So, sometimes, that kind of pragmatic=
 approach gets drowned out by the partisanship and ideology and occasional =
histrionics that are endemic on Capitol Hill.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But in this case, we're g=
oing to continue to work with Democrats and Republicans to try to navigate =
those cross-currents and hopefully emerge on the other side with a genuine =
bipartisan reform bill that would have
 enormous positive consequences for our country.&nbsp; And the President id=
entified this as a top legislative priority of his last year, and we've bee=
n working since then to try to make it a reality.&nbsp; And I do anticipate=
 that the President will devote a significant
 portion of his eight months that remain here in office to getting this leg=
islation passed through Congress an onto his desk.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, there.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Syri=
a, there was the short-term truce announced earlier today, and it doesn&#82=
17;t seem like it addresses the fighting in Aleppo.&nbsp; So I wanted to se=
e what more information you could give us and what the plan is to address f=
ighting
 there.&nbsp; And also, are you confident that a date could be set for peac=
e talks to resume?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, le=
t's first talk about the agreement that was announced today.&nbsp; Since th=
e beginning of the cessation of hostilities, fighting has continued in the =
area of north Latakia and eastern Ghouta, putting armed opposition
 groups there and in other areas controlled by the opposition under pressur=
e.&nbsp; Persistent violations in this area are unacceptable and damaging.&=
nbsp; As a result, the U.S. government and Russia have been working to secu=
re a general recommitment to the cessation
 of hostilities by all parties in Latakia and eastern Ghouta to be implemen=
ted beginning at midnight tonight, Damascus time.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's our view that this ess=
entially would be a refreshment of the cessation of hostilities, and gettin=
g both sides to commit to refreshing the commitments that they made in the =
context of the cessation of hostilities could have potentially
 a catalyzing effect.&nbsp; And what we would like to see is a return to th=
e situation on the ground that prevailed a couple of weeks ago, which was n=
ot an all-out end to the fighting, but rather a broad acceptance of the ter=
ms of the cessation of hostilities.&nbsp;
 And that agreement was only possible because the United States and Russia =
used our influence with the relevant groups to bring about that agreement a=
nd that cessation of hostilities.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we acknowledged all alo=
ng that there were likely to be violations of the cessation of hostilities.=
&nbsp; But what's happened over the last week or so is that the frequency o=
f violations has increased, and that's been a source of significant
 concern.&nbsp; So our hope is that by refreshing this agreement, focusing =
our attention on these two particular areas, we can build momentum again to=
ward a broadly observed cessation of hostilities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And how=
 confident are you that this refreshment is going to help push forward thes=
e talks?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e thing that we know is that the opposite is true.&nbsp; The thing that we =
know is that the weakening of the cessation of hostilities, or the repeated=
 violations of the cessation of hostilities have tangibly undermined
 efforts to reach -- or at least to advance political talks.&nbsp; So the q=
uestion is, can we give some more momentum to those political talks by expa=
nding the area in Syria where the cessation of hostilities is once again ob=
served.&nbsp; And again, our goal of trying
 to refresh the cessation of hostilities is motivated by a desire to advanc=
e the political talks.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other benefit -- and th=
is is another important benefit of refreshed cessation of hostilities, part=
icularly in these two areas -- is it could create space for the delivery of=
 additional humanitarian relief.&nbsp; This part of Syria has
 been subject to quite intense fighting for a long time now.&nbsp; And ther=
e are communities and innocent people there that are suffering.&nbsp; And b=
ringing much-needed humanitarian relief in the form of food and water and m=
edicine could relieve, at least a little bit,
 so much of the widespread suffering that we've seen in that country.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On anot=
her topic, on the Korean Peninsula, China and Russia today said that they w=
anted the United States to back off its possible plan to put in an anti-mis=
sile defense system near South Korea.&nbsp; What's your reaction to that?<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e reaction to that is that the United States' commitment to South Korea's s=
ecurity is rock-solid.&nbsp; The Republic of Korea is a close ally of the U=
nited States, and that means the United States is prepared to invest
 resources in keeping them safe.&nbsp; We have seen repeated provocations, =
particularly in just the last few months, from North Korea, vowing to use t=
heir military might against our allies.&nbsp; And we've begun -- there alre=
ady has been a significant commitment of military
 firepower and manpower by the United States to defend South Korea.&nbsp; A=
nd the assessment of our military and national security experts is that add=
itional resources could be necessary to ensure the safety and security of t=
he Republic of Korea.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that's why the United =
States has engaged in conversations with our South Korean allies about depl=
oying what's called a THAAD battery.&nbsp; This is essentially a sophistica=
ted anti-ballistic missile system that would
 enhance our ally's security.&nbsp; Those discussions are ongoing.&nbsp; I'=
ll just point out that that equipment would be oriented toward the threat t=
hat is posed by North Korea, not oriented toward China or Russia.&nbsp; Tha=
t's been our contention all along, and those are
 the facts.&nbsp; And it's certainly changes in the environment, at least i=
n the behavior of the North Korea government, that is prompting this consid=
eration of increasing our posture on South Korea.&nbsp; It's not a result o=
f changes that are made by Russia or China.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So ta=
lks are ongoing with South Korea.&nbsp; Can you give us any sense of timing=
 or when you expect the talks to conclude?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&=
#8217;t have an updated sense of timing at this point.&nbsp; But obviously =
these conversations have been occurring for several weeks now.&nbsp; But I =
don&#8217;t have an announcement to make yet about a particular
 decision.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Michelle.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
s, Josh.&nbsp; More than once, China has now expressed its annoyance at thi=
s THAAD possibility.&nbsp; So if that's going to go through -- and you do e=
xpect that to be completed, is that right?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I wouldn&#8217;t prejudge the outcome.&nbsp; Obviously we would defer to th=
e preferences of our allies in South Korea about whether or not they would =
like to have this additional equipment located on their
 territory.&nbsp; The assessment of our military and national security expe=
rts is that it could be a good idea for them to do that.&nbsp; But ultimate=
ly, this is a sovereign country, and because they&#8217;re an ally of the U=
nited States, we&#8217;re looking for ways to help them.&nbsp;
 And this is one potential way we could offer some assistance to them and e=
nhance their security.&nbsp; But ultimately, they would make the final call=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a=
t this point, there&#8217;s no reason to think that that wouldn&#8217;t be =
completed, right?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I wouldn&#8217;t prejudge what the outcome here would be.&nbsp; I would jus=
t note that our officials have concluded it might be prudent, and we&#8217;=
ll have a conversation with the Koreans about that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.=
&nbsp; So if we already know that China is not happy about this, and they&#=
8217;ve expressed it more than once, if this does go through and that syste=
m is deployed there, is that going to affect China&#8217;s pressure
 on North Korea, which many feel is the only way to eventually get North Ko=
rea to change its behavior?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
it shouldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; Let me explain a couple reasons why.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The first is, of course, =
the THAAD battery would be oriented to the threat in North Korea, not orien=
ted to China in any way.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What =
if they don&#8217;t like it, though?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; They d=
on&#8217;t, but those are the facts.&nbsp; The second fact is that we alrea=
dy know that China is understandably concerned about the behavior of the No=
rth Korean government.&nbsp; These repeated provocations
 and violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions are destabilizing.&nbs=
p; And it&#8217;s not at all in China&#8217;s interest to have that kind of=
 destabilizing activity right on their doorstep.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the point is, China, u=
sing its influence on the North Korean government to get them to end their =
provocative acts, is not something that they do as a favor to the United St=
ates.&nbsp; They&#8217;re focused on getting North
 Korea to end their provocations is rooted in their own self-interest, whic=
h is that having all this provocative behavior and this conflict and this d=
estabilizing activity on their doorstep is not in their interest.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do yo=
u expect THAAD to affect the relationship between the U.S. and China in any=
 way, though?&nbsp; Or do you expect it to prompt China to, I don&#8217;t k=
now, keep on militarizing or militarizing faster the islands that
 the U.S. disagrees with?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I mean=
, obviously, there&#8217;s a reference to the situation on the South China =
Sea.&nbsp; That is obviously an entirely -- I mean, it is an entirely diffe=
rent part of the world, both literally and figuratively
 here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But d=
o you expect some tit for tat if this goes through?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I wouldn&#8217;t predict what the Chinese response would be, even if this i=
s something that were eventually decided.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think what I would say =
is that there&#8217;s an opportunity for the United States and China to wor=
k together -- and we have, effectively -- to increase the pressure on the N=
orth Korean government to change their behavior.&nbsp;
 We&#8217;ve ramped up the pressure, but thus far we have not seen the chan=
ge that we are both seeking.&nbsp; And as a result, we have felt that it&#8=
217;s necessary to begin at least talking to our allies in South Korea abou=
t enhancing their national security.&nbsp; But that is
 not going to in any way diminish our interest in trying to make the Korean=
 Peninsula more stable and less a source of tension in the region.<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.=
&nbsp; And looking at the way the campaigns are playing out, it was just a =
few days ago that Hillary Clinton&#8217;s communications director called Be=
rnie Sanders &#8220;destructive,&#8221; said that he&#8217;s not &#8220;pro=
ductive for
 Democrats, not productive for the country.&#8221;&nbsp; Does the President=
 feel like Democrats are united right now?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
obviously, we&#8217;re still in the midst of a primary.&nbsp; And obviously=
, the Democratic Party has been engaged in a competitive process.&nbsp; Tha=
t&#8217;s appropriate.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a way we can -- that&#8217;s the =
way the
 party can evaluate who the strongest candidate is.&nbsp; And obviously, th=
e party has a strong interest in choosing the strongest candidate to repres=
ent the party in the general election.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But these are decisions f=
or voters to make.&nbsp; And the President, as a voter, has cast a ballot, =
but has not weighed in publicly about who his preference is.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So at some point, I think=
 the President will make a strong case about the need for the Democratic Pa=
rty to come together in support of the policies that he&#8217;s fought so h=
ard to put in place.&nbsp; That will be a fundamental
 question in the election.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So yo=
u said multiple times that you welcome robust debate, this is just what hap=
pens with the election; it&#8217;s good for the country.&nbsp; But at the s=
ame time, we&#8217;ve heard the President say at a private event that
 Democrats really need to come together right now.&nbsp; So would you disag=
ree with words like that, that Sanders has been a destructive influence not=
 only on Democrats but on the country?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I&#8217;ve done my best to stay out of the middle of the debate between the=
 two Democratic candidates, and I&#8217;m going to try to do that in this c=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think what the Presiden=
t is focused on is ensuring that when the general election does roll around=
 -- and it hasn&#8217;t yet -- but when we get knee-deep in a general elect=
ion, it will be important for Democrats to
 keep in mind what their priorities are.&nbsp; And obviously, the President=
 has spent the better part of seven and a half years fighting for a set of =
priorities, and he&#8217;ll, I&#8217;m confident, make a case in the genera=
l election about the wisdom of continuing that fight.&nbsp;
 But the time for that part of the debate has not yet arrived.<o:p></o:p></=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Sa=

 side and the debate on the Republican side.&nbsp; Many Republicans have ma=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The President does enjoy =
this opportunity, that it is something -- the President, over the course of=
 eight years, has given thousands of speeches in public in one form or anot=
her.&nbsp; The vast majority of them are
 dealing with very serious topics.&nbsp; And this is one unique opportunity=
 that he has every year to poke a little fun at himself, poke a little fun =
at the process, maybe even poke a little fun at a political adversary or tw=
o, but it's also a reminder of how in
 one way or another, we all have a role to play in our democracy.&nbsp; And=
 obviously the President has an important role to set the agenda, but you a=
ll have an important role, too, to hold those in power accountable.&nbsp; A=

 and I'm confident that the President will acknowledge that in the serious =
portion of his speech because he believes in the value of professional, ind=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laura.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the =
President concerned about the protestors -- again last night, took the stre=
et, protesting Donald Trump?&nbsp; That's the first question.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, La=
ura, I think in general there is a long history of and a long tradition of =
protest in the American political system.&nbsp; In fact, this country was s=
tarted by a bunch of protestors, some of whom decided that they
 were pretty unhappy about taxes and threw some barrels of tea in the Bosto=
n Harbor.&nbsp; So there's a history of protest in this country.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the President believes=
 is that we also have a system of government, and there is an opportunity f=
or voters to make their voices heard at the ballot box.&nbsp; And there sho=
uld be a debate, and there should be a public debate.&nbsp; And
 that debate is likely to be filled with some emotion.&nbsp; These are seri=
ous issues that are being discussed.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So while people surely sh=
ould take advantage of the history and tradition in this country of engagin=
g in political protest, they need to do so with some respect for the system=
 and for our country and for our government,
 and to ensure that that protest isn't a source of violence, it doesn't inc=
ite violence.&nbsp; The protest should not be used to drown out the ability=
 of other people to participate in our political system or to participate i=
n the political debate.&nbsp; But there's
 a strong history of protest in this country -- that's a good thing.&nbsp; =
That's something we're proud of as Americans.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in =
a presidential election, outside the United States, the whole world now is =
watching with quite astonishment what's happening when Donald Trump is spea=
king.&nbsp; You don't think the President has a responsibility to do someth=
ing
 about the potential of violence, which is happening now each time Donald T=
rump is speaking?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'=
ll just say, as a general statement, the President has been outspoken on a =
number of occasions about how our political system, our form of politics in=
 the United States was geared toward resolving conflicts.&nbsp;
 This is a big, diverse country, and people are going to have different poi=
nts of view.&nbsp; And we resolve those differences not through violence, n=
ot by taking up arms against one another, not by questioning someone else's=
 patriotism or judging someone based
 on their religion or their color or who they are, but rather through our s=
ystem of government, where every citizen has an opportunity to cast a vote =
and make their voices heard at the ballot box.&nbsp; And that's how our sys=
tem of government was designed.&nbsp; And
 that's the way that it should work.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Dona=
ld Trump again.&nbsp; Yesterday in California, he was talking about his sol=
ution to fight ISIS, referring to General Pershing, and it was quite astoni=
shing also for a lot of foreign observers.&nbsp; And on NBC News, he was ta=
lking
 about the possibility to a nuclear ISIS.&nbsp; He said that he won't exclu=
de, if he is elected President, to use the nuclear weapon against ISIS.&nbs=
p; What's the White House reaction on that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'=
ll let all of you sort of conclude the wisdom of that kind of strategy.&nbs=
p; I think the President has been pretty clear about what our strategy is.&=
nbsp; And that is a strategy that is mindful of the need to protect the
 American people, and that our success in the effort to degrade and ultimat=
ely destroy ISIL is not unrelated to how those efforts are carried out.&nbs=
p;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, we make it a p=
riority in this country to avoid civilian casualties.&nbsp; That certainly =
is going to be a lot harder to do if you're using nuclear weapons, or advoc=
ating the use of nuclear weapons.&nbsp; In this country, we have
 made clear that people are included and not discriminated against just bec=
ause of their religion or what their name is, or how they may have entered =
the country, but rather they're judged based on their contributions to the =
country and their contributions
 to the political debate.&nbsp; And that's not just a reflection of our val=
ues, but our commitment to our values is also an important part of advancin=
g our interests around the world and protecting our national security.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don=
't see the need to quiet down the tone at this moment due to what's happeni=
ng -- the level of anger, frustration, and what's happening in this country=
?&nbsp; You don't think there's a responsibility to quiet down this tone?<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, there's a long history of tough political debate and protest in this c=
ountry.&nbsp; And, again, that kind of protest and debate was present at th=
e creation of our country.&nbsp; At the same time, leaders in both parties
 have a responsibility not to incite violence, not to promote discriminatio=
n, but rather to, even in the midst of tough political debates, remind us a=
ll that there's a whole lot more that we have in common than divides us.&nb=
sp; And that certainly has been part
 and parcel of the President's leadership style, even before he entered the=
 Oval Office.&nbsp; And that is a legacy -- certainly an aspect of his lega=
cy that President Obama is quite proud of.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I thin=

ough, and objective accounting that the President asked for.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There=

the Afghan government, wasn&#8217;t there?&nbsp; There were other investiga=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&=

about that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So wh=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Becaus=
e the President has confidence that the investigation that was conducted wa=
s objective.&nbsp; It was conducted by people who were not involved in the =
particular operation, and it was conducted --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These=
 are commanders, though.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, th=
e investigation was conducted by individuals who are not involved in the in=
vestigation.&nbsp; They were outside of the chain of command of those who w=
ere involved in the investigation.&nbsp; So that's
 why we would describe it as an objective investigation and an objective ac=
counting of what exactly transpired.&nbsp; What's also clear here, Ron, is =
that an investigation that includes suggestions for reforms needs to be con=
ducted by individuals that have their
 own working expertise of how U.S. military operations are conducted.&nbsp;=
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I understand sort of t=
he case that you're making for the benefits of an investigation that's cond=
ucted by someone outside of the United States military, but I think it's im=
portant that you don&#8217;t overlook the
 value of choosing somebody who understands how the U.S. military works, wh=
o understands how these kinds of operations are carried out, but is also so=
mebody who can be objective because they weren&#8217;t involved in the oper=
ation, they're not in the chain of the
 command with the individuals who were involved in the operation.&nbsp; The=
y're professional investigators, and they can put forward a clear rendering=
 of what transpired of what steps toward accountability should be taken and=
 what reforms should be implemented to
 prevent something like this from happening again. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This =
internationally renowned and respected organization does not think that thi=
s is justice when there are 42 people dead and there's no one held criminal=
ly responsible.&nbsp; How do you reconcile that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I reco=
ncile that by saying the United States goes to great lengths to avoid civil=
ian casualties.&nbsp; And when those casualties do occur as a result of hum=
an error that was compounded by systemic and procedural
 failures, the United States of America owns up to it.&nbsp; The United Sta=
tes of America conducts an independent investigation to determine what exac=
tly happened.&nbsp; The United States of America, consistent with our value=
s, is transparent about those failures.&nbsp; They're
 published on a website that all of you can see right now.&nbsp; We've owne=
d up to it.&nbsp; The individuals who were involved and do bear some accoun=
tability are held accountable.&nbsp; That's our system.&nbsp; And that is a=
 system that's consistent with our values.&nbsp; It's also
 a system that follows through on implementing reforms that makes something=
 like this much less likely to ever happen again.&nbsp; And that's what the=
 Commander-in-Chief asked for, and that's what he got.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anoth=
er thing I'd point out is that they believe this focus on intent is not a v=
alid answer to the question of responsibility in determining a crime or a w=
ar crime.&nbsp; Clearly, you don&#8217;t agree with that.&nbsp; But
 do you see the point, that this idea of intent is not -- it's the result, =
it's what happened -- and intent is not a way to essentially explain away s=
omeone's responsibility.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I thin=
k the passion that's evident in the arguments that are being made by MSF is=
 entirely understandable, and this is a tragedy.&nbsp; And this is an organ=
ization that does heroic work around the world.&nbsp;
 And in this case, some of the individuals that they employ, or at least su=
pport, were killed while they were trying to attend to wounds of innocent p=
eople who were injured in this conflict.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I think their response=
 is entirely human; one that's entirely understandable, one that's entirely=
 reasonable.&nbsp; But what's also true is that the investigation that was =
conducted by the Department of Defense is
 consistent with the orders they received from the Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp=
; And the American people and people around the world can go and decide for=
 themselves whether or not this investigation was serious.&nbsp; I think wh=
en you take a look at a report that extends
 beyond 100 pages, there's ample detail in there, and it does discuss what =
transpired and what steps could be taken to prevent these errors from happe=
ning somewhere else.&nbsp; And I think that's what the President has been f=
ocused on, even in the midst of this
 terrible tragedy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a =
much lighter note, the Correspondents' Dinner, when you answered the questi=

to Mr. Trump in that?<o:p></o:p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one other thing.&nbsp=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
the Invictus Games is obviously an international competition by our men and=

 the Supreme Court?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I didn&#8217;t see the announcement from the Supreme Court.&nbsp; The Presi=
dent has expressed his significant concern with politically motivated effor=
ts to make it harder for people to vote.&nbsp; As the President
 observed I believe at this podium yesterday, the United States is the only=
 genuine democracy in the world that actually makes it harder for its citiz=
ens to vote than it should be.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s increasing evidence =
to indicate that Republicans engage in these
 kinds of tactics to make it harder for people to vote because they perceiv=
e a political interest in doing so.&nbsp; They somehow believe that if fewe=
r people vote, that that&#8217;s good for Republicans.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not=
 exactly a motto to be proud of, I don&#8217;t think.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so the President obvi=
ously believes that when cities and states, and even the federal government=
, are considering voting laws, that they should do so with an eye toward ma=
king it easier and more convenient for
 citizens who are registered to vote.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s a principle th=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Kevin, earlier today, the White House actually did announce the moving forw=
ard on an executive action that the President announced actually early this=
 year.&nbsp; And this is an executive action that
 would essentially allow law enforcement officials at the Department of Jus=
tice and the Department of Homeland Security to begin developing guidelines=
 and standards for smart gun technology.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the idea is there are=
 a set of standards and guidelines that can be developed that would ensure =
that smart gun technology could effectively be used by law enforcement offi=
cers.&nbsp; And the idea is that, yes, the
 federal government is a bulk purchaser of firearms, and so it does raise q=
uestions about that potential.&nbsp; But that is not the announcement that =
we made today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The announcement that we =
made today was this question about specific guidelines and standards, and w=
hether or not those could be developed consistent with the needs of law enf=
orcement officials.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How c=
oncerned is the President about the notion from some gun owners that this i=
s yet another intrusion by the federal government to try to get regular, la=
w-abiding gun purchasers and gun owners to purchase
 a technology that they&#8217;re not interested in, which is, somehow manda=
te this in the future?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I thin=
k this is consistent with the kind of wild-eyed conspiracy theories that we=
&#8217;ve heard on this issue for years now.&nbsp; I think what is true is =
I couldn&#8217;t think of another industry off the top of
 my head that isn&#8217;t interested in looking at new technology that coul=
d make their product safer.&nbsp; Just about every other industry that I ca=
n think of, that&#8217;s what people do.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what manufactur=
ers do.&nbsp; That is a source of innovation in a variety of fields.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think the best example =
of this is in the auto industry.&nbsp; Auto manufacturers actually market t=
he degree to which they use new technology to make their products safer, to=
 make cars and trucks safer.&nbsp; And it is surprising
 to me that so many gun manufacturers shirk that responsibility.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think one of the other =
questions that can be answered by this effort to try to devise a set of sta=
ndards and guidelines is whether or not a market would emerge for a gun man=
ufacturer that deploys smart gun technology.&nbsp;
 Is there a manufacturer that comes forward and says, hey, I can adopt thos=
e standards that the federal government has said would be consistent with t=
he needs of law enforcement officials and maybe I can make some money by ma=
rketing to people who are interested
 in actually being safer, but all of that is an open question and a questio=
n that will ultimately be determined by the free market.&nbsp; But it certa=
inly is a question that's been answered in the affirmative by the free mark=
et in just about every other product
 imaginable.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly,=
 let me ask you about Puerto Rico.&nbsp; You and I spoke yesterday about th=
e ticking of the clock.&nbsp; May 1st is around the corner now.&nbsp; Can y=
ou discuss the restructuring of the debt effort that is ongoing for Puerto =
Rico and
 the possibility that American taxpayers can end up having to if not be on =
the hook for the problems there, responsible for trying to mitigate the dam=
age?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e problem right now, Kevin, is that the government of Puerto Rico does not =
have the authority that they need to effectively restructure their debt.&nb=
sp; The kind of authority that the federal government has proposed
 giving the Puerto Rican government is the kind of restructuring authority =
that's available to cities all across the country.&nbsp; So this is not a s=
trategy that had to be designed from scratch -- there's a template for givi=
ng the government the authority that
 they need -- the local government the authority that they need to restruct=
ure their debt.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, what's also true is th=
e Obama administration, at least, is interested in making sure that that re=
structuring authority is paired with a commitment on the part of the Puerto=
 Rican government to implement long-overdue economic,
 financial and fiscal reforms.&nbsp; And we should write into the law overs=
ight that ensures the Puerto Rican government makes good on their commitmen=
t to implement those reforms.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So wher=
e are we in the process then?&nbsp; Because May 1st is around the corner.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, wh=
ere we are in the process is that now for 191 days we've seen Republicans i=
n Congress fail to act on the common-sense proposal that the administration=
 put forward back on October 21st.&nbsp; And that delay has allowed
 the situation in Puerto Rico to only get worse.&nbsp; And that's why the c=
ase that I've made is that Republicans who are falsely suggesting that the =
proposal that I've outlined is a bailout.&nbsp; That's wrong; it's not a ba=
ilout.&nbsp; But the more they delay, and the more
 that Republicans drag their feet, the more likely it is that a bailout bec=
omes the only option.&nbsp; So it's irresponsible for Republicans to be han=
dling this in the way that they have thus far.&nbsp; Frankly, their false a=
ccusations only further gum up the process
 in a way that makes the worst possible outcome even more likely.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any cha=
nce that there will be work on this over the weekend?&nbsp; Because between=
 now and Monday, something has got to give.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
know that there have been extensive conversations already between administr=
ation officials, mostly at the Treasury Department, and officials on Capito=
l Hill.&nbsp; Obviously Puerto Rican officials have been involved
 in this, too.&nbsp; Look, this is an island that is inhabited by 3 million=
 Americans, and these are American citizens who are increasingly at risk be=
cause of the dire fiscal situation of the local government.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is where Congress h=
as to step in and act, show some leadership, and act in a way that is not j=
ust in the best interest of the Americans in Puerto Rico, but actually act =
in the best interests of the 300 million Americans that
 live here on the mainland to make sure we're not on the hook for bailing o=
ut Puerto Rico.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, h=
ave the Russians ever responded to the U.S. complaint about the buzzing of =
the U.S. naval vessel?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
know how the Russians responded to the concerns that were expressed by our =
military attach=E9.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never r=
esponded?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I just d=
on't know whether or not, or how the Russians communicated or responded to =
the concerns that we raised.&nbsp; But obviously those concerns were raised=
 by the military attach=E9 at the U.S. embassy in Moscow to his military
 counterpart.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you =
know if there was another complaint after the incident with a U.S. reconnai=
ssance plane?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I do not=
 know whether or not additional concerns were raised about that incident, b=
ut you could check with the Department of Defense about that.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I=
 saw that there's a movie coming out about the Obamas' first date.&nbsp; Do=
 you know whether the President and First Lady have cooperated in the makin=
g of that movie?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I've rea=
d a little bit of the news coverage about this.&nbsp; It was a couple of mo=
nths ago that I first saw the first story about it.&nbsp; I'm not aware of =
any cooperation on the part of the White House or the Obama family in
 the making of that movie, but I do know that the President and the First L=
ady have heard of the movie.&nbsp; I don't know if they've seen it.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don=
't know.&nbsp; Could you find out?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'll loo=
k into it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, a=
pologies if you talked about this at the beginning.&nbsp; On Afghanistan, w=
ith this incident in Kunduz, there was a reference at the briefing at the P=
entagon that there was some combat fatigue that played a role in all this.&=
nbsp;
 And it made me wonder if the White House has any timeline or any update on=
 when you're going to move from that 9,800 down to 5,500 U.S. troops.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have an update on our troop posture at this point.&nbsp; Obviously the Pres=
ident has laid out a strategy, one that he spoke about as recently as the e=
nd of last year.&nbsp; And the strategy that he's laid out is consistent
 with the recommendations that he's received from our military leaders, bot=
h here in Washington and on the ground in Afghanistan.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Our men and women in unif=
orm have two missions.&nbsp; The first is continuing to fight terrorism.&nb=
sp; We know there are extremist elements that could be trying to use the ch=
aos in Afghanistan as cover to establish a safe
 haven there.&nbsp; We want to make sure that they're not able to do that.&=
nbsp; But in addition to that, our military servicemembers are also providi=
ng some advice and assistance to Afghan security forces whose capacity is o=
nly improving.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So those dual missions will=
 continue, and I don't have any update at this point about whether or not a=
 change in our posture is imminent.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it f=
air to say that the troop position is still under review as is the consider=
ation of allowing U.S. troops more of what their requesting, in terms of le=
eway to engage on the battlefield?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, wh=
at the President has said about this is that it is important for the broade=
r strategic decisions that are made about things like force posture to be i=
nfluenced, at least, by conditions on the ground.&nbsp; We need
 to be mindful of what's happening on the ground, even as we are making hig=
her-level strategic decisions.&nbsp; That certainly is why the Commander-in=
-Chief gets regular updates from his military and civilian leadership at th=
e Department of Defense about what's
 happening in Afghanistan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He understands that as he's=
 setting the broader strategic direction, it needs to reflect the changing =
situation on the ground.&nbsp; At this point, I'm not aware of any changes =
that are being contemplated with respect to the mission that
 our men and women in uniform are fulfilling.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Syri=
a, I wanted to ask you, some of the friendly groups to the U.S., rebel grou=
ps have come out and really strongly hit back, saying why isn't the White H=
ouse condemning specifically the Russian build-up around Aleppo and the
 regime's -- what they believe were regime strikes on medical personnel and=
 hospitals, believing that it is, to them, obvious who did it, and wonderin=
g why the White House isn't condemning it, saying that that makes you compl=
icit in allowing this sort of thing
 to continue to happen.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
can tell you that this particular incident about -- I'm referring to the MS=
F facility in Syria -- was not the result of any action taken by the United=
 States or our coalition partners.&nbsp; I noted yesterday that
 the tactics used in that incident were consistent with tactics that we've =
seen used by the Assad regime in other parts of the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at this point, I'm not =
aware of any analysis that has concluded definitively that the Assad regime=
 or associated forces are directly responsible.&nbsp; But like I said, the =
early evidence that is already available indicates that it
 is quite similar to the tactics that have been used by the Assad regime in=
 other places.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this administration, fr=
om the President on down, have repeatedly and forcefully condemned the immo=
ral tactics of the Assad regime.&nbsp; We've noted that this blood-thirsty =
dictator has time and time again used the military might of
 that nation to attack innocent citizens.&nbsp; That is, in fact, why the O=
bama administration believes that he has lost the legitimacy to lead that c=
ountry.&nbsp; And it's why we believe a political transition is necessary t=
o try to bring an end to the chaos, and to
 try to address the series of consequences that have stemmed from President=
 Bashar al-Assad's failed political leadership.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the=
 opposition sees that hedging as a defense of a broken peace and a desperat=
e attempt to save a faltering -- didn't really even get started -- a peace =
process here, saying that this is some political theater; call it what
 it is and say directly what it is.&nbsp; How do you put that concern to re=
st?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think what I would say is simply that the observations that we have made ar=
e based on available information and available evidence.&nbsp; And there's =
no denying that the United States of America has, on a variety of
 occasions, starting at the level of the President on down, has repeatedly =
and forcefully condemned the attacks that the Assad regime has launched aga=
inst innocent civilians.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What's also true is that =
this administration has made reaching a political settlement and a politica=
l transition inside of Syria a top priority.&nbsp; There's no military solu=
tion that can be imposed successfully on
 Syria.&nbsp; The way to resolve the chaos in that country --<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What =
if the Russians don&#8217;t believe that?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
actually, the Russians themselves have acknowledged that a political transi=
tion is necessary.&nbsp; They've indicated that they share that view.&nbsp;=
 And what we have challenged the Russians to do is
 to use their influence with the Assad regime to get them to participate on=
 those talks more constructively.&nbsp; And look, the fact that those talks=
 convened, and the fact that there was, at least for several weeks, a cessa=
tion of hostilities that largely held,
 was a testament to the efforts of the United States and our ability to per=
suade the Russians to influence the Assad regime. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this is a strategy tha=
t has shown at least a little glimmer of progress, a glimmer of hope.&nbsp;=
 And that's why the administration continues to push.&nbsp; That's why you =
see the dogged engagement of Secretary Kerry in
 this effort.&nbsp; His repeated calls to Foreign Minister Lavrov and other=
 participants in these talks are an indication that we're trying to capital=
ize on a very, very narrow opening.&nbsp; Because, as the President observe=
d during his trip last week, all the options
 in Syria are bad.&nbsp; There are no good options there.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we might as be focused=
 on the one thing that we know can address the wide array of problems in th=
at country, and that is seeking a political transition that would bring lea=
dership to Syria that reflects the will
 and ambition of the Syrian people, that can unite that country, that can r=
estore some order, that can be a partner of the United States and our coali=
tion partners to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and begin to try to g=
overn that country once again.&nbsp;
 This is long-term goal.&nbsp; It's not going to happen overnight.&nbsp; An=
d there will be lots of starts and stops to try to achieve that end.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But that is the path that=
 we're trying to carve out.&nbsp; And it's painstaking work, and it is -- g=
oodness knows it's frustrating.&nbsp; But that is the path to an outcome th=
at reflects the best interest of the United States,
 and the path to an outcome that reflects the best way to resolve a conflic=
t that has contributed to tensions in an already volatile part of the world=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So th=
is isn&#8217;t a failure to confront on the part of the U.S. in an attempt =
to rescue what remains a hopeful idea but not a real political process at t=
his point?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
again, the United States has willingly and forcefully condemned the immoral=
 and bloodthirsty actions of the Assad regime.&nbsp; They have repeatedly u=
sed grotesque military tactics to attack innocent
 men, women and children.&nbsp; And we have forcefully condemned those acti=
ons more times than I can count.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And yes, the United State=

what we have said, particularly as it relates to Mr. Warmbier, the college =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talki=
ng about the Zika funding, the bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, it increased =
discretionary caps -- $80 billion over two years, including non-defense dis=
cretionary spending, about $40 billion over the next
 fiscal year.&nbsp; Does that money give the administration any flexibility=
 to work with appropriators to try to come up with a way to fund the emerge=
ncy for Zika?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I'm certainly no expert when it comes to the intricacies of the congression=
al budget process.&nbsp; What I do know, and what requires no expertise to =
include, is that the budget process that's being
 run by Republicans in the House and Senate right now is totally broken.&nb=
sp; The prospects of any sort of budget agreement, even by the strong Repub=
lican majorities in the House and Senate, are basically nil -- which is why=
 it is totally irresponsible for Republicans
 to suggest that this broken budget process should be pursued to meet an ur=
gent need.&nbsp; Our public health professionals have called this a public =
health emergency.&nbsp; It has prompted an emergency response by the CDC an=
d the NIH and other public health professionals
 all across the country.&nbsp; And it's time for Congress to treat it accor=
dingly.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Democrats in Congress are=
 certainly committed to addressing this emergency, but Republicans aren&#82=
17;t.&nbsp; And, frankly, I don&#8217;t know why.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know =
what their explanation is.&nbsp; There's no -- it's not as if the Zika
 virus only affects Democrats.&nbsp; Pregnant women in both parties are aff=
ected by the Zika virus and are at risk.&nbsp; It&#8217;s time for Congress=
 to do something to protect them.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And every day that goes b=
y that Republicans in Congress fail to act is another day lost to our effor=
ts to prepare for this emergency.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the subject of int=
ense disappointment.&nbsp; And it is highly irresponsible,
 and I don&#8217;t know how Republicans who are in the majority in Congress=
 right now are going to explain that to their constituents as they spend th=

these members of Congress are planning a vacation or if they&#8217;re plann=

y direct questions from their constituents asking them
 why they haven&#8217;t done anything to address a public health emergency.=
&nbsp; And I suspect that Republicans at some point later this summer, when=
 the television networks and the newspapers are warning of this public heal=
th crisis, the Republicans themselves are going
 to be wondering why they didn&#8217;t do something earlier.&nbsp; And I do=

ls
 and pronouncements, you talk about the President&#8217;s record, especiall=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
look, over the course of the last nine months or so, I&#8217;ve been asked =
frequently about presidential candidates in both parties.&nbsp; And I think=
 I&#8217;ve been pretty candid about the fact that there are
 some opportunities that I&#8217;ve taken to weigh on that debate, but most=
ly I&#8217;ve tried to stay out of it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I think as the genera=

s I have here, which is to obviously help all of you understand exactly wha=
t&#8217;s happening at the White House, but also
 to be an advocate for the President&#8217;s policies and the President&#82=

 for the President.&nbsp; Obviously the President himself is going to be ou=
t there making his case too, and he&#8217;ll do that here at the White Hous=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
look, I don&#8217;t want to prejudge the process.&nbsp; What I will say is =
the process has already been delayed for too long by Republicans who have n=
ot recognized that this needs to be a priority.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">One of the reasons that e=
mergency funding is typically not offset is that funding bills can often ge=
t bogged down in debates about the pay-fors.&nbsp; The essence of an emerge=
ncy is that Congress should act quickly.&nbsp;
 So what we would like to see is Congress to act quickly, to act consistent=
 with the urgent needs that our public health professionals say exist.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So if there were a way to=
 design a package that had strong bipartisan support that could be quickly =
and easily resolved that included pay-fors, I wouldn&#8217;t rule that out =
of hand.&nbsp; But given how long it has taken
 to just discuss the funding in and of itself, I find it hard to imagine a =
scenario in which there isn&#8217;t a protracted debate about the pay-fors.=
&nbsp; That protracted debate at this point is frankly not something that w=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The fact is there is no d=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I guess =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And spe=

</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; It has a=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does=
.&nbsp; It's going on seven weeks since the President made this nomination.=
&nbsp; It doesn't appear like you're any closer to a hearing.&nbsp; And the=
 congressional calendar, you might call it less than robust for the rest of=
 the year.&nbsp;
 Do you view this campaign coming up as the last best shot you've got at ge=
tting a hearing?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, no=
, not necessarily.&nbsp; Look, I think we've made a forceful case for why C=
hief Judge Garland deserves to be treated fairly by the Senate.&nbsp; The S=
enate has a constitutional responsibility to offer their advice and consent
 of a presidential nominee.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Obama has taken t=
hat advise and consent responsibility quite seriously.&nbsp; The President =
conducted extensive negotiations and conversations with members of Congress=
 prior to putting Chief Judge Garland's name forward.&nbsp; And
 it's not a coincidence that the President actually nominated somebody that=
 even leading Republicans have described as a consensus nominee.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief Judge Garland is some=
body who has served on the second-highest court in the land for 19 years.&n=
bsp; He's got more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court=
 nominee in American history.&nbsp; He is an individual who spent
 his life in public service.&nbsp; He is somebody who has demonstrated that=
 he understands that a judge should interpret the law, not advance a politi=
cal agenda.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why it's particularl=
y disappointing that somebody with a set of credentials and experience like=
 this is being treated so unfairly by Republicans in the Senate.&nbsp; So w=
e're going to continue to press upon Republicans and make the
 case that they should do what every other Supreme Court nominee since *<s>=
1975</s>[1875] has gotten, which is a hearing and/or a vote.&nbsp; Those ar=
e just the facts.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And those arguments have go=
tten some traction.&nbsp; Certainly there's ample public evidence to indica=
te that Republicans' political standing has suffered as a result of the unr=
easonable position they've taken with respect to Chief Judge
 Garland's nomination.&nbsp; I saw some polling just yesterday that the app=
roval rating of the Republican Party as a whole is as low as it has been si=
nce I was in high school.&nbsp; This is despite the fact that there are str=
ong Republican majorities in the House and
 Senate in Congress.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think that's an indicat=
ion that people aren't particularly pleased in either party by the way that=
 Republican leaders in Washington, D.C. have handled the people's business.=
&nbsp; I think in many cases they've refused
 to handle the people's business.&nbsp; They've refused to move on emergenc=
y funding for Zika.&nbsp; They've refused to consider restructuring authori=
ty for Puerto Rico, despite the dire financial situation there.&nbsp; They'=
ve refused to even give a hearing, let alone a
 vote, to the President's consensus Supreme Court nominee -- consensus is a=
 word that is often used by Republicans -- to say nothing of the budget pro=
cess that Republicans have previously described as critically important and=
 a basic function of Congress, but
 yet we've seen that process utterly break down in both the House and the S=
enate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there are some difficult=
 questions for Republicans to answer.&nbsp; And certainly moving forward wi=
th fair consideration of the President's Supreme Court nominee is one way t=
hat Republicans could try to restore confidence in their ability
 to do the simplest, most basic thing.&nbsp; This is a responsibility to co=
nsider these Supreme Court nominees, it's a responsibility that's outlined =
in the Constitution.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the President could h=
ave chosen somebody who is outside the mainstream, somebody who is a strong=
 progressive that has political views that are far different than any Repub=
lican senator.&nbsp; But that's not what
 he's done.&nbsp; He's actually chosen somebody that even Republicans have =
described as a consensus nominee; somebody that's demonstrated time and tim=
e again that he has what it takes to serve on the Supreme Court.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In fact, I made note of a=
n op-ed that was written by Ted Olson today.&nbsp; Ted Olson is certainly n=
o liberal.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a conservative, and a widely respected legal mi=
nd, frankly on both sides of the aisle.&nbsp; But his conservative
 credentials are well-known.&nbsp; He wrote, &#8220;By temperament, charact=
er and qualifications, Judge Garland is precisely the kind of jurist we wan=
t on the Supreme Court.&nbsp; For Republicans, there is much to recommend g=
iving Mr. Garland a good look, a respectful hearing,
 and a vote on the merits.&#8221;&nbsp; That&#8217;s a conservative lawyer =
who&#8217;s making that argument.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this is an argument th=
at&#8217;s gotten traction.&nbsp; And I think the pressure on Republicans w=
ho refuse to do their job is only going to increase.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
look, I think it is clear that they are stalling, that they aren&#8217;t do=
ing their jobs, and they&#8217;re hoping that no one will notice.&nbsp; I t=
hink, unfortunately, they&#8217;re going to be wrong about that.&nbsp;
 If they wanted to reverse course, there&#8217;s still ample time for them =
to do so.&nbsp; There is no reason that Republicans couldn&#8217;t act quic=
kly to schedule a hearing, put Chief Judge Garland through his paces.<o:p><=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Again, I&#8217;m not expe=
cting that -- I&#8217;m not suggesting or in any way expecting that Chief J=
udge Garland should get a pass.&nbsp; He should just get what every other S=
upreme Court nominee has gotten since 1875, and that&#8217;s
 a fair hearing, a tough hearing.&nbsp; Every year since television was inv=
ented, those Supreme Court justices have gone on in front of the cameras to=
 answer questions under oath, and those are tough questions that they&#8217=
;ve gotten from senators on both the right
 and the left.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That&#8217;s all we&#8217=

t Republicans don&#8217;t want to give him that venue is they&#8217;re conc=
erned that he&#8217;s going to actually perform well in that venue.&nbsp; A=
nd
 that&#8217;s the reason that they don&#8217;t even want to invite that pos=

 his nomination.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we&#8217;re going to =
keep the pressure up.&nbsp; This is a powerful argument.&nbsp; And the effe=
ctive functioning of our Supreme Court with the full complement of justices=

 we know that the Supreme Court has a rather full docket next term.&nbsp; A=
