Today Show:

Replaying clip from 1991 of someone pretending to be a PR person, sounds li=
ke Trump.
- Trump says he doesn't know anything about it, doesn't sound like his voic=
e. Many people are trying to pretend to be him
- Doesn't sound like him

Guthrie pressing, he's admitted he used to do this.
- Wasn't him on the phone, doesn't sound like him. You're going so low as t=
o talk about something that happened 25 years ago? The answer is no, we hav=
e more important things to discuss

Meeting with Paul Ryan, disappointed no endorsement?
- It's a process. A little surprised, not that surprised. Got many endorsem=
ents yesterday
- Thinks he'll win the election because HRC is a disaster, assuming she eve=
n gets to run

Muslim ban a suggestion or a proposal? Softening stand
- Not the president, so everything he says is a suggestion. If he were pres=
ident he would put in legislation and do what he had to do. He's looking at=
 it very strongly

Pressed on whether softening stance
- Not softening stance at all, but always flexible on issues
- We have a major problem we have to solve, president won't even use its na=
me

President transgender bathroom order
- Would leave that and many other things up to the states, it's a local iss=
ue not a federal one
- Everyone has to be protected, but you're talking about a tiny, tiny group=
 of the population. Everyone has to be protected

Portman as VP?
- was with him in group yesterday. Had a great talk with all of them. Portm=
an is a good man
