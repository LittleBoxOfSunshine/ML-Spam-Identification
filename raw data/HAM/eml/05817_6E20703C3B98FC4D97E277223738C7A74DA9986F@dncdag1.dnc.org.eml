SL: ROUNDUP: Dangerous Donald=92s Foreign Policy =93Plan=94

As he=92s done throughout his campaign, Dangerous Donald Trump is proving t=
hat on foreign policy, he lacks the judgment, experience, and temperament t=
o be our next commander-in-chief. Trump would alienate allies and deal with=
 friend and foe alike with reckless disregard, with poorly conceived ideas =
that would undermine our national security and make the American people les=
s safe.

Don=92t take our word for it, see what people are saying about his remarks =
below:

A Trump-First Foreign Policy

TREET JOURNAL //
His maiden policy speech on Wednesday, devoted to foreign affairs, earns an=
 =93incomplete=94 at Trump University.
=85

The 5,000-word speech lacked specifics by normal political standards, if no=
t his own. The central motif, like all of Mr. Trump=92s political thought, =
is that the businessman has the brains and strength to solve a given proble=
m, and everybody else is a pathetic loser, so trust his instincts and tempe=
rament.
=85

For prepared remarks, or for that matter even an after-dinner talk, Mr. Tru=
mp=92s speech was especially rife with contradictions. He said the conduct =
of foreign policy must be =93more unpredictable. We are totally predictable=
. We tell everything.=94 He also said the conduct of foreign policy must be=
 =93disciplined, deliberate and consistent.=94
=85
Mr. Trump isn=92t known for close readings of his briefing books, if such d=
ocuments exist, and deep policy knowledge is obviously not the source of hi=
s political appeal. But Americans typically prefer Presidents who are conve=
rsant about the world=92s biggest problems beyond a sound bite or two=85

Mr. Trump promised to =93win our new future struggles, which may be many, w=
hich may be complex, but we will win if I become President.=94 He won=92t b=

Donald Trump=92s Strange Worldview

...
No one=92s fears are likely to be allayed by this speech, which was clearly=
 worked up by his new campaign advisers and read from a teleprompter. It di=
d not exhibit much grasp of the complexity of the world, understanding of t=
he balance or exercise of power, or even a careful reading of history.
...

Mr. Trump repeatedly states outright falsehoods, often based on wrong assum=
ptions. He=92s been refuted before on his claim that the Islamic State is m=
aking =93millions of dollars a week=94 by selling Libyan oil. There is zero=
 evidence of that. The nuclear deal with the United States and other major =
powers has not made Iran a =93great power,=94 nor has Tehran violated the c=
onditions of that pact, as Mr. Trump has said.

Mr. Trump says he knows how to negotiate, and to him that seems to mean put=
ting forward maximal positions that he can then walk back. That won=92t wor=
k in foreign policy. Mr. Trump did not display any willingness to learn or =
to correct his past errors. For someone who claims he is ready to lead the =
free world, that is inexcusable.

As anyone who watches reality television knows, the genre might be entertai=
ning, but its correlation to actual reality is tenuous.

Which is a good place to start with the  much-awaited foreign policy speech=
 delivered Wednesday in Washington by presidential candidate Donald Trump.

As with The Apprentice, the show that helped him become a household name, t=
he Republican front-runner sought to provide appealing fare for a certain c=
lass of people. In this case, the primary audience was voters opposed to tr=
ade, resentful of immigrants, distrustful of foreign governments, and wistf=
ul for a time when America wielded more power in a simpler world.

In reaching out to this group, Trump vividly portrayed a world that does no=
t exist: America=92s allies would be more respectful after being lectured t=
o, while its enemies would be dealt with by bluster. China would fall into =
line after enduring unspecified economic pressure. And troubled regions of =
the world would be stabilized through U.S. disengagement.
=85

Things might happen that way on TV. But not in reality. Or perhaps we shoul=
d say real reality.

Donald Trump shows dangerously incoherent foreign policy<http://www.sacbee.=

THE SACRAMENTO BEE // THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Then, he gave a rambling, vague and incoherent speech Wednesday full of pla=
titudes and contradictions, and suggested he would undermine international =
alliances that have helped keep America safe since World War II.

It was billed as a major foreign policy address, but voters looking for rea=
ssurances about Trump as commander in chief can=92t feel that much more com=
fortable. Our longtime allies certainly won=92t be confident.
Don=92t be fooled by Trump=92s foreign policy speech<https://www.washington=
post.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/04/28/dont-be-fooled-by-trumps-foreign=
-policy-speech/>
WASHINGTON POST // ANNE APPLEBAUM
If you weren=92t already convinced that parody is now the central art form =
of our era, then Donald Trump=92s grand foreign policy speech yesterday was=
 the proof.
=85

The multiple inconsistencies and internal contradictions have already been =
listed by others. On the one hand, he said that =93your friends need to kno=
w that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them.=94 On the =
other hand, he threatened to =93walk=94 if those same friends didn=92t pony=
 up to his demands. He wants to invest heavily in the military, but he want=
s to stop using the military. He doesn=92t want to do =93nation-building=94=
 but does want to promote =93regional stability.=94 There was no sense that=
 he knew what either of those terms actually meant.
=85

Anyone who sits down and analyzes the speech from start to finish will, of =
course, worry about the contradictions, the inconsistencies, the impossible=
 claims, the detachment from reality.

From Donald Trump, a Foreign Policy Speech Heavy on Slogans and Light on De=
tails
<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/27/from-donald-trump-a-foreign-polic=
y-speech-heavy-on-slogans-and-light-on-details/>WALL STREET JOURNAL // AARO=
N DAVID MILLER
Those expecting a coherent, well-ordered view of the world and a strategy t=
o match it would have been disappointed listening to Donald Trump=92s forei=
gn policy address on Wednesday. The speech was a collection of bromides, sl=
ogans, aims, and promises wrapped in Mr. Trump=92s conviction that he can s=
olve America=92s problems in a cruel and unforgiving world=96all without sp=
ecifying how.
=85

Nobody expected great detail on how exactly he would accomplish all of his =
plans. But in what was billed as a major foreign-policy address, the absenc=
e of guidance on how he would achieve his goals was striking. The best he c=
ould do about better burden sharing with our NATO allies was to suggest a s=
ummit to discuss the matter.

=85
His implication that only he knows how to fix what ails the republic sugges=
ts a self-absorption that goes well beyond the normal ego and narcissism re=
quired to run for president. Mr. Trump=92s preference for celebrity (his) o=
ver substance and his reliance on one-liners over serious analysis of compl=
icated problems point up potential for conflict, at minimum, should he win =
the nation=92s most-demanding job, a position that requires prudence, curio=
sity, and a willingness not only to ask questions but also to home in on th=
e right ones.

Trump struggles to explain 'America first' foreign policy<http://www.boston=
herald.com/news/us_politics/2016/04/trump_struggles_to_explain_america_firs=
t_foreign_policy>
ASSOCIATED PRESS// LOLITA C. BALDOR AND SAGAR MEGHANI
Donald Trump strained to lay out a clear vision of his "America first" fore=
ign policy on Wednesday, vowing to substitute hard-headed realism for what =
he called a post-Cold War era replete with U.S. national security failures.

Yet the Republican presidential front-runner outlined no strategy for how h=
e'd make the United States at the same time a "consistent" and "unpredictab=
le" force in the world. And he didn't appear to allay the concerns of U.S. =
and international critics =97 Republicans at home as well as Democrats =97 =
who see him as unfit for the responsibilities of commander in chief.
=85

Trump also contradicted his own broad-brush approach to foreign policy. He =
said at one point that the best way to achieve his goals was through "disci=
plined, deliberate and consistent" policy. Later, however, he exhorted the =
nation to "be more unpredictable" in how it combats enemies.

Graham tears into Trump=92s =91pathetic=92 foreign policy speech

trumps-pathetic-foreign-policy-speech>THE HILL // JESSIE HELLMAN
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) tore into Donald Trump=92s foreign policy addr=
ess Wednesday in a series of tweets, saying, =93Ronald Reagan must be rolli=
ng over in his grave.=94

The outspoken senator called Trump=92s speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Was=
hington pathetic and incoherent.

=93Trump speech is pathetic in terms of understanding the role America play=
s in the world, how to win War on Terror, and threats we face,=94 Graham wr=
ote.

=93Trump=92s FP speech not conservative. It=92s isolationism surrounded by =
disconnected thought, demonstrates lack of understanding threats we face.=

<br>
As with The Apprentice, the show that helped him become a household name, t=

lass of people. In this case, the primary audience was voters opposed to tr=
ade, resentful of immigrants, distrustful
 of foreign governments, and wistful for a time when America wielded more p=
ower in a simpler world.<br>
<br>
In reaching out to this group, Trump vividly portrayed a world that does no=
t exist: America=92s allies would be more respectful after being lectured t=
o, while its enemies would be dealt with by bluster. China would fall into =
line after enduring unspecified economic
 pressure. And troubled regions of the world would be stabilized through U.=
S. disengagement.<br>

Which is a good place to start with the &nbsp;much-awaited foreign policy s=

<br>
As with The Apprentice, the show that helped him become a household name, t=
he Republican front-runner sought to provide appealing fare for a certain c=
lass of people. In this case, the primary audience was voters opposed to tr=
ade, resentful of immigrants, distrustful
 of foreign governments, and wistful for a time when America wielded more p=
ower in a simpler world.<br>
<br>
In reaching out to this group, Trump vividly portrayed a world that does no=
t exist: America=92s allies would be more respectful after being lectured t=
o, while its enemies would be dealt with by bluster. China would fall into =
line after enduring unspecified economic
 pressure. And troubled regions of the world would be stabilized through U.=
S. disengagement.<br>
