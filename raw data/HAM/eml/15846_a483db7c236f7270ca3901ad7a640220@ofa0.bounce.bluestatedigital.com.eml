Dear NFC:

The 2016 Hope Institute application is open. We are looking for candidates =
with little previous exposure to politics to participate in the program, =
which will take place in Washington, DC.

Ideal candidates will be eager for political campaign training with the =
goal of jumping on a campaign in the 2016 elections. Candidates should be =
enthusiastic, politically minded future leaders between the ages of 20 and =
24 from diverse backgrounds all across the country.

We cover all costs, including airfare to and from Washington, =
accommodations, meals, and ground transportation to and from Hope =
Institute activities.

The details are copied below. Please feel free to share with your =
networks.

Thanks,

Jordan Kaplan
National Finance Director
Democratic National Committee
