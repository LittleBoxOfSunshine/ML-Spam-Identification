Republican National Security Experts Raise Concerns about Trump=92s Dangero=
us Foreign Policy, such as his Admiration for Putin

Republican national security experts, including former Secretary of Defense=
 Robert Gates and Congressman Peter King, the former chairman of the Commit=
tee on Homeland Security, raised concerns over the past week about Donald T=
rump=92s dangerous foreign policy.  Gates and King criticized Trump=92s adm=
iration for Vladimir Putin and questioned his lack of a plan on ISIS.

Read criticisms made over the past week by Republican national security exp=
erts of Trump=92s dangerous foreign policy:

Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates:<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bob-g=
ates-donald-trump-national-security-past-presidents/> =93I have some real i=
ssues with things he=92s said about national security policy.  And some con=
cerns.  I think there are some contradictions. You can't have a trade war w=
ith China and then turn around and ask them to help you on North Korea. I h=
ave no idea what his policy would be in terms of dealing with ISIS. I worry=
 a little bit about his admiration for Vladimir Putin=85=94

Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates:<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bob-g=
ates-donald-trump-national-security-past-presidents/> =93I guess one of the=
 things that makes it challenging for me is that he seems to think that he =
has all the answers.=94

Congressman Peter King, former chairman of the Committee on Homeland Securi=
ty:<http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/515-priebus-king-blackburn/> =93Well I=92=
m supporting the nominee of the party but I still have real questions with =
him as far as national security. I don't think his Asian policy is coherent=
 because, again, if he does want to get in a trade war with China, he has t=
o explain how that coincides with him wanting to use China against North Ko=
rea. If he wants to have leverage over China, how can be talking about taki=
ng troops out of Japan and Korea.=94

Congressman Peter King, former chairman of the Committee on Homeland Securi=
ty:<http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/515-priebus-king-blackburn/> =93I=92m ver=
y concerned about this romance he seems to have with Putin=85=94

Senator Lindsey Graham:<https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-05-11/=
republicans-pray-trump-will-evolve-on-foreign-policy> =93He talks like Rona=
ld Reagan one moment and then embraces Putin the next.  The contradictions =
are just overwhelmingly to me.=94

Senator Marco Rubio:<https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-05-11/rep=
ublicans-pray-trump-will-evolve-on-foreign-policy> =93=92My hope is that he=
 can be persuaded away from those sorts of positions,=92 Rubio said. =91As =
of now that=92s not the case.=92 Rubio doesn=92t agree with Corker that Tru=
mp will see the world differently after he learns the details of the issues=
.=94

Former Secretary of State James Baker:<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/ar=
ticles/2016-05-12/trump-foreign-policy-spurned-by-veteran-republican-advise=
r-baker> =93While Donald Trump met with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hil=
l Thursday, a Senate hearing provided a forum for critics in his party to t=
ake aim at his foreign policy proposals. At the prompting of Republican Sen=
ator Marco Rubio, who dropped out of the presidential race in March, former=
 Secretary of State James Baker said that the world =91would be far less st=
able=92 if the U.S. left the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or let Sout=
h Korea and Japan obtain nuclear weapons, proposals floated by Trump during=
 the campaign that made him the presumptive Republican presidential nominee=
. =91We=92ve got a lot of problems today, but you=92d have a hell of a lot =
more if that were the case,=92 Baker, who was secretary of state in Preside=
nt George H.W. Bush=92s administration, said without mentioning Trump by na=
me. =91NATO has been the foundation of peace and stability in Europe. The m=
ore countries that obtain nuclear weapons the more instability there will b=
e in the world.=92=94

Former Secretary of State James Baker:<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/0=
5/marco-rubio-james-baker-donald-trump-223142> =93Marco Rubio=92s latest sh=
ot at Donald Trump came with an assist from James Baker. The Republican Flo=
rida senator, who abandoned the presidential race earlier this year after r=
epeated drubbings by Trump, asked the revered GOP elder statesman on Thursd=
ay what he thought of suggestions by =91some people=92 that more countries =
should have nuclear weapons. =91The more countries that acquire nuclear wea=
pons, the more instability there is going to be in the world,=92 replied Ba=
ker, a former secretary of state, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committ=
ee hearing.=94

Former CIA Director Michael Hayden:<http://www.businessinsider.com/michael-=
hayden-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-2016-5> =93Michael Hayden didn't mince =
words when asked about Donald Trump's proposal to bar Muslim immigrants and=
 tourists from entering the US. It's not legally possible, the former direc=
tor of the Central Intelligence Agency told Business Insider in an intervie=
w. It's morally reprehensible. And, frankly, =91it's dumb as dirt.=92=94

Former CIA Director Michael Hayden:<http://www.businessinsider.com/michael-=
hayden-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-2016-5> =93He has not shown me the capa=
city to treat international issues with the complexity and seriousness that=
 they deserve.  And again, if I'm supposed to ignore those things =97 =91th=
at was just done for the crowd=92 =97 frankly, that's an even worse problem=
. I'm going to take him at face value.=94
