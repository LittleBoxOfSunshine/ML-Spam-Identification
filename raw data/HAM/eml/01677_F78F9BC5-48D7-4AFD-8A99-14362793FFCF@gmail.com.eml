Thanks, Colleen, and sorry I missed your call.  Jordan, I love the =
thought of you with =E2=80=9Cfree time.=E2=80=9D =20

As someone who not only supports the President but dedicates nearly all =
my time to nonprofit leadership, strategy and governance endeavors, I =
couldn=E2=80=99t be more interested in attending and learning more, and =
the night looks good. =20

As you may recall, my husband Ranesh is Jonathan Lavine=E2=80=99s =
partner and general counsel and has been traveling nonstop for the past =
few weeks so I just want to coordinate our RSVP appropriately with him =
as soon as I get him back stateside.  I=E2=80=99m sure we can close the =
loop formally by end of week.

Thanks!
