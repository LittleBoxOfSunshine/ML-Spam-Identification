*DNC Chair, Jewish Community Leaders Denounce Anti-Semitic Vitriol Against
Jewish Reporters in 2016 campaign*



Today, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz joined Jewish community
leaders from the Anti-Defamation League, the National Jewish Democratic
Council, and Bend the Arc to denounce anti-Semitic vitriol against Jewish
reporters in the 2016 campaign.



Throughout the 2016 campaign, journalists reporting on Donald Trump=E2=80=
=99s
candidacy have been met with hatred and vitriol inspired by the Republican
nominee himself.  In fact, the Wall Street Journal recently reported how
Trump inspires white supremacists in a story titled: =E2=80=9CWhite Nationa=

Whether it=E2=80=99s Trump=E2=80=99s campaign manager assaulting a female r=
eporter, or
Donald Trump commanding the crowd to direct their anger towards the press
during his rallies, it=E2=80=99s clear Trump=E2=80=99s supporters derive th=
is kind of
violent behavior and extreme rhetoric towards the press from the man
standing behind the podium[SA1] <#_msocom_1>



Furthermore, the Trump camp has shown no remorse or sympathy for reporters
who are subjected to abuse by Trump supporters. When GQ reporter Julia Ioff=
e
received
<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/28/julia-ioffe-journalist-mela=
nia-trump-antisemitic-abuse?CMP=3Dshare_btn_fb>
hateful
messages in response to a profile she penned about Melania Trump, Ms. Trump
blamed the reporter, saying she =E2=80=9Cprovoked
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/17/politics/melania-trump-dujour/>=E2=80=9D the
anti-Semitic abuse. Mr. Trump declined
<http://www.jta.org/2016/05/05/news-opinion/politics/trump-no-message-for-f=

to
denounce the followers who flooded that reporter with invective, saying he
had =E2=80=9Cno message,=E2=80=9D for them. According to Politico, Jewish l=
eaders on both
sides of the aisle were dismayed by Trump=E2=80=99s refusal to combat



Yesterday, Robert Kagan wrote this in the Washington Post about the fascist
threat posed by Trump=E2=80=99s candidacy

ld
oppose it, frightening weapon. When controlled and directed by a single
leader, it can be aimed at whomever the leader chooses.=E2=80=9D



Predictably, when Jonathan Weisman of the New York Times, tweeted out a
passage from that op-ed, he was treated to similar anti-Semitic abuse

from
Trump supporters.



This is unacceptable. Until Trump makes a forceful denouncement of the
anti-Semitic vitriol his supporters have directed at Jews and Jewish
reporters, he is condoning his followers=E2=80=99 comments.


------------------------------

 [SA1] <#_msoanchor_1>. [This quote to me seems more about attacking the
press than attacking Jews or a minority group, is there another that=E2=80=

about attacking Jews specifically?
