PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20





1:11 P.M. EDT





 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to the dry White House B=
riefing Room. (Laughter.) I do not have any announcements to start, so we=
 can go straight to your questions.



 Darlene, do you want to go first?



 Q Thank you. The Senate passed legislation today by voice vote that will=
 allow families of 9/11 victims to sue in U.S. court for any role the Sau=
di government may have played in the attack. Does the White House threat =
to veto that bill still stand?



 MR. EARNEST: Darlene, I know that the advocates of this legislation have=
 suggested that they have taken into account our concerns by more narrowl=
y tailoring the legislation. But, unfortunately, their efforts were not s=
ufficient to prevent the longer-term, unintended consequences that we are=
 concerned about. This legislation would change longstanding internationa=
l law regarding sovereign immunity. And the President of the United State=
s continues to harbor serious concerns that this legislation would make t=
he United States vulnerable in other court systems around the world.



 Theres also a concern that hasnt gotten as much attention about the pote=
ntial vulnerability that is created for some of our allies and partners i=
n U.S. courts. And the concern is related to the fact that sovereign immu=
nity is a principle that is critical to our national security. The United=
 States is more engaged in activities in other countries than any other c=
ountry in the world. Typically, those are actually activities that other =
countries benefit from significantly. These are peacekeeping activities, =
or humanitarian relief activities, or other activities in which the Unite=
d States is supporting the national security activities of other countrie=
s, and the national security of other countries is enhanced by the involv=
ement of the United States. =20



 But out involvement in those activities is made more complicated by the =
chance that the principle of sovereign immunity could be eroded. So the a=
dministration strongly continues to oppose this legislation. And we're ob=
viously going to begin conversations with the House about it.



 Q Are the serious concerns that you just cited -- are those strong enoug=
h to lead to a veto of the bill?



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, as I think I mentioned before, given the concerns that=
 we have expressed, it's difficult to imagine the President signing this =
legislation. That continues to be true.



 Q Will the White House -- as the bill goes to the House, will the White =
House work with lawmakers in the House to maybe keep the bill from coming=
 up for a vote there? Is it important enough to try to do that and stop i=
t?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a variety of options. That would ce=
rtainly be one of them. I think the other option would be seeking additio=
nal changes to the bill that would more directly address the concerns tha=
t we have been raising for months now. So there are multiple options, but=
 we certainly anticipate having conversations with members of Congress ab=
out this issue.



 I would just note that there are both Democrats and Republicans in the H=
ouse of Representatives that have expressed concerns with the bill. So th=
ere is an opportunity for us to work in bipartisan fashion to try to addr=
ess the serious concerns that we've raised about the unintended consequen=
ces of this legislation being enacted.



 Q Just to before we came out -- concerning the veto theme -- the Stateme=
nt of Administration Policy that was released on the $622 million Zika fu=
nding bill in the House -- saying that -- would recommend that the Presid=
ent veto that if it got to him. The Senate today is voting on three diffe=
rent Zika funding measures. Theres one for about $1.1 billion that seems =
most likely to advance. Where does the White House fall on that particula=
r bill? If the $622 million is not enough.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we have several concerns with the House bill. The fir=
st concern is that it is woefully insufficient given the significant risk=
 that is posed by Zika. Thats not just my own personal analysis -- that a=
ctually is the analysis of our public health professionals who advise the=
 administration about what should be included in the supplemental appropr=
iations package that we sent up to Congress nearly three months ago.



 So its disappointing that Congress is -- at least the House of Represent=
atives is three months late and more than a billion dollars short of doin=
g whats necessary to protect the American people. Theres no reason that t=
his should be a partisan or ideological issue -- this isnt a question of =
government philosophy. This is a question about whether or not youre actu=
ally committed to ensuring that were doing everything possible to protect=
 pregnant women and babies in the United States of America from getting a=
 debilitating disease, or at least a virus that has debilitating conseque=
nces for the neurological development of babies.



 So were quite disappointed that the House is so late in acting and what =
theyve put together is so woefully insufficient. Its not just our public =
health professionals who have expressed those concerns. I would note that=
 one certain Republican senator from Florida was on the floor of the Unit=
ed States Senate today expressing those concerns. So I do think it does r=
aise a question for the 17 Republican House members from the state of Flo=
rida about what their view is. The Republican senator from the state of F=
lorida has indicated that the Congress should act expeditiously to pass t=
he $1.9 billion funding proposal that our public health experts say is ne=
eded.



 I think it would be interesting to understand exactly what position the =
17 other Republicans from Florida who represent that state in the Congres=
s think of this. I think its certainly a relevant question. I think it un=
derscores the point that I was making before that theres no reason this s=
hould be a partisan issue. This is a basic matter of the public health an=
d well-being of the American people.



 Q And the $1.1 billion -- where does the administration fall on that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the Senate, fortunately, appears to be making more pr=
ogress. They will also include a vote today on the $1.9 billion proposal =
that we put forward back in February. And we strongly encourage Democrats=
 and Republicans to come together around that bill. Thats what our public=
 health professionals say is needed to do everything possible to protect =
the American people from Zika. And this would be an emergency appropriati=
on that would be available to state and local officials, and federal gove=
rnment scientists immediately. We believe that is the preferred -- we bel=
ieve thats the best way to protect the American people from the Zika viru=
s.



 Q You seem to be saying the $1.9 billion or nothing. I mean --=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, what Im saying is that is what our public health prof=
essionals say that we need. So were looking for Congress to act on that r=
equest and thats what we would like to see move forward.=20



 The other concern that we have with the House bill isnt just that the am=
ount of resources committed is much smaller; the funding would be offset =
by taking away resources that are currently being used to protect the Ame=
rican people from Ebola. And traditionally, when Congress has been faced =
with a public health emergency, they havent wasted a lot of time looking =
for funding offsets. And thats a pretty dangerous exercise because it del=
ays the needed funding, but it also risks gutting other critical prioriti=
es.



 Lets talk a little bit about how that Ebola funding is currently being u=
sed. Right now, that funding is being used by the CDC to work with the he=
alth ministries in both Guinea and Liberia to investigate the rapidly cha=
nging situation related to new Ebola cases there. Right now, the CDC is a=
ssisting those governments in tracing nearly a thousand contacts. These a=
re individuals who are at heightened risk of potentially spreading Ebola.=
 So the CDC has 100 staff that are deployed over there, and that staff is=
 helping to process 10,000 samples per month in Liberia, Sierra Leone, an=
d Guinea.



 So its pretty clear that whats happening -- that the work that the CDC i=
s doing in West Africa was very helpful in the fall of 2014 in stopping t=
he spread of that terrible disease, but it requires vigilance. And the le=
sson that we should have learned from 2014 is that the United States and =
the American people benefit from enhanced capacity of public health offic=
ials in other countries, that stopping the spread of a dangerous virus in=
 another country makes the American people safer. And when that was an ac=
ademic hypothetical exercise, there was some skepticism that some people =
expressed about that notion. But there werent many people expressing skep=
ticism about that notion in the fall of 2014 when there was concern about=
 the Ebola virus appearing in the United States.



 So it is a bad idea for Republicans to move forward with a proposal that=
 would gut our efforts to follow through in the fight against Ebola and i=
ts a bad idea for Republicans to further delay the emergency funding that=
s necessary to protect the American people from the Zika virus.



 Tim.



 Q In Baghdad, several bombings today, extending the deadliest wave of th=
e year in bombings there. And on Saturday, Prime Minister Abadi said that=
 hes afraid that the political crisis there is hampering the fight agains=
t Islamic State. Does the administration share that concern?



 MR. EARNEST: Tim, let me start by saying that the United States strongly=
 condemns the barbaric terrorist attacks in Iraq today by ISIL that speci=
fically targeted innocent civilians. We extend our deepest condolences to=
 the victims and their families. These string of attacks by ISIL is the l=
atest reminder of the danger that this group poses to all Iraqis and the =
importance of Iraqi leaders from all communities, working together agains=
t a common enemy.



 Tim, youll recall back in 2014, the President made the offer of U.S. mil=
itary assistance to Iraq contingent upon Iraqs central government more ef=
fectively uniting that country to confront ISIL. So that should be an ind=
ication to you that a unified, effectively governed Iraq is critical to o=
ur success against ISIL. It has been a central part of our strategy from =
the very first day. And weve been encouraged over the last year and a hal=
f by the efforts that Prime Minister Abadi has undertaken to unify that c=
ountry and pursue the kind of inclusive governing agenda that can inspire=
 the confidence of Iraqs diverse population that the central government i=
n Baghdad is looking out for their best interests. We believe that that w=
ill have a corresponding impact on the effectiveness and resilience of Ir=
aqs security forces.



 I think thats largely proved to be true. Iraqs security forces, backed b=
y coalition military airpower and the advice and assistance of coalition =
militaries from around the world, has bene effective in driving ISIL out =
of territory that they previously controlled. We know that ISIL has been =
driven out of about 40 percent of the populated areas that ISIL previousl=
y controlled in Iraq. Thats tangible progress.=20



 And our coalition is committed to trying to keep up that momentum and co=
ntinue to pressure ISIL while also providing the Iraqi central government=
 necessary resources to rebuild those areas that ISIL had taken over. We =
know that in places like Ramadi. ISIL didnt just occupy that community --=
 they essentially destroyed it. And rebuilding that infrastructure and re=
building those communities so that people feel confident in moving back h=
ome is going to be critical to our longer-term success of bringing some s=
tability to that region of the world. And so the important financial cont=
ributions that have been made by countries around the world are also an i=
mportant part of our strategy, but theyre all predicated on the Iraqi peo=
ple and the international community having confidence in the effectivenes=
s of the Iraqi central government.



 Q Well, Abadi seems to be very concerned about the turmoil in his own go=
vernment. Are you saying that the troops that are coming in, the U.S. tro=
ops that are coming in are going to help him deal with that while he figu=
res out the turmoil?



 MR. EARNEST: No. I think the U.S. troops that are in Iraq are there for =
a very specific reason, which is to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. =
And theyre focused on missions that involve protecting the embassy, carry=
ing out military air operations against ISIL targets, in some cases provi=
ding training and advice and assistance to Iraqi security forces, and the=
res a small number of special operators that have been organized into the=
se expeditionary forces that can carry out raids against senior ISIL figu=
res. Weve been very clear about the mission that U.S. forces in Iraq are =
pursuing.



 Q And on Syria, theres a lot of pessimism over the talks in Vienna. Does=
 the White House believe that the Syrian government has systematically de=
nied humanitarian aid?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, theres extensive reporting and plenty of evidence to =
indicate that too often the Assad regime or forces that are operating und=
er the command and control of the Assad regime are making a concerted eff=
ort to prevent the kind of humanitarian access thats needed for Syrian po=
pulations that are caught in the crossfire of that conflict.=20



And weve expressed our concerns on a variety of occasions about the tende=
ncy of Assad regime forces to either prevent convoys of humanitarian good=
s from moving into needed areas -- in some cases, there actually are repo=
rts of Syrian forces essentially raiding those convoys for the supplies t=
hat they would like to have or at least prevent those supplies from reach=
ing the intended audience. So that is a source of significant concern. An=
d one of the reasons that the administration has worked aggressively to h=
old the Assad regime accountable for living up to the commitments that th=
ey made in the context of the cessation of hostilities is to make it easi=
er for those kinds of humanitarian supplies to get to those areas that ba=
dly need it.



 So access for humanitarian relief workers and for humanitarian assistanc=
e continues to be a critical concern not just of the United States but th=
e rest of the international community. And that includes the Assad regime=
 following through on the commitment that theyve made to abide by the ces=
sation of hostilities and create conditions where it's much easier for hu=
manitarian aid workers to get access to communities that have spent years=
 caught in the crossfire.



 Justin.



 Q Vice President Biden, tomorrow, is going to announce the final overtim=
e rule, and the news here is that it's pegged now to the 40th percentile =
in sort of the lowest-paid region of the country rather than the country =
overall. It's about a $3,000 dip. I'm wondering if you can explain why th=
e administration ultimately decided not to extend this benefit to more wo=
rkers.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, the Department of Labor has been considering =
this change to overtime rules for quite some time, and their focus has be=
en on making sure that people are fairly paid, including for their hard w=
ork. And by definition, this is a rule that would apply to the hardest-wo=
rking Americans.



 But this is a rule that continues to be under consideration and is in th=
e process. It has been for some time, and I would expect an announcement =
about a decision soon, but I don't have any information about the conclus=
ions that have been reached at this point. Once theyve made an announceme=
nt, then we can engage in a discussion about why theyve reached the decis=
ion that they have.



 Q Senator Warren wrote a letter to the administration earlier this month=
 and urged you guys that, one, too often the voices of workers are buried=
 beneath a flood of comments from lobbyists and lawyers. If there an eros=
ion here that would leave hundreds of thousands of people without getting=
 that benefit, wouldn't that be a sign that lobbyists and lawyers ended u=
p winning out with the administration?



 MR. EARNEST: No, I think there is a strong track record of this administ=
ration making sure that the rulemaking process represents the best intere=
sts of middle-class families. And that is true when it comes to establish=
ing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that was establis=
hed specifically to look out for the interests consumers that aren't as w=
ell represented in Washington and in the rulemaking process as much large=
r financial institutions that can afford highly paid lobbyists.



 So whether it's the implementation of rules related to Wall Street refor=
m, or the implementation of rules related to health care reform, or the i=
mplementation of rules related to fighting carbon pollution, the administ=
rations track record of protecting the interest of middle-class families =
is rock-solid.



 Q On the 9/11 bill, obviously it's got to pass through the House, but Se=
nator Schumer said today that he believes -- that he would vote to overri=
de the Presidents veto and he thinks that he could have the votes to do t=
hat. Is that a legitimate concern? Are you guys going to start whipping a=
gainst a veto override in the Senate?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, before we get to the question of a veto override ther=
es a question about whether or not this legislation will pass the House. =
So as I noted to Darlene, there are Democrats and Republicans in the Hous=
e of Representatives that have raised concerns about the bill in the same=
 way that the administration has. So we'll engage in a conversation with =
the House of Representatives, and we'll take it from there.



 Q Last one, on Gitmo. You guys released a veto threat against the NDAA y=
esterday, and in it you said specifically that the restrictions preventin=
g you from coming up with an alternative site for Guantanamo Bay was pote=
ntially unconstitutional. That's also the reason that you cited, back a f=
ew months ago when presenting the plan to Congress, for why you couldn't =
say which site would be picked -- your hands were tied because of this re=
striction. So if you believe it's unconstitutional, I guess the question =
is, why not either defy the law and let the courts decide, or challenge t=
he law in the courts to allow you to do this work that you say is necessa=
ry for the President?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, we have made clear that closing the prison at=
 Guantanamo Bay is a top priority, and it's a top priority because taxpay=
er funds could be much more effectively spent in housing those individual=
s in facilities that have already been built here in the United States. A=
nd we could do that -- and in doing so, we could save millions of dollars=
 in taxpayers funds. We've also expressed a concern that is shared by nat=
ional security experts in both parties that extremist organizations use t=
he continued operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting to=
ol. And the President believes that the American people would be safer if=
 we took that recruiting tool, that propaganda tool away from extremist o=
rganizations.=20



 This is all important, particularly when you consider that we've demonst=
rated in this country that we can effectively detain convicted terrorists=
 on American soil in a way that doesnt pose an enhanced security threat t=
o the American people. We've also demonstrated that we can bring terroris=
ts to justice on American soil, using the American criminal justice syste=
m to hold them accountable for their crimes. That would give the United S=
tates the benefit of being able to say we're going to protect the America=
n people and we're going to do it in a way that's entirely consistent wit=
h our values even if our adversaries and our enemies aren't willing to su=
bscribe to those values.=20



 It's a pretty powerful argument and a pretty powerful statement, and som=
ething that makes the American people safer. So that's our motivation.=20=




 And, frankly, what we would like to see, Justin, is wed just like to see=
 Congress get out of the way. In some ways, it's not even a situation -- =
so often -- lets take Zika, for example. To fight Zika and protect the Am=
erican people from Zika we need Congresss affirmative cooperation to do t=
hat. And right now, Republicans, particularly in the House of Representat=
ives, are falling down on the job and putting the American people at grea=
ter risk because they aren't working effectively with the administration =
to fight the Zika virus, because they won't appropriate the emergency fun=
ding.=20



 When it comes to Gitmo, the standard is much lower. We just need Congres=
s to get out of the way. They have, time and time again, included all the=
se restrictions that have prevented the administration from doing what is=
 necessary to protect the American people. So we just need Congress to re=
move those obstacles so that we can move forward effectively in closing t=
he prison at Guantanamo Bay and doing it in a way that will enhance the n=
ational security of the American people.



 Q But I think my question was if you believe the restriction is unconsti=
tutional, and for all the reasons that you just outlined, strongly believ=
e that the prison should be closed, why not either mount a legal challeng=
e or just defy what you see is an unconstitutional restriction?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to our legal strategy. I think the most=
 direct route is not one that winds through the federal courts for years,=
 but rather --



 Q Well, we're in year eight, right, so, you might as well try something,=
 right?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I actually think that that's sort of my point, which =
is we are in year eight, so initiating a years-long legal process is cert=
ainly an option that's available to the administration. I'm not going to =
take it off the table. But given the priority that the President has esta=
blished here, wed like to just see Congress take the steps that are neces=
sary to remove those obstacles so that we can get this important business=
 done. That's the most direct route to accomplishing a national security =
goal that has been advocated by both Democrats and Republicans, including=
 Republican President George W. Bush.



 Olivier.



 Q Thanks, Josh. Staying on Gitmo for a second. The NDAA has a section th=
at would appear to reopen the door to detainees there now to take plea de=
als in Article 3 courts and then be transferred to third countries. Is th=
at something that you guys support? And by how much do you think that wou=
ld reduce the population?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, I haven't considered every single proposal i=
n the NDAA, so let me consult with our policy staff in terms of the way t=
hat proposal is written and get back to you with a position on it.=20



 Q And then on the talks about Syria, John Kerry today said if Assad has =
reached a conclusion that there is no plan B. He has done so without any =
foundation whatsoever and its very dangerous. Its dangerous for whom?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the concern that Secretary Kerry is expressin=
g there is that the longer that President Assad remains in power in Syria=
, the more chaos and violence and division plagues that country. And that=
s why the United States and most of the rest of the international communi=
ty is strongly in favor of executing a political transition inside of Syr=
ia as soon as possible. He has lost the legitimacy to lead that country, =
he continues to order the Syrian military to carry out attacks against in=
nocent, unarmed civilians, and by doing so, he has lost any claim within =
the realm of reason to being able to govern the country of Syria. Just as=
 a practical matter, its hard to imagine that Syrian citizens who are on =
the receiving end of barrel bombs would at all be open to President Assad=
 continuing to lead the country.



 So the longer that he is there, the more dangerous and violent that coun=
try becomes. And thats dangerous for the United States because we know th=
at extremist organizations like ISIL -- and theyre not the only one -- tr=
y to capitalize on that chaos and that violence to establish a safe haven=
 and plot and carry out attacks against targets outside of Syria, includi=
ng areas -- including locations that are important to the United States a=
nd including on the soil of close American allies.



 Chris.



 Q Josh, on the NDAA, the Statement of Administration Policy objects to a=
 provision in the bill that would undermine President Obamas federal -- e=
xecutive order prohibiting anti-LGBT discrimination among federal contrac=
tors. Would that provision alone be enough for the President to veto the =
House version of the NDAA?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, the way that its detailed in the Statement of =
Administration Position that youve clearly reviewed quite closely, theres=
 a long list of concerns that we have with the proposal that Republicans =
have put forward. So at this point, I dont think I can single out any one=
 as being sufficient to garner a presidential veto, and the reason for th=
at is just that there are a whole lot of reasons why the bill is bad and =
why the President strongly opposes it.



 So I think what I can say as a general matter is that the President has =
been forceful in using his executive authority to prevent discrimination =
and the executive order that youve cited is a good example of that. And t=
he President has on a number of occasions protected his ability to use th=
at executive authority in his negotiations with Congress. Because we know=
 that there are some in Congress who, for reasons that seem rather perver=
se to me, believe that the President shouldnt be taking actions to preven=
t discrimination. So Ill leave it to them to explain why thats an appropr=
iate position for them to take. Its one that seems hard -- difficult to j=
ustify, in my opinion. But the President has worked hard to protect his e=
xecutive authority that can be used to prevent discrimination, and thats =
something that we take quite seriously.



 Q How confident are you that the Republican-controlled Congress will pre=
sent the President a version of a defense authorization bill that will om=
it this provision against his executive order?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think its very difficult to predict exactly =
what this Congress will do. But what is true is that there are a long lis=
t of reasons why we have strong concerns about the way that the NDA legis=
lation is currently written, and were hopeful that Republicans will begin=
 to make some changes.



 After all, this is their responsibility. Republicans have a strong major=
ity in the House of Representatives. Republicans have a strong majority i=
n the United States Senate. So, ultimately, its Republicans who need to c=
arry the weight of figuring out how to ensure that our national security =
professionals and our men and women in uniform have the authority and fun=
ding that they need to protect the country.=20



So this is a basic function of the United States Congress. Its unfortunat=
e that it is being larded up with a bunch of proposals like the one that =
you just cited that arent related to our national security but are intend=
ed to be divisive. And we hope that at some point Republicans in Congress=
 will act responsibly to put forward a funding authorization proposal tha=
t is consistent with our national security interests.



 Lesley.



 Q Thanks, Josh, appreciate it. I wanted to ask you, going back to the di=
rective on Friday, on the bathrooms, transgender bathrooms. Theres an imp=
ression that the administration has been particularly aggressive on trans=
gender issues, sort of more so than it was on gay marriage before the Pre=
sidents evolution in 2012. Im just wondering if you see that reflecting s=
ociety or if thats an administrative decision?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I dont think I would describe our position that way f=
or a variety of reasons. I think the first is, this is a confrontation th=
at Republicans have sought out, rather cynically, because they are seekin=
g a political advantage. So its the Republicans in the North Carolina leg=
islature, for example, that convened a one-day special session to ram thr=
ough HB2, the now infamous HB2 in North Carolina so that it could be quic=
kly passed in both houses of the legislature and then signed into law by =
the governor of that state. They have since walked back some aspects of t=
hat bill in the face of significant criticism, particularly from the busi=
ness community, and its clear that its had a negative impact on the econo=
mic climate in North Carolina.



 So the comments that weve seen from Republicans in other places I think =
makes clear that theyre not really interested in helping schools across t=
he country confront what is a difficult policy challenge; theyd rather ju=
st cynically try to appeal to peoples fears in order to try and gin up po=
litical support for their campaigns.



 And thats not the approach that the administration is taking, and in fac=
t, I think this was evident from the guidance that was issued by the Depa=
rtment of Education on Friday, that in response to specific requests from=
 school administrators across the country, the Department of Education pu=
t forward best practices and good ideas with regard to how schools can im=
plement this policy in a way that will protect the dignity and safety of =
every student at the school. And these werent just ideas that were develo=
ped by administrators in Washington, D.C. -- these are actually ideas tha=
t were developed by school administrators across the country who had foun=
d workable solutions that could be successfully applied in their schools.=
 And sharing those ideas with school administrators across the country is=
 a tangible, constructive offer of assistance that I think the majority o=
f school administrators appreciated.=20



 And thats not the kind of constructive contribution that weve seen from =
conservatives. From conservatives, you basically have seen the suggestion=
 that they dont really have a way of -- they havent really put forward a =
specific suggestion for how they believe that the rules should be applied=
. The best that they seem to have come up with is suggesting that birth c=
ertificates should be examined before anyone can enter a public bathroom.=
 So that doesnt make sense. That certainly is an indication that they are=
 much more interested in politics than they are in actually trying to sol=
ve the problem.



 Q But you said that the directive was not necessarily brought about by t=
he North Carolina law. So Im wondering if the administration has made a c=
oncerted effort -- I mean, the Wall Street Journal calls it an effort to =
start a culture war to drive voter turnout in November -- I mean, if they=
ve made a decision to sort of be more aggressive on these measures.=20



 MR. EARNEST: I dont make a habit of reading the editorial page of the Wa=
ll Street Journal I think for obvious reasons, but I did happen to take a=
 look at it today, and I noticed that the editorial also noted that someh=
ow Democrats appeared to be obsessed with sex, which I thought was a rath=
er amusing observation on their part because its Republicans who have, fo=
r example, passed this HB2 law in North Carolina. Its Republicans in the =
Congress that have created a special congressional committee to take a lo=
ok at Planned Parenthood. Its Republicans who have sued the administratio=
n over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, including as it rel=
ates to women being able to get access to their birth control. So its a c=
urious observation by the Wall Street Journal that I dont think stands up=
 to a lot of scrutiny.



 Q Getting back to the President, is he making more of a decision to be m=
ore forceful on these issues than he had been back in 2012 when he was cr=
iticized for being sort of slow on gay marriage?



 MR. EARNEST: No, I don't think so. And again, I think that at every stag=
e, it's this administration that fought for and successfully ended don't =
ask, don't tell. It's this administration that declined to continue defen=
ding the Defense of Marriage Act as litigation contesting that law wound =
its way through the courts.=20



 So, again, I think as it relates to this issue, it is clear that it's Re=
publicans who are seeking a political advantage and an administration tha=
t is seeking to offer tangible, practical advice to school administrators=
 who are seeking to protect the safety and dignity of every student at th=
eir school.



 Julie.



 Q Thanks, Josh. On lifting sanctions on Burma, the Treasury Department a=
nnounced today you're going to be lifting a variety of those sanctions to=
morrow. But the President did say that the national emergency is going to=
 continue and called Burma an extraordinary threat. So I wonder if you co=
uld tell us whether the President feels like the human rights situation i=
n Myanmar warrants this action, and whether you might like to see some mo=
re progress on that front before additional sanctions come off.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, lets start by saying that the U.S. government announc=
ed steps to support Burmas new democratic government, including the recal=
ibration of sanctions on Burma, to demonstrate support for the new govern=
ments democratic reforms and the broad-based economic development.=20



 Theres no denying the important political process that has been made in =
Burma, and the United States has been strongly supportive of the Burmese =
people and Burmese government as they pursue these reforms. One high-prof=
ile piece of evidence about that progress was the election that was condu=
cted just in the last few months that allowed for the peaceful democratic=
 transfer of power. It's an important development in that countrys histor=
y and is indicative of the important progress that theyre making in pursu=
ing long overdue political reforms.



 At the same time, the United States wants to continue to further incenti=
vize democratic reforms and continue to pressure targeted individuals and=
 entities, including the military, so that work of reforming that governm=
ent continues. There obviously is more work that needs to be done, and th=
e sanctions that remain in place do serve to pressure those entities that=
 may be advocating for rolling back some of those reforms.



 So the government has made important progress. We want them to build on =
that momentum. And that's why the recalibrated sanctions announcement wil=
l move forward. But there still are entities that are obstacles to needed=
 reform and we continue to apply pressure against those entities so that =
we can hopefully nurture the continued progress that Burma has met.



 Q But if you still think that there are concerns as it relates to human =
rights and the militarys control and the government potentially rolling b=
ack the progress theyve made, wouldn't it be wiser to wait until you see =
some more of that progress before you go lifting sanctions?



 MR. EARNEST: Again, I think that's why we've described it as recalibrati=
ng the sanctions rather than lifting them, because --=20



 Q -- entities that you listed, though.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, for discussion of specific entities and what i=
mpact they may have had on political reforms, I'd refer you to the Treasu=
ry Department. They can sort of walk you through our policy towards speci=
fic entities. But most of the remaining sanctions are primarily intended =
to discourage economic activity with certain individuals and entities, pa=
rticularly those who undermine or obstruct political reform in Burma, com=
mit human rights abuses in Burma, or propagate military trade with North =
Korea.=20



 Those are the entities that are targeted. And I think for those reasons,=
 continuing to apply those sanctions makes sense. At the same time, it's =
also important to recognize the progress that Burma has made, and by reca=
librating the sanctions and easing the sanctions against some entities in=
 Burma, we acknowledge the important progress that theyve made and furthe=
r incentivize additional reforms.=20



 So that's the recalibration strategy that's been applied in this instanc=
e.=20



 Michelle.



 Q Okay, so the White House has now issued several strongly worded warnin=
gs about the 9/11 bill to members of Congress. And youve come out publicl=
y and said these exact same things before. But today, when this bill pass=
ed on a voice vote, there was no opposition. So doesnt that tell you that=
 theres just as strong a feeling even from the Presidents own party that =
this is a legitimate concern, and that the needs of these families to at =
least bring their claims to a court are more important than some indeterm=
inate risk that some other country could do something similar to the U.S.=
?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, look, the administration is strongly committed to ass=
isting the 9/11 families, and there are a variety of ways in which this a=
dministration has gone to bat for 9/11 families and those who did such im=
portant work around Ground Zero to recover and rebuild in the aftermath o=
f the 9/11 attacks. I have in mind, of course, the legislation that on a =
number of occasions got bottled up in the Congress to ensure that those w=
ho performed so heroically at Ground Zero were able to get access to heal=
th care.=20



 So the administrations commitment to our nations national security and t=
o those who lost the most on 9/11 is steadfast. And our commitment to tho=
se principles will not change.=20



 But we have to acknowledge the significant unintended consequences of mo=
ving forward with a piece of legislation like this. And this is a concern=
 that's not just expressed by the Democratic administration; there are Re=
publicans in Congress who have also expressed concerns about this in the =
past. So this is a sensitive issue, and I would acknowledge that the poli=
tics are tough. But focusing on the substance, we need to make sure that =
we don't overlook the potential unintended consequences of a bill that co=
uld put the United States at risk around the world. That is a dangerous p=
roposition and one that the Commander-in-Chief I think is rightly concern=
ed about.



 Q So it just seems like Democrats in the Senate, by there being zero opp=
osition on this bill, it seems like theyre sending a message to the White=
 House that the concerns of the White House aren't as important. Whats yo=
ur response to that?



 MR. EARNEST: I'll let them explain their position and I'll let them expl=
ain why they did not object to a proposal that has significant, though, a=
dmittedly, unintended consequences. But, look, the accusation here is not=
 that somebody in Congress voting for this legislation is seeking to inte=
ntionally inflict harm against the United States. Our concern is that tha=
t is an unintended consequence of this particular piece of this legislati=
on. And it's the responsibility of the President of the United States and=
 the Commander-in-Chief to look out for the interests of the United State=
s and our servicemembers and diplomats around the world.



 The concern that we have is that other countries could use the passage o=
f this bill as an excuse to initiate their own proceedings in their own c=
ourts that puts the United States uniquely at risk.



 Q Are you disappointed that Democrats in the Senate didnt voice the same=
 concerns or oppose this bill that the White House is --=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, look, we oppose the bill, so we obviously are not ple=
ased to see it move forward in the Senate. But we're going to engage with=
 the bipartisan members in the House of Representatives who have expresse=
d similar concerns and see if we can ensure that they are addressed as th=
is legislative process moves forward.=20



 Q In the past, youve urged members of Congress not to proceed because th=
is could have ramifications. So the fact that it has now passed the Senat=
e, are there ramifications to that alone in terms of the relationship wit=
h Saudi Arabia or anything else?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, as I think as we discussed when the President travele=
d to Saudi Arabia a few weeks ago, the President had a long bilateral mee=
ting with the King of Saudi Arabia and the issue of this legislation was =
not raised. And I think it is an indication of the fact that right now, a=
t least, this legislation is not interfering with our ability to coordina=
te with the Saudi Arabian government on a range of issues of mutual conce=
rn.=20



But our broader concern is about the potential, unintended consequence th=
at the passage of this legislation would bring about, and that is basical=
ly giving other countries an excuse to subject the United States of Ameri=
ca to what could just be kangaroo courts in other countries. And it puts =
the United States in a situation where we spend a lot of time and energy =
and resources going and defending the United States in foreign courts. Th=
ats not a good use of our time. Its also certainly not a good use of our =
diplomatic capital. These kinds of cases would just serve as an additiona=
l irritant in our relations with countries around the world.



 So, again, we believe that these kinds of concerns are the kinds of conc=
erns that should be taken into account by every member of Congress as the=
y consider their position on this bill.



 Q The families out a statement saying, well, the big difference here -- =
theyre sort of dissecting the arguments that the White House has made, an=
d they said, well, the difference here is that the U.S. doesnt support te=
rrorist organizations that target civilians. So if this bill is so narrow=
ly tailored to involve just terror attacks on U.S. soil, and you look at =
the argument that those families are making, is that really such a huge r=
isk that somebody would do something similar? If youre just looking at th=
at specific instance, of targeting civilians on our soil in this case? An=
d obviously Democrats in the Senate dont agree that that risk is --



 MR. EARNEST: Well, look, I do understand what youre saying. And, look, I=
 think that the concern is about potential unintended consequences. There=
 are a number of countries around the world that do falsely accuse the Un=
ited States of engaging in acts of terrorism that result in the death of =
innocent civilians. There are other countries that publicly make that acc=
usation on a regular basis, and if they now have a precedent for establis=
hing their own method of bringing the United States into court and puttin=
g at risk U.S. assets that are held overseas, even as they prosecute thos=
e false claims in a kangaroo court, thats not a path that we want to go d=
own.



 The other concern, Michelle, is exactly how that system could work. You =
can imagine a scenario where somebody whos injured or wounded overseas is=
 brought back to the United States for medical treatment and then they di=
e. That could potentially open up the United States or other countries, i=
ncluding our allies, to claims in an American court because that individu=
al died on American soil. And this is the thing. I mean, our court system=
 is such that you dont have to be an American citizen in order to file su=
it in an American court. I recognize that these are hypotheticals, but th=
ey are potential, unintended consequences that are quite serious. And tha=
ts the basis of our concern about this bill. The potential, unintended co=
nsequences that have and could have a very negative effect on U.S. nation=
al security, could put at risk the United States, our assets, and our per=
sonnel in countries all around the world.



 Ron.



 Q So is this just a closed matter again, the whole issue of 9/11? Becaus=
e obviously youre talking about unintended consequences, and the families=
 are concerned about finally trying to figure out exactly what happened. =
And youve said before I think on Saudi Arabia that the investigation show=
ed there was no Saudi connection, the 28 pages. Others have said that thi=
s is not significant information -- just like the furor about it. So do y=
ou say to the families essentially that -- oh, and also, you seem to say =
that there are some changes to the legislation that Congress didnt consid=
er that might have made it more palatable to the administration. Is there=
 some way to reconcile this whole concern about sovereign immunity and th=
e families concern? Or is this really just the end of it as far as the ad=
ministration is concerned?



 MR. EARNEST: Its certainly not the end of it. Theres a lot to unpack the=
re. Lets start by -- there was a commission, an outside -- a commission o=
f experts established outside the government to examine the attacks of 9/=
11, to take a look at what conditions led up to the attacks, what exactly=
 transpired on that fateful day, and what sort of reforms could be implem=
ented to ensure something like that never happens again. Its that outside=
 group, the 9/11 Commission, that carefully examined all of the available=
 evidence and concluded that theres no evidence to indicate that the Saud=
i government as an institution supported the 9/11 plotters.=20



 So thats not some sort of government conspiracy -- this is an outside or=
ganization, staffed by experts that took a close look at this. And those =
-- the leaders of that commission themselves reviewed the 28 pages. They =
have acknowledged that 28 pages included preliminary investigatory materi=
als that they had an opportunity to pursue. And that as a result of readi=
ng those 28 pages, they conducted interviews -- not just in the United St=
ates but in other countries around the world to follow up on those potent=
ial leads.



 And despite having read those 28 pages and despite having acted on them =
by pursuing investigations that that information could point to, they sti=
ll concluded that the Saudi government as an institution didnt support th=
e 9/11 plotters. So I think there is no denying that that part of it has =
been exhaustively investigated. Im not saying this to suggest that someho=
w thats going to ease the pain of somebody who lost a loved one or severa=
l loved ones on 9/11.



 Our heart breaks for those people. These are thousands of Americans who =
walk around every day with a hole in their heart because they lost a love=
d one on that tragic day. And trying to make sense of that and trying to =
move on with ones life is something that many of them have been challenge=
d to do, and theyve demonstrated tremendous patriotism and heroism as the=
yve moved on with their lives.=20



And in some cases, were talking about parents who have had to raise kids =
on their own. In some cases, were talking about first-responders who have=
 continued to fight fires and respond to emergencies, even with the memor=
y of their partner in the back of their mind. So theres no denying the he=
roism of the 9/11 families. And there is no denying the courage that they=
 have shown every single day since 9/11.=20



But what were focused on here -- and I think what the families are genuin=
ely focused on as well -- is the national security of the United States a=
nd making sure that the United States of America continues to preserve th=
e ability to protect our interests around the globe. They understand that=
 our capacity to do that is critical to preventing terrorist attacks on A=
merican soil. So the Presidents priority is not different than the priori=
ty thats been identified by the 9/11 families when it comes to protecting=
 the United States of America and protecting our men and women in uniform=
 and our diplomats as they serve our country around the world.



 Q So did I hear you correctly that there were some changes that could ha=
ve made that could have reconciled this whole concern about sovereign imm=
unity? Or did I -- in terms of the way these bills were written -- or is =
this just not a reconcilable situation?=20



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the reason that we are going to talk to Democr=
ats and Republicans in Congress is to figure out if there is a way to add=
ress the serious concerns that are raised by these potential, unintended =
consequences. I dont know if thats possible at this point, but we certain=
ly are willing to engage in a bipartisan conversation to make that happen=
 if its possible.



 Q On the TSA -- theres been a lot written lately about long lines at air=
ports and people being really inconvenienced. I saw a study that said the=
 morale in Homeland Security is the lowest in the federal government; the=
res high turnover. The summer season is coming up. And while thats an inc=
onvenience to travelers and all that, how much of a security risk is ther=
e now? Is it greater? Is there a concern in the administration that becau=
se of this tension on the system, to put it mildly, that there is now a g=
reater concern about security lapses, perhaps, at airports around the cou=
ntry?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, you probably should talk to somebody at the TSA to dr=
aw a definitive conclusion about that. I think what I would just state is=
 the significant challenge that TSA officers face, which is they dont wan=
t to inconvenience people. They know people are just trying to get on the=
ir flight and do their business or go home to see their family or go on v=
acation or whatever it is that theyre doing. But they want to make sure t=
hat people can engage in that travel safely.=20



And so theres always going to be a little tension in making sure that wer=
e doing thorough checks and making sure that we are protecting the integr=
ity of the aviation system while also at the same time giving people the =
freedom to use that aviation system without a whole lot of hassle and inc=
onvenience. And resolving that tension is challenging, and there are a nu=
mber of creative things that the TSA has tried to do -- the establishment=
 of pre-check, which allows some individuals to go and essentially go thr=
ough a background check thats conducted by the government so that they ca=
n go through an expedited security line. Thats one example.



 We know that the TSA has been working closely with airports to see if ai=
rports can actually commit to using airport personnel to expedite the pro=
cess. So, Ron, as a reporter, youve had to travel through a lot of airpor=
ts. Its not uncommon for TSA officers to help people navigate the screeni=
ng process by loading materials into trays and getting into the right lin=
e. So thats not necessarily a core security function so what you could do=
 is the TSA could coordinate with airport staff so that when lines get lo=
ng or volumes are expected to be high, that its airport personnel that do=
nt have a security function that can help people manage the security proc=
ess so that all of the security-trained people can be involved in the act=
ual screening.



 So my point is that theres always going to be a little tension here in t=
he basic function of the TSA. And the TSA, to their credit, has worked ha=
rd to try to be creative about developing solutions that would make this =
process more efficient and not inconvenience travelers as greatly while a=
lso adhering to the high security standards that I think we all would dem=
and.



 Q Right, but, again, the long lines have revealed that there seems to be=
 staffing problems. Theres a high turnover rate; theres low morale. And t=
he question is, to what extent is all of that potentially compromising sa=
fety at the airports? Is there a concern in the administration, has there=
 been some focus in trying to make sure -- well, you do this on a daily b=
asis -- but given where we are in the last month or so of this particular=
 phenomenon of these long lines, has there been some targeted effort focu=
sed to make sure that this is not causing security problems, beyond the i=
nconvenience?



 MR. EARNEST: Even in the face of these significant challenges, the profe=
ssionals at the TSA are committed to the safety and security of the Ameri=
can traveling public. And they maintain these very high standards because=
 theyre concerned about safety, and youre right that this is something th=
at they are reviewing safety standards and security standards regularly, =
daily, to ensure that those high standards are being met. And theyre doin=
g all that even though on average the TSA is now screening about 125,000 =
more passengers per day. And there has been an effort by the TSA to exped=
ite the processing of the newest class of TSA officers. There has been an=
 effort on the part of TSA to get Congress to approve funds that could be=
 reallocated so that additional overtime pay can be paid to the TSA offic=
ers so that they can be paid for working longer hours and therefore try t=
o shorten lines.



 So, again, theres a lot of work thats going into trying to be creative a=
bout how to not inconvenience travelers unduly while also maintaining the=
 strict safety and security standards that the American people would expe=
ct.



 Byron.



 Q Thanks, Josh. Has the President or the White House been tracking whats=
 happening -- or what happened in Nevada at the Democratic State Conventi=
on there? Sanders supporters were reportedly making death threats against=
 the state party chair to the point where the state party actually filed =
a complaint with the DNC. Does the White House have a reaction? And obvio=
usly theres a lot of emotion around this primary process still. Is it tim=
e for the President to sort of step in and calm the waters and help unify=
 the party, moving into the final stage?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, as it relates to the delegate selection process for i=
ndividual states, I would refer you to the DNC. They have a very well-est=
ablished process whereby they review the plans that are put forward by in=
dividual states for choosing their delegates to the convention and every =
state does it differently, and that makes the process a little cumbersome=
 but its the way that each state retains control over the process for sel=
ecting delegates to the Democratic Convention.



 But I think at the same time, youve heard the President on a number of o=
ccasions talk about how political disputes can never justify an act of vi=
olence. And the President talked about this in his speech at the Rutgers =
commencement ceremony just on Sunday, about the importance of good citize=
nship, about the importance of focusing on facts and evidence, and how th=
e establishment of our political system was intended to resolve disputes =
among our citizens to prevent violence from occurring in the first place.=




 And I think what is true is the expectation that the President has that =
there will be a strong commitment to that principle of nonviolence. And t=
he way that candidates in both parties address this question publicly is =
important and Im confident its something that people all across the count=
ry will carefully watch.



 Q Is the White House disturbed by the behavior of not only members of hi=
s own party making death threats against the state party chair over what =
is, essentially, as you characterized it, a political dispute?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I havent looked at the individual claims that have be=
en made, but I think the President on a number of occasions has spoken ou=
t against violence and has certainly said that a political dispute like t=
his can never be justified or used to justify an act of violence or even =
a threat of violence. And that is a principle that he has championed for =
a long time and his expectation would be that politicians in both parties=
, whether theyre involved in an election or not, would express their supp=
ort for that principle.



 Q One more on the Presidents legacy on special interest. Roll Call yeste=
rday reported that a Republican lobbyist is trying to organize other lobb=
yists on behalf of Hillary Clinton. Shes had lobbyist bundlers. Donald Tr=
ump has hired some ex--foreign government lobbyists into his campaign. Th=
e President banned lobbyists from donating to his campaign and the DNC. N=
o current 2016 campaign has embraced that pledge. Even Bernie Sanders sor=
t of made this a key issue. Is the President worried that his legacy on t=
his issue is being eroded?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, I think the authenticity of the change that Pr=
esident Obama brought to Washington has been confirmed in what you just r=
elayed. And it's an indication of how difficult it is to change our polit=
ical system, particularly when it comes to confronting entrenched special=
 interests and the President is quite proud of his record of doing that. =
And the truth is, its going to be up to the next President to determine e=
xactly how to build on that progress. And presumably there are a variety =
of ways to do that, and I think that will be part of the debate -- not ju=
st through the summer but also into the fall. But these principles of ens=
uring that citizens retain a voice in their government is something that =
the President has made a high priority.



 John.



 Q Over the past week, youve had some pointed words from the podium about=
 Republicans use of this $100 billion figure in regard to the Iran nuclea=
r deal. Ive gone back and asked them about it, and they basically point t=
o the administrations own use of it last summer, back in July, and a few =
instances from the Treasury Department, from Secretary Kerry, President O=
bama in an interview with The Atlantic. Where did the administration, whe=
n they were initially using that figure before the deal was finalized, wh=
ere was that coming from?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, John, what I can tell you is that there were initial =
estimates about the amount of money that Iran had in reserves outside of =
their country that were subject to sanctions. And this is essentially mon=
ey that Iran was not able to get access to because of the sanctions that =
we had put in place to compel them to come to the negotiating table. And =
those sanctions did have the effect of bringing Iran to the negotiating t=
able and ultimately pressuring Iran to sign on the dotted line of an agre=
ement that verifiably prevents them from acquiring a nuclear weapon. That=
 was a genuine success.



 Now, what the Secretary of the Treasury and others repeatedly tried to e=
xplain is how much money Iran was likely to get access to -- that much of=
 those funds that were held overseas were basically already spoken for in=
 terms of debts that Iran had already sort of -- they had already incurre=
d. And what critics of the deal have suggested is that Iran would get all=
 that money and be flush with cash and then use it for terrorism. And wev=
e said that the critics were vastly exaggerating that risk. That was the =
essence of the debate at the time is we were trying to explain exactly wh=
at would happen here. And they did vastly overstate that risk in a way th=
at they continue to repeat. And theyre wrong about it. Ted Cruz just wrot=
e an op-ed in the New York Times repeating this claim. Its not uncommon t=
o come across Republicans spouting off this false claim, and the truth is=
, whats happened is we actually see officials in Iran saying they didnt g=
et nearly as much sanctions relief as they thought they would.



 Around the time of the negotiations, it was actually the Iran Central Ba=
nk Governor who came forward and said that they expected that Iran would =
get $30 billion in sanctions relief. And I think based on the tone and th=
e comments from Iranian officials, they havent even met them that far. So=
 thats the essence of the way in which Republicans repeatedly misled the =
American public when talking about the Iran deal or just didnt know what =
they were talking about.



 So its not just as it relates to sanctions relief where what Republicans=
 said didnt turn out to be true. Many of them, at the very beginning of t=
his exercise, said that it didnt make sense for the United States and the=
 international community to negotiate with Iran over their nuclear progra=
m because theyd never go along with the deal. They were wrong about that.=
=20



And many of our critics have suggested that Iran would never make -- take=
 the kind of actions that are consistent with rolling back key aspects of=
 their nuclear program. But yet thats exactly what they did. They reduced=
 their uranium stockpile by 98 percent. They rendered harmless their heav=
y water reactor. They disconnected thousands of centrifuges.=20



And Republicans, critics of the deal suggested that the international com=
munity would never be able to verify Irans compliance with the agreement.=
 But, in fact, the nuclear experts at the IAEA -- an organization thats w=
on the Nobel Peace Prize, I might point out -- has verified Irans complia=
nce with the agreement. So critics of the deal who predicted that we woul=
d never be able to verify that Iran was going along with the agreement ar=
e wrong, or at least on the wrong side of an argument with internationall=
y renowned nuclear experts.=20



So the list of concerns that we have here with the way that Republicans h=
ave conducted this debate is lengthy and I can certainly understand why R=
epublicans appear quite desperate to try to recapture what credibility th=
ey have left.



 Q And despite that characterization, isnt it about the money being freed=
 up for Iran to use their other resources towards other programs? I mean,=
 it's the money that the sanctions relief is going towards, these debts t=
hat theyve already incurred and paying those off, isnt that freeing up an=
other pocket of money they could use? Isnt that kind of the Republicans p=
oint that theyve got access now to a broader fund? Or is your point just =
that they wouldnt have paid off those debts in the first place?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, my point is that they werent paying off those debts, =
and then when the money was freed, some of them have gone to doing exactl=
y that. So theres no evidence that anybody can marshal that thats exactly=
 -- Republicans cannot demonstrate that what they predicted came true. Bu=
t I can certainly substantiate the fact, even in the claims made by Irani=
ans themselves who are responsible for managing their economy, theyve exp=
ressed concern about the fact that they havent gotten as much sanctions r=
elief as they expected to get. And they acknowledged a much lower level o=
f sanctions relief than what Republicans said was likely to happen -- to =
say nothing of the many Republicans who I can point to who said that Iran=
 was going to get $150 billion in sanctions relief, a number that was com=
pletely unsubstantiated. And then youve got somebody like Congressman Ste=
ve Scalise who said that Iran would get hundreds of billions of dollars i=
n sanctions relief. So it appears he might have a little baggage when dis=
cussing the truth about the Iran deal.



 Q So whats the bottom line? Whats the total figure? You said it was far =
less than $100 billion, but has Treasury come up with an estimate? Or are=
 you relying on what the Iranians have said publicly?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have an assessment to share with you. You certainly=
 can check with the Treasury Department and maybe theyll know.



 Q And my final question was, Senators Cornyn, Barrasso, and Mark Kirk --=
 they wrote a letter to the President yesterday regarding Ben Rhodes, cal=
ling on the President to fire him. You said that the President stands by =
his Deputy National Security Advisor. Whats your response to the letter? =
Whats the Presidents response to the letter?



 MR. EARNEST: The publicity stunt that Senator Kirk attempted one week ag=
o today -- I think pretty much everybody ignored it then, and I'm going t=
o ignore it now.



 Dave.



 Q Josh, thanks. Back on the Zika bill in the House. The White House wasn=
t just saying that you don't want to offset the money from the Ebola fund=
, you're saying you don't want to offset the money for Zika from anywhere=
 else in the budget. In a $4 trillion budget, why are you insisting that =
there be no offsets for this Zika relief?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, this is typically the way, Dave, that Congress has co=
nsidered emergency appropriations, which is that they, recognizing the ex=
istence of an emergency, Congress has not gotten bogged down in political=
 fights related to pay-fors. Demonstrating a sense of urgency, most Congr=
esses, when confronted with a public health emergency, would consult with=
 public health experts and consider carefully what sort of assistance sho=
uld be provided and they would provide it. And that's what we believe tha=
t this Congress should do.



 Q On the Ben Rhodes matter, obviously he didnt go to the hearing today t=
o testify like the committee wanted. Can you explain why last week you sa=
id this has nothing to do with executive privilege and today Neil Egglest=
on said, oh, yes, it does have to do with --



 MR. EARNEST: No, he didnt. That word does not appear in the letter. And =
my good friends at the House Government Oversight Committee posted that l=
etter on the website, so you can certainly check it out for yourself. But=
 the White House counsel did not raise that prospect.



 Q So why didnt he go?



 MR. EARNEST: Because theres longstanding concerns that we have expressed=
 and that previous Presidents have expressed when it comes to declining a=
 request to voluntarily testify based on institutional concerns. The Pres=
ident of the United States should be able to get confidential, candid adv=
ice from his top advisors. And this is a principle that basically every P=
resident has observed.=20



I would note that at least one of the individuals who did testify before =
the House Oversight Committee today served in the previous administration=
 and invoked exactly the same concern -- because he had almost exactly th=
e same title as Mr. Rhodes -- in explaining why he wouldn't testify befor=
e Congress. So this is an indication that its not a partisan matter, but =
rather a longstanding institutional difference of opinion between Congres=
s and the executive branch.



Q Isn't that asserting executive privilege without saying the words?=20



MR. EARNEST: No. Executive privilege applies specifically to situations w=
hen the President of the United States acts to protect information that i=
s compelled by Congress. This was a specific request for testimony on a v=
oluntary basis. So on one hand, youve got information that Congress is co=
mpelling; on the other hand, youve got testimony that was requested. So t=
he principle is different. And that is evident in the letter, so I would =
encourage you to check it out.



Q If I could overstay my welcome for one more.=20



MR. EARNEST: You're not overstaying your welcome.=20



Q The Senate Democrats tomorrow are going to hold whats called a hearing =
on Chief Judge Garland because there is no nomination hearing yet. Did th=
e White House participate in arranging this in any way? Do you think it's=
 a good idea? And isn't it a clear sign that the nomination just isn't go=
ing anywhere?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I did hear that the Judiciary Committee is planning a =
hearing for tomorrow. And obviously the White House has been coordinating=
 closely with Democrats and Republicans on the committee to try to move t=
hat process forward. But as it relates to the individuals who are testify=
ing before the committee tomorrow, I'd refer you to the members of the co=
mmittee to talk to you about it.



Q Is this a sign that things are just not going well, that this nominatio=
n is dead?



MR. EARNEST: No, the fact is Chief Judge Garland has got another six meet=
ings over the course of this week. Hes met with 15 Republicans. Hes submi=
tted his questionnaire and members of the Judiciary Committee have posted=
 that questionnaire publicly on their website. So we continue to apply pr=
essure to Republicans. The President did an interview with BuzzFeed just =
yesterday, talking about why this is a critically important issue. And we=
're going to continue to raise pressure on Republicans. And all of the pu=
blically available data that I've seen indicates that it's not just Democ=
rats and independents who are dissatisfied with the position that many Re=
publican senators are taking, but many Republican voters across the count=
ry are expressing concern with the way that Republicans in the Senate are=
 refusing to do their job.



Margaret.



Q Josh, Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, was spotted leaving the White Ho=
use. Can you tell us anything about why he was here?



MR. EARNEST: I'll see if I can get you some more information about what h=
e was doing while he was here. He obviously is somebody who has had an op=
portunity to interact with the President in the past. He participated in =
a forum with President Obama at the G20 in Malaysia where they talked abo=
ut the global economy and the impact that climate change is having on the=
 way that businesses, large and small, around the world are confronting c=
limate change.



But I'll see if we can get you some more information about his visit.



Q Also if it relates in any way to our trip to Asia.



MR. EARNEST: Okay.



Q Also, going back to I guess it's technically called the Justice Against=
 Sponsors of Terrorism Act -- this passed Senate bill, it's not just abou=
t Saudi Arabia. It opens up I guess litigation against any other state, w=
hich is your concern about sovereign immunity there. From what -- you're =
saying from the podium, youve said focus on the substance, look at the fa=
cts. Are you saying that, in that sense, one of the most emotionally erod=
ed living memories in American history is being used for political purpos=
es and in some ways overshadowing the substance of a bill that youve desc=
ribed as perhaps potentially dangerous to American interests? I mean, are=
 you going that far to say that this one issue is overshadowing all the o=
ther ways that this bill could become a problem for the U.S. or other cou=
ntries?



MR. EARNEST: Well, theres no denying the charged, emotional nature of thi=
s issue and why the discussion of this particular legislation could arous=
e particularly strong feelings. I'm not going to question the motive of t=
he people who may be involved in supporting this bill. I'm just merely po=
inting out the source of the concerns that we've expressed.=20



This bill does potentially open up the United States to a range of uninte=
nded consequences that would be bad for our national security. It would b=
e bad for our ability to continue to coordinate with our allies, make tha=
t even harder, and it could risk -- put at risk the United States, our as=
sets, and maybe even our personnel in countries and courts all around the=
 world.



So that's the source of our concern. This is a concern that we've repeate=
dly expressed. And that's the reason we oppose the bill. It's not because=
 we question the motives of those who are involved in trying to promote t=
he bill. Our concerns are substantive and relate specifically to the pote=
ntial of unintended consequences.



Q And not specifically about Saudi Arabia, which is the only country we'v=
e discussed here?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think that's because the advocates of the bill are s=
uggesting that they want to create an opportunity that --



Q -- played it in some way that this is some sort of special treatment or=
 that this is being treated differently because of Saudi Arabia, versus, =
say, the Supreme Court decision that was just recently upheld regarding s=
uing Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism, which the administration has s=
upported. So can you explain the difference, I guess?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the difference is, is that there is this small=
 class of countries that are confirmed state sponsors of terrorism that a=
re in a separate category from every other country. And, yes, that includ=
es Iran. We do know that Iran uses assets of the state to support terrori=
sm around the world, including terrorism that has claimed the lives of Am=
erican citizens.=20



So we do treat Iran differently from every other country. Iran and other =
countries that are confirmed state sponsors of terrorism are treated diff=
erently than every other country, including Saudi Arabia that's not.



Q So you don't see the position to be supportive of the Supreme Court uph=
olding being able to sue Iran and a position opposing this bill because i=
t could compromise sovereign immunity as contradictory in any way?



MR. EARNEST: No, because there is this special exception that does apply =
to confirmed state sponsors of terrorism, and Iran is one of them.



Q Question for you on -- an amendment from Congressman Thornberry specifi=
cally trying to cap the number of NSC officials at 100. It's being sugges=
ted that power is too concentrated in the hands of too few located in thi=
s building and not other assets of national security establishment. Do yo=
u have any comment on that?



MR. EARNEST: Well, a couple observations I guess. I think the first is th=
e Presidents current National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, has actually =
undertaken an effort to try to streamline and reform certain functions of=
 the National Security Council that have allowed her to reduce the size o=
f the National Security Council by about I believe 10 percent or so. And =
I think that's the first thing.



I think the second thing is theres no denying the wide array of significa=
nt national security challenges that any President of the United States c=
onfronts when they walk into the Oval Office every morning. And ensuring =
that that President has access to the expertise and advice that he needs =
to deal with those challenges is an important priority. And the desire of=
 some Republicans to try to limit the ability of the next President to ma=
ke foreign policy decisions may reflect their lack of confidence in their=
 prospects for the next presidential election.



Kevin.



Q Thanks, Josh. Maybe you covered this. I was out a couple days last week=
. But transgender Americans as it relates to White House facilities and o=
ther government facilities, be that the State Department, elsewhere -- th=
eyre able to use the restroom of their gender identity without restrictio=
n, and that's always been the way, correct?=20



MR. EARNEST: I don't know that it's always been that way, but it's certai=
nly been that way in the Obama administration.



Q Okay. Is the President aware of the readiness issues as it relates to t=
he United States military?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, there certainly are a number of things that we =
believe that Congress has proposed to do that would have a direct impact =
on our military readiness. There are a whole range of programs that Congr=
ess repeatedly funds that our military leaders say that we don't need, an=
d there are a whole set of national security priorities that our military=
 leaders have said are worthy of an investment from Congress that have be=
en underfunded by the United States Congress.



So there are a number of things that the President and our military leade=
rs believe that we could do that would enhance our readiness, and there a=
re a number of things that Congress shouldnt do that would degrade our re=
adiness. And so there are concerns about the way that Congress handles it=
s business with respect to the military.=20



But I can tell you that the President of the United States is quite proud=
 of the finest fighting force that the world has ever known. He has often=
 described his role as Commander-in-Chief and leading the men and women o=
f the United States military as the greatest professional honor of his li=
fe. And I think, time and time again, we have seen the heroism and courag=
e and professionalism of the United States military yield significant and=
 enormous benefits to the American people. And that's true when it comes =
to fighting Ebola. That's true when it comes to rescuing hostages. And th=
at's true when it comes to taking out terrorists. The President is quite =
proud to lead the United States military.



Q And yet he may veto the defense bill, despite the fact that there are a=
 number of F18s that can't be launched right now, B1 bombers having troub=
le. I'm just wondering if the President feels like the services deserve m=
ore money. And if they deserve more money, whats he doing about it? Hes g=
oing to veto this bill. It can make it even tougher for them to do the jo=
b and the missions that theyve been charged with.



MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the President is not vetoing the bill and sugge=
sting that Congress shouldnt pass them any funding. The President is actu=
ally going to veto the bill because he believes that Congress should more=
 effectively fund our national security apparatus, including our military=
, and that there are programs that are worthy of more funding, and more c=
onsistent funding.=20



I believe that Secretary Carter has spoken to this repeatedly, that right=
 now what Congress is proposing to do is to basically just fund the milit=
ary for the next six months. That doesnt make any sense. That's not a sma=
rt way to manage the most effective fighting force in the world, particul=
arly one that we depend on to protect our national security.=20



So this is an ill-advised piece of legislation. And there are a number of=
 reasons that we oppose it. And the President --if this is passed, it's s=
omething that he will veto so that Congress can pass funding at an approp=
riate level for our United States military to protect our readiness and t=
o protect our country.=20



 Q So while you all squabble back and forth with congressional leaders, w=
hats the message to the women and men who are charged with mission readin=
ess and their job is to protect us all? They need their funding. They nee=
d their money.



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, they do. I hope that Congress is hearing your message,=
 Kevin.



 Q Right. And so you guys have to figure this thing out. Because I get le=
tters and emails from people who say, ask the White House, what are they =
doing about this? When are they going to put pen to paper and make sure t=
hat were covered and that were taken care of?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, its the responsibility of the United States Co=
ngress to fund our government. That includes funding our military. And Il=
l remind that if people want to actually understand exactly what the Pres=
idents proposal is, we put forward a budget back in February. And for the=
 first time in 40 years, Republican leaders in Congress refuse to have a =
hearing to even discuss what the Presidents Budget Director exactly what =
our national security funding strategy should be. So its Republicans who =
have fallen down on the job. Its Republicans who have refused time and ti=
me again to handle their responsibilities consistent with putting our nat=
ional security first.=20



Theyd much rather play politics and attack the Presidents EO to prevent d=
iscrimination against LGBT Americans, something that has nothing to do wi=
th funding our national security priorities, but, for some strange reason=
, is actually included as a provision in the NDAA bill. Thats not a provi=
sion that was inserted by Democrats, that was a provision that was insert=
ed by Republicans who are much more interested in playing politics than t=
hey are with funding our national security.



 Q Whats next? Whats the solution to the issue? Because every day that go=
es by, theres another aircraft that cant be launched, theres another sold=
ier out there that doesnt have what she or he needs.



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, and I think that is a very good question for the men a=
nd women in the United States Congress who have a responsibility to fund =
our government and to fund our military. That is a core function of the U=
nited States Congress. That is the way that our Founders designed our sys=
tem of government. And the President has a responsibility to put forward =
a very specific proposal and he did that. And its Republicans who refuse =
to even discuss it with him.=20



So Republicans are the ones that have to bear the responsibility of figur=
ing out how theyre going to use their majority in the House and the Senat=
e that they fought so hard for to make sure theyre doing right by our men=
 and women in uniform.



 Q Lastly, Ill take this one because Im not sure if April can make her wa=
y back in. The Urban Leagues 40th State of Black America report is out. I=
s black America better now than it was when President Obama took office?



 MR. EARNEST: There is no denying -- and Mitch McConnell agrees with me o=
n this -- that all of America is better since President Obama took office=
, and black America is better since President Obama took office. And no m=
atter how -- on almost any measure that I can think of, whether it comes =
to graduate rates, access to health care, or the strength of our economy =
and job creation, by every measure, our economy and our country is strong=
er -- not just for African Americans but for all Americans.



 John.



 Q Thank you, Josh. Someone who does not have a political agenda or any p=
artisan bones in his body I dont think spoke about the new regulations in=
 the administration. This is Cardinal Robert Sarah, one of the Popes righ=
t hands in the Vatican, speaking at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfas=
t this morning. He said, and I quote, Should it be not that biological me=
n should use a mans bathroom. It doesnt get any simpler than that. Does t=
he administration have a reaction to criticism of its new orders from a t=
op Vatican official?



 MR. EARNEST: I havent seen his comments.



 Yes, maam, Ill give you the last one.



 Q Thank you, Josh. When the President --



 MR. EARNEST: She sat through the whole thing.



 Q I had to run -- Im dealing with Roots over there -- I wanted to ask yo=
u about that, too.



 MR. EARNEST: I understand. (Laughter.)



 Q Thank you, Josh. When the President visits Japan for the G7 meeting ne=
xt week, will the North Korean nuclear issue be discussed at this meeting=
? And also I have a second question for you. And what is it the United St=
ates final destination of North Korean nuclear issues? Does the President=
 consider before his administration, the end of this year, will there be =
more attention to the North Korean nuclear issues?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Im confident that this is an issue that will be discu=
ssed at the G7 meeting in Japan. Obviously the world is concerned about t=
he provocations and destabilizing activities of the North Korean regime, =
and Japan is particularly concerned about the impact that those activitie=
s could have on their national security.



 The United States believes strongly in our alliance with Japan. The U.S.=
-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of regional security in Northeast Asia=
. And the United States has deployed resources and personnel to Japan to =
assist them in countering the threat that emanates from North Korea.=20



 As it relates to resolving our broader concerns with North Koreas nuclea=
r program, we continue to work with the international community to pressu=
re the North Korean regime, to isolate them further and encourage them to=
 come into compliance with their international obligations. Earlier this =
year, the United States worked effectively with China at the United Natio=
ns to ramp up the pressure that has been placed on the North Korean regim=
e. We put in place sanctions that went farther than they ever have before=
 in isolating that country and targeting certain industries in North Kore=
a that we know generate revenue thats used to invest in their nuclear pro=
gram.



 So those kinds of sanctions would not be possible without the effective =
cooperation and coordination of the United States and China, and were goi=
ng to continue to work with the rest of the international community to ma=
ke progress in isolating North Korea until they make clear that theyre pr=
epared to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and stop engaging in the kind=
s of provocative acts that are broadly destabilizing.



 Q What is President Obamas final decision for the North Korean nuclear i=
ssues before he steps down?



 MR. EARNEST: Look, the next step will be up to the North Koreans and it =
will be up to the North Koreans to decide whether or not theyre ready to =
commit to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Until they do, theyre goin=
g to continue to face the kind of isolation that they currently suffer fr=
om.=20



 Go ahead, April.



 Q Thank you. Im sorry. Please dont be angry. Its hard dealing with two e=
vents at one time. One, as you talked about the Urban League, theyre talk=
ing about an issue -- ACA, focusing on ACA, and hoping that the costs wil=
l be cut for health care, the price -- the high prices of health care. Wh=
at does this administration say in the midst of that report?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Im glad that you asked that question because it does =
give me an opportunity to point to the recent study that was published th=
at indicates for the first time the percentage of Americans with health i=
nsurance in 2015 exceeded 90 percent.=20



Thats the highest annual measure thats ever been recorded and is another =
sign of the important progress that our country has made under the Afford=
able Care Act. One of the goals of the Affordable Care Act was to put dow=
nward pressure on the growth in health care costs. And since the Affordab=
le Care Act went into effect, we have seen the slowest growth in health c=
are costs on record. That, again, is another tangible sign of the importa=
nt benefits of the Affordable Care Act.=20



 Moving forward, as the law continues to be implemented and as more peopl=
e get access to health care and as more competition is created in individ=
ual markets, were optimistic that were going to continue to put downward =
pressure on costs and put outward pressure on expanding coverage to even =
more Americans.



 Q And then on another subject, really fast. You have Roots in your next =
building -- the conversation and airing I guess of the film, parts of the=
 film. Can you explain why this White House for Roots, this historic movi=
e event that happened decades ago, and the re-airing of it in a new versi=
on now? And also, the most recent movie filming, the John Legend movie, t=
he Underground movie. Can you talk to us why these events are happening h=
ere?



 MR. EARNEST: I think the significance is that this is obviously a film t=
hat shaped a generation of Americans views of our countrys history and of=
 race relations in this country. And theres been a movement to modernize =
the film and present an updated version that I think has a lot of people =
talking and a lot of people considering some issues that are central to t=
he founding of our country. And theyre central to our nations history, an=
d theyre central to the impact that race relations has on everyday life i=
n the United States. So these are issues that are worthy of discussion an=
d study and using an opportunity with the presentation of a new film like=
 this, the administration decided to try to capitalize on that opportunit=
y to cultivate and engage in an important discussion.



 Q So this is part of the Presidents effort to keep the dialogue going on=
 race? These movies -- the airing of these movies from this historic plac=
e?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly is an opportunity for people to come tog=
ether and discuss these issues. And certainly peoples interest in a film =
like this provides an appropriate venue for having those discussions.



 Go ahead, Mark.



 Q I wasnt aware of this event. Was the President at this screening?



 MR. EARNEST: He is not. He is not.



 Q One other question. You mentioned the 90 percent with health insurance=
. Why is it not 100 percent? Whats holding up the ACA on that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, part of whats holding it up are Republican governors =
across the country that are opposing the expansion of Medicaid. And its u=
nfortunate that weve seen -- that we continue to see millions of American=
s be denied access to health care because Republicans in their state dont=
 want to be viewed as implementing, let alone supporting, the health care=
 reform law, championed by President Obama. So thats a -- there are milli=
ons of Americans who dont have access to health care for that reason. Tha=
t certainly is a big chunk of that 10 percent that doesnt have access to =
health care.



 Some of them are -- some of those people are also individuals who have c=
hosen to pay a penalty as opposed to paying for health insurance and we t=
alked a lot last fall and even earlier this spring about why that was not=
 a common-sense financial choice but yet its a choice that some Americans=
 make.=20



 Thanks, everybody. Well see you tomorrow.

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Good aft=
ernoon, everybody.&nbsp; Welcome to the dry White House Briefing Room.&nbsp=
; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I do not have any announcements to start, so we can go =
straight to your questions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darlene, do you want to go =
first?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou.&nbsp; The Senate passed legislation today by voice vote that will allow=
 families of 9/11 victims to sue in U.S. court for any role the Saudi gover=
nment may have played in the attack.&nbsp; Does the White House threat to v=
eto
 that bill still stand?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Darlene,=
 I know that the advocates of this legislation have suggested that they hav=
e taken into account our concerns by more narrowly tailoring the legislatio=
n.&nbsp; But, unfortunately, their efforts were not sufficient to
 prevent the longer-term, unintended consequences that we are concerned abo=
ut. This legislation would change longstanding international law regarding =
sovereign immunity.&nbsp; And the President of the United States continues =
to harbor serious concerns that this
 legislation would make the United States vulnerable in other court systems=
 around the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s also a concer=
n that hasn&#8217;t gotten as much attention about the potential vulnerabil=
ity that is created for some of our allies and partners in U.S. courts.&nbs=
p; And the concern is related to the fact that sovereign immunity is a
 principle that is critical to our national security.&nbsp; The United Stat=
es is more engaged in activities in other countries than any other country =
in the world.&nbsp; Typically, those are actually activities that other cou=
ntries benefit from significantly.&nbsp; These
 are peacekeeping activities, or humanitarian relief activities, or other a=
ctivities in which the United States is supporting the national security ac=
tivities of other countries, and the national security of other countries i=
s enhanced by the involvement of
 the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But out involvement in thos=
e activities is made more complicated by the chance that the principle of s=
overeign immunity could be eroded.&nbsp; So the administration strongly con=
tinues to oppose this legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we're obviously going
 to begin conversations with the House about it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the=
 serious concerns that you just cited -- are those strong enough to lead to=
 a veto of the bill?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, as =
I think I mentioned before, given the concerns that we have expressed, it's=
 difficult to imagine the President signing this legislation.&nbsp; That co=
ntinues to be true.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will th=
e White House -- as the bill goes to the House, will the White House work w=
ith lawmakers in the House to maybe keep the bill from coming up for a vote=
 there?&nbsp; Is it important enough to try to do that and stop it?<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think there are a variety of options. That would certainly be one of them.&=
nbsp; I think the other option would be seeking additional changes to the b=
ill that would more directly address the concerns that we have been
 raising for months now.&nbsp; So there are multiple options, but we certai=
nly anticipate having conversations with members of Congress about this iss=
ue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would just note that ther=
e are both Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives that h=
ave expressed concerns with the bill.&nbsp; So there is an opportunity for =
us to work in bipartisan fashion to try to address the serious
 concerns that we've raised about the unintended consequences of this legis=
lation being enacted.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to=
 before we came out -- concerning the veto theme -- the Statement of Admini=
stration Policy that was released on the $622 million Zika funding bill in =
the House -- saying that -- would recommend that the President veto that
 if it got to him.&nbsp; The Senate today is voting on three different Zika=
 funding measures.&nbsp; There&#8217;s one for about $1.1 billion that seem=
s most likely to advance.&nbsp; Where does the White House fall on that par=
ticular bill?&nbsp; If the $622 million is not enough.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 have several concerns with the House bill.&nbsp; The first concern is that=
 it is woefully insufficient given the significant risk that is posed by Zi=
ka.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not just my own personal analysis -- that actually i=
s
 the analysis of our public health professionals who advise the administrat=
ion about what should be included in the supplemental appropriations packag=
e that we sent up to Congress nearly three months ago.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it&#8217;s disappointing=
 that Congress is -- at least the House of Representatives is three months =
late and more than a billion dollars short of doing what&#8217;s necessary =
to protect the American people.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no reason that this sho=
uld
 be a partisan or ideological issue -- this isn&#8217;t a question of gover=
nment philosophy.&nbsp; This is a question about whether or not you&#8217;r=
e actually committed to ensuring that we&#8217;re doing everything possible=
 to protect pregnant women and babies in the United States
 of America from getting a debilitating disease, or at least a virus that h=
as debilitating consequences for the neurological development of babies.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&#8217;re quite disapp=
ointed that the House is so late in acting and what they&#8217;ve put toget=
her is so woefully insufficient. It&#8217;s not just our public health prof=
essionals who have expressed those concerns.&nbsp; I would note that one ce=
rtain
 Republican senator from Florida was on the floor of the United States Sena=
te today expressing those concerns.&nbsp; So I do think it does raise a que=
stion for the 17 Republican House members from the state of Florida about w=
hat their view is.&nbsp; The Republican senator
 from the state of Florida has indicated that the Congress should act exped=
itiously to pass the $1.9 billion funding proposal that our public health e=
xperts say is needed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it would be interes=
ting to understand exactly what position the 17 other Republicans from Flor=
ida who represent that state in the Congress think of this.&nbsp; I think i=
t&#8217;s certainly a relevant question.&nbsp; I think it underscores
 the point that I was making before that there&#8217;s no reason this shoul=
d be a partisan issue.&nbsp; This is a basic matter of the public health an=
d well-being of the American people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the=
 $1.1 billion -- where does the administration fall on that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e Senate, fortunately, appears to be making more progress.&nbsp; They will =
also include a vote today on the $1.9 billion proposal that we put forward =
back in February.&nbsp; And we strongly encourage Democrats and Republicans
 to come together around that bill.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what our public heal=
th professionals say is needed to do everything possible to protect the Ame=
rican people from Zika.&nbsp; And this would be an emergency appropriation =
that would be available to state and local officials,
 and federal government scientists immediately.&nbsp; We believe that is th=
e preferred -- we believe that&#8217;s the best way to protect the American=
 people from the Zika virus.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see=
m to be saying the $1.9 billion or nothing.&nbsp; I mean --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, wh=
at I&#8217;m saying is that is what our public health professionals say tha=
t we need.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re looking for Congress to act on that request=
 and that&#8217;s what we would like to see move forward.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other concern that we h=
ave with the House bill isn&#8217;t just that the amount of resources commi=
tted is much smaller; the funding would be offset by taking away resources =
that are currently being used to protect the American people
 from Ebola.&nbsp; And traditionally, when Congress has been faced with a p=
ublic health emergency, they haven&#8217;t wasted a lot of time looking for=
 funding offsets.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s a pretty dangerous exercise becaus=
e it delays the needed funding, but it also risks gutting
 other critical priorities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&#8217;s talk a little b=
it about how that Ebola funding is currently being used.&nbsp; Right now, t=
hat funding is being used by the CDC to work with the health ministries in =
both Guinea and Liberia to investigate the rapidly changing situation
 related to new Ebola cases there.&nbsp; Right now, the CDC is assisting th=
ose governments in tracing nearly a thousand contacts.&nbsp; These are indi=
viduals who are at heightened risk of potentially spreading Ebola.&nbsp; So=
 the CDC has 100 staff that are deployed over there,
 and that staff is helping to process 10,000 samples per month in Liberia, =
Sierra Leone, and Guinea.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it&#8217;s pretty clear =
that what&#8217;s happening -- that the work that the CDC is doing in West =
Africa was very helpful in the fall of 2014 in stopping the spread of that =
terrible disease, but it requires vigilance.&nbsp; And the lesson that
 we should have learned from 2014 is that the United States and the America=
n people benefit from enhanced capacity of public health officials in other=
 countries, that stopping the spread of a dangerous virus in another countr=
y makes the American people safer.&nbsp;
 And when that was an academic hypothetical exercise, there was some skepti=
cism that some people expressed about that notion.&nbsp; But there weren&#8=
217;t many people expressing skepticism about that notion in the fall of 20=
14 when there was concern about the Ebola virus
 appearing in the United States.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is a bad idea for Rep=
ublicans to move forward with a proposal that would gut our efforts to foll=
ow through in the fight against Ebola and it&#8217;s a bad idea for Republi=
cans to further delay the emergency funding that&#8217;s necessary
 to protect the American people from the Zika virus.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Bagh=
dad, several bombings today, extending the deadliest wave of the year in bo=
mbings there.&nbsp; And on Saturday, Prime Minister Abadi said that he&#821=
7;s afraid that the political crisis there is hampering the fight against I=
slamic
 State.&nbsp; Does the administration share that concern?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Tim, let=
 me start by saying that the United States strongly condemns the barbaric t=
errorist attacks in Iraq today by ISIL that specifically targeted innocent =
civilians.&nbsp; We extend our deepest condolences to the victims
 and their families. These string of attacks by ISIL is the latest reminder=
 of the danger that this group poses to all Iraqis and the importance of Ir=
aqi leaders from all communities, working together against a common enemy.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim, you&#8217;ll recall ba=
ck in 2014, the President made the offer of U.S. military assistance to Ira=
q contingent upon Iraq&#8217;s central government more effectively uniting =
that country to confront ISIL.&nbsp; So that should be an indication to
 you that a unified, effectively governed Iraq is critical to our success a=
gainst ISIL. &nbsp;It has been a central part of our strategy from the very=
 first day.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve been encouraged over the last year and a =
half by the efforts that Prime Minister Abadi has
 undertaken to unify that country and pursue the kind of inclusive governin=
g agenda that can inspire the confidence of Iraq&#8217;s diverse population=
 that the central government in Baghdad is looking out for their best inter=
ests.&nbsp; We believe that that will have
 a corresponding impact on the effectiveness and resilience of Iraq&#8217;s=
 security forces.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s largel=
y proved to be true.&nbsp; Iraq&#8217;s security forces, backed by coalitio=
n military airpower and the advice and assistance of coalition militaries f=
rom around the world, has bene effective in driving ISIL out of territory
 that they previously controlled.&nbsp; We know that ISIL has been driven o=
ut of about 40 percent of the populated areas that ISIL previously controll=
ed in Iraq.&nbsp; That&#8217;s tangible progress.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And our coalition is commit=
ted to trying to keep up that momentum and continue to pressure ISIL while =
also providing the Iraqi central government necessary resources to rebuild =
those areas that ISIL had taken over.&nbsp; We know that in
 places like Ramadi. ISIL didn&#8217;t just occupy that community -- they e=
ssentially destroyed it.&nbsp; And rebuilding that infrastructure and rebui=
lding those communities so that people feel confident in moving back home i=
s going to be critical to our longer-term success
 of bringing some stability to that region of the world.&nbsp; And so the i=
mportant financial contributions that have been made by countries around th=
e world are also an important part of our strategy, but they&#8217;re all p=
redicated on the Iraqi people and the international
 community having confidence in the effectiveness of the Iraqi central gove=
rnment.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, A=
badi seems to be very concerned about the turmoil in his own government.&nb=
sp; Are you saying that the troops that are coming in, the U.S. troops that=
 are coming in are going to help him deal with that while he figures out th=
e
 turmoil?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nbsp=
; I think the U.S. troops that are in Iraq are there for a very specific re=
ason, which is to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.&nbsp; And they&#8217=
;re focused on missions that involve protecting the embassy, carrying out m=
ilitary
 air operations against ISIL targets, in some cases providing training and =
advice and assistance to Iraqi security forces, and there&#8217;s a small n=
umber of special operators that have been organized into these expeditionar=
y forces that can carry out raids against
 senior ISIL figures.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been very clear about the mission t=
hat U.S. forces in Iraq are pursuing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on =
Syria, there&#8217;s a lot of pessimism over the talks in Vienna.&nbsp; Doe=
s the White House believe that the Syrian government has systematically den=
ied humanitarian aid?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
ere&#8217;s extensive reporting and plenty of evidence to indicate that too=
 often the Assad regime or forces that are operating under the command and =
control of the Assad regime are making a concerted effort to prevent
 the kind of humanitarian access that&#8217;s needed for Syrian populations=
 that are caught in the crossfire of that conflict.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we&#8217;ve expressed=
 our concerns on a variety of occasions about the tendency of Assad regime =
forces to either prevent convoys of humanitarian goods from moving into nee=
ded areas -- in some cases, there actually
 are reports of Syrian forces essentially raiding those convoys for the sup=
plies that they would like to have or at least prevent those supplies from =
reaching the intended audience.&nbsp; So that is a source of significant co=
ncern.&nbsp; And one of the reasons that the
 administration has worked aggressively to hold the Assad regime accountabl=
e for living up to the commitments that they made in the context of the ces=
sation of hostilities is to make it easier for those kinds of humanitarian =
supplies to get to those areas that
 badly need it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So access for humanitarian =
relief workers and for humanitarian assistance continues to be a critical c=
oncern not just of the United States but the rest of the international comm=
unity.&nbsp; And that includes the Assad regime following through
 on the commitment that they&#8217;ve made to abide by the cessation of hos=
tilities and create conditions where it's much easier for humanitarian aid =
workers to get access to communities that have spent years caught in the cr=
ossfire.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justin.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vice Pr=
esident Biden, tomorrow, is going to announce the final overtime rule, and =
the news here is that it's pegged now to the 40th percentile in sort of the=
 lowest-paid region of the country rather than the country overall.&nbsp;
 It's about a $3,000 dip.&nbsp; I'm wondering if you can explain why the ad=
ministration ultimately decided not to extend this benefit to more workers.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ju=
stin, the Department of Labor has been considering this change to overtime =
rules for quite some time, and their focus has been on making sure that peo=
ple are fairly paid, including for their hard work.&nbsp; And by
 definition, this is a rule that would apply to the hardest-working America=
ns.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is a rule that con=
tinues to be under consideration and is in the process.&nbsp; It has been f=
or some time, and I would expect an announcement about a decision soon, but=
 I don't have any information about the conclusions that have
 been reached at this point.&nbsp; Once they&#8217;ve made an announcement,=
 then we can engage in a discussion about why they&#8217;ve reached the dec=
ision that they have.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator=
 Warren wrote a letter to the administration earlier this month and urged y=
ou guys that, one, too often the voices of workers are buried beneath a flo=
od of comments from lobbyists and lawyers.&nbsp; If there an erosion here
 that would leave hundreds of thousands of people without getting that bene=
fit, wouldn't that be a sign that lobbyists and lawyers ended up winning ou=
t with the administration?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, I th=
ink there is a strong track record of this administration making sure that =
the rulemaking process represents the best interests of middle-class famili=
es.&nbsp; And that is true when it comes to establishing the Consumer
 Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that was established specifically t=
o look out for the interests consumers that aren't as well represented in W=
ashington and in the rulemaking process as much larger financial institutio=
ns that can afford highly paid lobbyists.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So whether it's the impleme=
ntation of rules related to Wall Street reform, or the implementation of ru=
les related to health care reform, or the implementation of rules related t=
o fighting carbon pollution, the administration&#8217;s track
 record of protecting the interest of middle-class families is rock-solid.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the =
9/11 bill, obviously it's got to pass through the House, but Senator Schume=
r said today that he believes -- that he would vote to override the Preside=
nt&#8217;s veto and he thinks that he could have the votes to do that.&nbsp=
; Is
 that a legitimate concern?&nbsp; Are you guys going to start whipping agai=
nst a veto override in the Senate?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, be=
fore we get to the question of a veto override there&#8217;s a question abo=
ut whether or not this legislation will pass the House.&nbsp; So as I noted=
 to Darlene, there are Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representa=
tives
 that have raised concerns about the bill in the same way that the administ=
ration has.&nbsp; So we'll engage in a conversation with the House of Repre=
sentatives, and we'll take it from there.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last on=
e, on Gitmo.&nbsp; You guys released a veto threat against the NDAA yesterd=
ay, and in it you said specifically that the restrictions preventing you fr=
om coming up with an alternative site for Guantanamo Bay was potentially un=
constitutional.&nbsp;
 That's also the reason that you cited, back a few months ago when presenti=
ng the plan to Congress, for why you couldn't say which site would be picke=
d -- your hands were tied because of this restriction.&nbsp; So if you beli=
eve it's unconstitutional, I guess the
 question is, why not either defy the law and let the courts decide, or cha=
llenge the law in the courts to allow you to do this work that you say is n=
ecessary for the President?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ju=
stin, we have made clear that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay is a top=
 priority, and it's a top priority because taxpayer funds could be much mor=
e effectively spent in housing those individuals in facilities
 that have already been built here in the United States.&nbsp; And we could=
 do that -- and in doing so, we could save millions of dollars in taxpayers=
 funds.&nbsp; We've also expressed a concern that is shared by national sec=
urity experts in both parties that extremist
 organizations use the continued operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay =
as a recruiting tool.&nbsp; And the President believes that the American pe=
ople would be safer if we took that recruiting tool, that propaganda tool a=
way from extremist organizations.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is all important, part=
icularly when you consider that we've demonstrated in this country that we =
can effectively detain convicted terrorists on American soil in a way that =
doesn&#8217;t pose an enhanced security threat to the American
 people.&nbsp; We've also demonstrated that we can bring terrorists to just=
ice on American soil, using the American criminal justice system to hold th=
em accountable for their crimes.&nbsp; That would give the United States th=
e benefit of being able to say we're going
 to protect the American people and we're going to do it in a way that's en=
tirely consistent with our values even if our adversaries and our enemies a=
ren't willing to subscribe to those values.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a pretty powerful argu=
ment and a pretty powerful statement, and something that makes the American=
 people safer.&nbsp; So that's our motivation.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, frankly, what we would=
 like to see, Justin, is we&#8217;d just like to see Congress get out of th=
e way.&nbsp; In some ways, it's not even a situation -- so often -- let&#82=
17;s take Zika, for example. To fight Zika and protect the American people
 from Zika we need Congress&#8217;s affirmative cooperation to do that.&nbs=
p; And right now, Republicans, particularly in the House of Representatives=
, are falling down on the job and putting the American people at greater ri=
sk because they aren't working effectively
 with the administration to fight the Zika virus, because they won't approp=
riate the emergency funding.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to Gitmo, the=
 standard is much lower.&nbsp; We just need Congress to get out of the way.=
&nbsp; They have, time and time again, included all these restrictions that=
 have prevented the administration from doing what is necessary
 to protect the American people.&nbsp; So we just need Congress to remove t=
hose obstacles so that we can move forward effectively in closing the priso=
n at Guantanamo Bay and doing it in a way that will enhance the national se=
curity of the American people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I t=
hink my question was if you believe the restriction is unconstitutional, an=
d for all the reasons that you just outlined, strongly believe that the pri=
son should be closed, why not either mount a legal challenge or just
 defy what you see is an unconstitutional restriction?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
can't speak to our legal strategy.&nbsp; I think the most direct route is n=
ot one that winds through the federal courts for years, but rather --<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, w=
e're in year eight, right, so, you might as well try something, right?<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
actually think that that's sort of my point, which is we are in year eight,=
 so initiating a years-long legal process is certainly an option that's ava=
ilable to the administration.&nbsp; I'm not going to take it off
 the table.&nbsp; But given the priority that the President has established=
 here, we&#8217;d like to just see Congress take the steps that are necessa=
ry to remove those obstacles so that we can get this important business don=
e.&nbsp; That's the most direct route to accomplishing
 a national security goal that has been advocated by both Democrats and Rep=
ublicans, including Republican President George W. Bush.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olivier.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; Staying on Gitmo for a second.&nbsp; The NDAA has a section th=
at would appear to reopen the door to detainees there now to take plea deal=
s in Article 3 courts and then be transferred to third countries.&nbsp; Is =
that something
 that you guys support?&nbsp; And by how much do you think that would reduc=
e the population?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ol=
ivier, I haven't considered every single proposal in the NDAA, so let me co=
nsult with our policy staff in terms of the way that proposal is written an=
d get back to you with a position on it.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the=
n on the talks about Syria, John Kerry today said if Assad &#8220;has reach=
ed a conclusion that there is no plan B.&nbsp; He has done so without any f=
oundation whatsoever and it&#8217;s very dangerous.&#8221;&nbsp; It&#8217;s=
 dangerous for whom?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the concern that Secretary Kerry is expressing there is that the long=
er that President Assad remains in power in Syria, the more chaos and viole=
nce and division plagues that country.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why the
 United States and most of the rest of the international community is stron=
gly in favor of executing a political transition inside of Syria as soon as=
 possible.&nbsp; He has lost the legitimacy to lead that country, he contin=
ues to order the Syrian military to carry
 out attacks against innocent, unarmed civilians, and by doing so, he has l=
ost any claim within the realm of reason to being able to govern the countr=
y of Syria.&nbsp; Just as a practical matter, it&#8217;s hard to imagine th=
at Syrian citizens who are on the receiving
 end of barrel bombs would at all be open to President Assad continuing to =
lead the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the longer that he is th=
ere, the more dangerous and violent that country becomes.&nbsp; And that&#8=
217;s dangerous for the United States because we know that extremist organi=
zations like ISIL -- and they&#8217;re not the only one -- try to capitaliz=
e
 on that chaos and that violence to establish a safe haven and plot and car=
ry out attacks against targets outside of Syria, including areas -- includi=
ng locations that are important to the United States and including on the s=
oil of close American allies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, o=
n the NDAA, the Statement of Administration Policy objects to a provision i=
n the bill that would undermine President Obama&#8217;s federal -- executiv=
e order prohibiting anti-LGBT discrimination among federal contractors.&nbs=
p; Would
 that provision alone be enough for the President to veto the House version=
 of the NDAA?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ch=
ris, the way that it&#8217;s detailed in the Statement of Administration Po=
sition that you&#8217;ve clearly reviewed quite closely, there&#8217;s a lo=
ng list of concerns that we have with the proposal that Republicans have pu=
t
 forward.&nbsp; So at this point, I don&#8217;t think I can single out any =
one as being sufficient to garner a presidential veto, and the reason for t=
hat is just that there are a whole lot of reasons why the bill is bad and w=
hy the President strongly opposes it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think what I can say a=
s a general matter is that the President has been forceful in using his exe=
cutive authority to prevent discrimination and the executive order that you=
&#8217;ve cited is a good example of that.&nbsp; And the President
 has on a number of occasions protected his ability to use that executive a=
uthority in his negotiations with Congress.&nbsp; Because we know that ther=
e are some in Congress who, for reasons that seem rather perverse to me, be=
lieve that the President shouldn&#8217;t be
 taking actions to prevent discrimination.&nbsp; So I&#8217;ll leave it to =
them to explain why that&#8217;s an appropriate position for them to take.&=
nbsp; It&#8217;s one that seems hard -- difficult to justify, in my opinion=
.&nbsp; But the President has worked hard to protect his executive
 authority that can be used to prevent discrimination, and that&#8217;s som=
ething that we take quite seriously.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How con=
fident are you that the Republican-controlled Congress will present the Pre=
sident a version of a defense authorization bill that will omit this provis=
ion against his executive order?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I think it&#8217;s very difficult to predict exactly what this Congres=
s will do.&nbsp; But what is true is that there are a long list of reasons =
why we have strong concerns about the way that the NDA legislation is
 currently written, and we&#8217;re hopeful that Republicans will begin to =
make some changes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this is their re=
sponsibility.&nbsp; Republicans have a strong majority in the House of Repr=
esentatives.&nbsp; Republicans have a strong majority in the United States =
Senate.&nbsp; So, ultimately, it&#8217;s Republicans who need to carry the
 weight of figuring out how to ensure that our national security profession=
als and our men and women in uniform have the authority and funding that th=
ey need to protect the country.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this is a basic functi=
on of the United States Congress.&nbsp; It&#8217;s unfortunate that it is b=
eing larded up with a bunch of proposals like the one that you just cited t=
hat aren&#8217;t related to our national security but
 are intended to be divisive.&nbsp; And we hope that at some point Republic=
ans in Congress will act responsibly to put forward a funding authorization=
 proposal that is consistent with our national security interests.<o:p></o:=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh, appreciate it.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you, going back to the directiv=
e on Friday, on the bathrooms, transgender bathrooms.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a=
n impression that the administration has been particularly aggressive on tr=
ansgender
 issues, sort of more so than it was on gay marriage before the President&#=
8217;s evolution in 2012.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just wondering if you see that re=
flecting society or if that&#8217;s an administrative decision?<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
don&#8217;t think I would describe our position that way for a variety of r=
easons.&nbsp; I think the first is, this is a confrontation that Republican=
s have sought out, rather cynically, because they are seeking a political
 advantage.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s the Republicans in the North Carolina legis=
lature, for example, that convened a one-day special session to ram through=
 HB2, the now infamous HB2 in North Carolina so that it could be quickly pa=
ssed in both houses of the legislature and
 then signed into law by the governor of that state.&nbsp; They have since =
walked back some aspects of that bill in the face of significant criticism,=
 particularly from the business community, and it&#8217;s clear that it&#82=
17;s had a negative impact on the economic climate
 in North Carolina.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the comments that we&#82=
17;ve seen from Republicans in other places I think makes clear that they&#=
8217;re not really interested in helping schools across the country confron=
t what is a difficult policy challenge; they&#8217;d rather just cynically
 try to appeal to people&#8217;s fears in order to try and gin up political=
 support for their campaigns.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s not the ap=
proach that the administration is taking, and in fact, I think this was evi=
dent from the guidance that was issued by the Department of Education on Fr=
iday, that in response to specific requests from school administrators
 across the country, the Department of Education put forward best practices=
 and good ideas with regard to how schools can implement this policy in a w=
ay that will protect the dignity and safety of every student at the school.=
&nbsp; And these weren&#8217;t just ideas that
 were developed by administrators in Washington, D.C. -- these are actually=
 ideas that were developed by school administrators across the country who =
had found workable solutions that could be successfully applied in their sc=
hools.&nbsp; And sharing those ideas
 with school administrators across the country is a tangible, constructive =
offer of assistance that I think the majority of school administrators appr=
eciated.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s not the ki=
nd of constructive contribution that we&#8217;ve seen from conservatives.&n=
bsp; From conservatives, you basically have seen the suggestion that they d=
on&#8217;t really have a way of -- they haven&#8217;t really put forward a =
specific
 suggestion for how they believe that the rules should be applied.&nbsp; Th=
e best that they seem to have come up with is suggesting that birth certifi=
cates should be examined before anyone can enter a public bathroom.&nbsp; S=
o that doesn&#8217;t make sense.&nbsp; That certainly
 is an indication that they are much more interested in politics than they =
are in actually trying to solve the problem.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you=
 said that the directive was not necessarily brought about by the North Car=
olina law.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m wondering if the administration has made a co=
ncerted effort -- I mean, the Wall Street Journal calls it an effort to sta=
rt a
 culture war to drive voter turnout in November -- I mean, if they&#8217;ve=
 made a decision to sort of be more aggressive on these measures.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t make a habit of reading the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal=
 I think for obvious reasons, but I did happen to take a look at it today, =
and I noticed that the editorial also noted that somehow Democrats
 appeared to be obsessed with sex, which I thought was a rather amusing obs=
ervation on their part because it&#8217;s Republicans who have, for example=
, passed this HB2 law in North Carolina.&nbsp; It&#8217;s Republicans in th=
e Congress that have created a special congressional
 committee to take a look at Planned Parenthood.&nbsp; It&#8217;s Republica=
ns who have sued the administration over the implementation of the Affordab=
le Care Act, including as it relates to women being able to get access to t=
heir birth control.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s a curious observation
 by the Wall Street Journal that I don&#8217;t think stands up to a lot of =
scrutiny.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting=
 back to the President, is he making more of a decision to be more forceful=
 on these issues than he had been back in 2012 when he was criticized for b=
eing sort of slow on gay marriage?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, I do=
n't think so.&nbsp; And again, I think that at every stage, it's this admin=
istration that fought for and successfully ended &#8220;don't ask, don't te=
ll.&#8221;&nbsp; It's this administration that declined to continue defendi=
ng the
 Defense of Marriage Act as litigation contesting that law wound its way th=
rough the courts.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, again, I think as it re=
lates to this issue, it is clear that it's Republicans who are seeking a po=
litical advantage and an administration that is seeking to offer tangible, =
practical advice to school administrators who are seeking
 to protect the safety and dignity of every student at their school.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; On lifting sanctions on Burma, the Treasury Department announc=
ed today you're going to be lifting a variety of those sanctions tomorrow.&=
nbsp; But the President did say that the national emergency is going to con=
tinue
 and called Burma an extraordinary threat.&nbsp; So I wonder if you could t=
ell us whether the President feels like the human rights situation in Myanm=
ar warrants this action, and whether you might like to see some more progre=
ss on that front before additional sanctions
 come off.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, le=
t&#8217;s start by saying that the U.S. government announced steps to suppo=
rt Burma&#8217;s new democratic government, including the recalibration of =
sanctions on Burma, to demonstrate support for the new government&#8217;s d=
emocratic
 reforms and the broad-based economic development.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s no denying th=
e important political process that has been made in Burma, and the United S=
tates has been strongly supportive of the Burmese people and Burmese govern=
ment as they pursue these reforms.&nbsp; One high-profile piece of
 evidence about that progress was the election that was conducted just in t=
he last few months that allowed for the peaceful democratic transfer of pow=
er.&nbsp; It's an important development in that country&#8217;s history and=
 is indicative of the important progress that
 they&#8217;re making in pursuing long overdue political reforms.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the Unite=
d States wants to continue to further incentivize democratic reforms and co=
ntinue to pressure targeted individuals and entities, including the militar=
y, so that work of reforming that government continues.&nbsp;
 There obviously is more work that needs to be done, and the sanctions that=
 remain in place do serve to pressure those entities that may be advocating=
 for rolling back some of those reforms.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the government has made =
important progress.&nbsp; We want them to build on that momentum.&nbsp; And=
 that's why the recalibrated sanctions announcement will move forward.&nbsp=
; But there still are entities that are obstacles to needed reform and
 we continue to apply pressure against those entities so that we can hopefu=
lly nurture the continued progress that Burma has met.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if =
you still think that there are concerns as it relates to human rights and t=
he military&#8217;s control and the government potentially rolling back the=
 progress they&#8217;ve made, wouldn't it be wiser to wait until you see so=
me more
 of that progress before you go lifting sanctions?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Again, I=
 think that's why we've described it as recalibrating the sanctions rather =
than lifting them, because --&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- enti=
ties that you listed, though. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, for discussion of specific entities and what impact they may have had =
on political reforms, I'd refer you to the Treasury Department.&nbsp; They =
can sort of walk you through our policy towards specific entities.&nbsp;
 But most of the remaining sanctions are primarily intended to discourage e=
conomic activity with certain individuals and entities, particularly those =
who undermine or obstruct political reform in Burma, commit human rights ab=
uses in Burma, or propagate military
 trade with North Korea.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are the entities that=
 are targeted.&nbsp; And I think for those reasons, continuing to apply tho=
se sanctions makes sense.&nbsp; At the same time, it's also important to re=
cognize the progress that Burma has made, and by recalibrating the
 sanctions and easing the sanctions against some entities in Burma, we ackn=
owledge the important progress that they&#8217;ve made and further incentiv=
ize additional reforms.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's the recalibration=
 strategy that's been applied in this instance.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, s=
o the White House has now issued several strongly worded warnings about the=
 9/11 bill to members of Congress.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ve come out publicly=
 and said these exact same things before.&nbsp; But today, when this bill p=
assed on a
 voice vote, there was no opposition.&nbsp; So doesn&#8217;t that tell you =
that there&#8217;s just as strong a feeling even from the President&#8217;s=
 own party that this is a legitimate concern, and that the needs of these f=
amilies to at least bring their claims to a court are more
 important than some indeterminate risk that some other country could do so=
mething similar to the U.S.?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, lo=
ok, the administration is strongly committed to assisting the 9/11 families=
, and there are a variety of ways in which this administration has gone to =
bat for 9/11 families and those who did such important work
 around Ground Zero to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of the 9/11 att=
acks.&nbsp; I have in mind, of course, the legislation that on a number of =
occasions got bottled up in the Congress to ensure that those who performed=
 so heroically at Ground Zero were able
 to get access to health care.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the administration&#8217=
;s commitment to our nation&#8217;s national security and to those who lost=
 the most on 9/11 is steadfast. &nbsp;And our commitment to those principle=
s will not change.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we have to acknowledge =
the significant unintended consequences of moving forward with a piece of l=
egislation like this.&nbsp; And this is a concern that's not just expressed=
 by the Democratic administration; there are Republicans in
 Congress who have also expressed concerns about this in the past.&nbsp; So=
 this is a sensitive issue, and I would acknowledge that the politics are t=
ough.&nbsp; But focusing on the substance, we need to make sure that we don=
't overlook the potential unintended consequences
 of a bill that could put the United States at risk around the world.&nbsp;=
 That is a dangerous proposition and one that the Commander-in-Chief I thin=
k is rightly concerned about.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it j=
ust seems like Democrats in the Senate, by there being zero opposition on t=
his bill, it seems like they&#8217;re sending a message to the White House =
that the concerns of the White House aren't as important.&nbsp; What&#8217;=
s your response
 to that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'll let=
 them explain their position and I'll let them explain why they did not obj=
ect to a proposal that has significant, though, admittedly, unintended cons=
equences.&nbsp; But, look, the accusation here is not that somebody
 in Congress voting for this legislation is seeking to intentionally inflic=
t harm against the United States.&nbsp; Our concern is that that is an unin=
tended consequence of this particular piece of this legislation.&nbsp; And =
it's the responsibility of the President of
 the United States and the Commander-in-Chief to look out for the interests=
 of the United States and our servicemembers and diplomats around the world=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concern that we have is=
 that other countries could use the passage of this bill as an excuse to in=
itiate their own proceedings in their own courts that puts the United State=
s uniquely at risk.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you=
 disappointed that Democrats in the Senate didn&#8217;t voice the same conc=
erns or oppose this bill that the White House is --&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, lo=
ok, we oppose the bill, so we obviously are not pleased to see it move forw=
ard in the Senate.&nbsp; But we're going to engage with the bipartisan memb=
ers in the House of Representatives who have expressed similar concerns
 and see if we can ensure that they are addressed as this legislative proce=
ss moves forward.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the =
past, you&#8217;ve urged members of Congress not to proceed because this co=
uld have ramifications.&nbsp; So the fact that it has now passed the Senate=
, are there ramifications to that alone in terms of the relationship with S=
audi
 Arabia or anything else?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, as=
 I think as we discussed when the President traveled to Saudi Arabia a few =
weeks ago, the President had a long bilateral meeting with the King of Saud=
i Arabia and the issue of this legislation was not raised.&nbsp;
 And I think it is an indication of the fact that right now, at least, this=
 legislation is not interfering with our ability to coordinate with the Sau=
di Arabian government on a range of issues of mutual concern.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But our broader concern i=
s about the potential, unintended consequence that the passage of this legi=
slation would bring about, and that is basically giving other countries an =
excuse to subject the United States
 of America to what could just be kangaroo courts in other countries.&nbsp;=
 And it puts the United States in a situation where we spend a lot of time =
and energy and resources going and defending the United States in foreign c=
ourts.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not a good use of our
 time.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also certainly not a good use of our diplomatic cap=
ital.&nbsp; These kinds of cases would just serve as an additional irritant=
 in our relations with countries around the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, again, we believe that =
these kinds of concerns are the kinds of concerns that should be taken into=
 account by every member of Congress as they consider their position on thi=
s bill.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fam=
ilies out a statement saying, well, the big difference here -- they&#8217;r=
e sort of dissecting the arguments that the White House has made, and they =
said, well, the difference here is that the U.S. doesn&#8217;t support terr=
orist
 organizations that target civilians.&nbsp; So if this bill is so narrowly =
tailored to involve just terror attacks on U.S. soil, and you look at the a=
rgument that those families are making, is that really such a huge risk tha=
t somebody would do something similar?&nbsp;
 If you&#8217;re just looking at that specific instance, of targeting civil=
ians on our soil in this case?&nbsp; And obviously Democrats in the Senate =
don&#8217;t agree that that risk is --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, lo=
ok, I do understand what you&#8217;re saying.&nbsp; And, look, I think that=
 the concern is about potential unintended consequences.&nbsp; There are a =
number of countries around the world that do falsely accuse the United Stat=
es
 of engaging in acts of terrorism that result in the death of innocent civi=
lians. There are other countries that publicly make that accusation on a re=
gular basis, and if they now have a precedent for establishing their own me=
thod of bringing the United States
 into court and putting at risk U.S. assets that are held overseas, even as=
 they prosecute those false claims in a kangaroo court, that&#8217;s not a =
path that we want to go down.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other concern, Michelle=
, is exactly how that system could work.&nbsp; You can imagine a scenario w=
here somebody who&#8217;s injured or wounded overseas is brought back to th=
e United States for medical treatment and then they die.&nbsp; That could
 potentially open up the United States or other countries, including our al=
lies, to claims in an American court because that individual died on Americ=
an soil.&nbsp; And this is the thing.&nbsp; I mean, our court system is suc=
h that you don&#8217;t have to be an American citizen
 in order to file suit in an American court.&nbsp; I recognize that these a=
re hypotheticals, but they are potential, unintended consequences that are =
quite serious.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the basis of our concern about this b=
ill.&nbsp; The potential, unintended consequences that
 have and could have a very negative effect on U.S. national security, coul=
d put at risk the United States, our assets, and our personnel in countries=
 all around the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is t=
his just a closed matter again, the whole issue of 9/11?&nbsp; Because obvi=
ously you&#8217;re talking about unintended consequences, and the families =
are concerned about finally trying to figure out exactly what happened.&nbs=
p; And you&#8217;ve
 said before I think on Saudi Arabia that the investigation showed there wa=
s no Saudi connection, the 28 pages.&nbsp; Others have said that this is no=
t significant information -- just like the furor about it.&nbsp; So do you =
say to the families essentially that -- oh,
 and also, you seem to say that there are some changes to the legislation t=
hat Congress didn&#8217;t consider that might have made it more palatable t=
o the administration.&nbsp; Is there some way to reconcile this whole conce=
rn about sovereign immunity and the families
 concern?&nbsp; Or is this really just the end of it as far as the administ=
ration is concerned?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; It&#8217=
;s certainly not the end of it.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a lot to unpack there.&=
nbsp; Let&#8217;s start by -- there was a commission, an outside -- a commi=
ssion of experts established outside the government to examine the attacks =
of 9/11, to
 take a look at what conditions led up to the attacks, what exactly transpi=
red on that fateful day, and what sort of reforms could be implemented to e=
nsure something like that never happens again.&nbsp; It&#8217;s that outsid=
e group, the 9/11 Commission, that carefully
 examined all of the available evidence and concluded that there&#8217;s no=
 evidence to indicate that the Saudi government as an institution supported=
 the 9/11 plotters.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that&#8217;s not some so=
rt of government conspiracy -- this is an outside organization, staffed by =
experts that took a close look at this.&nbsp; And those -- the leaders of t=
hat commission themselves reviewed the 28 pages.&nbsp; They have acknowledg=
ed
 that 28 pages included preliminary investigatory materials that they had a=
n opportunity to pursue.&nbsp; And that as a result of reading those 28 pag=
es, they conducted interviews -- not just in the United States but in other=
 countries around the world to follow
 up on those potential leads.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And despite having read tho=
se 28 pages and despite having acted on them by pursuing investigations tha=
t that information could point to, they still concluded that the Saudi gove=
rnment as an institution didn&#8217;t support the 9/11 plotters.&nbsp;
 So I think there is no denying that that part of it has been exhaustively =
investigated.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not saying this to suggest that somehow that&=
#8217;s going to ease the pain of somebody who lost a loved one or several =
loved ones on 9/11.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our heart breaks for those =
people.&nbsp; These are thousands of Americans who walk around every day wi=
th a hole in their heart because they lost a loved one on that tragic day.&=
nbsp; And trying to make sense of that and trying to move on with
 one&#8217;s life is something that many of them have been challenged to do=
, and they&#8217;ve demonstrated tremendous patriotism and heroism as they&=
#8217;ve moved on with their lives.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And in some cases, we&#82=
17;re talking about parents who have had to raise kids on their own.&nbsp; =
In some cases, we&#8217;re talking about first-responders who have continue=
d to fight fires and respond to emergencies, even with
 the memory of their partner in the back of their mind.&nbsp; So there&#821=
7;s no denying the heroism of the 9/11 families.&nbsp; And there is no deny=
ing the courage that they have shown every single day since 9/11.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But what we&#8217;re focu=
sed on here -- and I think what the families are genuinely focused on as we=
ll -- is the national security of the United States and making sure that th=
e United States of America continues to preserve
 the ability to protect our interests around the globe.&nbsp; They understa=
nd that our capacity to do that is critical to preventing terrorist attacks=
 on American soil.&nbsp; So the President&#8217;s priority is not different=
 than the priority that&#8217;s been identified by the
 9/11 families when it comes to protecting the United States of America and=
 protecting our men and women in uniform and our diplomats as they serve ou=
r country around the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So did =
I hear you correctly that there were some changes that could have made that=
 could have reconciled this whole concern about sovereign immunity?&nbsp; O=
r did I -- in terms of the way these bills were written -- or is this just
 not a reconcilable situation?&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think the reason that we are going to talk to Democrats and Republicans i=
n Congress is to figure out if there is a way to address the serious concer=
ns that are raised by these potential, unintended
 consequences.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s possible at this po=
int, but we certainly are willing to engage in a bipartisan conversation to=
 make that happen if it&#8217;s possible.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the =
TSA -- there&#8217;s been a lot written lately about long lines at airports=
 and people being really inconvenienced.&nbsp; I saw a study that said the =
morale in Homeland Security is the lowest in the federal government; there&=
#8217;s high
 turnover.&nbsp; The summer season is coming up.&nbsp; And while that&#8217=
;s an inconvenience to travelers and all that, how much of a security risk =
is there now? Is it greater?&nbsp; Is there a concern in the administration=
 that because of this tension on the system, to put it
 mildly, that there is now a greater concern about security lapses, perhaps=
, at airports around the country?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, yo=
u probably should talk to somebody at the TSA to draw a definitive conclusi=
on about that.&nbsp; I think what I would just state is the significant cha=
llenge that TSA officers face, which is they don&#8217;t want to inconvenie=
nce
 people.&nbsp; They know people are just trying to get on their flight and =
do their business or go home to see their family or go on vacation or whate=
ver it is that they&#8217;re doing.&nbsp; But they want to make sure that p=
eople can engage in that travel safely.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so there&#8217;s alwa=
ys going to be a little tension in making sure that we&#8217;re doing thoro=
ugh checks and making sure that we are protecting the integrity of the avia=
tion system while also at the same time giving people
 the freedom to use that aviation system without a whole lot of hassle and =
inconvenience.&nbsp; And resolving that tension is challenging, and there a=
re a number of creative things that the TSA has tried to do -- the establis=
hment of pre-check, which allows some
 individuals to go and essentially go through a background check that&#8217=
;s conducted by the government so that they can go through an expedited sec=
urity line.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one example.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that the TSA has be=
en working closely with airports to see if airports can actually commit to =
using airport personnel to expedite the process.&nbsp; So, Ron, as a report=
er, you&#8217;ve had to travel through a lot of airports.&nbsp; It&#8217;s =
not
 uncommon for TSA officers to help people navigate the screening process by=
 loading materials into trays and getting into the right line.&nbsp; So tha=
t&#8217;s not necessarily a core security function so what you could do is =
the TSA could coordinate with airport staff
 so that when lines get long or volumes are expected to be high, that it&#8=
217;s airport personnel that don&#8217;t have a security function that can =
help people manage the security process so that all of the security-trained=
 people can be involved in the actual screening.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So my point is that there&#=
8217;s always going to be a little tension here in the basic function of th=
e TSA.&nbsp; And the TSA, to their credit, has worked hard to try to be cre=
ative about developing solutions that would make this process more
 efficient and not inconvenience travelers as greatly while also adhering t=
o the high security standards that I think we all would demand.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right, =
but, again, the long lines have revealed that there seems to be staffing pr=
oblems.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a high turnover rate; there&#8217;s low morale.=
&nbsp; And the question is, to what extent is all of that potentially compr=
omising safety at
 the airports?&nbsp; Is there a concern in the administration, has there be=
en some focus in trying to make sure -- well, you do this on a daily basis =
-- but given where we are in the last month or so of this particular phenom=
enon of these long lines, has there been
 some targeted effort focused to make sure that this is not causing securit=
y problems, beyond the inconvenience?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Even in =
the face of these significant challenges, the professionals at the TSA are =
committed to the safety and security of the American traveling public.&nbsp=
; And they maintain these very high standards because they&#8217;re concern=
ed
 about safety, and you&#8217;re right that this is something that they are =
reviewing safety standards and security standards regularly, daily, to ensu=
re that those high standards are being met.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re doing a=
ll that even though on average the TSA is now screening
 about 125,000 more passengers per day.&nbsp; And there has been an effort =
by the TSA to expedite the processing of the newest class of TSA officers.&=
nbsp; There has been an effort on the part of TSA to get Congress to approv=
e funds that could be reallocated so that
 additional overtime pay can be paid to the TSA officers so that they can b=
e paid for working longer hours and therefore try to shorten lines.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, again, there&#8217;s a =
lot of work that&#8217;s going into trying to be creative about how to not =
inconvenience travelers unduly while also maintaining the strict safety and=
 security standards that the American people would expect.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Byron.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; Has the President or the White House been tracking what&#8217;=
s happening -- or what happened in Nevada at the Democratic State Conventio=
n there?&nbsp; Sanders supporters were reportedly making death threats agai=
nst the state
 party chair to the point where the state party actually filed a complaint =
with the DNC.&nbsp; Does the White House have a reaction?&nbsp; And obvious=
ly there&#8217;s a lot of emotion around this primary process still.&nbsp; =
Is it time for the President to sort of step in and calm
 the waters and help unify the party, moving into the final stage?<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, as=
 it relates to the delegate selection process for individual states, I woul=
d refer you to the DNC.&nbsp; They have a very well-established process whe=
reby they review the plans that are put forward by individual states
 for choosing their delegates to the convention and every state does it dif=
ferently, and that makes the process a little cumbersome but it&#8217;s the=
 way that each state retains control over the process for selecting delegat=
es to the Democratic Convention.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think at the same tim=
e, you&#8217;ve heard the President on a number of occasions talk about how=
 political disputes can never justify an act of violence.&nbsp; And the Pre=
sident talked about this in his speech at the Rutgers commencement
 ceremony just on Sunday, about the importance of good citizenship, about t=
he importance of focusing on facts and evidence, and how the establishment =
of our political system was intended to resolve disputes among our citizens=
 to prevent violence from occurring
 in the first place.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think what is true is=
 the expectation that the President has that there will be a strong commitm=
ent to that principle of nonviolence.&nbsp; And the way that candidates in =
both parties address this question publicly is important and
 I&#8217;m confident it&#8217;s something that people all across the countr=
y will carefully watch.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the =
White House disturbed by the behavior of not only members of his own party =
making death threats against the state party chair over what is, essentiall=
y, as you characterized it, a political dispute?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
haven&#8217;t looked at the individual claims that have been made, but I th=
ink the President on a number of occasions has spoken out against violence =
and has certainly said that a political dispute like this can never
 be justified or used to justify an act of violence or even a threat of vio=
lence. And that is a principle that he has championed for a long time and h=
is expectation would be that politicians in both parties, whether they&#821=
7;re involved in an election or not, would
 express their support for that principle.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One mor=
e on the President&#8217;s legacy on special interest. Roll Call yesterday =
reported that a Republican lobbyist is trying to organize other lobbyists o=
n behalf of Hillary Clinton.&nbsp; She&#8217;s had lobbyist bundlers.&nbsp;=
 Donald Trump has
 hired some ex--foreign government lobbyists into his campaign.&nbsp; The P=
resident banned lobbyists from donating to his campaign and the DNC.&nbsp; =
No current 2016 campaign has embraced that pledge.&nbsp; Even Bernie Sander=
s sort of made this a key issue.&nbsp; Is the President
 worried that his legacy on this issue is being eroded?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, By=
ron, I think the authenticity of the change that President Obama brought to=
 Washington has been confirmed in what you just relayed.&nbsp; And it's an =
indication of how difficult it is to change our political system,
 particularly when it comes to confronting entrenched special interests and=
 the President is quite proud of his record of doing that.&nbsp; And the tr=
uth is, it&#8217;s going to be up to the next President to determine exactl=
y how to build on that progress.&nbsp; And presumably
 there are a variety of ways to do that, and I think that will be part of t=
he debate -- not just through the summer but also into the fall. But these =
principles of ensuring that citizens retain a voice in their government is =
something that the President has
 made a high priority.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over th=
e past week, you&#8217;ve had some pointed words from the podium about Repu=
blicans&#8217; use of this $100 billion figure in regard to the Iran nuclea=
r deal.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve gone back and asked them about it, and they basica=
lly point to the
 administration&#8217;s own use of it last summer, back in July, and a few =
instances from the Treasury Department, from Secretary Kerry, President Oba=
ma in an interview with The Atlantic.&nbsp; Where did the administration, w=
hen they were initially using that figure before
 the deal was finalized, where was that coming from?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Jo=
hn, what I can tell you is that there were initial estimates about the amou=
nt of money that Iran had in reserves outside of their country that were su=
bject to sanctions. And this is essentially money that Iran
 was not able to get access to because of the sanctions that we had put in =
place to compel them to come to the negotiating table.&nbsp; And those sanc=
tions did have the effect of bringing Iran to the negotiating table and ult=
imately pressuring Iran to sign on the
 dotted line of an agreement that verifiably prevents them from acquiring a=
 nuclear weapon.&nbsp; That was a genuine success.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, what the Secretary of =
the Treasury and others repeatedly tried to explain is how much money Iran =
was likely to get access to -- that much of those funds that were held over=
seas were basically already spoken for in terms of debts
 that Iran had already sort of -- they had already incurred.&nbsp; And what=
 critics of the deal have suggested is that Iran would get all that money a=
nd be flush with cash and then use it for terrorism.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve =
said that the critics were vastly exaggerating that
 risk.&nbsp; That was the essence of the debate at the time is we were tryi=
ng to explain exactly what would happen here.&nbsp; And they did vastly ove=
rstate that risk in a way that they continue to repeat.&nbsp; And they&#821=
7;re wrong about it.&nbsp; Ted Cruz just wrote an op-ed in
 the New York Times repeating this claim.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not uncommon to =
come across Republicans spouting off this false claim, and the truth is, wh=
at&#8217;s happened is we actually see officials in Iran saying they didn&#=
8217;t get nearly as much sanctions relief as they thought
 they would.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the time of the nego=
tiations, it was actually the Iran Central Bank Governor who came forward a=
nd said that they expected that Iran would get $30 billion in sanctions rel=
ief.&nbsp; And I think based on the tone and the comments from
 Iranian officials, they haven&#8217;t even met them that far.&nbsp; So tha=
t&#8217;s the essence of the way in which Republicans repeatedly misled the=
 American public when talking about the Iran deal or just didn&#8217;t know=
 what they were talking about.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it&#8217;s not just as i=
t relates to sanctions relief where what Republicans said didn&#8217;t turn=
 out to be true.&nbsp; Many of them, at the very beginning of this exercise=
, said that it didn&#8217;t make sense for the United States and the intern=
ational
 community to negotiate with Iran over their nuclear program because they&#=
8217;d never go along with the deal.&nbsp; They were wrong about that.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And many of our critics h=
ave suggested that Iran would never make -- take the kind of actions that a=
re consistent with rolling back key aspects of their nuclear program.&nbsp;=
 But yet that&#8217;s exactly what they did.&nbsp; They
 reduced their uranium stockpile by 98 percent.&nbsp; They rendered harmles=
s their heavy water reactor.&nbsp; They disconnected thousands of centrifug=
es.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And Republicans, critics =
of the deal suggested that the international community would never be able =
to verify Iran&#8217;s compliance with the agreement.&nbsp; But, in fact, t=
he nuclear experts at the IAEA -- an organization
 that&#8217;s won the Nobel Peace Prize, I might point out -- has verified =
Iran&#8217;s compliance with the agreement.&nbsp; So critics of the deal wh=
o predicted that we would never be able to verify that Iran was going along=
 with the agreement are wrong, or at least on the
 wrong side of an argument with internationally renowned nuclear experts.&n=
bsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the list of concerns t=
hat we have here with the way that Republicans have conducted this debate i=
s lengthy and I can certainly understand why Republicans appear quite despe=
rate to try to recapture what credibility
 they have left.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And des=
pite that characterization, isn&#8217;t it about the money being freed up f=
or Iran to use their other resources towards other programs?&nbsp; I mean, =
it's the money that the sanctions relief is going towards, these debts that=
 they&#8217;ve
 already incurred and paying those off, isn&#8217;t that freeing up another=
 pocket of money they could use?&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that kind of the Republi=
cans&#8217; point that they&#8217;ve got access now to a broader fund? Or i=
s your point just that they wouldn&#8217;t have paid off those debts
 in the first place?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, my=
 point is that they weren&#8217;t paying off those debts, and then when the=
 money was freed, some of them have gone to doing exactly that.&nbsp; So th=
ere&#8217;s no evidence that anybody can marshal that that&#8217;s exactly =
-- Republicans
 cannot demonstrate that what they predicted came true.&nbsp; But I can cer=
tainly substantiate the fact, even in the claims made by Iranians themselve=
s who are responsible for managing their economy, they&#8217;ve expressed c=
oncern about the fact that they haven&#8217;t gotten
 as much sanctions relief as they expected to get.&nbsp; And they acknowled=
ged a much lower level of sanctions relief than what Republicans said was l=
ikely to happen -- to say nothing of the many Republicans who I can point t=
o who said that Iran was going to get
 $150 billion in sanctions relief, a number that was completely unsubstanti=
ated.&nbsp; And then you&#8217;ve got somebody like Congressman Steve Scali=
se who said that Iran would get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanction=
s relief.&nbsp; So it appears he might have a little
 baggage when discussing the truth about the Iran deal.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what=
&#8217;s the bottom line?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the total figure?&nbsp; You sa=
id it was far less than $100 billion, but has Treasury come up with an esti=
mate?&nbsp; Or are you relying on what the Iranians have said publicly?<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have an assessment to share with you. You certainly can check with the Trea=
sury Department and maybe they&#8217;ll know.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my =
final question was, Senators Cornyn, Barrasso, and Mark Kirk -- they wrote =
a letter to the President yesterday regarding Ben Rhodes, calling on the Pr=
esident to fire him.&nbsp; You said that the President stands by his Deputy
 National Security Advisor.&nbsp; What&#8217;s your response to the letter?=
&nbsp; What&#8217;s the President&#8217;s response to the letter?<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The publ=
icity stunt that Senator Kirk attempted one week ago today -- I think prett=
y much everybody ignored it then, and I'm going to ignore it now.<o:p></o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, t=
hanks.&nbsp; Back on the Zika bill in the House.&nbsp; The White House wasn=
&#8217;t just saying that you don't want to offset the money from the Ebola=
 fund, you're saying you don't want to offset the money for Zika from anywh=
ere else in
 the budget.&nbsp; In a $4 trillion budget, why are you insisting that ther=
e be no offsets for this Zika relief?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
is is typically the way, Dave, that Congress has considered emergency appro=
priations, which is that they, recognizing the existence of an emergency, C=
ongress has not gotten bogged down in political fights related
 to pay-fors.&nbsp; Demonstrating a sense of urgency, most Congresses, when=
 confronted with a public health emergency, would consult with public healt=
h experts and consider carefully what sort of assistance should be provided=

 what we believe that this Congress should do.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the =
Ben Rhodes matter, obviously he didn&#8217;t go to the hearing today to tes=
tify like the committee wanted.&nbsp; Can you explain why last week you sai=
d this has nothing to do with executive privilege and today Neil Eggleston =
said,
 oh, yes, it does have to do with --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, he d=
idn&#8217;t.&nbsp; That word does not appear in the letter.&nbsp; And my go=
od friends at the House Government Oversight Committee posted that letter o=
n the website, so you can certainly check it out for yourself.&nbsp; But th=
e White
 House counsel did not raise that prospect.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why =
didn&#8217;t he go?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Because =
there&#8217;s longstanding concerns that we have expressed and that previou=
s Presidents have expressed when it comes to declining a request to volunta=
rily testify based on institutional concerns.&nbsp; The President of the
 United States should be able to get confidential, candid advice from his t=
op advisors.&nbsp; And this is a principle that basically every President h=
as observed.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I would note that at leas=
t one of the individuals who did testify before the House Oversight Committ=
ee today served in the previous administration and invoked exactly the same=
 concern -- because he had almost exactly
 the same title as Mr. Rhodes -- in explaining why he wouldn't testify befo=
re Congress.&nbsp; So this is an indication that it&#8217;s not a partisan =
matter, but rather a longstanding institutional difference of opinion betwe=
en Congress and the executive branch.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't=
 that asserting executive privilege without saying the words?&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=
bsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nb=
sp; Executive privilege applies specifically to situations when the Preside=
nt of the United States acts to protect information that is compelled by Co=
ngress.&nbsp; This was a specific request for testimony
 on a voluntary basis.&nbsp; So on one hand, you&#8217;ve got information t=
hat Congress is compelling; on the other hand, you&#8217;ve got testimony t=
hat was requested.&nbsp; So the principle is different.&nbsp; And that is e=
vident in the letter, so I would encourage you to check it
 out.<o:p></o:p></p>

of this week.&nbsp; He&#8217;s met with 15 Republicans.&nbsp; He&#8217;s su=
bmitted his questionnaire and members of the Judiciary Committee
 have posted that questionnaire publicly on their website.&nbsp; So we cont=
inue to apply pressure to Republicans.&nbsp; The President did an interview=
 with BuzzFeed just yesterday, talking about why this is a critically impor=
tant issue.&nbsp; And we're going to continue to
 raise pressure on Republicans.&nbsp; And all of the publically available d=

 going back to I guess it's technically called the Justice Against Sponsors=

 state, which is your concern about sovereign immunity there.&nbsp; From wh=
at -- you're saying from the podium, you&#8217;ve said focus on the substan=
ce, look at the facts.&nbsp; Are you saying that, in that sense, one of the=
 most emotionally eroded living memories in American
 history is being used for political purposes and in some ways overshadowin=
g the substance of a bill that you&#8217;ve described as perhaps potentiall=

say that this one issue is overshadowing all
 the other ways that this bill could become a problem for the U.S. or other=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
there&#8217;s no denying the charged, emotional nature of this issue and wh=
y the discussion of this particular legislation could arouse particularly s=
trong feelings. I'm not going to question the motive
 of the people who may be involved in supporting this bill.&nbsp; I'm just =
merely pointing out the source of the concerns that we've expressed.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This bill does potentiall=
y open up the United States to a range of unintended consequences that woul=
d be bad for our national security.&nbsp; It would be bad for our ability t=
o continue to coordinate with our allies,
 make that even harder, and it could risk -- put at risk the United States,=
 our assets, and maybe even our personnel in countries and courts all aroun=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that's the source of o=
ur concern.&nbsp; This is a concern that we've repeatedly expressed.&nbsp; =
And that's the reason we oppose the bill.&nbsp; It's not because we questio=

 promote the bill.&nbsp; Our concerns are substantive and relate specifical=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- pl=
ayed it in some way that this is some sort of special treatment or that thi=
s is being treated differently because of Saudi Arabia, versus, say, the Su=
preme Court decision that was just recently upheld
 regarding suing Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism, which the administra=
tion has supported.&nbsp; So can you explain the difference, I guess?<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I guess the difference is, is that there is this small class of countries t=
hat are confirmed state sponsors of terrorism that are in a separate catego=
ry from every other country.&nbsp; And, yes, that
 includes Iran.&nbsp; We do know that Iran uses assets of the state to supp=
ort terrorism around the world, including terrorism that has claimed the li=
ves of American citizens.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we do treat Iran diffe=

 not.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So yo=
u don't see the position to be supportive of the Supreme Court upholding be=
ing able to sue Iran and a position opposing this bill because it could com=
promise sovereign immunity as contradictory in any
 way?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, be=

hat power is too concentrated in the hands of too few located
 in this building and not other assets of national security establishment.&=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
a couple observations I guess.&nbsp; I think the first is the President&#82=
17;s current National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, has actually undertaken=
 an effort to try to streamline and reform certain functions
 of the National Security Council that have allowed her to reduce the size =
of the National Security Council by about I believe 10 percent or so.&nbsp;=
 And I think that's the first thing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think the second thing =
is there&#8217;s no denying the wide array of significant national security=
 challenges that any President of the United States confronts when they wal=
k into the Oval Office every morning.&nbsp; And
 ensuring that that President has access to the expertise and advice that h=
e needs to deal with those challenges is an important priority.&nbsp; And t=
he desire of some Republicans to try to limit the ability of the next Presi=
dent to make foreign policy decisions
 may reflect their lack of confidence in their prospects for the next presi=
dential election.<o:p></o:p></p>

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don'=

the Obama administration.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.=
&nbsp; Is the President aware of the readiness issues as it relates to the =
United States military?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Kevin, there certainly are a number of things that we believe that Congress=
 has proposed to do that would have a direct impact on our military readine=
ss.&nbsp; There are a whole range of programs
 that Congress repeatedly funds that our military leaders say that we don't=
 need, and there are a whole set of national security priorities that our m=
ilitary leaders have said are worthy of an investment from Congress that ha=
ve been underfunded by the United
 States Congress.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So there are a number of =
things that the President and our military leaders believe that we could do=
 that would enhance our readiness, and there are a number of things that Co=
ngress shouldn&#8217;t do that would degrade
 our readiness.&nbsp; And so there are concerns about the way that Congress=
 handles its business with respect to the military.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But I can tell you that t=
he President of the United States is quite proud of the finest fighting for=
ce that the world has ever known.&nbsp; He has often described his role as =
Commander-in-Chief and leading the men and
 women of the United States military as the greatest professional honor of =
his life.&nbsp; And I think, time and time again, we have seen the heroism =
and courage and professionalism of the United States military yield signifi=
cant and enormous benefits to the American
 people.&nbsp; And that's true when it comes to fighting Ebola.&nbsp; That'=
s true when it comes to rescuing hostages.&nbsp; And that's true when it co=
mes to taking out terrorists.&nbsp; The President is quite proud to lead th=
e United States military.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And y=
et he may veto the defense bill, despite the fact that there are a number o=
f F18s that can't be launched right now, B1 bombers having trouble.&nbsp; I=
'm just wondering if the President feels like the services
 deserve more money.&nbsp; And if they deserve more money, what&#8217;s he =
doing about it?&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to veto this bill.&nbsp; It can make=
 it even tougher for them to do the job and the missions that they&#8217;ve=
 been charged with.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Kevin, the President is not vetoing the bill and suggesting that Congress s=
houldn&#8217;t pass them any funding.&nbsp; The President is actually going=
 to veto the bill because he believes that Congress
 should more effectively fund our national security apparatus, including ou=
r military, and that there are programs that are worthy of more funding, an=
d more consistent funding.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I believe that Secretary =
Carter has spoken to this repeatedly, that right now what Congress is propo=
sing to do is to basically just fund the military for the next six months.&=
nbsp; That doesn&#8217;t make any sense.&nbsp; That's
 not a smart way to manage the most effective fighting force in the world, =
particularly one that we depend on to protect our national security.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this is an ill-advised=
 piece of legislation.&nbsp; And there are a number of reasons that we oppo=
se it.&nbsp; And the President --if this is passed, it's something that he =
will veto so that Congress can pass funding at
 an appropriate level for our United States military to protect our readine=
ss and to protect our country.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So whil=
e you all squabble back and forth with congressional leaders, what&#8217;s =
the message to the women and men who are charged with mission readiness and=
 their job is to protect us all?&nbsp; They need their funding.&nbsp; They =
need their
 money.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, the=

</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&=
nbsp; And so you guys have to figure this thing out. Because I get letters =
and emails from people who say, ask the White House, what are they doing ab=
out this?&nbsp; When are they going to put pen to paper and make sure that =
we&#8217;re
 covered and that we&#8217;re taken care of?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ke=
vin, it&#8217;s the responsibility of the United States Congress to fund ou=
r government.&nbsp; That includes funding our military.&nbsp; And I&#8217;l=
l remind that if people want to actually understand exactly what the Presid=
ent&#8217;s
 proposal is, we put forward a budget back in February.&nbsp; And for the f=
irst time in 40 years, Republican leaders in Congress refuse to have a hear=
ing to even discuss what the President&#8217;s Budget Director exactly what=
 our national security funding strategy should
 be.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s Republicans who have fallen down on the job.&nbsp;=
 It&#8217;s Republicans who have refused time and time again to handle thei=
r responsibilities consistent with putting our national security first.&nbs=
p;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">They&#8217;d much rather =
play politics and attack the President&#8217;s EO to prevent discrimination=
 against LGBT Americans, something that has nothing to do with funding our =
national security priorities, but, for some strange
 reason, is actually included as a provision in the NDAA bill.&nbsp; That&#=
8217;s not a provision that was inserted by Democrats, that was a provision=
 that was inserted by Republicans who are much more interested in playing p=
olitics than they are with funding our national
 security.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8=
217;s next?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the solution to the issue?&nbsp; Because eve=
ry day that goes by, there&#8217;s another aircraft that can&#8217;t be lau=
nched, there&#8217;s another soldier out there that doesn&#8217;t have what=
 she or he needs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, and=
 I think that is a very good question for the men and women in the United S=
tates Congress who have a responsibility to fund our government and to fund=
 our military.&nbsp; That is a core function of the United States
 Congress.&nbsp; That is the way that our Founders designed our system of g=
overnment.&nbsp; And the President has a responsibility to put forward a ve=
ry specific proposal and he did that.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s Republicans who =
refuse to even discuss it with him.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So Republicans are the on=
es that have to bear the responsibility of figuring out how they&#8217;re g=
oing to use their majority in the House and the Senate that they fought so =
hard for to make sure they&#8217;re doing right
 by our men and women in uniform.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly,=
 I&#8217;ll take this one because I&#8217;m not sure if April can make her =
way back in.&nbsp; The Urban League&#8217;s 40th State of Black America rep=
ort is out.&nbsp; Is black America better now than it was when President Ob=
ama took office?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; There is=
 no denying -- and Mitch McConnell agrees with me on this -- that all of Am=
erica is better since President Obama took office, and black America is bet=
ter since President Obama took office.&nbsp; And no matter how --
 on almost any measure that I can think of, whether it comes to graduate ra=
tes, access to health care, or the strength of our economy and job creation=
, by every measure, our economy and our country is stronger -- not just for=
 African Americans but for all Americans.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou, Josh.&nbsp; Someone who does not have a political agenda or any partisa=
n bones in his body I don&#8217;t think spoke about the new regulations in =
the administration.&nbsp; This is Cardinal Robert Sarah, one of the Pope&#8=
217;s right hands
 in the Vatican, speaking at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast this mo=
rning.&nbsp; He said, and I quote, &#8220;Should it be not that biological =
men should use a man&#8217;s bathroom.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t get any simpl=
er than that.&#8221;&nbsp; Does the administration have a reaction to criti=
cism
 of its new orders from a top Vatican official?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I haven&=
#8217;t seen his comments.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;l=
l give you the last one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou, Josh.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the President --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; She sat =
through the whole thing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had t=
o run -- I&#8217;m dealing with Roots over there -- I wanted to ask you abo=
ut that, too.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I unders=
tand.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou, Josh.&nbsp; When the President visits Japan for the G7 meeting next wee=
k, will the North Korean nuclear issue be discussed at this meeting?&nbsp; =
And also I have a second question for you.&nbsp; And what is it the United =
States final
 destination of North Korean nuclear issues?&nbsp; Does the President consi=
der before his administration, the end of this year, will there be more att=
ention to the North Korean nuclear issues?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I&=
#8217;m confident that this is an issue that will be discussed at the G7 me=
eting in Japan.&nbsp; Obviously the world is concerned about the provocatio=
ns and destabilizing activities of the North Korean regime, and Japan
 is particularly concerned about the impact that those activities could hav=
e on their national security.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States believes =
strongly in our alliance with Japan.&nbsp; The U.S.-Japan alliance is the c=
ornerstone of regional security in Northeast Asia.&nbsp; And the United Sta=
tes has deployed resources and personnel to Japan to assist them
 in countering the threat that emanates from North Korea.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it relates to resolving =
our broader concerns with North Korea&#8217;s nuclear program, we continue =
to work with the international community to pressure the North Korean regim=
e, to isolate them further and encourage them to come into compliance
 with their international obligations.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the United =
States worked effectively with China at the United Nations to ramp up the p=
ressure that has been placed on the North Korean regime.&nbsp; We put in pl=
ace sanctions that went farther than they
 ever have before in isolating that country and targeting certain industrie=
s in North Korea that we know generate revenue that&#8217;s used to invest =
in their nuclear program.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So those kinds of sanctions=
 would not be possible without the effective cooperation and coordination o=
f the United States and China, and we&#8217;re going to continue to work wi=
th the rest of the international community to make progress
 in isolating North Korea until they make clear that they&#8217;re prepared=
 to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and stop engaging in the kinds of pro=
vocative acts that are broadly destabilizing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is=
 President Obama&#8217;s final decision for the North Korean nuclear issues=
 before he steps down?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Look, th=
e next step will be up to the North Koreans and it will be up to the North =
Koreans to decide whether or not they&#8217;re ready to commit to denuclear=
izing the Korean Peninsula.&nbsp; Until they do, they&#8217;re going to con=
tinue
 to face the kind of isolation that they currently suffer from.&nbsp; <o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead, April.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t be angry.&nbsp; It&#821=
7;s hard dealing with two events at one time.&nbsp; One, as you talked abou=
t the Urban League, they&#8217;re talking about an issue -- ACA, focusing o=
n ACA, and hoping that the costs will
 be cut for health care, the price -- the high prices of health care.&nbsp;=
 What does this administration say in the midst of that report?<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I&=
#8217;m glad that you asked that question because it does give me an opport=
unity to point to the recent study that was published that indicates for th=
e first time the percentage of Americans with health insurance in
 2015 exceeded 90 percent.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That&#8217;s the highest =
annual measure that&#8217;s ever been recorded and is another sign of the i=
mportant progress that our country has made under the Affordable Care Act.&=
nbsp; One of the goals of the Affordable Care Act was
 to put downward pressure on the growth in health care costs.&nbsp; And sin=
ce the Affordable Care Act went into effect, we have seen the slowest growt=
h in health care costs on record.&nbsp; That, again, is another tangible si=
gn of the important benefits of the Affordable
 Care Act.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, as the law =
continues to be implemented and as more people get access to health care an=
d as more competition is created in individual markets, we&#8217;re optimis=
tic that we&#8217;re going to continue to put downward pressure on
 costs and put outward pressure on expanding coverage to even more American=
s.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the=
n on another subject, really fast.&nbsp; You have &#8220;Roots&#8221; in yo=
ur next building -- the conversation and airing I guess of the film, parts =
of the film.&nbsp; Can you explain why this White House for &#8220;Roots,&#=
8221; this historic movie event
 that happened decades ago, and the re-airing of it in a new version now?&n=
bsp; And also, the most recent movie filming, the John Legend movie, the Un=
derground movie.&nbsp; Can you talk to us why these events are happening he=
re?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
the significance is that this is obviously a film that shaped a generation =
of Americans views of our country&#8217;s history and of race relations in =
this country.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s been a movement to modernize the film
 and present an updated version that I think has a lot of people talking an=
d a lot of people considering some issues that are central to the founding =
of our country.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re central to our nation&#8217;s histo=
ry, and they&#8217;re central to the impact that race relations
 has on everyday life in the United States.&nbsp; So these are issues that =
are worthy of discussion and study and using an opportunity with the presen=
tation of a new film like this, the administration decided to try to capita=
lize on that opportunity to cultivate
 and engage in an important discussion.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this=
 is part of the President&#8217;s effort to keep the dialogue going on race=
?&nbsp; These movies -- the airing of these movies from this historic place=
?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, it=
 certainly is an opportunity for people to come together and discuss these =
issues.&nbsp; And certainly people&#8217;s interest in a film like this pro=
vides an appropriate venue for having those discussions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead, Mark.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn&=
#8217;t aware of this event.&nbsp; Was the President at this screening?<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; He is no=
t.&nbsp; He is not.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One oth=
er question.&nbsp; You mentioned the 90 percent with health insurance.&nbsp=
; Why is it not 100 percent?&nbsp; What&#8217;s holding up the ACA on that?=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, pa=
rt of what&#8217;s holding it up are Republican governors across the countr=
y that are opposing the expansion of Medicaid.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s unfortu=
nate that we&#8217;ve seen -- that we continue to see millions of Americans=
 be denied
 access to health care because Republicans in their state don&#8217;t want =
to be viewed as implementing, let alone supporting, the health care reform =
law, championed by President Obama.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s a -- there are mi=
llions of Americans who don&#8217;t have access to health
 care for that reason.&nbsp; That certainly is a big chunk of that 10 perce=
nt that doesn&#8217;t have access to health care.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of them are -- some of=
 those people are also individuals who have chosen to pay a penalty as oppo=
sed to paying for health insurance and we talked a lot last fall and even e=
arlier this spring about why that was not a common-sense
 financial choice but yet it&#8217;s a choice that some Americans make. <o:=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
