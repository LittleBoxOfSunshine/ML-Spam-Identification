Smith Statement on Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act and Related Leg=
islation

Washington D.C. =96 Congressman Adam Smith released the following statement=
 on the opioid related legislation considered by the House of Representativ=
es:

=93Our nation is in the midst of a heroin and prescription drug abuse epide=
mic, resulting in the deaths of thousands, and taking a toll on the health =
and safety of many Americans and their families. Since 2000, overdose death=
s have increased 137% - costing more than 60 lives a day. Congress must act=
 to stem this nation-wide epidemic by investing in prevention, treatment, r=
ecovery, and efforts to prevent the smuggling of drugs across our borders. =
Addiction is a brain disease, and given the medical and technological advan=
cements over the years, we now have a better understanding of the mental an=
d physical aspects of drug abuse; and can work to increase access to recove=
ry services that can turn the tide of this fight. The debate on the House F=
loor this week should have been much more comprehensive but I support the s=
teps we have taken to combat the drug abuse epidemic and I will continue to=
 support efforts to address inequities in our society.

=93While I am deeply disappointed that the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduc=
tion Act and its related bills do not provide the full funding necessary to=
 confront the rising numbers of overdose death and addiction, I believe the=
se legislative efforts will begin to address the fight against opioid and h=
eroin abuse. It is my hope that the conversations my colleagues and I had o=
n the piecemealed legislation that came to the House Floor this week will b=
e the beginning of a much larger fight to secure the resources and funding =
necessary to meaningfully address this crisis and treat the overdose and ad=
diction affecting our communities.

=93The scourge of this disease is not limited to single cities or groups. A=
s Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have personally f=
ought for the wellbeing of our service members and requested critical suppo=
rt in efforts to address opioid misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and deat=
h. I submitted an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Author=
ization Act, directing the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congr=
ess on the DOD=92s efforts to prevent, educate and treat prescription opioi=
d drug abuse.

=93While the current crisis we face in opioid abuse is extraordinarily impo=
rtant, we must remain cognizant of the unfinished business in the sentencin=
g disparity between crack vs. powder cocaine. That these are essentially tw=
o separate forms of the same substance remains a significant issue that can=
not be overlooked. In 2010, I supported the passage of S. 1789, the Fair Se=
ntencing Act of 2010, which reduced the sentencing disparity between offens=
es for crack and powder cocaine from 100:1 to 18:1. It also eliminated the =
mandatory minimum sentence for simple possession offenses. The 100:1 ratio =
was scientifically unjustifiable, and resulted in individuals of color bein=
g targeted and jailed with disproportionately longer sentences.

=93In the current Congress, I am a supporter of a number of bills that work=
 to correct this historical inequity. H.R. 1252, the Fair Sentencing Clarif=
ication Act, would make the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactively appli=
cable to federal prisoners serving mandatory minimum sentences for crack co=
caine. I also co-sponsored H.R. 1255, the Fairness in Cocaine Sentencing Ac=
t, which would eliminate disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine=
 sentences entirely =96 creating a 1:1 ratio. This legislation would combat=
 inequities in our justice system, requiring that the same amount of each d=
rug triggers the same sentence.

=93We know that in order to pursue true racial justice we must re-examine t=
he role of our justice system as the spearhead against the disease of drug =
addiction, challenging long-held assumptions and improving our system to em=
phasis prevention. Rather than focus on incarcerating Americans who suffer =
from addiction, we must focus on education, access to treatment services, a=
nd rehabilitation into society.  By doing so, we recognize the evidence-bas=
ed fact that remanding these individuals to jail and prison is structurally=
, as well as morally, wrong. I applaud my colleagues for the bipartisan wor=
k accomplished this week to start addressing the issues of opioid prescript=
ion and heroin drug abuse, but know there is much more work that still need=
s to be done.=94
