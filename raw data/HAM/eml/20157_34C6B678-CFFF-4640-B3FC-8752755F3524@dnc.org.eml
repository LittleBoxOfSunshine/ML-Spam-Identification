So now that Miami is confirmed, we can notify our attendees that the date h=
as changed to June 2. Can you mock up some language and send it to me to re=
view? Just something that thanks them for their support while notifying the=
m of the change (with an apology for any inconvenience).=20

Ideally we would send it this afternoon, but if you're slammed we can do it=
 tomorrow. Thank you!
