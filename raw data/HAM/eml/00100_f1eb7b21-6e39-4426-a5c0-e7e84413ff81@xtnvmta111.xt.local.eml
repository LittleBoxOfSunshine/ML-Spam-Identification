LASTING BERN: The Democratic National Committee is making some concessions to BERNIE SANDERS after all. POLITICO's Daniel Strauss reports the Vermont senator will have more sway on the party's platform committee.

Under a deal announced today, HILLARY CLINTON will pick six members of platform committee, Sanders five members and DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz four members. The concession addresses one of Sanders' chief desires as the primary season draws to a close - helping to shape Democrats' message. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4fe666a4347bc5daa95dcd4e9570544459d92c7b171f43679a0ddb5169b8be21 

It also comes at a time of high tension. Sanders has been criticized for his lack of condemnation after zealous supporters in Nevada disrupted party conventions there. And over the weekend he took the charged step of endorsing Wasserman Schultz's opponent in a congressional primary. More on that here: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4fe666a4347bc5daf9434e3658409fce9644d84b6104b1e0492845087c6ddf13 

Happy Monday. What concessions can we make? We concede that your weekend is over and that your first 2016 Blast of the week is here. Please don't endorse our primary opponents. Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through the day's campaign news, so send your tips, complaints and hottest hot takes to: hjackson@politico.com. 

2) FALL PREPARATION: HILLARY CLINTON's campaign hired a new communications operative today - a move that may presage a line of attack on DONALD TRUMP. Jess McIntosh will decamp to Brooklyn from a post at EMILY's List, a political action committee that helps elect female Democrats who are abortion rights supporters. (And which has endorsed Clinton.) POLITICO's Annie Karni reports McIntosh will serve in a newly created role that will involve messaging for media figures, social media influencers and other allies as they seek to define Trump. McIntosh will report to Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4fe666a4347bc5da897db835b30c05b8005476545aec74d6b990625be56c0374 

3) GENERAL PRACTICE: DONALD TRUMP and HILLARY CLINTON, meanwhile, continued to attack each other today. Trump, offering yet more evidence that he'll wield the '90s against Clinton like a cudgel, released a video attacking former President Bill Clinton that showed him chomping a cigar. The video and text then raised questions about whether HILLARY CLINTON was protecting women. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e92cb615e7b097fe76ec0602e7106f1cad7d8a7c0953e36bc5f5e355f777ca7d Clinton took her own shot at Trump - mocking his business acumen and four bankruptcies. "What little we know of his economic policies would be running up our debt, starting trade wars, letting Wall Street run wild, all of that could cause another crash and devastate
 working families and our country," the Democratic candidate told an audience at the Service Employees International Union's annual convention in Detroit. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e92cb615e7b097fe1a6e71c923e0db0a410b1bf41867622f9f3cb03dd6bbac13 

4) NO BET: Paul Ryan won't be betting on DONALD TRUMP - at least not yet. The GOP speaker tells POLITICO's Glenn Thrush that it's definitely possible Trump defeats HILLARY CLINTON. He also said he wouldn't hesitate to call out Trump if he feels like he's not sufficiently conservative. "I will," Ryan said. "I've done that in the past, and I will do that in future if need be, and I hope it's not necessary." What's notable in Thrush's interview: Ryan comes no closer to endorsing Trump and doesn't sound particularly warm to him after their meeting in Washington a few weeks ago and said Trump should answer the question of whether he is truly a conservative. 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e92cb615e7b097fed3310c0d0b2fc55bcc465dec4a28c10773325eaf1c449c2f 

BLAST NOTE: Beyond Trump, Thrush's podcast is particularly entertaining this week, if for no other reason than to hear Ryan's evident disgust with Axl Rose filling in as the new lead singer of AC/DC.

5) CORKED: A hyped meeting in New York and - well, not much to show for it. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, who has been reserved in his criticisms of DONALD TRUMP, played down talk he could be the real estate mogul's vice president as he talked to reporters after a meeting with him today. Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said the two discussed Russia and China. But he pushed off VP talk. "I will say that, you know the fact that he's challenging some of the status quo, if you will, it is causing these countries to think a little bit differently about the U.S. And I say that in a positive way," Corker said. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e92cb615e7b097fe36b69a2fa488e65a15dd4bae07732564c1bee6f765abe9f8 
BLAST NOTE: Of course this qualifies for the Blast's official vice presidential selection theme song. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e92cb615e7b097fea6c85b848109d64c6a12058e26353876d13d0a4ed1b0d238 

TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Al Gore finds many inconvenient truths in DONALD TRUMP's climate ideas. BERNIE SANDERS doesn't like the Puerto Rico deal and deconstructing HILLARY CLINTON's slogan. 

GORE-Y DETAILS: Former Vice President Al Gore is aghast at DONALD TRUMP's climate change policies. (Today) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e92cb615e7b097fe7fb4cf1b807257d0d604c0d2997553f1a07525c34cfb849e 

REMAKING THE (HIGHEST) OFFICE: Ricky Gervais says DONALD TRUMP would be "the funniest" president. (Rolling Stone) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e92cb615e7b097fe801562f80b838936b47e3c1a8628c4a3af50c0c003a239d3 

DEEP BREATHS: NPR explains why everyone should relax a bit about general election polling right now. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5cda5089689184f688e32aa6964394ad34925fc6211a68be8e6a11e7a821c5f2 

PUERTO RICO FIGHT: BERNIE SANDERS is calling for Democrats to reject the Puerto Rico debt deal. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5cda5089689184f65352167a68f930b7a8b35692bf7b986230452653bdb2d908 

BULLY PULPIT: HILLARY CLINTON also called DONALD TRUMP a "bully" today. (NBC) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5cda5089689184f6cb49993d27270d6f381bdc89719c0da472fc47d2d0423f65 

SLOGANEERING: Looking for deeper meaning in "We're Stronger Together" HILLARY CLINTON's newest slogan. (Washington Post) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5cda5089689184f69c931e9e3be563d0d4db1d7d1b18c6f67372ba7508e4c27c 

BROOKLYN MUSIC SCENE: The Clinton campaign released an official campaign Spotify playlist. So you can sing along. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5cda5089689184f633716fceb69bd0e6699a97d88d92745a6f885412464b309a 

WHAT'S NEXT: Democrats are focused on California. BERNIE SANDERS has events in Los Angeles today. HILLARY CLINTON also has fundraisers there. 

THEY SAID IT: "When people go to the polls in November, they are not just picking a person ... they're also picking a path,"
- Paul Ryan, on November's election. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5cda5089689184f6c9d9b4f62ae64a3964de7c02716d8acb949e218e3295c6a5 

MAGIC NUMBER: 39. 
That's the percentage of Democratic-leaning independents who are closely watching the election right now, per Gallup. About 10 percentage points less than Republican-leaning independents. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5cda5089689184f6882fe3c82a821583a25d85169213f31973510b1e34f4d1b5
