Ted Cruz will announce Wednesday that Carly Fiorina will be his vice presidential nominee if he's the Republican party's pick for president, according to two sources with knowledge of the announcement.

Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard CEO, has been among Cruz's most loyal and active surrogates since she ended her own 2016 GOP presidential bid after a poor finish in New Hampshire in February.

The announcement, which was teased early Wednesday morning and will be made official Wednesday afternoon, comes the day after Cruz suffered a drubbing at the hands of Donald Trump in five northeastern primaries - losses that mathematically eliminated Cruz from getting the 1,237 delegates he'd need to clinch the GOP nomination.

Cruz's hopes now rest in a contested convention this summer in Cleveland, where the Texas senator would hope to stop Trump on the first ballot and then win in subsequent rounds of voting thanks to support from the loyal delegates his campaign has assiduously courted.

Cruz is campaigning fervently this week in Indiana, where primary rules award the winner most of the state's 57 delegates. With Trump's victories Tuesday night, and with most of Pennsylvania's 54 unbound delegates are leaning in Trump's direction, Cruz needs success in Indiana and California if he's to stop Trump from clinching the nomination.

The most recent Indiana polls show Trump polling around 40 percent, between 5 and 8 percentage points ahead of Cruz. Those polls were conducted before John Kasich - who's polling around 20 percent in the state - announced that he would no longer actively campaign in Indiana, in exchange for Cruz agreeing to no longer actively campaigning in Oregon and New Mexico.
