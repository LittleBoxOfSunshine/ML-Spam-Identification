2004: TRUMP BRAGGED THAT HE HAD "ALWAYS MADE A LOT OF MONEY IN BAD MARKETS"

Trump: "I Always Made A Lot Of Money In Bad Markets.  I Love Bad Markets." TRUMP: "The real estate markets in 1990 crashed.  I had billions and billions of dollars in debt.  I had many friends that went bankrupt." BLITZER: "You were going down?" TRUMP: "Well, I was, but I worked hard. And my company today is a much bigger, stronger company than it ever was in the 1980s or 1990s even.  But I was in trouble if I didn't get really back on the stick and start working.  The real estate markets crashed.  Now, I don't want to blame the real estate markets, because I always made a lot of money in bad markets.  I love bad markets.  You can do very well in a bad market."

2005: TRUMP PRESENTED THE "SO-CALLED HOUSING BUBBLE" AS AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY

Donald Trump In September 2005 On The "So-Called Housing Bubble": "Are You The Type Of Person Who Takes Advantage Of Positive Situations When They Present Themselves...Or Do You Heed Every Message Of Doom And Gloom, Avoiding Risks That Could Be Some Remarkable Opportunities?" "How you react to the so-called housing bubble can be a barometer of your business personality. Are you the type of person who takes advantage of positive situations when they present themselves, riding them out as long as they last? Or do you heed every message of doom and gloom, avoiding risks that could be some remarkable opportunities? Obviously, good things don't last forever. But in a competitive business environment, you have to be willing to take chances. You can't always live in fear. That said, when things start to look questionable, you also have to be smart enough to know when to get out."

2006: TRUMP IMPLIED PEOPLE WHO TALKED ABOUT A REAL ESTATE BUBBLE WERE ACTUALLY JUST AFRAID OF HARD WORK

2006: Trump To His Potential Students: "Is It The So-Called Bubble You're Afraid Of Or Is It Hard Work?" "You can get rich in real estate. I've proved it, and so have each of these presenters, but you must treat it as a discipline. You have to study real estate. You have to learn how to spot a deal, understand a neighborhood, follow trends, evaluate a property, and you must be willing to dig in for the long term. This program is for the serious real estate investor. Is it the so-called bubble you're afraid of or is it hard work? If you're willing to do what it takes, you will succeed in any market.

2007: TRUMP SAID HE WAS "EXCITED" FOR A REAL ESTATE BUBBLE BECAUSE HE HAD ALWAYS MADE MORE MONEY THAT WAY

Trump On A Real Estate Bubble: "People Have Been Talking About The End Of The Cycle For 12 Years, And I'm Excited If It Is... I've Always Made More Money In Bad Markets Than In Good Markets." "Donald Trump almost lost his shirt 15 years ago when the North American real estate bubble burst. The 2007 version of that disaster will be much more benign, the real estate magnate predicts, although there is softness in some urban markets, such as Toronto and San Francisco. 'We're talking very minor [problems] compared with the depression of the early 1990s,' Mr. Trump said yesterday in a phone interview from Los Angeles. Mr. Trump said he is poised to invest in depressed property as the downturn moves through individual cities. 'People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is,' he said. 'I've always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.'"

Donald Trump in 2006: I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks<http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/19/politics/donald-trump-2006-hopes-real-estate-market-crashes/index.html>
By Jeremy Diamond, CNN

Two years before the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, Donald Trump said he was hoping for a crash.

"I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy," Trump said in a 2006 audiobook from Trump University, answering a question about "gloomy predictions that the real estate market is heading for a spectacular crash."
The U.S. housing bubble burst two years later, triggering the stock market crash of 2008 that plunged the U.S. economy into a deep recession, leaving millions of Americans unemployed.

Trump was speaking with Jon Ward, a marketing consultant who "masterminded all the initial education programs for Trump University," according to his website<http://www.jonward.net/more-about-jon/>. The audiobook is available on iTunes.

"If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you can make a lot of money," Trump said in the 2006 audio book, "How to Build a Fortune." "If you're in a good cash position -- which I'm in a good cash position today -- then people like me would go in and buy like crazy."

The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

Few, including Trump, predicted the 2008 crash or the magnitude of the recession that would ensue.

"I'm not a believer that the interest market -- that the real estate market is going to take a big hit," Trump said in the same interview.

But Trump's comments in the audio book, a project of his Trump University -- which is currently facing three lawsuits representing thousands of former students<http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/08/news/trump-university-controversy-donald-trump/> -- underscore the challenges the billionaire and presumptive Republican nominee will increasingly face in the general election as comments from his life before politics return to haunt him.

Trump has come under fire for a slew of remarks he made before entering the presidential fray last year, from misogynistic comments about women to statements on certain issues that undercut his current policy positions.
But in beating back such criticism, Trump has sought to convince voters that, despite his multiple flirtations with running for president over the last two decades, he never planned to run for president, "Don't forget, I was never going to run for office," he has said.

Trump, who has staked his candidacy on his wealth and business acumen, has also been unabashed about prioritizing his business interests above all else -- even when it has involved helping politicians with policy positions antithetical to his own.

He defended his hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to Democrats by saying that he "got along with everybody" in order to boost his business.

Trump has also defended the bankruptcies several of his businesses have undergone, saying he has "taken advantage of the laws of this country," even as thousands of his employees lost their jobs as a result.

And he has also defended manufacturing much of his merchandise abroad, including in countries like China.
But as he launched his presidential bid last June, Trump flipped the script and struck a decisively populist tone --pledging take on very same self-interested maneuvers of businesses that he also employed -- and vowed to compel U.S. businesses to manufacture in the U.S. and slammed the influence of special interests in Washington.

 real estate magnate predicts, although there is softness in some urban markets, such as Toronto and San Francisco. &#8216;We're talking very minor [problems] compared with the depression of the early 1990s,&#8217; Mr. Trump said yesterday in a phone interview from Los
 Angeles. Mr. Trump said he is poised to invest in depressed property as the downturn moves through individual cities. &#8216;People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is,&#8217; he said. &#8216;I've always made more money in bad
 markets than in good markets.&#8217;&#8221; [Globe and Mail, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/trump-touts-soft-markets-in-cities-like-toronto/article17993211/">

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">By&nbsp;Jeremy Diamond, CNN</span></b><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
<span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Two years before the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, Donald Trump said he was hoping for a crash.</span></span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
<span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">&quot;I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy,&quot; Trump said in a 2006 audiobook from Trump University, answering a question about &quot;gloomy predictions that the real estate market
 is heading for a spectacular crash.&quot;</span></span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The U.S. housing bubble burst two years later, triggering the stock market crash of 2008 that plunged the U.S. economy into a deep recession, leaving millions of Americans unemployed.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
Trump was speaking with Jon Ward, a marketing consultant who &quot;masterminded all the initial education programs for Trump University,&quot;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jonward.net/more-about-jon/" target="_blank">according to his website</a>. The audiobook is available on
 iTunes.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
<span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">&quot;If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you can make a lot of money,&quot; Trump said in the 2006 audio book, &quot;How to Build a Fortune.&quot; &quot;If you're in a good cash position -- which I'm in a good
 cash position today -- then people like me would go in and buy like crazy.&quot;</span></span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
Few, including Trump, predicted the 2008 crash or the magnitude of the recession that would ensue.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
&quot;I'm not a believer that the interest market -- that the real estate market is going to take a big hit,&quot; Trump said in the same interview.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
But Trump's comments in the audio book, a project of his Trump University -- which is currently facing&nbsp;<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/08/news/trump-university-controversy-donald-trump/">three lawsuits representing thousands of former students</a>&nbsp;--
 underscore the challenges the billionaire and presumptive Republican nominee will increasingly face in the general election as comments from his life before politics return to haunt him.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
Trump has come under fire for a slew of remarks he made before entering the presidential fray last year, from misogynistic comments about women to statements on certain issues that undercut his current policy positions.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">But in beating back such criticism, Trump has sought to convince voters that, despite his multiple flirtations with running for president over the last two decades, he never planned
 to run for president, &quot;Don't forget, I was never going to run for office,&quot; he has said.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
Trump, who has staked his candidacy on his wealth and business acumen, has also been unabashed about prioritizing his business interests above all else -- even when it has involved helping politicians with policy positions antithetical to his own.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
He defended his hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to Democrats by saying that he &quot;got along with everybody&quot; in order to boost his business.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
Trump has also defended the bankruptcies several of his businesses have undergone, saying he has &quot;taken advantage of the laws of this country,&quot; even as thousands of his employees lost their jobs as a result.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
And he has also defended manufacturing much of his merchandise abroad, including in countries like China.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">But as he launched his presidential bid last June, Trump flipped the script and struck a decisively populist tone --pledging take on very same self-interested maneuvers of businesses
 that he also employed -- and vowed to compel U.S. businesses to manufacture in the U.S. and slammed the influence of special interests in Washington.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
