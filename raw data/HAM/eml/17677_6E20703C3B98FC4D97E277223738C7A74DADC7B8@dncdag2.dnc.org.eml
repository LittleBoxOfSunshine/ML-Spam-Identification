Obama to lay out vision for Vietnam ties after ending arms ban<http://www.r=

U.S. President Barack Obama is set to lay out more of his plan for a strong=
er alliance with Vietnam on Tuesday, after scrapping an arms ban that was t=
he last big hurdle between two countries drawn together by concern over Chi=
na's military buildup. The removal of a vestige of the Vietnam War suggests=
 U.S. worries about Beijing's reclamation of islands in the South China Sea=
 and deployment of advanced radars and missile batteries in the disputed re=
gion trumped concerns about Vietnam's human rights record. Washington had f=
or years said a lifting of the ban would require concrete steps by Vietnam =
in allowing freedom of speech, worship and assembly and releasing political=
 prisoners. In a joint news conference on Monday with Vietnamese counterpar=
t Tran Dai Quang, Obama said "modest" human rights improvements had been ma=
de and the decision to end the embargo was about the changing dynamic in ti=

U.S. Strike on Taliban Leader Is Seen as a Message to Pakistan<http://www.n=
ytimes.com/2016/05/24/us/politics/afghanistan-pakistan-taliban-leader.html>

NEW YORK TIMES // MARK LANDLER AND MATTHEW ROSENBERG

Early on Saturday, a middle-aged Pashtun man used forged documents to cross=
 from Iran into Pakistan. A few hours later, on a lonely stretch of highway=
, he was incinerated by an American drone. It is not exactly clear how the =
Americans tracked Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, leader of the Afghan Tali=
ban, to a white sedan rattling across the arid expanse of Baluchistan Provi=
nce. The United States picked up a mix of phone intercepts and tips from so=
urces, American and European officials said, and there were reports that Pa=
kistan also provided intelligence. President Obama described Mullah Mansour=
's death on Monday as an "important milestone" - but the strike was also an=
 illustration of the tangled relationship between Washington and Islamabad.=
 Not since Mr. Obama ordered Navy SEALs to hunt down Osama bin Laden in May=
 2011 has he authorized a military incursion in Pakistan as audacious as th=
is one. The White House did not inform the Pakistanis in advance of the ope=
ration, which occurred outside the frontier region near Afghanistan, the on=
e place where Pakistan has tolerated American drone strikes in the past. By=
 using the military's Joint Special Operations Command rather than the C.I.=
A. to carry out the attack, the United States denied Pakistan the fig leaf =
of a covert operation, which in the past has given the Pakistanis the abili=
ty to claim they had been consulted beforehand.



Obama Chides Congress Over Zika Funding<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/u=

NEW YORK TIMES // CARL HULSE

The House and Senate are gearing up for a push before a Memorial Day break =
that President Obama said Congress should not take unless it got some very =
specific business done. Mr. Obama chided lawmakers last week, saying they s=
hould not leave town at the end of this week unless they reconcile their di=
fferences over a Zika prevention funding bill and send him public health le=
gislation he is willing to sign. "They should not be going off on recess be=
fore this is done," Mr. Obama said about putting resources behind an effort=
 to stop the spread of the mosquito-borne virus. "To the extent that we're =
not handling this thing on the front end, we're going to have bigger proble=
ms on the back end." But chances of a quick compromise on the legislation s=
eem dim. The House has provided only about half as much as the $1.1 billion=
 approved by the Senate - both well short of the $1.9 billion sought by the=
 White House. And the House bill would shift money to fight Zika from effor=
ts to combat Ebola, which Mr. Obama compared to robbing Peter to pay Paul.



VA chief compares waits for veteran care to Disneyland: They don't measure =

WASHINGTON POST // LISA REIN

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald, under pressure to be more trans=
parent about how VA measures wait times for veteran care, on Monday said th=
e government should be more like Disneyland. Disney doesn't track how long =
visitors wait in line for attractions at its theme parks to decide if they =
liked their experience, he said. So the VA should not be held to the same s=
tandard for medical appointments for veterans. "When you go to Disney, do t=
hey measure the number of hours you wait in line? Or what's important?" McD=
onald told reporters at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Moni=
tor. "What's important is, what's your satisfaction with the experience?" T=
he comparison brought swift, political-season condemnation from Republicans=
 and veteran service organizations, who said McDonald was being insensitive=
 to veterans.

USA TODAY // DONOVAN SLACK

Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald said Monday that he b=
elieves veterans' wait times for appointments aren't a valid measure of the=
ir experience at the VA and releasing more wait-time data would create nega=
tive headlines that would distract people from what really matters. The VA =
currently does not release data showing how long veterans wait between sche=
duling an appointment and being seen. "So why don't I also make the measure=
ment of the fit of your prosthetic sleeve public?" McDonald said at a break=
fast with reporters organized by The Christian Science Monitor. "I mean, I'=
ve got so many measures, if I make them all public, you're all going to wri=
te headlines about them and they're going to distract people from what's im=
portant. I don't want to do that. I want people focused on what's really im=

A top security chief at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) wh=
o came under fire for receiving a $90,000 bonus has been removed from his p=
ost, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said Monday evenin=
g. The panel tweeted that Kelly Hoggan, assistant administrator for the off=

ng a committee hearing earlier this month on TSA misconduct. A House commit=
tee aide said Hoggan has been reassigned at the agency, but could not provi=
de further details. A spokeswoman for TSA did not immediately return a requ=
est for comment. Hoggan came under fire during an Oversight hearing for rec=
eiving a $90,000 bonus, which was paid in small increments over a 13-month =
period, despite a damning report that showed that screeners he oversaw were=
 failing to detect fake bombs and weapons during security tests. The agency=

wait times at airports around the country.



Breyer: Supreme Court can function with 8 justices<http://www.politico.com/=

POLITICO // ASSOCIATED PRESS

Justice Stephen Breyer said Monday that the Supreme Court has not been dimi=
nished by having only eight members since the death of Justice Antonin Scal=
ia in February. Breyer suggested in response to questions at an awards cere=
mony at the Library of Congress that Scalia would have made a difference in=
 only four or five cases out of more than 70 the court will decide this ter=
m. "We may divide 4-4 in four or five cases, we may not," Breyer said of th=
e term than will end in June. That could include some of the term's biggest=
 cases involving abortion and immigration. A tie vote would leave the lower=
 court ruling in place and prevent the court from setting a legal precedent=
 that applies to the entire country. The court has already deadlocked in th=
ree cases, including a high-profile dispute over public-sector labor unions=
. And last week, the justices returned a dispute over access to birth contr=
ol to lower courts, suggesting they could not form a majority that would ha=
ve settled a major conflict over the scope of the nation's health care law.

Democrats, seeking unity, give Sanders say in party platform<http://www.reu=

The Democratic Party said on Monday it would give U.S. presidential contend=
er Bernie Sanders a prominent say in writing its platform this year, a gest=
ure that could ease tensions between Sanders' camp and party leaders, whom =
Sanders has accused of favoring rival Hillary Clinton. Sanders has remained=
 steadfast in his long-shot battle with Clinton for the Democratic nominati=
on for the Nov. 8 presidential election, even though he lags her in the del=
egate count with only a few state contests remaining. The divisiveness amon=
g the Democrats stands in contrast to the Republicans, whose party leaders =
are slowly rallying behind Donald Trump, their presumptive nominee. Sanders=
' tenacity appeared to be paying off. The U.S. senator from Vermont will be=
 allowed to name five members to the 15-member committee that writes the pl=
atform at the Democratic National Convention in late July in Philadelphia e=
ven if he is not the nominee. Clinton will name six. The party said in a st=
atement the split was based on the results of state votes to date "in an ef=
fort to make this the most representative and inclusive process in history.=
" The party's chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, will name the committee=
's final four members.

The Democratic National Committee made a bid to quell an escalating feud wi=

the party around likely nominee Hillary Clinton. With Clinton having all bu=

. Clinton gets six members and four others are appointed by DNC chairwoman =
Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who Sanders has accused of tilting the nomination=
 process in Clinton's favor. Sanders said he was satisfied with the comprom=

Trump fuels Democratic voter surge<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/ca=

When the deadline to register to vote in California's June 7 primary closes=
 Monday evening, Democrats are expected to be the big winners. The party ha=
s enjoyed a dramatic spike in registration since the beginning of the year =
- and they have Donald Trump to thank for it. In the first three months of =
the year, California added 1.5 million new voters through the end of April =
- double the number of new voters added during the same time period in 2012=
. And the total number of registered Democrats increased by nearly 100,000 =
people between the beginning of January and the beginning of April - compar=
ed to a gain of just 15,000 registered Republicans, according to an analysi=
s from Political Data Inc., a California-based voting analytics firm. Paul =
Mitchell, Political Data's vice president, notes that Democratic registrati=
on typically increased when the news cycle revolved around Donald Trump. "W=
hat's interesting is that the upticks have been greatest among Democrats an=
d Latinos on those days where Donald Trump is kind of dominating the conver=
sation," said Mitchell, a former Democratic consultant who has analyzed Cal=

 inherent racism," Carter added of the GOP's presumptive presidential nomin=

 Obama that exudes a "heavy racial overtone." "I think there's a heavy reac=

as a board member of the Clinton Global Initiative, part of the charitable =
foundation set up by former President Bill Clinton, CNN said, citing uniden=

THE HILL // PETER SULLIVAN

Two Republican lawmakers are breaking with their party's long-stated goal o=
f repealing ObamaCare by putting forward a healthcare plan that leaves part=
s of the system in place. While the new bill from Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex=
as) and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) is a departure from the core Republican i=
dea of full repeal, it could provide a roadmap for changes that could be en=
acted under a GOP president. At the center of the bill is a $2,500 tax cred=
it that any citizen could use to purchase health insurance. The plan would =
repeal ObamaCare's mandates for individuals to have coverage and for employ=
ers to provide it, as well as the reform law's requirements for what an ins=
urance plan must cover. But much of ObamaCare would remain, including its s=
afeguards against insurers discriminating based on pre-existing conditions.=
 The law's tax increases would also be kept. Sessions and Cassidy acknowled=

the whole law; they said they are dealing with the "political reality."

MORNING CONSULT // MARY ELLEN MCINTIRE

Two GOP lawmakers have introduced a bill that deviates from years of Republ=
ican health care orthodoxy by not attempting to repeal the Affordable Care =
Act. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) on Monday f=
ormally announced a bill that they say would cover more people than the Aff=
ordable Care Act does now. While the bill does not repeal the 2010 health c=
are law, it would repeal both the individual and employer mandates and limi=
ts the "non-essential" products that plans would have to cover. They aren't=
 being shy about how great they think their proposal is. They are calling i=
t the "World's Greatest Healthcare Plan." Republicans have long promised to=
 repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but the politics just may not =
work that way, Sessions and Cassidy said at joint press conference.



Fearing a Last-Minute Obstacle in a Push to Release 9/11 Findings<http://ww=

NEW YORK TIMES // CARL HULSE

After years of frustration, proponents of releasing 28 classified pages of =
a congressional inquiry into the Sept. 11 attacks were seeing real progress=
 in their push for disclosure of findings that are said to show high-level =
Saudi Arabian support for the hijackers. "We seem to be coming to a point o=
f decision as to whether to release it or not and in what form," said Bob G=
raham, the former Democratic senator from Florida, who served as a co-chair=
man of the 2002 inquiry and has made disclosure of the pages a personal cau=
se since leaving Congress. But last-minute obstacles, often by design, have=
 a way of cropping up in Washington and slowing things down. Mr. Graham hop=
es he is not seeing an example of that, he said, after suggestions from Jam=
es R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, that Congress wil=
l ultimately be left to decide what to do with the pages once intelligence =
officials finish a review as early as next month. That approach - first rai=
sed in a private meeting last week among Mr. Clapper, Mr. Graham and lawmak=
ers - took Mr. Graham by surprise. It threatens to add a new layer of compl=
exity to a process that those backing the release thought was reaching its =
long-sought end.

The Senate is set to vote Wednesday on proceeding to a defense policy bill.=
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) set up the vote on Monday, =
moving to end debate on whether or not to take up the bill. Sen. John McCai=
n (R-Ariz.) had lambasted his colleagues for making the defense bill - pass=

ocedural hurdles. "We are going to go through some kind of foolishness of h=

he chairman of the Armed Services Committee, tried to get an agreement to m=
ove immediately to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), but was b=
locked by Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Though GOP leadership had fl=

A "SWAT team" of eight House GOP lawmakers has begun meeting to strike a la=
st-ditch deal on a fiscal 2017 budget, Republican Study Committee Chairman =
Bill Flores (R-Texas) told The Hill on Monday. It's just the latest attempt=
 to jump-start a budget process that many on Capitol Hill have left for dea=

ward to get a budget on the floor," Flores said during an interview in his =
Capitol Hill office. "That team has been formed and we are working on that,=
" he added. The creation of the SWAT team comes amid GOP infighting over a =
budget resolution that has gone on for months.

THE HILL // DAVID MCCABE

A bill that would make it easier for law enforcement to get cellphone locat=
ion data during emergencies was rejected by the House of Representatives on=
 Monday, after critics said it could too easily be abused. The Kelsey Smith=
 Act failed to get the two-thirds vote required to pass under suspension of=
 the rules, with 229 votes for the bill and 158 votes against. It marked a =
defeat for House leadership, because it is uncommon for bills to fail under=
 suspension. The Huffington Post reported that the family of Kelsey Smith, =
who was murdered after being kidnapped almost 10 years ago, watched from th=
e gallery as the bill failed. The measure would have made it easier for law=
 enforcement to get location data from cellphones in emergency situations b=
y requiring telecom companies to provider it. Critics said it gave police t=
oo much power - and urged lawmakers to vote against it even as they said th=
ey agreed with the broader purpose of the law.

Sen. Bob Corker says he declined an invitation to join President Barack Oba=
ma's historic trip to Asia this week, citing the busy congressional schedul=
e. But Corker did find time for a New York meeting with Donald Trump on Mon=
day - a visit the Tennessee Republican downplayed despite ceaseless questio=

chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is plainly excited about=
 Trump's candidacy upending traditional political allegiances in Washington=
, even as he deflects questions about joining the Manhattan mogul on the ti=
cket. Trump has campaigned as a deal maker who isn't beholden to parties or=
 ideology - the kind of pitch that could fit nicely with Corker's own prope=
nsity for working across the aisle. "Right now our country's on a very nega=
tive trend with things as they're going with both parties and the situation=
 we're in. That's the thing that's attracted Americans to [Trump] is hoping=
 the status quo will change and we can address some of the big issues the n=
ation is dealing with," Corker said in a brief interview Monday after visit=
ing with Trump.

Eager to move on from the Democratic primary race, Hillary Clinton has turn=

how she might confront him in the general election. Mr. Sanders's campaign =
last week tentatively accepted an invitation by Fox News to participate in =
a debate before California's June 7 primary, and expressed hope that Mrs. C=

Hillary Clinton's campaign said on Monday that she will not participate in =
a California debate against Bernie Sanders before the state's primary on Ju=

 continue her pivot to the general election fight against Donald Trump, the=
 likely Republican nominee. "We have declined Fox News' invitation to parti=

Sen. Bernie Sanders was given unprecedented say over the Democratic Party p=

 choose nearly as many members of the Democratic Party platform-writing bod=

WASHINGTON POST // DAVID WEIGEL

Thirty-two minutes into his speech to a large and slightly sunburned crowd,=
 Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) finally did it. He mentioned that he was running=
 against someone. "We don't hang out in fancy mansions raising millions of =
dollars," Sanders said. "One of the differences between Secretary Clinton a=
nd our campaign is that we've raised money in the old-fashioned way. ... Se=
cretary Clinton and Donald Trump are doing it a little bit differently." Th=
ere were boos at the mention of Clinton's name, but not many. The largely L=
atino crowd in east Los Angeles's Lincoln Park offered no chants or "Bernie=
 or Bust" heckles. As his campaign quietly fights to influence July's Democ=
ratic National Convention, Sanders is limiting his own critiques of Clinton=
 to electability and to her support from super PACs that can collect unlimi=

 from Washington, D.C., to Nevada, to Wyoming - are about to get far more a=

WASHINGTON POST // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

Donald Trump appeared Friday before the National Rifle Association and prom=
ised to roll back gun restrictions if elected president. The next day, Hill=
ary Clinton stood before a group of mothers who have lost children or other=
 relatives to gun violence and vowed to fight for stricter gun control. The=
 back-to-back speeches by the presumptive Republican nominee and his likely=
 Democratic opponent signal the prominent role that gun issues may play in =
the presidential election. That would be a welcome contrast to the recent p=
ast, when the critical matter of gun violence - and how to combat it - was =
missing in action from national election debates. Ms. Clinton has highlight=
ed her disagreement with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over gun policy in the=
ir primary battle. Traditionally, Democrats running for office tread ginger=
ly on the issue so as not to rile the NRA, but Ms. Clinton seems eager to t=
ake on the powerful organization. "Unlike Donald Trump, I will not pander t=
o the gun lobby," she said Saturday, after the NRA had endorsed Mr. Trump.



A Baffling, Hard-line Choice in Israel<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/op=

NEW YORK TIMES // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

Avigdor Lieberman's previous stints as Israel's foreign minister under Prim=
e Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were a disaster for Israeli-American relation=
s. Mr. Lieberman's ultranationalist positions on Palestinians, settlements =
and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict rendered him effectively unwelcome in =
Washington and toxic to Palestinians. Yet to shore up his coalition in the =
Israeli Parliament, Mr. Netanyahu has now offered Mr. Lieberman the office =
of minister of defense - widely considered to be the second most powerful p=
osition in the Israeli government, with a critical role in dealing with the=
 United States and the Palestinians. Mr. Netanyahu may think his political =
needs are more important than relations with the soon-to-end Obama administ=
ration, relations that are already severely strained by the nuclear agreeme=
nt with Iran. But the administration had at least established a working rel=
ationship with Moshe Yaalon, the tough but pragmatic defense minister who r=
esigned once the offer to Mr. Lieberman became known. The timing of this ch=
anging of the guard is particularly sensitive because a critical 10-year de=
fense agreement establishing new levels of American military aid for Israel=
 is in the final stages of negotiations.



Moving On in Vietnam, but Remembering Its Lessons<http://www.nytimes.com/20=

NEW YORK TIMES // JOHN KERRY, JOHN MCCAIN, AND BOB KERREY

As President Obama visits Vietnam, we are struck by the fact that most citi=
zens of both countries have no living memory of a conflict that claimed the=
 lives of more than 58,000 Americans and upward of a million Vietnamese. As=
 Americans who fought in that war, we are frequently asked about its lesson=
s. There are few easy answers, in part because every conflict is unique and=
 because we have learned that attempts to apply past lessons to new crises =
sometimes do more harm than good. But a few things are clear. The first is =
not personal to us, but a principle that applies to all who wear the unifor=
m: We must never again confuse a war with the warriors. American veterans d=
eserve our deepest respect, gratitude and support whenever and wherever the=
y serve. The second lesson is that our leaders need to be honest with Congr=
ess and the American people about our plans, goals and strategy when the li=
ves of our fighting men and women are put at risk. (The mission of the firs=
t American combat troops deployed to Vietnam was described as "flood relief=
.")

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing">U.S. President Barack Obama is set to lay out mor=
e of his plan for a stronger alliance with Vietnam on Tuesday, after scrapp=
ing an arms ban that was the last big hurdle between two countries drawn to=
gether by concern over China's military
 buildup. The removal of a vestige of the Vietnam War suggests U.S. worries=
 about Beijing's reclamation of islands in the South China Sea and deployme=
nt of advanced radars and missile batteries in the disputed region trumped =
concerns about Vietnam's human rights
 record. Washington had for years said a lifting of the ban would require c=
oncrete steps by Vietnam in allowing freedom of speech, worship and assembl=
y and releasing political prisoners. In a joint news conference on Monday w=
ith Vietnamese counterpart Tran
 Dai Quang, Obama said &quot;modest&quot; human rights improvements had bee=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing">Early on Saturday, a middle-aged Pashtun man used=
 forged documents to cross from Iran into Pakistan. A few hours later, on a=
 lonely stretch of highway, he was incinerated by an American drone. It is =
not exactly clear how the Americans
 tracked Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, leader of the Afghan Taliban, to a=
 white sedan rattling across the arid expanse of Baluchistan Province. The =
United States picked up a mix of phone intercepts and tips from sources, Am=
erican and European officials said,
 and there were reports that Pakistan also provided intelligence. President=
 Obama described Mullah Mansour&#8217;s death on Monday as an &#8220;import=
ant milestone&#8221; &#8212; but the strike was also an illustration of the=
 tangled relationship between Washington and Islamabad.
 Not since Mr. Obama ordered Navy SEALs to hunt down Osama bin Laden in May=
 2011 has he authorized a military incursion in Pakistan as audacious as th=
is one. The White House did not inform the Pakistanis in advance of the ope=
ration, which occurred outside the
 frontier region near Afghanistan, the one place where Pakistan has tolerat=
ed American drone strikes in the past. By using the military&#8217;s Joint =
Special Operations Command rather than the C.I.A. to carry out the attack, =
the United States denied Pakistan the
 fig leaf of a covert operation, which in the past has given the Pakistanis=
 the ability to claim they had been consulted beforehand.<o:p></o:p></p>

 over a Zika prevention funding bill and send him public health legislation=
 he is willing to sign. &#8220;They should not be going off on recess befor=

 seem dim. The House has provided only about half as much as the $1.1 billi=

th of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. Breyer suggested in response to q=
uestions at an awards ceremony at
 the Library of Congress that Scalia would have made a difference in only f=
our or five cases out of more than 70 the court will decide this term. &quo=
t;We may divide 4-4 in four or five cases, we may not,&quot; Breyer said of=
 the term than will end in June. That could
 include some of the term's biggest cases involving abortion and immigratio=
n. A tie vote would leave the lower court ruling in place and prevent the c=
ourt from setting a legal precedent that applies to the entire country. The=
 court has already deadlocked in
 three cases, including a high-profile dispute over public-sector labor uni=
ons. And last week, the justices returned a dispute over access to birth co=
ntrol to lower courts, suggesting they could not form a majority that would=
 have settled a major conflict over
 the scope of the nation's health care law. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing">The Democratic Party said on Monday it would give=
 U.S. presidential contender Bernie Sanders a prominent say in writing its =
platform this year, a gesture that could ease tensions between Sanders' cam=
p and party leaders, whom Sanders
 has accused of favoring rival Hillary Clinton. Sanders has remained steadf=

the Nov. 8 presidential election, even though he lags her in the delegate c=
ount with only a few state contests
 remaining. The divisiveness among the Democrats stands in contrast to the =
Republicans, whose party leaders are slowly rallying behind Donald Trump, t=
heir presumptive nominee. Sanders' tenacity appeared to be paying off. The =
U.S. senator from Vermont will be
 allowed to name five members to the 15-member committee that writes the pl=
atform at the Democratic National Convention in late July in Philadelphia e=

 results of state votes to date &quot;in an effort to make this the most re=
presentative and inclusive process in history.&quot; The party's chairwoman=
, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, will name the committee's final four members.<o=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing">When the deadline to register to vote in Californ=

 big winners. The party has enjoyed a dramatic spike in registration since =
the beginning of the year &#8212; and they
 have Donald Trump to thank for it. In the first three months of the year, =
California added 1.5 million new voters through the end of April &#8212; do=

d the total number of registered Democrats
 increased by nearly 100,000 people between the beginning of January and th=

-based voting analytics firm. Paul Mitchell,
 Political Data&#8217;s vice president, notes that Democratic registration =
typically increased when the news cycle revolved around Donald Trump. &#822=
0;What&#8217;s interesting is that the upticks have been greatest among Dem=

 is kind of dominating the conversation,&#8221; said Mitchell, a former Dem=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing">A &#8220;SWAT team&#8221; of eight House GOP lawm=
akers has begun meeting to strike a last-ditch deal on a fiscal 2017 budget=
, Republican Study Committee Chairman Bill Flores (R-Texas) told The Hill o=
n Monday. It&#8217;s just the latest attempt to jump-start
 a budget process that many on Capitol Hill have left for dead. &#8220;Earl=
ier this month, I recommended that Speaker Ryan put together a small team o=
f interested individuals with disparate views to develop a path forward to =
get a budget on the floor,&#8221; Flores said
 during an interview in his Capitol Hill office. &#8220;That team has been =
formed and we are working on that,&#8221; he added. The creation of the SWA=
T team comes amid GOP infighting over a budget resolution that has gone on =
for months.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing">A bill that would make it easier for law enforcem=
ent to get cellphone location data during emergencies was rejected by the H=
ouse of Representatives on Monday, after critics said it could too easily b=
e abused. The Kelsey Smith Act failed
 to get the two-thirds vote required to pass under suspension of the rules,=
 with 229 votes for the bill and 158 votes against. It marked a defeat for =
House leadership, because it is uncommon for bills to fail under suspension=
. The Huffington Post reported that
 the family of Kelsey Smith, who was murdered after being kidnapped almost =
10 years ago, watched from the gallery as the bill failed. The measure woul=
d have made it easier for law enforcement to get location data from cellpho=
nes in emergency situations by requiring
 telecom companies to provider it. Critics said it gave police too much pow=
er &#8212; and urged lawmakers to vote against it even as they said they ag=
reed with the broader purpose of the law.<o:p></o:p></p>

 to electability and to her support from super PACs that can collect unlimi=

 Trump won the Florida primary. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s in for a real bat=

&#8212; which clearly he is &#8212; they don&#8217;t like to be attacked. A=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing">Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump share a defining=
 asset that is fueling support for both in the 2016 presidential race: vote=
rs&#8217; animus toward the other candidate. More than half of registered v=
oters in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News
 poll who said they plan to cast ballots for Mrs. Clinton this fall say the=
ir decision is more about opposing Mr. Trump than supporting the likely Dem=
ocratic nominee. A slightly larger share of Trump backers says the same abo=
ut their vote for the Republican
 candidate. That finding underscores just how discouraged many voters are a=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing">Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is=
 reviving some of the ugliest political chapters of the 1990s with escalati=

 who accused the former president of sexual
 assault, underscoring the presumptive Republican nominee&#8217;s willingne=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing">Donald J. Trump met privately on Monday with Wood=
y Johnson, the New York Jets owner and a top Republican fund-raiser, as the=
 presumptive nominee looks to secure the support of some of the party&#8217=
;s largest financial backers in order to
 raise hundreds of millions of dollars for his general election effort. Mr.=
 Trump confirmed the meeting in a brief interview with The Times. &#8220;Wo=
ody&#8217;s a great guy,&#8221; Mr. Trump said. &#8220;Woody will support m=
e. He&#8217;s a terrific guy, he&#8217;s been a friend of mine a long
 time.&#8221; Mr. Johnson supported Jeb Bush during the Republican primary,=
 a decision he made early in 2015, at a time when many people were still un=
certain whether Mr. Trump was mounting a serious campaign. An aide to Mr. J=
ohnson declined to comment on the meeting.
 The move came as Mr. Trump begins to build a fund-raising operation in ord=
er to raise roughly $1 billion through a joint fund-raising agreement among=
 his campaign, the Republican National Committee and 11 state parties.<o:p>=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing">Donald Trump appeared Friday before the National =
Rifle Association and promised to roll back gun restrictions if elected pre=
sident. The next day, Hillary Clinton stood before a group of mothers who h=
ave lost children or other relatives
 to gun violence and vowed to fight for stricter gun control. The back-to-b=
ack speeches by the presumptive Republican nominee and his likely Democrati=
c opponent signal the prominent role that gun issues may play in the presid=
ential election. That would be a
 welcome contrast to the recent past, when the critical matter of gun viole=
nce &#8212; and how to combat it &#8212; was missing in action from nationa=
l election debates. Ms. Clinton has highlighted her disagreement with Sen. =
Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over gun policy in their
 primary battle. Traditionally, Democrats running for office tread gingerly=
 on the issue so as not to rile the NRA, but Ms. Clinton seems eager to tak=
e on the powerful organization. &#8220;Unlike Donald Trump, I will not pand=
er to the gun lobby,&#8221; she said Saturday,
 after the NRA had endorsed Mr. Trump.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing">Avigdor Lieberman&#8217;s previous stints as Isra=
el&#8217;s foreign minister under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were a =
disaster for Israeli-American relations. Mr. Lieberman&#8217;s ultranationa=
list positions on Palestinians, settlements and the
 Israeli-Palestinian conflict rendered him effectively unwelcome in Washing=
ton and toxic to Palestinians. Yet to shore up his coalition in the Israeli=
 Parliament, Mr. Netanyahu has now offered Mr. Lieberman the office of mini=
ster of defense &#8212; widely considered
 to be the second most powerful position in the Israeli government, with a =
critical role in dealing with the United States and the Palestinians. Mr. N=
etanyahu may think his political needs are more important than relations wi=
th the soon-to-end Obama administration,
 relations that are already severely strained by the nuclear agreement with=
 Iran. But the administration had at least established a working relationsh=
ip with Moshe Yaalon, the tough but pragmatic defense minister who resigned=
 once the offer to Mr. Lieberman
 became known. The timing of this changing of the guard is particularly sen=
sitive because a critical 10-year defense agreement establishing new levels=
 of American military aid for Israel is in the final stages of negotiations=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing">As President Obama visits Vietnam, we are struck =
by the fact that most citizens of both countries have no living memory of a=
 conflict that claimed the lives of more than 58,000 Americans and upward o=
f a million Vietnamese. As Americans
 who fought in that war, we are frequently asked about its lessons. There a=
re few easy answers, in part because every conflict is unique and because w=
e have learned that attempts to apply past lessons to new crises sometimes =
do more harm than good. But a few
 things are clear. The first is not personal to us, but a principle that ap=
plies to all who wear the uniform: We must never again confuse a war with t=
he warriors. American veterans deserve our deepest respect, gratitude and s=
upport whenever and wherever they
 serve. The second lesson is that our leaders need to be honest with Congre=
ss and the American people about our plans, goals and strategy when the liv=
es of our fighting men and women are put at risk. (The mission of the first=
 American combat troops deployed
 to Vietnam was described as &#8220;flood relief.&#8221;)<o:p></o:p></p>
