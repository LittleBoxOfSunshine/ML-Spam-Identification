Labor and Business Leaders Call on Republican Lawmakers to Fund Much-Needed=
 Infrastructure Improvements

[City]- Underfunding of public roads and bridges in the United States have =
put residents in danger of transit accidents on a daily basis. Yet Republic=
an lawmakers like [INSERT GOP MEMBERS OF CONGRESS] repeatedly refuse to inv=
est in our nation=92s infrastructure. Labor and business leaders gathered t=
oday to call for funding to address this serious matter in honor of Nationa=
l Infrastructure Week.

=93As a business owner, I find it unconscionable that our congressman has f=
ailed to make sure our roads and bridges are safe,=94 said XXXX. =93It=92s =
not a partisan issue to properly fund our transportation network, but he is=
 making it one and putting his constituents in danger in the process.=94

If Hitting House Member:
In 2012, XXXX supported a transportation bill that was strongly opposed by =
safety and environmental advocates. It would have covered only five percent=
 of the funds needed to pay for the entirety of national mass transit repai=
rs.

If Hitting Senator:
XXXX has repeated blocked bills to fund national infrastructure repairs. In=
 2011, XXXX blocked President Obama=92s plan to allocate $60 billion in for=
 much-needed highway, rail, transit and airport repairs and construction. A=
nd in 2015, XXXX helped defeat an amendment that would have allocated $478 =
billion in infrastructure investment while remaining deficit-neutral.

=93If the roof of your house is leaking, you try to fix it immediately inst=
ead of waiting for the whole thing to cave in,=94 said XXXX. =93[SENATOR or=
 MEMBER]=92s actions simply don=92t make sense. He is putting our lives at =
risk for refusing to act.=94

Letter 1

Editor

Under President Obama, we=92ve seen 14 million new jobs created. But we can=
 do even more if Republicans in Congress would agree to invest more in infr=
astructure projects =96 not only repairing our crumbling roads and bridges,=
 but also wiring rural America and installing green energy infrastructure. =
These investments are what=92s needed to create even more jobs while making=
 our nation stronger.

Infrastructure shouldn=92t fall victim to partisan political games. Investi=
ng in roads, bridges, railroads, and airports is fundamental to our economy=
. Expanding broadband internet access and installing wind and solar panels =
in communities across the country will build a stronger future and create m=
illions of jobs. Investments in wiring rural America, in particular, would =
pay off in spades by allowing rural families to grow their businesses onlin=
e, tapping into e-commerce in order to provide for their families.

Simply put, investing in infrastructure helps lift up hardworking families.=
 When Republicans block infrastructure spending, they kill jobs, make our r=
oads and bridges less safe, and block hardworking Americans from gaining in=
ternet access. We need to focus on efforts to grow America=97not limit our =
progress because of political strife.

Sincerely,
Rachel Palermo

Letter 2

Editor:


The backbone of our country is our infrastructure. As our transportation ne=
tworks crumble, public life suffers. Looking towards the future, I am conce=
rned that our country is falling behind.



All investments in our infrastructure double as an investment for our count=
ry=92s residents. Transportation is a vital engine of our economy, ensuring=
 people can get to their jobs and that goods can get from businesses to cus=
tomers. While we allow our bridges and roads to fall into disrepair, we are=
 failing to meet the needs of our growing population and economy.



Recent opportunities to improve our nation's infrastructure have been thwar=
ted by the political games of the Republican Party in Washington. On the ot=
her side of the aisle, Democrats are invested in creating jobs at home by e=
nsuring our transportation network is safe and efficient, and by going a st=
ep further. Democratic efforts to invest in projects such as high-speed rai=
l, renewable energy, and broadband internet would create millions of jobs w=
hile ensuring that our nation stays on the cutting-edge.

Previous generations recognized the necessity of infrastructure innovations=
 and now is our opportunity to pay the same progress forward. Let=92s put o=
ur family members, friends and neighbors to work and build the transportati=
on network of tomorrow.

Sincerely,
Jenna Price

Editor:

As National Infrastructure Week kicks off, I am calling on Republican polit=
icians including our representative, XXX, to stop blocking investments that=
 would repair our crumbling infrastructure and create jobs. Our nations=92 =
aging highways, bridges, and water systems are in urgent need of repair, bu=
t the Republicans continue to oppose the necessary investments which make o=
ur transportation system safer, create jobs, and alleviate congestion in an=
d around our major cities.

The water crisis in Flint, Michigan is the most overt example of the GOP=92=
s willingness to cut costs without any regard for the impact their ill-conc=
eived decisions may have on a community. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder appo=
inted the emergency mangers who decided to draw water from the polluted Fli=
nt River, and then Congressional Republicans doubled down on their failure =
by refusing to approve the funding needed to replace Flint=92s corroded pip=
es.

Ignoring a problem won=92t solve it. The AFL-CIO, the Chamber of Commerce a=
nd other groups recognize the need to repair, improve, and expand America=
=92s crumbling infrastructure. It=92s time for the GOP to do the same.

Sincerely,
Deshundra Jefferson

Editor:

National Infrastructure Week isn=92t the sexiest of causes to celebrate =96=
 that much I know. But what I also know is this: infrastructure is fundamen=
tal to our economy and our daily lives. Think about it: every day we use br=
idges, roads, and airports to get around; every day we use the internet to =
connect with the world; and every day we use products that were created in =
factories and arrived safely to the stores we bought them in.

However, our nation=92s infrastructure is crumbling. We need to make invest=
ments quickly or risk paying the consequences. Both Democratic candidates f=
or president have detailed plans for investing in infrastructure that would=
 create millions of jobs and give Americans the 21st century transportation=
 network they deserve.

Republicans have had their way obstructing new investments in infrastructur=
e for years. We need to elect leaders up and down the ballot who understand=
 our prosperity can only grow when we have the infrastructure to support it=
.

The presumptive GOP nominee, Donald Trump? He hasn=92t a clue. In fact, as =
it relates to infrastructure, the only concrete thing<http://www.nytimes.co=
m/2015/06/17/us/politics/donald-trump-runs-for-president-this-time-for-real=
-he-says.html> we=92ve heard he=92ll do is build a =93great wall=94 to keep=
 out rapists and other criminals who are apparently making their way over i=
n droves. Seriously. As Trump even declared at a campaign rally in Tampa, F=
lorida, =93You watch, and that wall will go up like magic.=94

Our country doesn=92t need a wall. What we need are bridges, and we need th=
em now more than ever.  [We need to take out reference to the wall. Please =
tweak.]

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">As National Infrastructure Week kicks off, I am call=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The water crisis in Flint, Michigan is the most over=

it: every day we use bridges, roads, and
 airports to get around; every day we use the internet to connect with the =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">However, our nation=92s infrastructure is crumbling.=
