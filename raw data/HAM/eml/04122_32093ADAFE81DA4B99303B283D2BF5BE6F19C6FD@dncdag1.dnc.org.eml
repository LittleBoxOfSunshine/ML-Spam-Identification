, @cmarinucci) and Andrew Weber (aweber@politico.com<mailto:aweber@politico=
.com>)

Buenos dias and good Wednesday morning, Golden State!

THE BUZZ: Republican Donald Trump's landslide five-state sweep -- cracking =
the 60 percent mark? -- and Hillary Clinton's key pickup of delegate-rich P=
ennsylvania, along with Connecticut, Maryland and Delaware in Tuesday's pri=
maries change the calculations and strategy heading toward California's Jun=
e 7 primary.

-- THE SILICON VALLEY ANGLE: Trump's dominant performance means the pressur=
e is ramping up on Google, one of Silicon Valley's biggest players, to be a=
 disrupter in the 2016 presidential race and to withhold potentially lucrat=
ive sponsorships for Republican National Convention events, now that he's c=
alling himself "the presumptive nominee."

-- WHAT'S AHEAD -- A coalition of local activist groups in the San Francisc=
o Bay Area promises Thursday to deliver upwards of 400,000 signatures to Mt=
. View-based Google, urging the tech firm to take no part in a convention c=
oronation of Trump. The protesters include activists from California groups=
 which have taken center stage in a number of high profile protests -- CRED=
O, ColorOfChange, UltraViolet, vsGoliath, Free Press Action Fund, Daily Kos=
, Center for Media Justice and the Courage Campaign.

-- Along with Thursday's petitions, a plane will fly over Google headquarte=
rs -- and later over the San Francisco Bay and Golden Gate Bridge -- with a=
 banner that reads "Google: Don't be evil. #DumpTrump." Google won't be the=
 only corporate target: the groups will expand their appeals to leading fir=
ms like Microsoft, Coca-Cola and Walmart "not to provide a platform for Don=
ald Trump's hateful rhetoric."

-- BOTTOM LINE : Reports already suggest leading tech firms like Facebook, =
Google and Apple, which have had big roles at political events ranging from=
 debates to convention parties, are rightly nervous about being associated,=
 even indirectly, with Trump's controversial statements and campaign. But t=
here's marketing, audience, and revenue to consider. Google this: "dilemma.=
"

** A message from Chevron: Data comes in all shapes and sizes: emails, text=
s, even selfies. And each day more energy is used to move the world's data =
than to fly all its planes. Chevron helps make sure we have the energy to k=
eep sharing and flying. http://tinyurl.com/zmlgsvl<http://go.politicoemail.=

<p><b>Buenos dias and good Wednesday morning, Golden State! </b><o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p><b>THE BUZZ: </b>Republican Donald Trump's landslide five-state sweep --=
 cracking the 60 percent mark? -- and Hillary Clinton's key pickup of deleg=
ate-rich Pennsylvania, along with Connecticut, Maryland and Delaware in Tue=
sday's primaries change the calculations
 and strategy heading toward California's June 7 primary. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p><b>-- THE SILICON VALLEY ANGLE: </b>Trump's dominant performance means t=
he pressure is ramping up on Google, one of Silicon Valley's biggest player=
s, to be a disrupter in the 2016 presidential race and to withhold potentia=
lly lucrative sponsorships for Republican
 National Convention events, now that he's calling himself &quot;the presum=
ptive nominee.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><b>-- WHAT'S AHEAD -- A coalition of local activist groups in the San Fr=
ancisco Bay Area promises Thursday</b> to deliver upwards of 400,000 signat=
ures to Mt. View-based Google, urging the tech firm to take no part in a co=
nvention coronation of Trump. The
 protesters include activists from California groups which have taken cente=
r stage in a number of high profile protests -- CREDO, ColorOfChange, Ultra=
Violet, vsGoliath, Free Press Action Fund, Daily Kos, Center for Media Just=
ice and the Courage Campaign.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><b>-- Along with Thursday's petitions, </b>a plane will fly over Google =
headquarters -- and later over the San Francisco Bay and Golden Gate Bridge=
 -- with a banner that reads &quot;Google: Don't be evil. #DumpTrump.&quot;=
 Google won't be the only corporate target:
 the groups will expand their appeals to leading firms like Microsoft, Coca=
-Cola and Walmart &quot;not to provide a platform for Donald Trump's hatefu=
l rhetoric.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><b>-- BOTTOM LINE </b>: Reports already suggest leading tech firms like =
Facebook, Google and Apple, which have had big roles at political events ra=
nging from debates to convention parties, are rightly nervous about being a=
ssociated, even indirectly, with
 Trump's controversial statements and campaign. But there's marketing, audi=
ence, and revenue to consider. Google this: &quot;dilemma.&quot;<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p><b>** A message from Chevron:</b> Data comes in all shapes and sizes: em=
ails, texts, even selfies. And each day more energy is used to move the wor=
ld's data than to fly all its planes. Chevron helps make sure we have the e=
nergy to keep sharing and flying.
