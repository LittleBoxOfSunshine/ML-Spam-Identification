The Republican Party=92s Worst Week in Washington

This is the week that the Republican Party's worst nightmare came true: Don=
ald Trump emerged as the presumptive presidential nominee after crushing th=
e competition in Indiana's GOP primary.

The party didn't handle it so well.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan kicked it all off, telling CNN's Jake Tapper tha=
t he simply can't support Trump yet<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics=
/ryan-says-he-is-not-ready-to-back-trump-deepening-gop-divide/2016/05/05/fa=
b4c590-12ff-11e6-81b4-581a5c4c42df_story.html?hpid=3Dhp_rhp-top-table-main_=
trumpryan-810pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&tid=3Da_inl>. "I=92m just not ready to d=
o that at this point," Ryan said. "I=92m not there right now. And I hope to=
, though, and I want to."

The hits just kept coming.

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham, a one-time presidential candidate, quickly made cle=
ar that his criticism of Trump wouldn't end now that the real estate mogul =
was the party's only remaining choice. "I also cannot in good conscience su=
pport Donald Trump because I do not believe he is a reliable Republican con=
servative," Graham said as a part of an extended tweetstorm<https://twitter=
.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/728638472957755392?ref_src=3Dtwsrc%5Etfw> expla=
ining why he wouldn't be voting for his party's nominee or attending the na=
tional convention in July.

5-Minute Fix newsletter

Keeping up with politics is easy now.

Graham's announcement was quickly followed by a similar one from Jeb Bush. =
In a Facebook post<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/0=
7/the-10-republicans-who-hate-donald-trump-the-most-ranked/>, Bush lambaste=
d Trump as someone " who has not demonstrated that temperament or strength =
of character. He has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he =
is not a consistent conservative. These are all reasons why I cannot suppor=
t his candidacy."

Trump was positively Trumpian in his response to all of the mishigas he has=
 created within the party he will represent this fall. A Trump spokeswoman =
suggested that it might be time for someone other than Ryan to be speaker<h=
ttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/05/06/katrina_pierson_paul_ryan_=
should_not_be_speaker_if_he_wont_support_trump.html>. And Trump unleashed t=
his doozy on Graham<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-t=
rump-response-to-lindsey-graham>: "Every time I see Lindsey Graham spew hat=
e during interviews, I ask why the media never questions how I single-hande=
dly destroyed his hapless run for president."

What's next is anybody's guess. The party appears to be teetering on the ed=
ge of a full-blown split between those who believe that now that the voters=
 have spoken it's time to get behind Trump and those who view backing the b=
illionaire as an abandonment of the true principles of conservatism.

And there's no one able stop it. Republican National Committee Chairman Rei=
nce Priebus has the most difficult job in America. Trump lacks the unity ge=
ne. Lots of other eminences grises within the party -- the Bushes, Bob Dole=
, and so on and so forth -- are on opposite sides of the divide and seem to=
 have no interest in serving as a bridge.

That means it's likely that the schism will get worse before it gets better=
. If it gets better. A party being torn in two is bad enough. That process =
happening within 184 days until a presidential election and in full view of=
 the general public is even worse. And this might not even be the bottom ye=
t.
