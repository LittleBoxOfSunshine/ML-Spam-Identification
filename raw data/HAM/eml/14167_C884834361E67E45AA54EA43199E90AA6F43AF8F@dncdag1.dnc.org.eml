Eric Trump: "I think it's actually nice to see somebody that is intimately involved. It's the difference between someone who's very macro and micro, and someone who is a doer versus a dictator and someone who's a delegator, I think that's refreshing, I want to see the person in the white house ultimately. I want to see the person take action as opposed to subbing it out to a million different people. That's the father I know, and the man that's become an enormous success."
