Subject: Travel Pool Report #5 - Potus remarks after briefing

The motorcade is rolling to the next stop at 2:22 pm

POTUS spoke for about 16 minutes after the pool was let in to the briefin=
g room at the food bank. Please check quotes against transcript that the =
WH will put out eventually.

POTUS started by thanking the federal officials, along with Gov. Snyder a=
nd Mayor Weaver, for the job they have done responding to the crisis. He =
called it a "whole of government effort" to make sure that people are hea=
lthy and to plan for how to fix the city's pipes over the long term.

POTUS urged families to make sure they take the time to have their childr=
en checked out by a doctor for lead exposure, and he said that Medicaid e=
xpansion in the city will help to provide extra medical resources.

"I want everybody in the city of Flint to know that you should have your =
child checked," POTUS said.

POTUS also acknowledged that there is "a lot of suspicion" about whether =
the water is safe to drink. He emphasized that the EPA has concluded that=
 the water is safe for everyone except kids under six and pregnant women =
as long as a water filter has been used.

"Filtered water is safe, and it works," he said. "Working with the state =
and the city, filters are now available for everyone in the city."

(At the very end of the briefing, POTUS was asked whether a glass of wate=
r sitting in front of him was from Flint. He said it was, and picked up t=
he glass of water. "Generally I haven't been doing stunts but here you go=
," he said as he took a small sip of the water. He said it "just confirms=
 what we know scientifically" -- that using a filter makes the water drin=
kable.)

POTUS said the use of filters doenst take away from the need to repair or=
 replace a number of pipes in the city, and he said that will be a long p=
rocess.

"It might take a year.  It might take two years. It might take more," POT=
US said.

POTUS also urged residents of Flint to help clean out the system by turni=
ng on their water for five minutes each day, something that the city has =
termed "Flush for Flint."

"It's not the most elegant name," POTUS said. "We need everybody to turn =
on their tap in the kitchen, the tub, for 5 minutes each day."

POTUS also said that the city of Flint had suffered from neglect long bef=
ore the current crisis and he said he hoped that the focus on the city no=
w could eventually make it even better than it was before.

"We have to take what has been a crisis and turn this into an opportunity=
 to rebuild Flint even better than before," POTUS said.

"I'm confident that we can do that if we are working together," he said. =
He said his visit to Flint was not for the purpose of sorting "through al=
l the ins and outs of how we got to where we are. There are times for pol=
itics and there are times for turf battles. This is not one of those time=
s."

POTUS also said that "kids are resilient" and that "every kid in Flint is=
 special and has capacity and can do great things." He urged parents not =
to give up on their kids and noted that lots of people in previous genera=
tions, including himself, may have been impacted by lead in lead paint be=
fore people knew it was a problem.

"The bottom line is we now know what to do. Parents and communities have =
to be proactive," he said.
