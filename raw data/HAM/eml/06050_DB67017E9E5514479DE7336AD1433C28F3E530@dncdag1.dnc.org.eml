Talks about Trump transition team in 3rd paragraph

Chris Christie On His Role As Transition Chairman For Donald Trump: "But As Some Of You May Know About Presidential Transitions, The Chairman's Running The Show And I Will Do That And I Will Make The Major Decisions That Need To Be Made, Of Course In Consultation With The Candidate." CHRISTIE: "I'm honored to be asked by Donald to have the responsibility of putting together a plan that will carry his first 200 days in office and a plan that will help him to populate the 4,000 federal jobs he'll need to fill in a relatively short order if he were to become president. That's not something, none of that stuff can be done in 75 days between the election and the inaugural. And so we're going to begin work earnestly now that the announcement's been made and I've been asked. Listen, in terms of time, the fact is that in the beginning, there will be some decent time for me to put a good team together. But as some of you may know about presidential transitions, the chairman's running the show and I will do that and I will make the major decisions that need to be made, of course in consultation with the candidate."

Chris Christie On Traveling Out-Of-State While Serving As Donald Trump's Transition Chairman: "I've Always Been Able To Manage My Time Pretty Well And I Don't Think It Will Take Me Out Of State Much At All. Maybe To Washington D.C. Every Once In A While." "But in the end, a lot of the work will be done by men and women who will volunteer their time as traditionally has happened across the country to bring their expertise to bear on all the different issues that a new president would have to confront. So I can't give you an exact amount of time, Michael, but I've always been able to manage my time pretty well and I don't think it will take me out of state much at all. Maybe to Washington D.C. every once in a while." [NJTV, 5/11/16<http://www.njtvonline.org/news/video/christie-announces-business-tax-break-talks-ac-trump-transition-team/>]

Christie: Today I'm pleased to announce that the growing health and solvency of our trust fund, which now has a positive balance of $1.8 billion will allow for yet another tax cut to be realized by our employers. We had announced just a few weeks ago a $200 million tax cut effective July 1. We're now announcing that we will increase that tax cut on July 1 by another $180 million making for a total tax cut of $380 million for our employers as of July 1.

Christie: I want to save Atlantic City. So does the Senate president. I would hope that the speaker would too. But if he's going to force Atlantic City to bankruptcy, that's going to be his call. I've done my job. I've said what I'd sign. And, by the way, when Sen. Sweeney and Assemblyman [Lou] Greenwald came out with a compromise, I said I'd be willing to look at it. But that wasn't good enough either. The only person who's not come to the table with anything, the reason he doesn't have a seat at the table? You got to bring something to the table. What's he brought, except defiance? So, I want to save Atlantic City, the Senate president wants to save Atlantic City and I think a majority of the state Legislature wants to. But speaker is bringing nothing to the table. Once again today he comes with nothing. Promised a vote today. He was going to get this thing passed. He didn't, again. So what's next now, Mr. Speaker? He can send out as many press releases as he wants blaming me but if I don't have anything on my desk to sign, and he can't point me to the inherent authority he says I have, well what am I supposed to do?

Christie: I'm honored to be asked by Donald to have the responsibility of putting together a plan that will carry his first 200 days in office and a plan that will help him to populate the 4,000 federal jobs he'll need to fill in a relatively short order if he were to become president. That's not something, none of that stuff can be done in 75 days between the election and the inaugural. And so we're going to begin work earnestly now that the announcement's been made and I've been asked. Listen, in terms of time, the fact is that in the beginning, there will be some decent time for me to put a good team together. But as some of you may know about presidential transitions, the chairman's running the show and I will do that and I will make the major decisions that need to be made, of course in consultation with the candidate.

Maybe to Washington D.C. every once in a while.

Aron: And Christie was asked whether becoming transition chair lessens his chances of being Trump's running mate. He said that's up to Donald, but he sounded like he wouldn't mind. I'm Michael Aron. Mary Alice, back to you.
