This is inefficient. It's a waste of time. We need her available windows, a=
nd based on that we can look at what shows we can work on. If there's a spe=
cific request we'll send that. But let's not work backwards, we can pick ju=
st about anything to pitch, it's better if we know what windows we're worki=
ng with.

I believe there are primaries on Tuesday, so for starters we should see abo=
ut morning tv on Tuesday and afternoon/evening as exit polls and results ro=
ll in.

Wednesday similarly.

But we need windows to narrow done our search.
