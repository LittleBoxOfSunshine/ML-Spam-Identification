By Natasha Korecki (nkorecki@politico.com; @natashakorecki) with Manuela Tobias (mtobias@politico.com; @manuelatobiasm)  

Good Tuesday morning, Illinois. Today, a coalition of aldermen and airport workers hold a news briefing to talk about a proposal for a Chicago independent Airport Authority, a position that seemed to throttle City Hall on Monday. 

The initiative, driven by the Service Employees International Union, calls for an independent board to oversee and manage operations and contracts at O'Hare and Midway airports. If somehow successful, it would be a massive power shift from City Hall and into the hands of aldermen and the powerful union. 

-- City Council sponsor Ald. Scott Waguespack told POLITICO on Monday that the proposal outlines are still being discussed and could include a look at a combination elected and appointed positions. 

"The City sees a new effort to create an independent airport authority as "backwards in its approach," hailing successes at the airports they say came without the help of an "untested political process." 

The response comes in the wake of a union-led effort to wrest control of airport operations and billions of dollars in contracts away from Mayor Rahm Emanuel and put it in the hands of an independent board. On Tuesday, a coalition of airport workers, aldermen and the Service Employees International Union Local 1 will hold a news conference laying out its approach, which they hope will mean an advisory referendum on the November ballot." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e0987652a0c94060db9dd7ca548c72affdd58cdb50b14539b5e 

WHO: Those to appear at today's news conference: SEIU Local 1, O'Hare Airport workers, Progressive Reform Caucus Chair Scott Waguespack (32), Chicago Black Caucus Chair Roderick T. Sawyer (6), Alderman Nick Sposato (38), Alderman Leslie Hairston (5), Alderman Sue Sadlowski Garza (10), Alderman Toni Foulkes (16), Alderman Carlos Rosa (35) and Citizen Action Illinois. 

EMANUEL FOES UNITE -- "A move to take over control of O'Hare and Midway emerges," by Crain's Greg Hinz: "In the newest and potentially biggest challenge to Mayor Rahm Emanuel's weakened authority, a big union and reportedly several key aldermen are moving to hand control over the O'Hare and Midway International Airports to an elected, independent airport authority. The move at this point is taking the form of an advisory referendum, and city officials are checking to determine whether such a takeover would be legal. But the proposal could unite a variety of Emanuel foes-including unions, leaders of various City Council factions and critics of O'Hare's expansion and noise-all under the
 rubric of bringing reform to what long has been a seat of mayoral patronage and contract control." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09103ee23b49981ac25f1c5adb46e0731845790320d0dd5bce 


** A message from VoteVets Action Fund: Strong prevailing wage laws improve the lives of veterans, who work in construction at much higher rates than non-veterans.

WHAT IS UP WITH TSA? -- "O'Hare Airport Was A Living Nightmare Last Weekend," by Chicagoist's Rachel Cromidas: "Treacherous security lines turned O'Hare International Airport into a waking nightmare of missed flights, delays and stranded travelers Sunday night. There's a TSA staffing shortage contributing to long security lines and delays around the country right now. In Chicago, many passengers had to wait two or more hours to get through airport security Sunday, causing 450 people to miss their American Airlines flights ... those passengers ended up sleeping in the airline's terminal on cots in hopes of flying out Monday morning. Many travelers leaving or passing through Chicago took to
 social media to express their frustrations." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09f83db28197f3fcd2601bb10a0b55f2174960fbb392920f0c 

MIDWAY WAS ITS OWN SPECIAL NIGHTMARE -- The unreal Midway security line that went viral: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e097efe92d9f426fb0511024154bbb3637d99ce401fde40f963  

TSA ACROSS THE USA -- "And it's not just Chicago. American Airlines says the TSA's problems have caused tens of thousands of customers to miss their flights, so far this year. O'Hare tops American's list of most affected airports followed by airports in Dallas/Fort Worth, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Miami." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09dc0ef4332934c04f254e1ab02b8f216a42860b87728682b8

RAUNER NUMBERS 'UPSIDE DOWN' -- Public Policy Polling was in the field for SEIU Health Care, looking specifically at five legislative districts where Republicans are incumbents. The surveys looked at Gov. Bruce Rauner's approval numbers and asked about wages, policy issues and funding for child care. Remember SEIU Health Care is still in contract negotiations with the governor. 

An accompanying memo reads: "Rauner's approval numbers were upside down. Fifty-one percent of voters in the 99th District, where the State Capitol is located, said Rauner was doing a bad job, compared to 32% who said good. He notched similarly dismal numbers in two downstate districts and one Chicago area district. In a northern suburban district voters offered a split verdict, 40% good versus 37% bad, but expressed serious reservations about positions taken by the legislators. 

"It's not only the governor's unpopularity that should be a cause of worry, but the lack of support for a number of his policies. In all of the districts, a majority of voters said they would be less likely to vote for a legislator who "opposed small wage increases for working poor Illinoisans who care for children, the elderly and persons with disabilities." The question pertains to a stalled contract negotiation between the Rauner administration and SEIU Healthcare, the organization that represents those workers. Voters also did not look favorably on representatives who have stood behind the Rauner's administrations cuts to childcare programs for lower-income working families, with a
 majority or near-majority in all districts saying it would make them less likely to vote for the member." 

Here's how the numbers break down: 

20th District

EDGAR FOR KIRK -- Former Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar was in the Chicago area on Monday as part of U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk's campaign briefing for top donors. The briefing was hosted by Michael Morgan, former Illinois finance chair for Scott Walker and Kirk's 2010 finance chair. Edgar remains a trusted and popular voice in the state's GOP establishment, which could be helpful in countering Trump-related attacks on Kirk who is running for reelection. 

CAMPAIGN ADS -- Kirk's campaign this weekend launched ads targeting U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and a civil case involving accusations of employee retaliation while Duckworth headed the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. Duckworth's case will go to trial in the fall. Duckworth's campaign called the new Kirk ad attacking Duckworth "dishonest" and "shameful." Here's Duckworth's response ad: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09925afb9f7649130e114f3a550468b23a1fedd90281875136 

CAMPAIGN COFFERS -- But should they be? "Nonprofits Donate To Illinois Politicians Despite Federal Ban," Better Government Association http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09f6c1f3f721208363087aa4880bc9c54fdf823c53a2d81d35 

THE COMPLEX CASE OF A MISSING, THEN FOUND SINEAD O'CONNOR -- "Singer Sinead O'Connor found safe, according to Wilmette police," by Chicago Tribune: "Wilmette police said Monday afternoon that Sinead O'Connor has been found and is safe. A press release issued at 1:45 p.m. said the Irish singer had been located, but offered no further details about where she was found or where she had been in the more than 24 hours since she went missing. Deputy Chief Kyle Perkins said later in the afternoon that police would not hold a press conference, and no further information about the incident would be released. O'Connor reportedly left the area for a bicycle ride at 6 a.m. Sunday and had not returned
 as of Monday morning, according to an earlier police statement." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e098572eadad04e744839a039bcd1b858dcd812c8bbfcffb81a 

TOUGH TO IGNORE -- "Gannett Raises Bid for Tribune Publishing," by Wall Street Journal's Joshua Jamerson: "Gannett Co. said Monday that it raised its all-cash offer for Tribune Publishing Co. to about $475 million, just two weeks after Tribune's board rejected a lower bid. Gannett raised its offer to $15 a share, a proposal valued at about $475 million when excluding about $385 million of outstanding debt. The revised offer represents a 22% increase over its prior bid and a nearly 100% premium over Tribune Publishing's share price of $7.52 on April 22, the last trading day before Gannett made public its initial offer of $12.25 a share April 25. Gannett's first proposal was valued at about
 $400 million plus the assumption of debt." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09e5ef4e5494a96574ddcbc1bad923cd46f495b7b08304d6c3 

NOT GOING AWAY -- "Gannett gears up for a long battle over control of Tribune Publishing," by Ken Doctor, for POLITICO: "Both Gannett and Tribune Publishing are settling in for a protracted battle, as Gannett marches forward in an increasingly hostile takeover attempt of Tribune. On one side of the front: Gannett's deep wallet - able to afford more than the 63 percent initial premium it initially offered. On the other side, Tribune chairman Michael Ferro has a line drawn around the company's prime properties in Chicago and L.A., claiming defensibility and great riches ahead. It's trench warfare that could well last months - and may run into mid-2017, sources now tell me." 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09073ad5c3c96b6230289f87592d1c418e6b82ea47701c8e51 

"Women Look To Make History In 2016 Senate Races," by NPR's Jessica Taylor: "If Democrats take back the Senate in 2016, they'll likely have women to thank for it. The party is likely to have at least six female nominees who are challenging Republican incumbents in their top-targeted states, helping them flip the four seats necessary to take back Senate control, if Democrats hold the White House. And Democrats believe they have the perfect storm brewing to help them do that - likely the first female presidential nominee coupled with a probable GOP nominee who has a well-documented history of controversial remarks about women." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09284787d8f420ec78b5687c4a87e8add25db48d92706b240c 

"Advocate to operate Chicago-area Walgreens health clinics," by The Associated Press: "The largest health system in Illinois is preparing to take over operations of more than 50 neighborhood health clinics inside Walgreens stores across the Chicago area. Advocate Health Care and Walgreens announced the ownership change in January. A series of kickoff events to mark the new Advocate Clinics at Walgreens are planned for Wednesday. The 56 clinics cover eight counties: Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e099f51b898d99b1cad73a54edd19250b61541d23dafa3808b1 

"Don't Blame the Video," by The New York Times' editorial board: "Videos of police officers battering or even killing unarmed black civilians have given the wider society a view of the world in which African-Americans have lived for a long time. President Obama has referred to this history on several occasions, noting that video from cellphones and body cameras have shown the country that black Americans were not imagining the problem of police brutality or 'making this up.' But the link between these videos and the racial history of United States seems to have eluded James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who appears to be fixated on the discredited idea that
 videos represent a problem in themselves - and that the police are less willing to do their jobs because of them." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e0959f050819186ff24f4b2aac4cc710c7b91b4c6f7c5ea1890 

DOWN BY THE RIVER -- "Chicago Riverwalk 2016 Vendor Lineup Announced," by DNAinfo's Lisa White: "Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced Saturday the lineup of vendors for the 2016 Riverwalk season, with a few new additions as well as returning favorites from the inaugural year of the popular Downtown outdoor space. New vendors this year include Tiny Hatt, Lilllies and Dulce in Horto, which will be the Riverwalk's first mobile food cart. Tiny Hatt, located at 55 W. Riverwalk South on the Dearborn Street side, will offer up signature barrel-aged cocktails and a food menu focused on BBQ. Lillies, located at 71 W. Riverwalk South on the Clark Street side, will feature grab and go options. Dulce in
 Horto's mobile food cart will offer an array of sweet treats including cupcakes, brownies and cookies throughout the Riverwalk area." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09e16383de327dc07a117e2e8d5445f347069d38c54562cf0f 

CELEB CHEF PLEADS GUILTY -- "Restaurateur pleads guilty to fraud, money laundering charges," by Chicago Sun-Times' Jon Seidel: "Chinatown restaurateur Tony Hu, accused of wire fraud and money laundering, pleaded guilty Monday in U.S. District Court. He is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 22 before Judge Amy St. Eve. Hu faces up to 30 years, but is more likely to serve 41 to 51 months in prison, under the terms of his 23-page plea agreement. The feds charged the local celebrity chef on Friday, accusing him of underreporting restaurant receipts paid in cash. Hu is expected to pay more than $1 million in restitution to the Illinois Department of Revenue."

YOU WON'T RECOGNIZE ALINEA - Probably because you couldn't afford to dine there in the first place. "Alinea reopens this week after five-month remodel," by Chicago Tribune's Phil Vettel: "Sometime this week, Chicago's most acclaimed restaurant will open its doors after a five-month hiatus, during which time the restaurant was stripped to its bones and rebuilt. A gut job, as they say in the biz. If you've been to Alinea once before, you won't recognize the place. Even if you've been to Alinea a dozen times or more, you'll be lucky to find the bathroom in the new layout. Gone is the long entrance hall, the one that narrowed as you went along; gone is the whooshing, hidden sliding door where
 visitors were greeted. Gone is the steel staircase that led to the upper dining areas." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e090efb57f24aff8276338b4b1112e75577c6650e39abe67972 

-- "Teaching the Agony of Ethical Dilemmas at DePaul," by Casey Bukro: "'There is real agony to ethical dilemmas as we strive to be both competitive and excellent,' said Carol Marin, one of Chicago's most respected journalists, as she launched DePaul University's Center for Journalism Integrity and Excellence. Marin will be co-director of the new center with her longtime television producer, Don Moseley. Both recently won Peabody Awards for their coverage of the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, the third Peabody for Marin and the second for Moseley. Marin and Moseley were among the speakers at a reception celebrating the launch. The new center is dedicated to turning students
 into investigative reporters who dig hard, but with compassion for those afflicted." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09c2e7af3490842fdadba765078c8d9edada902e65f10ab73d 

STATE  

MEETING -- Gov. Bruce Rauner and the four legislative leaders are to meet today to discuss budget strategies. The meeting comes after a budget working group forwarded a proposal to the leaders that did not include items involving the governor's policy agenda. 

BALANCING ACT -- Illinois Education Secretary Beth Purvis writes a Chicago Tribune Op-Ed, calling on the need for a change in the state's school funding formula but without a "bailout" for Chicago Public Schools. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09b1e8e38f6d1bb76a162bac3b02d6f5e4a73b4519d4b714fd 

AFSCME BILL VETOED AGAIN -- "Gov. Rauner vetoes union arbitration bill," State Journal-Register: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e0915e80d92f41c6ca252e41652d90dabd7f0ace5c5fdc33aee 

VETO EXPLAINED -- Gov. Bruce Rauner writes an open letter to state employees: "Rauner: You've been misled," -- "Expanding the size of government faster than middle-class paychecks are growing is a failing strategy. That is why I have no choice but to veto AFSCME's arbitration bill, HB580. It's not because I don't want to see you earn a better living today. I do. I veto HB580 because I want to protect the pension system that you are counting on for your retirement." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09e824d86dbdc35828e6bb78e3bb923d660a9c86f373d43729 

WHERE'S RAHM? In the morning, delivers remarks at the Taste of Chicago food vendor event. 

WHERE'S RAUNER? No public events. 

** A message from VoteVets Action Fund: Strong prevailing wage laws are like a minimum wage for skilled construction workers. Because veterans work in construction at higher rates than non-veterans, prevailing wage laws enable hundreds of thousands of veterans to put their battle-tested leadership and problem solving skills to work building our communities while providing a good life for their families. Unfortunately, in the last two years, at least eleven states (including Illinois) have considered repealing or weakening their prevailing wage laws, which would hurt our economy and drive thousands of veterans out of their jobs and into poverty. Our nation's heroes deserve better from our
 elected officials. Stand with veterans and sign our petition for the strong prevailing wage laws that help our veterans and their families. - http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e090359de37cb601c753609c6aa2f3fb12ad41ad1389ef4c7ba **

<b>WHAT IS UP WITH TSA? -- &quot;O'Hare Airport Was A Living Nightmare Last Weekend,&quot; by Chicagoist's Rachel Cromidas: 
</b>&quot;Treacherous security lines turned O'Hare International Airport into a waking nightmare of missed flights, delays and stranded travelers Sunday night. There's a TSA staffing shortage contributing to long security lines and delays around the country right now. In Chicago, many passengers had to wait two or more hours to get through airport security Sunday, causing 450 people to miss their American Airlines flights ... those passengers ended up sleeping in the airline's terminal on cots in hopes of flying out Monday morning. Many travelers leaving or passing through Chicago took to social media to express their frustrations.&quot;

</b>, looking specifically at five legislative districts where Republicans are incumbents. The surveys looked at Gov. Bruce Rauner's approval numbers and asked about wages, policy issues and funding for child care. Remember SEIU Health Care is still in contract negotiations with the governor.  </p><p><b>An accompanying memo reads: </b>&quot;Rauner's approval numbers were upside down. Fifty-one percent of voters in the 99<sup>th
</sup> District, where the State Capitol is located, said Rauner was doing a bad job, compared to 32% who said good. He notched similarly dismal numbers in two downstate districts and one Chicago area district. In a northern suburban district voters offered a split verdict, 40% good versus 37% bad, but expressed serious reservations about positions taken by the legislators. </p><p><b>&quot;It's not only the governor's unpopularity 
</b>that should be a cause of worry, but the lack of support for a number of his policies. In all of the districts, a majority of voters said they would be less likely to vote for a legislator who &quot;opposed small wage increases for working poor Illinoisans who care for children, the elderly and persons with disabilities.&quot; The question pertains to a stalled contract negotiation between the Rauner administration and SEIU Healthcare, the organization that represents those workers. Voters also did not look favorably on representatives who have stood behind the Rauner's administrations cuts to childcare programs for lower-income working families, with a majority or near-majority in all districts
 saying it would make them less likely to vote for the member.&quot; </p><p><b>Here's how the numbers break down:</b> </p><p><b>20th District</b> </p><p><a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e0905d3b460664009693ef04d2755b9e14dd3cc2f32868d02ef" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1TdImXS</a>  </p><p><b>61st District</b> </p><p><a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e098106777e9a87c3f2c7353f2c8a87c3be0b55996477411fca" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1Yydwrc</a>  </p><p><b>95th District</b> </p><p><a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e09acd5907e81e331712bc156a89cb5eea8e947895a50a67523" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1WCj9qL</a>  </p><p><b>99th district </b> </p><p><a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7be1726fd7c70e093e039a0c0af6fbd68c02ebcd6bc883798f43a95310186720" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1suaBpK</a>  </p><p><b>115 District</b> </p><p>

Gannett raised its offer to $15 a share, a proposal valued at about $475 million when excluding about $385 million of outstanding debt. The revised offer represents a 22% increase over its prior bid and a nearly 100% premium over Tribune Publishing's share price of $7.52 on April 22, the last trading day before Gannett made public its initial offer of $12.25 a share April 25.

On one side of the front: Gannett's deep wallet - able to afford more than the 63 percent initial premium it initially offered. On the other side, Tribune chairman Michael Ferro has a line drawn around the company's prime properties in Chicago and L.A., claiming defensibility and great riches ahead.

<b>&quot;Women Look To Make History In 2016 Senate Races,&quot; by NPR's Jessica Taylor: </b>&quot;If Democrats take back the Senate in 2016, they'll likely have women to thank for it. The party is likely to have at least six female nominees who are challenging Republican incumbents in their top-targeted states, helping them flip the four seats necessary to take back Senate control, if Democrats hold the White House. And Democrats believe they have the perfect storm brewing to help them do that - likely the first female presidential nominee coupled with a probable GOP nominee who has a well-documented history of controversial remarks about women.&quot;

President Obama has referred to this history on several occasions, noting that video from cellphones and body cameras have shown the country that black Americans were not imagining the problem of police brutality or 'making this up.' But the link between these videos and the racial history of United States seems to have eluded James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who appears to be fixated on the discredited idea that videos represent a problem in themselves - and that the
