The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friends,
=20
Last week we learned what we have known for a long time- that Donald Trump =
will be the Republican nominee for President in November.=20
=20
Make no mistake, he is the single biggest threat to everything we have acco=
mplished under President Obama.  This election, we have a choice to make, e=
ither sit back and let his backwards ideals take hold or we stand together.=
=20
=20
I am asking you to take a stand and that is why I am writing to tell you th=
at DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz is coming to Indianapolis on Saturday=
, June 4th for a reception at the home of Nathaniel Lee. The funds raised a=
t the reception will help our Democratic nominee for President take the Whi=
te House in November.
=20
We must do everything we can to keep Trump out of the White House!  So plea=
se, join me and Debbie at Nathaniel's house for an evening of discussion ab=
out the 2016 race and the part we can all play to elect Democrats up and do=
wn the ticket.
=20
You can RSVP here:

I hope to see you all there!
