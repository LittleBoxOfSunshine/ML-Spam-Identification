Hello Geoff,

My name is Juliana Jim?nez, I'm a reporter for Univision News, I called your office earlier and spoke with Sam, who gave me your email. I'm working on a story about the effect Bernie Sanders is having on the Democratic Party, and in what ways he is dividing it--and in turn the effect that could have on Hillary Clinton's chances at the general election. I'd love to know a bit about the Democratic party's sense of the current landscape, their concerns with Sanders' voters, the democratic base's alienation, among other things.

My number is 305-487-5513<tel:305-487-5513>, or 352-792-2410<tel:352-792-2410>. I would love to ask you a few short questions whenever you have a chance as soon as possible, my deadline is ASAP.

Thank you so much,
Juliana
