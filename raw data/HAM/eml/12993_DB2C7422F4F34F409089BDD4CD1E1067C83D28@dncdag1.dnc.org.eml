Delegate allegiances: It's not all in the slate cards
April 26, 2016 1:12 PM

As we pass into the afternoon on Primary Day, take a few seconds to pity all those Republican voters out there, trying to figure out which delegate to support ... not to mention the reporters fielding their calls.

Of the 71 Republican delegates at stake in today's GOP primary, 17 will be obliged to vote for the presidential candidate who wins the state's popular vote. But the other 54 delegates are chosen directly by voters ... and they can support whomever they wish. And while the campaigns of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have released "slate cards" of delegate candidates they endorse, let the voter beware: Those cards aren't the final word in how a delegate will vote upon arriving at the Republican National Convention.

As we reported Sunday<http://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2016/04/24/GOP-s-delegates-will-play-huge-role-in-deciding-Republican-presidential-candidate-primary-election/stories/201604230118>, some delegates have thrown their support to a candidate already, though most others have merely pledged to support whoever wins their district ... at least on the first ballot. The campaigns themselves have issued slate cards, though sometimes they too can confuse the issue.

For one thing, while Gabriel Keller appears in our Sunday story as a champion of frontrunner Donald Trump, Mr. Trump's list of endorsed candidate<http://www.politicspa.com/exclusive-trumps-pa-delegates-slate/74749/>s doesn't include him. (It DOES include Monica Morrill, who the P-G couldn't reach for comment.)

Ted Cruz has released a slate card of his own, though recent versions - including one sent to supporters this morning --include candidates who aren't committed to him.

The latest version of the card names three delegates in the 14th Congressional District -- Mike DeVanney, Cameron S. Linton and Mary Ann Meloy -- who told the Post-Gazette that they were committed to being uncommitted.

Those are also the only three delegates running in the 14th, a Democratic bastion centered on the city of Pittsburgh ... and each congressional district picks three delegates.

"I honestly don't know why we're on the list," said Mr. DeVanney. "It's absolutely the case that all three of us are uncommitted delegates. We're legitimately weighing all the candidates."

Lowman Henry, who chairs Mr. Cruz's campaign in Pennsylvania, acknowledged that not everyone on the endorsed list can be relied upon to vote for Mr. Cruz.

"At this point, it's really a list of who we are supporting, and not just who is supporting us," he said. "In a number of districts where we didn't have people committed to Cruz, we reached out and recommended people who we believe to be good solid conservatives. These are thoughtful people and we think we have a chance to win their support."

Mr. Henry acknowledged that part of the motivation was to build good will with delegates who were certain to win today: "A pat on the back is always welcome," he said. "And Mike and Mary Ann have been good friends of mine for many years. I think they are all open-minded delegates, so why wouldn't we help?"

Just don't feel betrayed if they end up supporting someone other than Ted Cruz.
