 last week to Jae Kim, a friend of mine and former WLF member now living in=
 Vancouver, if she would feel comfortable contacting her best friend, Ahmal=
 Clooney, to see if she might be part of this event. Jae called me today to=
 say that she spoke to Ahmal, =C2=A0that George has been invited to speak a=
t Convention, (hasn't accepted yet, but =C2=A0he's thinking it's too import=

 consider being our special guests at this event. (great news!!) =C2=A0They=
 also met Kirsten, are impressed with her,=C2=A0and would like to do someth=
