Andrew, 

,
 
With Donald Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, the stakes this November couldn't be higher. 
 
Our country needs a Democratic majority in the Senate not only to protect and advance our progressive priorities, but also to serve as a firewall against a possible Trump administration.
 
That's why I'm asking for your help. These three critical races will help Democrats take back the U.S. Senate in November. Pitch in today to help them win >>
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/tk-mcgintyjudgehassan?refcode=20160518&amount=25
 
Katie McGinty is the ninth of ten kids, born to a Philadelphia police officer and a restaurant hostess. The first person in her family to go to college, she's running for the U.S. Senate so she can create jobs while protecting our environment. Katie is running in an extremely close race in Pennsylvania, where polls show her only one point down from her Republican opponent. Chip in to elect Katie now >>
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/tk-mcgintyjudgehassan?refcode=20160518&amount=25

Patty Judge is the former Lieutenant Governor of Iowa, as well as the first woman to be elected Secretary of Agriculture for her state. Polls show that voters are responding to Patty's message about the importance of filling the current Supreme Court vacancy. Chip in to elect Patty now >>
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/tk-mcgintyjudgehassan?refcode=20160518&amount=25
 
Maggie Hassan, currently the Governor of New Hampshire, is neck and neck in what is being called one of the most closely watched Senate races this cycle. Maggie wants to go to Washington to defend our middle class and senior citizens from right-wing attacks. Chip in to elect Maggie now >>
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/tk-mcgintyjudgehassan?refcode=20160518&amount=25
 
If Senators more closely resembled their constituents, we wouldn't face these constant attacks on Planned Parenthood, and women might actually earn the same amount as men for doing the exact same job. That's why it's so important that these three women are elected in November: this is Democrats' opportunity to win back the Senate and elect strong woman leaders. Chip in to send Katie McGinty, Patty Judge, and Maggie Hassan to Washington. >>
