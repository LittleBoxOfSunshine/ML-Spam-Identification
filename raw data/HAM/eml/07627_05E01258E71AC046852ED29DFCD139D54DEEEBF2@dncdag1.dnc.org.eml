The Confessore story on Bernie=92s impact on the Party beyond his electoral=
 prospects is out. Overall I think it=92s as good as we could hope for. We =
were able to keep him from including more on the JVF, it has a mention in t=
here, but between us and a conversation he had with Marc Elias he finally b=
acked off from focusing too much on that. Longabaugh also strikes a somewha=

 named

By Nicholas Confessore

APRIL 24, 2016



Even as his chances of winning the Democratic presidential nomination slip =
away, Senator Bernie Sanders<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/ele=
ctions/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?inline=3Dnyt-per> and his allies a=
re trying to use his popularity to expand his political influence, setting =
up an ideological struggle for the soul of the Democratic Party<http://topi=
cs.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/democratic_party/i=
ndex.html?inline=3Dnyt-org> in the post-Obama era.

Aides to Mr. Sanders have been pressing party officials for a significant r=
ole in drafting the platform for the Democratic convention in July, aiming =
to lock in strong planks on issues like a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage,=
 breaking up Wall Street banks and banning natural gas =93fracking.=94

Amid his unexpectedly strong showing in the Democratic primaries, Mr. Sande=
rs has tapped his two-million-person donor list to raise money for liberal =
congressional candidates in New York, Nevada and Washington State. And in t=
he waning months of Barack Obama=92s presidency, Mr. Sanders=92s allies are=
 testing their muscle against the White House, mounting a public attack on =
the president=92s housing secretary, Juli=E1n Castro, over his department=
=92s sales of delinquent mortgages to banks and private equity firms.

=93There is a greater goal here,=94 said Representative Ra=FAl M. Grijalva =
of Arizona, a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who sent=
 a letter to Mr. Castro criticizing the mortgage sales. =93The contribution=
 of Bernie that will be lasting for us is that we will coalesce around an a=
genda.=94

The pressure from Mr. Sanders and his allies is putting the party establish=
ment, which is closely aligned with Hillary Clinton<http://www.nytimes.com/=
interactive/2016/us/elections/hillary-clinton-on-the-issues.html?inline=3Dn=
yt-per>, in a delicate position. Democratic leaders are wary of steering th=
e party too far left, but do not want to alienate the Sanders supporters wh=
ose votes Mrs. Clinton needs in November, or risk losing the vast new donor=
 base Mr. Sanders has created.

The institutional bulwarks against Mr. Sanders are significant: Hundreds of=
 the party=92s =93superdelegates=94 have endorsed Mrs. Clinton, a signal of=
 her broad support among the party=92s power brokers. The Democratic Nation=
al Committee<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizati=
ons/d/democratic_national_committee/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-org> now relies=
 on Mrs. Clinton=92s fund-raising to provide a fifth of its monthly income,=
 an arrangement the Sanders campaign has criticized.

And Mrs. Clinton is well positioned to block any proposals she would not wa=
nt to defend in a general election. In January, the party chairwoman, Repre=
sentative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, appointed dozens of Clinton =
supporters and advisers to the three standing committees of the Democratic =
Party convention. Of 45 potential members submitted by Mr. Sanders, she app=
ointed just three, according to Mr. Sanders=92s campaign.

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, a top Clinton surrogate, will be co-c=
hairman of the platform committee. Barney Frank, a former Massachusetts con=
gressman and fierce critic of Mr. Sanders and his Wall Street proposals, wi=
ll be a co-chairman of the rules committee, which governs procedure on the =
convention floor. Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said he=
 believed the campaign would ultimately be well represented on all the comm=
ittees as more members are named. But he questioned how Ms. Wasserman Schul=
tz had chosen her discretionary appointments.

=93Not only are they supporting Clinton, but they have been extremely criti=
cal of Bernie Sanders,=94 Mr. Longabaugh said. =93That doesn=92t seem like =
the right way to go if we want to have a convention that is evenhanded.=94

Luis Miranda, a spokesman for the Democratic National Convention<http://top=
ics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/democratic_national_co=
nvention/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-org>, said the party was =93committed to a=
n open, inclusive and representative process=94 to draft the platform.

=93Both of our campaigns will be represented on the drafting committee,=94 =
Mr. Miranda said.

Some fissures within the Democratic family may be inevitable. For eight yea=
rs, Mr. Obama=92s presidency has muted ideological disagreement within the =
party. His moral authority as the country=92s first black commander in chie=
f, his popularity with grass-roots Democratic voters and his political batt=
les with Congress have worked to squelch the kind of ideological battles th=
at have divided the Republican Party.

But the Democrats=92 liberal wing, including lawmakers like Senator Elizabe=
th Warren of Massachusetts, has become more restive in Mr. Obama=92s second=
 term. Liberal groups have pressured the president on recent appointments t=
o the Treasury Department and his deportation policies. At the same time, a=
 younger generation of activists is challenging presidential candidates in =
both parties on issues of criminal justice, police violence and the rights =
of undocumented immigrants.

=93A boldly populist, people-oriented type of platform is massively appeali=
ng to those who have come of age during the financial meltdown and the peri=
od afterward,=94 said Kurt Walters, the campaign director at Rootstrikers, =
a group that favors limiting the influence of big donors in politics.

The party is relatively unified on raising the minimum wage to $15, and Mrs=
. Clinton recently voiced qualified support. But there is a risk, some Demo=
crats said, that Mr. Sanders =97 an independent who is not actually a membe=
r of the party =97 would push the party to embrace positions that could lat=
er hurt Mrs. Clinton and other Democratic candidates.

Mr. Sanders is almost certain to win a prime-time speaking slot at the summ=
er convention, providing one of the biggest audiences yet for his views. So=
me Democrats said they feared a left-wing equivalent of Pat Buchanan=92s se=
aring speech at the 1992 Republican convention, when Mr. Buchanan, who had =
failed to win his party=92s nomination, called for a =93cultural war=94 aga=
inst =93liberals and radicals.=94

Matt Bennett, a founder of the center-left think tank Third Way, said Mrs. =
Clinton had so far avoided tacking too far left to compete effectively in a=
 general election. =93They need to be careful not to go so far as to hand t=
he Republicans something to beat them over the head with,=94 Mr. Bennett sa=
id. =93Bans on anything tend to be politically problematic.=94

The campaign against Mr. Castro=92s policies at the Department of Housing a=
nd Urban Development, called =93Don=92t Sell Our Homes to Wall Street,=94 c=
ould foreshadow the kind of leverage progressives would like to exert after=
 November. Mr. Castro, one of the country=92s most prominent young Latino p=
oliticians, is seen as a potential vice-presidential pick<http://www.nytime=
s.com/2016/04/24/us/politics/hillary-clinton-vice-president.html> for Mrs. =
Clinton.

But the pressure tactics are also likely to sow more of the bitterness that=
 has come to dominate Mr. Sanders=92s primary battle with Mrs. Clinton.

This month, Mr. Sanders asked his supporters to contribute money to Lucy Fl=
ores, a former Nevada assemblywoman running for Congress.

In his email, Mr. Sanders also suggested that Emily=92s List, a political a=
ction committee that is dedicated to electing women who support abortion ri=
ghts and is close to Mrs. Clinton, had spurned Ms. Flores in her race becau=
se she had endorsed Mr. Sanders. Emily=92s List, which has endorsed Ms. Flo=
res in past campaigns, backed another Democratic candidate.

The claim drew a sharp response from Emily=92s List, one of the most powerf=
ul groups in mainstream Democratic politics.

=93We support several candidates who have endorsed him, so he should stick =
to issues rather than disingenuous attacks,=94 said Marcy Stech, a spokeswo=
man for Emily=92s List.

But in an interview, Ms. Flores said she believed there was a broader agend=
a at play in the group=92s decision.

=93It=92s just like with the presidential race,=94 Ms. Flores said. =93The =
Democratic Party and the establishment have their ideas about who they want=
 to support.=94
