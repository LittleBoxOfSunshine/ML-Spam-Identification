  *   Miami Beach commissioner closing controversial Relentless for Progres=
s PAC:  The controversial political action committee Relentless for Progres=
s has relented.

Citing personal reflection as his primary motivation, Miami Beach Commissio=
ner Jonah Wolfson announced on Thursday afternoon that he will close his co=
mmittee, which has raised more than $1 million from a gallery of city vendo=
rs, prominent developers and lobbyists. He said he will return what remains=
 of the money to contributors, which is about half.

The PAC had become the talk of political circles both in and outside of Mia=
mi Beach for its rapid fundraising from entities who have business with the=
 city, and its activity attracted the attention of the Miami-Dade Commissio=
n on Ethics and Public Trust, which started an investigation.

The committee sparked a debate about the role of =93soft money=94 in local =
politics =97 particularly in a city like Miami Beach, which has an ordinanc=
e that prohibits vendors, developers and lobbyists from donating directly o=
r indirectly to candidates=92 campaigns. Wolfson had planned on using Relen=
tless for Progress =97 whose initials mirror the acronym for the way cities=
 solicit city vendors, =93request for proposal=94 =97 to back candidates in=
 this year=92s Beach elections. Three commission seats are up for grabs in =
November and Mayor Philip Levine has a challenger.

The Beach=92s city attorney had opined that contributions to RFP were legal=
 as long as they were not earmarked for specific candidates by the donors.

All along, Wolfson and Levine, who helped solicit contributors, defended th=
emselves and the committee in the Miami Herald and on television.

But fellow commissioner Ed Tobin criticized the committee from the dais, an=
d local political journalist Michael Putney slammed RFP on more than one oc=
casion in a Herald op-ed and during This Week in South Florida.

During at least one of those broadcasts, a slick TV commercial starring Lev=
ine and paid for by the PAC aired between segments. The ad, which Levine in=
sists was not a campaign commercial but featured him listing the chief init=
iatives during his term as mayor, ran at least three times. It has since go=
tten placement before YouTube videos.

Wolfson also bought a full-page ad in the Herald taking aim at Putney. The =
ad ran three times.

Now, Wolfson is saying he will close RFP and give contributors their money =
back.

=93After some heated debate as well as much personal reflection, I have mad=
e the decision to close the PAC,=94 he said Wednesday in an emailed stateme=
nt. =93The PAC was legal, ethical and appropriate. Fundraising from stakeho=
lders is a practice that has been going on throughout the country in local,=
 state and federal elections for years. Our nation=92s highest court has ru=
led that it is protected free speech.=94

In an interview on Thursday afternoon, Wolfson told the Miami Herald that h=
e reflected on the contentious debate surrounding his committee after forme=
r Miami Beach Mayor David Dermer, whom Wolfson considers a mentor, visited =
him at home to discuss RFP.

=93He gave me good guidance and direction on the topic,=94 he said. =93When=
 he came to me and mentioned it, it made me take a step back and reflect.=
=94

Through the end of July, RFP brought in about $1.3 million and spent about =
$700,000 on mailers, TV spots, campaign contributions to four county judges=
 and political consulting. The committee=92s financial activity from August=
 is not yet available.

Wolfson said he would refund all of the remaining money in the committee=92=
s account on a pro rata basis, meaning each donor would get an amount back =
in proportion to what was donated.

He said he plans to bring a new ordinance to the Beach=92s commission that =
will prohibit elected officials and candidates or their designees from soli=
citing any contributions from vendors, lobbyists and real estate developers=
 with any interest in Miami Beach projects.

=93We should hold ourselves to a higher standard,=94 he said. =93During the=
 last two months of my service, I will continue to lead Miami Beach in the =
right direction, with dignity and integrity.=94

Wolfson is term-limited this year. On Thursday he said he does not know wha=
t is next for him after public office, though he wants to remain active in =
Beach issues. A vocal opponent of the proposed land lease for a headquarter=
 hotel next to the Miami Beach Convention Center, he said he=92d likely pub=
licly speak out against it on his own dime.

Levine had gone on Putney=92s Sunday morning program to defend himself and =
the PAC in July. On Thursday, the mayor said he applauded Wolfson=92s decis=
ion.

=93I think the PAC became a distraction to the real issues that we need to =
be discussing in moving our city forward,=94 he said.

Upon learning of the PAC=92s closing on Thursday, Tobin was skeptical that =
contributions from monied special interests wouldn=92t keep finding its way=
 into local Beach politics, either through other committees or through 501(=
c)(4) status organizations, which do not have to disclose donors.

=93It=92s not going to change,=94 he said. =93It=92s just a lack of respect=
 for the public=92s intelligence. It=92s that simple.=94 [Miami Herald; Sep=
t 3, 2015<http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/miami-=
