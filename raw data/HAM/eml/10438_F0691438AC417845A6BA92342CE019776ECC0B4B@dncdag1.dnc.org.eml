Panel 1: Ruth Marcus, Ben Domenech, Amy Walter, and Jonathan Martin

Where are we this week?

Martin: unless something really crazy happens at the convention, this is no=
w Trump's party.

Paul Ryan is not ready to embrace the nominee of the party but Reince is ur=
ging everyone to come together. Is there a genuine break in this party?

Walter: There is a genuine break in this party and it won't look the same i=
n 2017 as it does today. Break in ideology, tone, style that has been brewi=
ng for a long time. Trump did not invent it but he walked into a room full =
of gasoline and threw a match on it.

Marcus: This was an extraordinary week for the Republican Party. Republican=
s are watching three out of the last four guys they voted for for president=
 saying they cannot support Trump and the fourth looked not too happy sayin=
g he would be for the nominee.

Martin: Republicans that have already endorsed Trump have to be feeling a l=
ittle uneasy about it after the week that Trump just had - with so many Rep=
ublicans coming out against him.

[shows clip of Trump saying HRC is playing the women card, the women get it=
 better than men do] HRC says she is not going to run a negative campaign a=
gainst Trump, but he is certainly running one against her.

Walter: She doesn't have to run a negative campaign, she is going to have a=
 lot of people doing it for her.

Marcus: Trump is making his standing with women worse by the day. Crooked H=
illary might work but saying she is not qualified and only there because sh=
e is a woman is insulting not just to HRC but to woman in general.

Domenech: the real question is whether Trump is even interested in unifying=
 the party.
