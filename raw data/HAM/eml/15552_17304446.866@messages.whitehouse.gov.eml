Pool Report #3



After a considerable wait, pool was ushered into the state dining room a =
little after noon. President Obama sat in his customary position at table=
 center, with Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Adviser=
 Susan Rice on his left. The president and prime ministers of the Nordic =
nations sat on his right and along two perpendicular wings at the ends of=
 the main table. Also present were the foreign ministers.



Presidents subdued remarks were a reprise of his Grand Foyer greeting thi=
s morning. He praised the nations for their respective roles in helping t=
o address the refugee crisis and said he looks forward to their participa=
tion in an upcoming summit on refugees in September. He also said the nat=
ions and the United States are united in their concern over Russia, and p=
ointed to an upcoming NATO summit as a forum for further discussion.



(Check quotes against transcript) We nations are ``united in our concerns=
 about Russias aggressive military presence in Ukraine and elsewhere, he =
said. He praised their commitment to the effort to control climate change=
, especially given the countries mutual proximity to the Arctic region.



The president also talked about mutual interests in combating poverty, an=
d health issues.



The only laugh he got this time around was when he suggested the discussi=
on perhaps lacked the fireworks of other parleys with foreign leaders, be=
cause there was ``too much agreement.



Then it was the turn of Stefan Lfven, Prime Minister of Sweden, to speak.=
 He praised the presidents leadership on climate change, and bringing hea=
lth care to the U.S. via the Affordable Care Act.



``I applaud President Obama for his instrumental role in (pushing) a clim=
ate-change agenda.



He quoted President Obama as saying ``if only everyone could be like Scan=
dinavia, it would all be easy. Pooler not sure of the source of that quot=
e.



The pool was ushered out amid a few questions, much to the amusement of t=
he visiting Nordic delegations. The president exchanged some knowing glan=
ces and then offered a table-clearing-type hand gesture that seemed to sa=
y ``OK, time to leave. Shortly after, the president and the Nordic leader=
s walked along the South Portico astride the Rose Garden. The president a=
ppeared to walk with Sigurur (Sigurdur) Ingi Jhannsson, Prime Minister of=
 the Republic of Iceland, who just took office after his predecessor resi=
gned because of the Panama Papers scandal.=20
