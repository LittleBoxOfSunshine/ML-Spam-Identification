What happened to the =91best=92 people for Trump?<https://www.washingtonpos=
t.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/05/10/what-happened-to-the-best-people-for-t=
rump/?postshare=3D2111462909337433&tid=3Dss_tw>
By Jennifer Rubin<http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jennifer-rubin> May =
10 at 3:38 PM

Throughout the campaign, Donald Trump boasted that he would get =93great=94=
 people, the =93best=94 people to work for him. As the campaign wore on, it=
 turned out the best people did not want to work for him. He came up with a=
 hodgepodge of under-qualified or downright flaky foreign policy advisers.

The problem is that a great many qualified people do not want to work with =
him and certainly do not want to be his VP (e.g., South Carolina Gov. Nikki=
 Haley, Ohio Gov. John Kasich). Now we see just how troubling is his judgme=
nt in advisers.

Corey Lewandowski, not a lawyer but someone who was charged with battery (c=
harges later were dropped) and sought to smear the accuser, is now going to=
 oversee the VP selection process. Do we think Lewandoswki can pick out peo=
ple who are respectful of others, have high standards and would contribute =
something other than =93Yes, Mr. President=94 to the administration? Probab=
ly not.

Then there is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is overseeing the transit=
ion team. (Usually candidates wait at least until after the nomination.) Th=
at=92s odd since Christie has never served in an administration (other than=
 as a U.S. attorney), has picked fights with Congress, was tutored by forei=
gn policy experts for months and then embraced a candidate who shared none =
of those positions, and managed to burn bridges with serious conservatives =
over his embrace of Trump. It=92ll be fascinating to see how he figures out=
 which sorts of people go with which jobs, let alone finds anyone to fill t=
hem.

And let=92s not forget he tapped Steven Mnuchin (a Democratic money man, ex=
-Goldman Sachs employee and failed movie investor who skipped out before a =
bankruptcy filing) as his finance director. I suppose we should be thankful=
 he is not the first pick for treasury secretary. (Oh, gosh, what if. . .)

Finally, there is Paul Manafort, former representative to the =93Torturer=
=92s Lobby=94 whose connections to Russia are so problematic it may complic=
ate Trump=92s national security briefing. (=93Trump=92s top adviser, Paul M=
anafort, has spent much of his recent career working for pro-Russian forces=
 in Ukraine, and doing complex deals for an oligarch with close ties to Put=
in. And while a Democratic senator has already charged Trump is not respons=
ible enough to receive secret information, Manafort=92s deep relationships =
with top pro-Russian figures raise special concerns.=94) Surely Manafort is=
 likely to be rewarded with a plum position if Trump wins. Secretary of sta=
te? National security adviser? One can only imagine.

This, you see, is one of the big problems with Trump=92s policy promises, i=
ncluding court nominees (not just the Supreme Court but also lower courts).=
 The people around him are not equipped to put in place an administration o=
f quality people who can shape and implement policy or vet and recommend ju=
dges. Trump values loyalty above all, regardless of experience, competence =
or character. Imagine an entire administration full of Lewandowskis and Rog=
er Stones. These people will have the power of the IRS, the Justice Departm=
ent, countless regulatory agencies and, of course, the armed forces. Betwee=
n public servants who take themselves out of the running and qualified peop=
le dubbed to be insufficiently loyal and subservient to Trump, the quality =
of a Trump administration will make the Obama team look like superstars by =
comparison.

It is, quite frankly, a recipe for corruption and self-dealing as Trump and=
 his minions use the levers of government to reward friends and punish enem=
ies. Some of the worst nominees will get weeded out by Congress, but many o=
thers will get rubber stamped. The White House staff, of course, is not sub=
ject to congressional confirmation (which is an excellent reason to chop it=
 down to size).

If one selects a president who is intellectually and unethically unfit, you=
=92re practically guaranteeing the vast majority of his staff and appointme=
nts will be so as well. Quality attracts quality, and the reverse is true a=
s well.
