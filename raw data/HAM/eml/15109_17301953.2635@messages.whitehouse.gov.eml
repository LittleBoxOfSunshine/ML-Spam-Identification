THE WHITE HOUSE
Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 5, 2016

**

*Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Announces Steps to Strengthen Financial=
 Transparency, and Combat Money Laundering, Corruption, and Tax Evasion*

**

*"Actions build on ongoing efforts to combat money laundering, corruption=
, and tax evasion"*



Today, the Administration announced several important steps to combat mon=
ey laundering, corruption, and tax evasion, and called upon Congress to t=
ake additional action to address these critical issues.=20



The United States has long led the global efforts to combat money launder=
ing, corruption, and offshore tax evasion, and pursue the bad actors  inc=
luding tax cheats, kleptocrats, and other criminals  who abuse the financ=
ial system or shell companies and other legal entities. Todays actions bu=
ild upon the substantial progress the United States and its global partne=
rs have made to date in strengthening the global financial system and pro=
viding greater transparency, so that criminals and tax cheats cannot hide=
 their activities using anonymous shell companies and other legal entitie=
s. These efforts are critical to preventing criminals from using the glob=
al financial system to launder proceeds from corruption or other illegal =
activities, finance criminal activity or even terrorism, evade internatio=
nal sanctions regimes, or evade taxes.



In recent weeks, the disclosure of the so-called Panama Papers  millions =
of leaked documents reportedly revealing the use of anonymous offshore sh=
ell companies  has brought the issues of illicit financial activity and t=
ax evasion into the spotlight. The Panama Papers underscore the importanc=
e of the efforts the United States has taken domestically, and the effort=
s we have undertaken with our international partners, to address these sh=
ared challenges.



*_Today, the Administration is taking the following steps:_*

*__*


  * *_Announcing new Administrative actions to combat money laundering, t=
errorist financing, and tax evasion_**:* The Administration is announcing=
 new rules to increase transparency and disclosure requirements that will=
 enhance law enforcements ability to detect, deter, and disrupt money lau=
ndering, terrorist finance, and tax evasion:




  * Final Treasury regulations on Customer Due Diligence that enhance tra=
nsparency and protect the integrity of the financial system by requiring =
financial institutions to know and keep records on who actually owns the =
companies that use their services;




  * New proposed Treasury/IRS tax rules closing a loophole allowing forei=
gners to hide assets or financial activity behind anonymous entities esta=
blished in the United States.




  * *_Putting forward new legislative proposals to strengthen our tools t=
o fight corruption and money laundering_**:* The Administration is releas=
ing draft legislation that would: *__*

*__*


  * Increase transparency into the beneficial ownership of companies form=
ed in the United States by requiring that companies know and report their=
 true owners;




  * Provide additional law enforcement tools to combat corruption and mon=
ey laundering.




  * *_Calling on Congress to act on long-overdue proposals that help crac=
k down on tax evasion_**: *In a letter from Secretary Lew, the Administra=
tion is also calling upon the Senate to finally approve tax treaties that=
 have been pending for several years, and that would help crack down on o=
ffshore tax evasion. We stand ready to work with Congress to act on the A=
dministrations legislative proposal, that ensures the United States is in=
 line with international standards on tax information sharing.

*__*

*_Enhancing Financial Transparency Through Customer Due Diligence Rules_*=


*__*

The Treasury Departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is=
 making public a final rule requiring financial institutions to know and =
verify the identities of the natural persons (also known as beneficial ow=
ners) who own, control, and profit from companies when those companies op=
en accounts.=20



This rule also amends existing regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act (BS=
A) to enhance transparency and protect the integrity of the financial sys=
tem by clarifying and strengthening the customer due diligence obligation=
s of financial institutions. The CDD Final Rule advances the implementati=
on of the BSA by helping to make available to law enforcement valuable in=
formation needed to disrupt illicit finance networks. This will in turn i=
ncrease financial transparency and augment the ability of financial insti=
tutions and law enforcement to identify the assets and accounts of crimin=
als and national security threats. This will also facilitate compliance w=
ith sanctions programs and other measures that cut off financial flows to=
 these actors.=20



*_Closing a Loophole that Enables Foreigners to Hide Behind Anonymous Ent=
ities Formed in the United States _*

*__*

The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are issuing pr=
oposed regulations closing a loophole in U.S. laws that has allowed forei=
gners to hide assets or financial activity behind anonymous entities esta=
blished in the United States. The rule will require foreign-owned entitie=
s that are disregarded entities for tax purposes, including foreign-owned=
 single-member limited liability companies (LLCs), to obtain an employer =
identification number (EIN) with the IRS. These entities represent a narr=
ow class of foreign-owned U.S. entities that have previously had no oblig=
ation to report information to the IRS or to get a tax identification num=
ber, and thus can be used to shield the foreign owners of non-U.S. assets=
 or non-U.S. bank accounts. The proposed rule will strengthen the IRSs ab=
ility to prevent the use of these entities for tax avoidance purposes, an=
d will build on the success of other efforts to curb the use of foreign e=
ntities and accounts to evade U.S. tax.



*_Calling Upon Congress to Provide Additional Tools to Combat Illicit Fin=
ancial Activity and Tax Evasion_*

*__*

In addition to the administrative steps taken today, the Administration r=
enews the call for Congress to act to strengthen our authorities and clos=
e the gaps in our laws that can be abused by bad actors and keep the Unit=
ed States at the forefront of international efforts to combat financial c=
rimes.=20




  * *_New legislation to require reporting of the beneficial ownership of=
 corporations, helping law enforcement prevent and investigate financial =
crimes_**: *Treasury is sending to Congress draft legislation requiring l=
egal entities to know and report information on beneficial ownership. Inc=
reasing law enforcement access to beneficial ownership information  infor=
mation about the people who are really behind a corporation or other busi=
ness entity  will help in preventing and investigating financial crimes.=20=




The Administration is committed to working with Congress to pass meaningf=
ul legislation that would require companies to know and report adequate a=
nd accurate beneficial ownership information at the time of a companys cr=
eation, so that the information can be made available to law enforcement.=
 The legislation would authorize the Treasury Department to require that =
legal entities formed or qualified to do business within the United State=
s file this information with the Treasury Department, and face penalties =
for failure to comply. The misuse of companies to hide beneficial ownersh=
ip is a significant weakness in the transparency of entities formed in th=
e United States that can only be resolved by Congressional action.=20




  * *_New legislation to strengthen our ability to fight transnational co=
rruption_**: *The Department of Justice is sending to Congress draft legi=
slation to enhance and strengthen our efforts to combat transnational cor=
ruption. This legislation would enhance law enforcements ability to preve=
nt bad actors from concealing and laundering illegal proceeds of transnat=
ional corruption. It would also allow U.S. prosecutors to more effectivel=
y pursue kleptocracy cases and prosecute money laundering as part of fore=
ign corruption, and reinforce our role in the international community as =
a model for others in anti-corruption matters. The proposals would assist=
 investigators and prosecutors in gathering evidence which can be used in=
 prosecuting those who seek to hide and move illegal funds.

.*__*


  * *_A call for long-overdue Senate action on tax treaties_**: *Eight ta=
x treaties with other countries have been awaiting Senate approval for se=
veral years  including amendments to our existing treaties with Switzerla=
nd and Luxembourg that would enable U.S. law enforcement in the United St=
ates to obtain information about financial accounts in those countries. T=
he inability to obtain this information has impeded investigations and en=
forcement relating to offshore tax evasion  including evasion involving s=
ecret Swiss bank accounts. Today, in a letter from Secretary Lew, the Adm=
inistration called on Congress to finally act upon the treaties so that t=
hey can be implemented without further delay.*__*

*__*


  * *_Reciprocal FATCA legislation to strengthen our ability to work with=
 other countries to fight tax evasion_**: *Congress also must act to stre=
ngthen the United States hand in pressing other countries to improve tran=
sparency by ensuring that we live up to our end of the bargain. The Presi=
dent has proposed providing full reciprocity under the Foreign Account Ta=
x Compliance Act (FATCA) in the last three budgets he has submitted to Co=
ngress. Secretary Lews letter reiterates that Congress should act on the =
Administrations legislative proposal as soon as possible to ensure that t=
he United States meets international standards.*__*

*__*

*_Background: Prior and Ongoing Administration Efforts to Address Illicit=
 Financial Activity and Tax Evasion_*

*"__"*


  * "Leading the charge globally to enhance financial transparency. "The =
United States has led efforts within the major economic powers of the G-2=
0 and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to strengthen international =
standards on combatting money laundering and terrorist financing, and fac=
ilitate their implementation. More than 190 jurisdictions around the worl=
d have committed to the FATF Recommendations through the global network o=
f FATF-Style Regional Bodies (FSRBs) and FATF memberships.




  * "Enacting legislation that provides critical tools to prevent individ=
uals from evading U.S. taxes using hidden offshore accounts". Since Presi=
dent Obama signed FATCA into law in 2010, the United States has negotiate=
d agreements with more than 100 countries that help us enforce tax our la=
ws. FATCAs pioneering approach to automatic information sharing on tax ma=
tters is the template for the development of international standards that=
 have been endorsed by the G-20 nations and are being deployed around the=
 world.




  * "Cracking down on U.S. tax cheats and entities that facilitate them".=
 The United States has cracked down on tax evasion through criminal and c=
ivil enforcement actions, including successful enforcement actions agains=
t dozens of Swiss banks. Prompted by the threat of prosecution, thousands=
 of U.S. individuals have come forward voluntarily to disclose offshore a=
ccounts and pay back taxes and penalties. The IRS has received more than =
54,000 offshore voluntary disclosures since 2009.




  * "Unparalleled efforts to fight corruption through law enforcement act=
ion". The United States was the first country to criminalize money launde=
ring and the U.S.s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) provided the mode=
l for the OECDs Anti-Bribery Convention and other efforts globally. The D=
epartment of Justice has an unparalleled commitment to, and record of, fi=
ghting corruption through law enforcement action, as reflected through si=
x anti-corruption programs:=20




  * public integrity prosecutions of U.S. public officials;=20
  * prosecutions of U.S. individuals that pay bribes to foreign officials=
;=20
  * prosecutions of U.S. taxpayers who seek to conceal foreign accounts, =
as well as bankers and advisors;=20
  * pursuit of those who misuse the U.S. financial system through money l=
aundering and other corrupt schemes;=20
  * the pioneering Kleptocracy Initiative, which uses investigation and l=
itigation to recover the proceeds of foreign official corruption and retu=
rn the proceeds to the citizens of countries victimized by corruption, wh=
ich has led to the restraint of more than $1.8 billion involving 12 count=
ries; and,=20
  * assistance to foreign counterparts in fighting corruption, both throu=
gh cooperation in foreign corruption cases and through overseas capacity =
building.=20
