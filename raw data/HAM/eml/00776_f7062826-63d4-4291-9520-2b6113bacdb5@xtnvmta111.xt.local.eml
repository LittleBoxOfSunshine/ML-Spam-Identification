JUST POSTED - "White House allies make new push for Garland: Groups to blitz nine states with ads, events to pressure GOP to allow a vote on Supreme Court nominee," by Isaac Dovere: "They're calling it the 9-9-9 campaign: nine states, over nine days, to push for a court with nine justices. (No apologies to Herman Cain, who coined the term for his 2012 tax plan.)" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=581dc5fc28b8983c5bc2377c9d4dac230b2a6a8c8f3a437e91ff2e69b753d8b7

 

BREAKING - "Trump puts his roughest edges on display in Costa Mesa ... begins California campaign with raw performance in O.C.," by L.A. Times' Michael Finnegan, Ruben Vives and Matt Pearce: "The front-runner ... surrounded himself onstage with people carrying banners with photos of family members killed by immigrants in the country illegally. More than 8,000 supporters erupted in a thunder of cheers as Trump vowed to make Mexico pay for a wall." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=581dc5fc28b8983c6a4ab5be7fd90d6a8a528c3a6bd30b62aababe180c19e888

 

--"Protests break out as Trump speaks in Southern Cal" - AP/Costa Mesa: "Dozens of protesters were mostly peaceful Thursday as Trump gave his speech inside the Pacific Amphitheatre. After the event, however, the demonstration grew rowdy late in the evening and spilled into the streets. Approximately 20 people were arrested and one Trump supporter had his face bloodied ... as he tried to drive out of the arena.

"One man jumped on a police car, leaving its front and rear windows smashed and the top dented in and other protests sprayed graffiti on a police car and the venue's marquee. ... [S]everal hundred demonstrators blocked the road, waved Mexican flags and posed for selfies. Police in riot gear and on horseback pushed the crowd back." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=581dc5fc28b8983c36c55255acdb57acccb4988250e7ba59f96e5412d47825bd

SNEAK PEEK - New Weekly Standard cover, "Thinking the Unthinkable: James W. Ceasar and Oliver Ward on surviving a Trump presidency" - with an illustration of Trump taking the oath of office in front of Justice Roberts while the Obamas look on while scowling http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=581dc5fc28b8983cce0b99c64f88e96fca24da445496427bc13bb17a9b309497

 

IF YOU READ ONLY ONE THING ... DAVID BROOKS, "If Not Trump, What? How to heal a crisis of solidarity": "[T]he leaders of the Republican Party are ... going down meekly and hoping for a quiet convention. They seem blithely unaware that this is a Joe McCarthy moment. People will be judged by where they stood at this time. Those who walked with Trump will be tainted forever after for the degradation of standards and the general election slaughter.

"The better course for all of us - Republican, Democrat and independent - is to step back and take the long view, and to begin building for that. This election - not only the Trump phenomenon but the rise of Bernie Sanders, also - has reminded us how much pain there is in this country. According to a Pew Research poll, 75 percent of Trump voters say that life has gotten worse for people like them over the last half century.

"This declinism intertwines with other horrible social statistics. The suicide rate has surged to a 30-year high - a sure sign of rampant social isolation. A record number of Americans believe the American dream is out of reach. And for millennials, social trust is at historic lows. Trump's success grew out of that pain, but he is not the right response to it. ... 

"We'll probably need a new national story. Up until now, America's story has been some version of the rags-to-riches story ... I don't know what the new national story will be, but maybe it will be less individualistic and more redemptive. ... We'll probably need a new definition of masculinity, too. ... The traditional masculine ideal isn't working anymore. It leads to high dropout rates, high incarceration rates, low labor force participation rates. This is an economy that rewards emotional connection and verbal expressiveness. ...

"We'll also need to rebuild the sense that we're all in this together. ... Maybe the task is to build a ladder of hope. ... Trump will have his gruesome moment. The time is best spent elsewhere, meeting the neighbors who have become strangers, and listening to what they have to say." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=581dc5fc28b8983c0fe0859b4eb2bf1370b3431b603b4d40c944e8e29b6a43ca

DATA DU JOUR -- "Poll: GOP disapproval highest since 1992," by Brianna Gurciullo: "Sixty-two percent of Americans have an unfavorable impression of the GOP compared to 33 percent who view the party favorably, according to a Pew Research Center study ... Democratic Party ... stayed about the same: 45 percent view the party favorably and 50 percent unfavorably. ...

WHAT HERBIE ZISKEND IS READING -- "Passover Seder: One last time for an Obama White House tradition," by WashPost's Juliet Eilperin: "The Passover Seder that the Obamas hosted Thursday night at the White House had many of the hallmarks that have defined it for years - the Maxwell House Haggadahs, the glass kiddush cup the first lady received in 2009 from a rabbi in Prague and bottles of Manischewitz wine. What began as a hastily arranged holiday observance in the basement of a Sheraton hotel in Harrisburg, Pa., in 2008 has become a White House tradition. But this Seder was the last one of Obama's presidency. ... They still use the 1930s-era coffee maker's Haggadah, even though plenty of
 people have suggested that they use something fancier or more politically correct." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=581dc5fc28b8983c09dad22719d2c00d83a9fe6a3dacfe5e2cbbcdcf1b2ca038 ...

He had been elected Yellowstone County Commissioner only two years before winning his Senate seat, where for 18 years, he became a powerful lawmaker. ... Prone to chewing tobacco and occasionally picking his teeth with his pocket knife, Burns stuck out in the Senate." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=581dc5fc28b8983c5150e7e4811633cb4be26ff431c30e3c4e487b1b08d58690

Those who walked with Trump will be tainted forever after for the degradation of standards and the general election slaughter.</p><p><b>&quot;The better course for all of us
</b> - Republican, Democrat and independent - is to step back and take the long view, and to begin building for that. This election - not only the Trump phenomenon but the rise of Bernie Sanders, also - has reminded us how much pain there is in this country. According to a Pew Research poll, 75 percent of Trump voters say that life has gotten worse for people like them over the last half century.</p><p><b>&quot;This declinism intertwines
</b> with other horrible social statistics. The suicide rate has surged to a 30-year high - a sure sign of rampant social isolation. A record number of Americans believe the American dream is out of reach. And for millennials, social trust is at historic lows. Trump's success grew out of that pain, but he is not the right response to it. ... </p><p><b>&quot;We'll probably need a new national story.
</b> Up until now, America's story has been some version of the rags-to-riches story ... I don't know what the new national story will be, but maybe it will be less individualistic and more redemptive. ... We'll probably need a new definition of masculinity, too. ...

</b>&quot;The Passover Seder that the Obamas hosted Thursday night at the White House had many of the hallmarks that have defined it for years - the Maxwell House Haggadahs, the glass kiddush cup the first lady received in 2009 from a rabbi in Prague and bottles of Manischewitz wine. What began as a hastily arranged holiday observance in the basement of a Sheraton hotel in Harrisburg, Pa., in 2008 has become a White House tradition. But this Seder was the last one of Obama's presidency. ... They still use the 1930s-era coffee maker's Haggadah, even though plenty of people have suggested that they use something fancier or more politically correct.&quot;
