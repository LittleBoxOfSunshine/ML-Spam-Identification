Was working on my own translation, but via Brooklyn:


Univision Al Punto con Jorge Ramos: Alicia Machado interview on negative experiences with Donald Trump after winning the Miss Universe contest, 5.22.16


**Ramos mentions HRC tweeting at Machado and Machado tweeting back. Also, flagging Machado's harshest statement against Trump:

Machado says "he's going to make the border a concentration camp, we're going to go back to the Holocaust again. Where are we going to go?"


Notes and rough translation of interview:


-- Jorge Ramos intro: what would happen if Trump became president? This week a new Fox poll shows Trump beating HRC by 3pts for the first time. How would he lead, how would he treat women? Alicia Machado knew him after she was crowned Miss Universe in 1996; afterwards she had an encounter with Trump that was reported in the NYT last week. She's here with us.


-- Ramos asks about her interactions with Trump after she was crowned Miss Universe in 1996 when she was 18 years old; says the NYT report says she gained weight after she won. Machado says she wants to take this opportunity to speak to the Latino community to say that what's happened to her is something she hasn't sought out but which has come to her, since the NYT came to her and included her in a story with various women that have had experiences near Trump and each one has told her story.


-- Ramos asks how Trump treated her. Machado says he treated her horribly ("fatal"). Says it's something that she's been speaking about for 20 years in terms of how he treated her, how she suffered, and how it affected her as a person. She says she went through lots of psychological abuse.


-- Ramos shows the video of Machado getting to the gym and seeing tons of press there. Machado says she had no idea they'd be there and that what happened would happen. Says that she stands by what she's saying about Trump and that there's proof of everything she says. She says that this incident at the gym happened 6 or 7 months after she won the contest so she didn't gain weight immediately after she won the competition. Says that that year she also won the best body in Miss Universe. She asked the company for help because she had gained weight and didn't like it or feel good so she asked them for a nutritionist to help her get back in shape. They said they'd figure it out, then called her and told her she was going to NY the next day; she gets to the hotel and is told she'd go to the gym the next day to be with a trainer. When she gets to the gym she sees "the whole circus" and told Trump she didn't want to do it and was ashamed. Says that Trump said that he didn't care, he told her "I pay you for this, smile."


-- Ramos says she has a big social media presence, someone asked her why she waited for so long to speak out. Machado says because Trump had never run for president before and he won't be leading a casino but would be leading a big and important nation. Says that now after going through this emotional harm that still hurts to think about she can speak out without fear. Ramos reads her tweet saying that she never imagined that he could run for president and because when she was 18 she was scared.


-- Ramos asks her about feeling scared at that time. Machado says she was very scared of Trump, "of course." Says she was 18 years old and coming to a new city, and she also didn't come from a rich family that could protect her from such a powerful man. Says she's asking the community that can vote in these elections to remember that this country and the world doesn't need just a businessman to be president. Says we also need a good person with a good heart, and "I'm totally 100% percent convinced that Donald Trump isn't a person with a good heart."


-- Ramos asks about how she is about to become a US citizen. Machado says she wants to vote and have the moral authority to be able to fight for the country. Says that she's already forgiven Trump for that incident and other things that happened in the course of that year. Ramos asks what she saw in the way that Trump treated other contestants and people. Machado says she speaks of her own experiences but what she lived through was very unpleasant and humiliating. Says Trump is "a despot, a cold man, a calculating man, a man with very little consideration for the people he considers inferior."


-- Ramos asks about him calling her Miss Piggy. Machado says, "he called me Miss Piggy, Miss Housekeeping -- he called me Eating Machine. And I argued with him and said that no that I'm Latina, and that I have a little more everywhere." Ramos asks if she considered it an insult at that time. Machado says of course, says it was also the way he said it; says it's not just what he said but how he said it.


-- Ramos asks what she thinks he'd be like if he became president. Machado says it'd be a disgrace because this is a country with many interests and many people that have a say so they won't just let him do whatever he wants. Says this is very personal for her, says she's doing this for her daughter. Says she's been very happy in the US and has had great experiences with Americans, whom she says are very generous, and says that the country doesn't deserve a man like this. Says that though Trump keeps winning however much he has in certain states, he doesn't represent Americans that are good people, of which there are many.


-- Ramos asks if she feels an obligation to speak out in the campaign. HRC tweeted at her saying "congratulations on becoming a US citizen. Enjoy casting that vote." and she responded, "thank you for this and please support us Latina mothers." Machado says that she founded an organization called Mamis Solas where she tries to help single mothers like herself. Says there are many mothers raising children alone because their partners have been deported or killed from the violence in our countries. Says that single mothers are still singled out or judged. Says Pres. Obama has done many things to help single mothers that she's benefited from, even though she's fortunate to not need many of them because of her work, but not all women are so lucky. Says Trump has said he'll take away programs to help women and the things that Pres. Obama has done, he will deport children born here and build a wall on the southern border. Machado says "he's going to make the border a concentration camp, we're going to go back to the Holocaust again. Where are we going to go?" Says she thinks that Trump will advocate only for his own interests to make more money.


-- Ramos asks about the other projects she's working on. Machado says she's in LA and has finished 3 movies, says she's working as a producer and is going to go to college to study production with scholarships she's won that Pres. Obama created. Says Latinos need to unite here in the US. Says she's still scared because Trump is a powerful man but it's been 20 years and she's a strong, working woman and she has the support of many people so she can speak out about this now.
