Gentlemen,

I'm encouraging a phone call next week.
There has been some shift in leadership and I'd like for us to be aligned o=
n next steps.
After seeing a few emails, I'm not sure that we are all on the same page.

I'm going to have LaQueenia send out some options for next week.
Hopefully we can all get on the phone and reenergize this event.

Rob
