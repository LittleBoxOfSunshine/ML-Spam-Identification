The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friends-

In complete candor, I cannot think of a single presidential election in my =
lifetime (and yes, I was born after the Johnson-Goldwater race) when it was=
 more important for us to defeat the Republican nominee for president.  Not=
 only are women insulted and denigrated by the other party's nominee on an =
almost daily basis, but our more than two-century old system of constitutio=
nal checks, balances and compromise is very much at risk.=20

Accordingly, please join me and special guests Tina Tchen and noted women's=
 rights attorney Gloria Allred on May 31st at 7:00 p.m. for dinner to help =
raise awareness for critical DNC efforts to make sure, for the sake of ours=
elves and of our children, that the arc of history keeps bending toward jus=
tice.=20

Please see the formal invitation below.

My very best regards,

Robbie
