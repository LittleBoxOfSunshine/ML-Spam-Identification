He got three questions about it.


Primaries are hard-fought. There seems to be a different flavor. There is violence, disenfranchisement, and one of the campaigns aren't addressing that. IS POTUS trying to mediate or resolve or will he wait until the candidates fight it out amongst themselves?



JE: The part of the primaries typically are, especially one that is as passionate as this one is. One of the lessons of the 2008 election is to not confuse the passion in the primary for disinterest in the general election. I think if anything the reason why people are so passionate about the current primary process is because they understand the stakes in the general election. That was true in 2008 and we will see if it is true in 2016. I am confident that POTUS's engagement in the general would be useful in sharpening up that case. He looks forward to the opportunity to do it. He also benefitted personally in the 2007 primary. Yes, things are different (like the debate process), but things are as intense as they were from 2008. Good story to write about what was happening eight years ago.


Are you concerned about violence, like the riots there were in 1968?



JE: No, that is not a concern.



You said earlier that there is a lot of passion in any process, but it seems to me that we are beyond that. A lot of Sanders supporters believe that the primary process is rigged against him and the integrity of the process is being question. The Nevada situation aside, does POTUS believe that the primary process is being followed and is fair?



JE: I haven't closely looked at the rules and I can say that the WH believes in the integrity of the DNC and their commitment to the fair implementation of the rules. I know that they are working with state parties all across the nation to ensure that the delegate selection plans are fair and transparent, so that state delegates can be chosen to the national convention. The other thing that you asked that occurs to me that helps put in stark relief, the intensity of the campaign in 2008 and the impact that that could have had on the election in 2008, there were not an insignificant number of Democrats in May of 2008 that were saying publically that they were prepared to organized and raise money in support of the GOP presidential nominee. There were questions that there could be Democrats for McCain movement that could tip the scale of the election. For all of the passion and furiosity and competitiveness of the democratic primary in 2016 I haven't read any public account of that happening in this general election.
