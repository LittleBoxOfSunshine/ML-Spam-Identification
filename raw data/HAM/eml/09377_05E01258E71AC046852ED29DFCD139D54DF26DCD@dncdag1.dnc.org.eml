SL: DNC Statement on Trump Tearing Up Dodd-Frank Financial Reforms

DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda issued the following statement on news that Donald Trump plans [insert link] "to release a detailed policy platform in two weeks that would propose dismantling nearly all of Dodd-Frank, a package of financial reforms put in place after the 2007-2009 financial crisis":

"His plans to tear up the most important financial reforms in decades is further proof that Donald Trump and his dangerous ideas shouldn't step foot in the White House. Hard-working American families simply cannot afford to take Donald Trump's advice on the economy or have critical protections gutted to benefit those at the very top."
