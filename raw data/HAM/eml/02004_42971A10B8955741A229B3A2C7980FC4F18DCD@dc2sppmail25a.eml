Scott,

One additional edit. Let's remove the word round table on page 2 at the top=
 ("$33,400 - Round table discussion guest").  As you know, WH policy restri=
cts the use of language that gives the appearance that contributors can pay=
 for policy access to the President.

Thanks,
Ruthzee
