Donald Trump Thinks Men Who Change Diapers Are Acting =93Like The Wife=94<h=
ttps://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-thinks-men-who-change-=
diapers-are-acting-like-t#.mdlEMA9aw>
Buzzfeed =96 Andrew Kaczynski and Megan Apper

=93Do you actually change diapers?=94 host Anthony Cumia asked Donald Trump=
 on the Opie and Anthony show in November of 2005.

The then 59-year-old businessman, whose wife Melania was pregnant with his =
fifth child and her first, responded bluntly: =93No, I don=92t do that.=94

=93There=92s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like=
 the wife and you know there=92s a lot of husbands that listen to that,=94 =
Trump added. =93So you know, they go for it.=94

=93If I had different type of wife,=94 Trump said laughing, =93I probably w=
ouldn=92t have a baby, ya know, cause that=92s not my thing. I=92m really l=
ike a great father but certain things you do and certain things you don=92t=
. It=92s just not for me.=94

The interview =97 one of many reviewed by BuzzFeed News =97 reveals a man w=
ith an extremely traditional view on the responsibilities a man and a woman=
 have when raising a family. That view has already come under attack by an =
anti-Trump group, with one of his comments in a 2005 Howard Stern interview=
 appearing in ad from the super PAC Our Principles.

=93I mean, I won=92t do anything to take care of them. I=92ll supply funds =
and she=92ll take care of the kids. It=92s not like I=92m gonna be walking =
the kids down Central Park,=94 Trump said in the interview. He repeated the=
 same sentiment to Stern two years laters, saying, =93Melania is a wonderfu=
l mother. She takes care of the baby and I pay all of the costs.=94

Trump=92s five children =97 Ivanka, Eric, Donald, Tiffany, and Barron =97 h=
ave been a highly visible part of his presidential bid and have all publicl=
y praised their father as a parent. But Trump himself has described himself=
 as hands off, and, in the same 2005 interview with Howard Stern, expressed=
 disdain for his ex-wife Marla Maples for suggesting he walk their daughter=
, Tiffany, down the street.

=93Well, Marla used to say, =91I can=92t believe you=92re not walking Tiffa=
ny down the street,=92 you know in a carriage,=94 Trump said. =93Right, I=
=92m gonna be walking down Fifth Avenue with a baby in a carriage. It just =
didn=92t work.=94

Trump added of his current wife, Melania: =93She would take great care of t=
he child without me having to do very much.=94

And in 2007, again in an interview with Stern, Trump, asked if he stays hom=
e with his infant son Barron, admitted that hands-on parenting has never be=
en his =93thing.=94

=93It probably should but it never has,=94 replied Trump.

Here is Trump in his own words:

Trump in April of 2005 said on the Howard Stern Show that he would simply s=
upply the funds and wouldn=92t do anything to care for his children.

In another interview Howard Stern interview, Trump recalled how he was shoc=
ked to learn that his second wife, Marla Maples, was pregnant.

w.soundcloud.com
In a 2003 appearance on the Howard Stern Show, Trump said he married Maples=
 because she got pregnant with their daughter, Tiffany.
=93At the time it was like, =91Excuse me, what happened?=94 Trump said he s=
aid to Maples when learning about the pregnancy. =93And then I said, =91Wel=
l, what are we going to do about this?=92=94
=93She said, =91Oh, are you serious? This is the most beautiful day of our =
lives,=92=94 Trump said Maples responded.
=93I said, =91Oh great.=92 So I said, =91Do you want to get married?=92=94
In 2006, Trump said men who change diapers and care for the child are actin=
g =93like the wife,=94 saying he wouldn=92t have kids with a woman who want=
ed him to do this.

w.soundcloud.com
Speaking with Howard Stern in 2007, Trump called Melania a wonderful mother=
 for taking care of their baby while he paid all of the costs.

w.soundcloud.com
Stern also asked how Trump=92s daughter, Tiffany, was doing.
=93I do see her and she=92s a great kid,=94 Trump said.
=93She comes to town, visits a little bit,=94 Stern asked.
=93You know for about an hour, =91hi dad,=92 =91hi Tiff, I love you Tiff.=
=92 She=92s a great kid,=94 says Trump laughing, saying he =93glances=94 at=
 her report cards. Trump said he would give Tiffany a future job at the Tru=
mp Organization if she had good abilities.
