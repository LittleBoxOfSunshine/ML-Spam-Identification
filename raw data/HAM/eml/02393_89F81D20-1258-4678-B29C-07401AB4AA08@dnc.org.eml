Stephen-

Hope all is well.

White House just told us that we will probably have POTUS in Miami for a dinner on Friday, June 3.

I have a call in to Noreen about hosting us on that date.

I will be in touch in the morning with more details/confirmation once we have it.

Looking forward to another successful Miami event!
