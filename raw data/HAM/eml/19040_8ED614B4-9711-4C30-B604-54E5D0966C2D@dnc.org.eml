Please make sure your teams copy Ryan on any requests for talking points or remarks. He is responsible for handling that work flow for the Chair's Office and the Comms department. Also remind them it is better to put the request in then to have DWS wing it. Even if she doesn't use them talking points and remarks help guide her thoughts and get her focused when she's running between 20 different events. Thanks all.
