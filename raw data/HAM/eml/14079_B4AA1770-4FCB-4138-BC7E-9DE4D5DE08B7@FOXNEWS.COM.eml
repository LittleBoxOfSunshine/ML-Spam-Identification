Folks,

Any word from the Chair? I'd been hoping to send the invite letters to cand=
idates today, although I suppose I could wait until tomorrow.

Lemme know.

Thank you!

Subject: Luis -- would you mind forwarding this to the Chair? Many thanks.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz
Chair, Democratic National Committee
Washington, DC

Dear Ms. Schultz:

First of all, thank you for granting interviews in recent weeks to Fox News=
 journalists, particularly Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace. As yo=
u know, these are the anchors who were widely praised - by Democrats and Re=
publicans alike - for their fair but rigorous questioning in a series of GO=
P presidential primary debates dating back to August in Cleveland, the very=
 first debate of the 2016 cycle.

Would you be amenable to those same respected journalists now bringing that=
 same fairness and rigor to a final debate of the 2016 cycle? Fox would ver=
y much like your blessing to host a Democratic presidential primary debate =
before the last batch of states hold their elections on June 7. We propose =
that it be in California, the largest state in the union, since there has n=
ot been a Democratic debate there this cycle.

Given that the race is still contested, and given that you sanctioned a fin=
al trio of debates, the last of which has not yet been held, we believe a f=
inal debate would be an excellent opportunity for the candidates to, as you=
 said when you announced these debates, "share Democrats' vision for the co=
untry."

As part of this final debate, we invite you to take some time to speak dire=
ctly to the nation through the cameras of Fox News. You could use this time=
 to make whatever remarks you like, perhaps as a way of bringing closure to=
 this long and robust primary process. These remarks could be taped or live=
.

Also, at the risk of pushing our luck, we would very much like to interview=
 you on Fox before and/or after the debate. As Chair of the party, your ins=
ights would be most instructive to our considerable audience. Perhaps you c=
ould also recommend other Democratic officials who might be featured as par=
t of our extensive coverage both before and after the debate.

Fox has not hosted a Democratic debate in 12 years. By ending that dry spel=
l, I believe the Democratic candidates could reach a vast audience on the e=
ve of the shift to the general election.

Thanks so much for considering this request. And please know that you are a=
lways welcome at Fox.

Sincerely,

Bill Sammon
Vice President of News
Washington Managing Editor
