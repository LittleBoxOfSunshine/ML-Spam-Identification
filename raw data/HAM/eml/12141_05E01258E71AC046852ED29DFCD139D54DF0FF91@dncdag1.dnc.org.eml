I agree on the first two, which should be one hit. They shouldn't be separate hits. 

Good on separate hit MccAin with DSCC ok.

-trump response on taxes on this week.
-trump doesn't think outsourcing clothing manufacturing to other countries undermines his argument that American companies shouldn't outsource jobs. Also on this week.
-we also have to send out mccain release if DS approves, and the WaPo worst week in Washington.

Now -These are just my recommendations.  I don't have signoff power so mark and Luis please determine if you want responses to these things.

Then - it's Pablo's weekend, so it is his responsibility to draft the content. Then Mark or Luis approves, then Pablo blasts. From dncpress, not personal account.
