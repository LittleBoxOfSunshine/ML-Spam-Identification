Conservative showdown<http://qctimes.com/news/opinion/editorial/conservativ=

Quad City Times // Editorial Board
Just last week, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence invited a handful of religious cons=
ervatives to a private signing of his Religious Freedoms bill, a vague appe=
al to religious exclusionists aligned with anti-gay initiatives. The bill f=
lew through Indiana's Republican-controlled legislature. Just five Republic=
ans voted against it. ...So the Indiana governor's socially conservative ta=
ctic didn't just backfire. It ignited a war between Indiana's traditional c=
onservatives and the tea party wing Pence helped bring to power.

Dubuque Telegraph Herald // Editorial Board
That Indiana is facing a firestorm of criticism and protest over last week'=
s enactment of a so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act may not say as=
 much about the Hoosier state as Americans' shifting attitudes over gay mar=
riage and LGBT issues...There has been significant movement over the past f=
ew years regarding Americans` attitudes toward gay marriage and other LGBT =
issues. The pendulum has swiftly swung away from discrimination. Owners of =
businesses have no better reason for refusing to sell a gay couple flowers =
or a cake for their wedding than their ancestors did for refusing to serve =
blacks at lunch counters and hotels 50 (or fewer) years ago. Providing a pr=
oduct or service to a LGBT customer is not an endorsement of the customer`s=
 lifestyle. The customer wants to buy flowers or photographs, not drag the =
business owner to church or a gay-pride parade.

Iowa State Daily // Editorial
Indiana took a big step backward in civil rights on Thursday when Gov. Mike=
 Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law. The new law w=
ill allow Indiana businesses to legally refuse services to people who are g=
ay. This is the first bill to become law under a movement of states that ha=
ve legislation moving through the state legislatures to "protect religious =
freedoms."...Those who worry that the vague nature of the law's language wi=
ll create a gray area that facilitates discrimination have more than enough=
 reason for concern, especially because the law itself is a nearly textbook=
 example or dictionary definition of discrimination.

Nashua Telegraph // Editorial
The uproar in Indiana will probably put an end to talk about Mike Pence as =
a possible presidential candidate - he made a test-the-waters visit to New =
Hampshire in the fall - but more importantly, it should serve as a lesson t=
o those who favor greater religious protections. The way to achieve it is n=
ot by discriminating against others. Anyone with even a passing familiarity=
 with religious history should know that.

Discrimination bill is indefensible<http://www.ledgertranscript.com/home/16=
336697-95/discrimination-bill-is-indefensible>
Monadnock Ledger-Transcript // Editorial
Big businesses have already threatened to pull their money and events out o=
f the Hoosier state. Several states, including New York and Connecticut, ha=
ve banned state-funded travel to Indiana in the wake of the bill's signing.=
 But there are a vocal few who have made their support of Gov. Pence and th=
e bill quite clear: the majority of the perceived frontrunners for the 2016=
 Republican presidential nomination. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush fired=
 up the bandwagon, and was quickly joined on his ride by Senator Ted Cruz o=
f Texas and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, all of whom defended Gov. Pence=
 in lockstep....These politicians need to be held accountable for their sta=
nce on this issue, and when voters and media members have their chance to q=
uestion the potential nominees, we hope they won't have forgotten this miss=
tep. Discrimination under any guise is just plain wrong, and it's hard to i=
magine electing someone for any position who feels otherwise.
