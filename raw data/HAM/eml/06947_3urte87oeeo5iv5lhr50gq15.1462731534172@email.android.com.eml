DNC Statement on Republican Senator Admitting Senate Republicans Should do =
Their Job on Supreme Court

WASHINGTON - DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following s=
tatement on Senator Jeff Flake's comments on Meet the Press today that if R=
epublicans lose the presidential election they "ought to approve [Judge Gar=
land] quickly:"

"Senator Flake's comments today are a reminder that Republicans are playing=
 political games with the Supreme Court. Judge Garland is the most qualifie=
d nominee in America's history and as the Constitution requires, he should =
get a fair hearing and a vote. That the GOP has nominated a reckless and da=
ngerous candidate in Donald Trump who lacks the temperament and judgment to=
 serve -- much less appoint a Supreme Court Justice -- should be enough for=
 republicans in the Senate to do their job now, not wait till November."
