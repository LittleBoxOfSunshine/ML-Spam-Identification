Hey guys -

I interviewed Nina Turner on Friday for a story that didn't end up coming
together, but my editors have asked me to go ahead and blog some of her
remarks.

Turner was highly critical of the DNC and wants an apology from Debbie
Wasserman Schultz for how she's handled the nominating process.

It will run tomorrow so wanted to give you an opportunity to respond.

Among the the things she said:

1) It will be difficult for the party to unify around the nominee because
the DNC has mistreated Sanders from the start, first with the debate
schedule, then with the data abase controversy, and now accusing them of
violence when there was no evidence of violence at the Nevada convention.

She says Wasserman Schultz jumped the gun in blaming Nevada on Sanders
without reaching out to the campaign or investigating what happened.

2) Debbie Wasserman Schultz should apologize to the Sanders campaign for
making this "an unfair fight" if she wants the party to unify in the fall.
Thanks,
