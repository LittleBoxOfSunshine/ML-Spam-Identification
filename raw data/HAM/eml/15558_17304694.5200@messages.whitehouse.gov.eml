>
> Guests are being announced as they walk through Booksellers, past tall =
vases fashioned of ice filled with masses of flowers. We can hear strains=
 of string music.
>
> Some guests stopping to talk to reporters have connection to Nordic nat=
ions. Will Ferrell and his wife, Vivica Paulen, for example--she was born=
 in Sweden and the couple visits frequently.
> Ferrell says it's their first White House dinner. "I hope we don't do a=
nything wrong."
> Actor Joel Kinnaman is Swedish American, and says he wants Americans to=
 know "we are a friendly country,well-educated and strong bearers of demo=
cracy in the world."
>
> Others, though, seem to be here by chance--or because of their relation=
ship with the Obamas. "I honestly don't know," answers actress Connie Bri=
tton when asked if she has a Nordic connection. She noted she had been to=
 the White House egg roll and the White House correspondents association =
dinner. "I'm a groupie at this point."
>
> "I'm here to see my First Lady," says tux-wearing Janelle Monae.

> Rapper Common said it was his first visit to the White House when he wa=
sn't performing, so he could enjoy it more. "I'm looking forward to the u=
