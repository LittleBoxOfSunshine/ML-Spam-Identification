Hi Zach,

First of all =E2=80=94 thx for letting me know.  Neither Ruth not I have ye=
t given
to the DNC as you sorta know (unless I had given behind your back, which I
did not).  I assume this makes us eligible for up to six guests (for our
collective $66,800).  Correct?

Will there be personal photos, or =E2=80=9Caudience photos?=E2=80=9D  Once,=
 at a Spike Lee
home event (just 30-40 people) there were no staged photos with the Prez).
I want to know what to say to my potential attendees (any who might want to
hold out for the other type of photo)

I=E2=80=99m going to go ahead and proffer several invites (indeed 6 =E2=80=
=94 can=E2=80=99t see why
it would be less) tonight.  Please assume (if you can =E2=80=94 for 24-36 h=
ours and
slightly pending your answers to my questions) that I will want 6 seats at
$10K a crack and will pay (between me and Ruth $66,800 for them).

I hope you and Ruth are well. I wanted to let you know, per our phone call,
that President Obama will be in NYC on June 8th for an event for the DNC  -
invitation for which is attached. It's a 60-70 person dinner ($10,000 per
person), so not sure it fits what you had in mind, but did want to make you
at least aware.


My best,
Zach
