Good Morning Everybody,

I am just checking in again about a confirmation for DNC Chair/ 
Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz for May 12.

I'm sensitive to the fact that we are in the middle of a presidential 
election and her time is limited.

But I would like to know fairly quickly because I need to get the promos 
in place for all our affiliates all over the country.

We put a lot of effort into marketing our interviews.

I appreciate your time.

Thanks,

Brad

                    ----<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    Dear Mr. Banfill,<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    My name is Brad Polisuk and I am a producer for the
                    nationally syndicated The Costa Report featuring
                    Rebecca Costa, broadcast from KSCO studios in Santa
                    Cruz, California, one of the last independently
                    owned radio stations in the US.<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    The Costa Report is a post-partisan human affairs
                    show with an audience of over 2 million people with
                    over 250,000 followers on social media.<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    I am pitching this to you because Rebecca Costa is
                    interested in doing an interview with Congresswoman
                    Wasserman-Schultz that isn't particularly partisan
                    or political in nature but to appeal to our higher
                    angels as Americans in terms of our love for civic
                    duty and commitment to public service.<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    I am sure the Congresswoman would like to do an
                    interview where she is not either on the offensive
                    or defensive as chair of the DNC or as a political
                    candidate.<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    Put simply, it won't be a hostile interview but more
                    of an interview that focuses on what can we do as a
                    country together, regardless if Hillary Clinton or
                    Donald Trump becomes president or if Congress stays
                    the same or changes hands.<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    Also, to be blunt, we would love to have more
                    Democrats in Congress on the program.<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    You can hear recordings of past work here: <a moz-do-not-send="true" class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.rebeccacosta.com/the-costa-report.htm"><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.rebeccacosta.com/the-costa-report.htm">http://www.rebeccacosta.com/the-costa-report.htm</a></a>
                    &nbsp;You will see that we have had on major players on
                    before.<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    I have May 12 open right now, which is right before
                    the California primary. It would be an opportune
                    time for her to be on and reach out to a talk radio
                    audience that would open to another perspective on
                    the Congresswoman's life and career.<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    There are a few options for a phone interview:<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    1. Live interview scheduled in between 2:00 - 3:00
                    pm (Pacific Time) with various breaks in between.<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    2. A recorded interview between 9:00 - 10:00 am
                    (Pacific Time).<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    3. A recorded interview between 10:00 - 11:00 am
                    (Pacific Time).<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    Also, I would like to develop a long-term
                    relationship with her so we can feature more
                    Democrats on the program but more from a public
                    servant perspective with an agenda to move forward
                    and get things done.<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    If this interests you and Congresswoman
                    Wasserman-Schultz, please let me know as soon as you
                    can. &nbsp;Thanks for your time.<br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    <br class="">
                    Sincerely,<br class="">
