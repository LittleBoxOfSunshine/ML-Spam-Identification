> Lindsey, I think you asked for a proposal for Nick - please find it =
attached.


> Nick has been with our team for a year exactly this May. In the summer =
of 2015, Nick helped developed our new National Finance Committee list. =
At the end of that summer, Nick worked with our LGBT Director to plan =
and execute the LGBT Gala. Nick assisted with the money tracking, =
tagging, vitals, and other logisitical tasks. Throughout the fall, Nick =
assisted our regional finance directors primarily on two major events: =
the WLF Conference and our event with the President in Potomac, =
Maryland. Throughout the year, he has also kept the LGBT money tracker =
and assisted the LGBT Director with a variety of Finance events. Nick =
also regularly assists with several regional and council projects and =
works with the PAC Finance Firector to keep the PAC money tracker.
> Given Nick=E2=80=99s extensive involvement with and knowledge of the =
Finance Department, we believe he would be an excellent addition to our =
team. Although he is still in school and cannot be formally hired, he =
works in the office five days a week and should, therefore, receive a =
weekly stipend for food and transportation.
