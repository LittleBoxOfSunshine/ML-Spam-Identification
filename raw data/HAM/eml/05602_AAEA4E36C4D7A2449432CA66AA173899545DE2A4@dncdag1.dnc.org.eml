By Ed O'Keefe and Karen Tumulty April 28 at 11:43 AM

As Sen. Ted Cruz was addressing the Indiana Republican Party=92s spring din=
ner last Thursday night, his father was on a secret mission to Puerto Rico.

Rafael Cruz, a pastor who is one of his son=92s most popular surrogates, wa=
s meeting privately at a home in Dorado with some of the island=92s 23 Repu=
blican convention delegates =97 all of whom are still bound to a candidate =
who got out of the race more than a month ago.

That=92s Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). His presidential campaign may be over, =
but his potential to keep the GOP nomination from going to Donald Trump liv=
es on.

That=92s because Rubio =97 berated on the campaign trail by Trump as =93Lit=
tle Marco=94 =97 still has scores of convention delegates who are required =
to vote for him on the first ballot, and who could go anywhere on the secon=
d and beyond.

Rubio suspended his bid more than a month ago, on the night that he lost hi=
s home state of Florida to Trump.

But =97 in part at the request of Cruz=92s campaign =97 he has done what he=
 can to hang onto the 171 delegates that he won in 21 states and territorie=
s. That is more than Ohio Gov. John Kasich has, even now.

Rubio sent letters to state parties noting that his decision to suspend his=
 campaign should not be interpreted as a release of his delegates. Whether =
they remain bound to him, however, varies according to the rules of individ=
ual states, how they are interpreted by party officials, and the inclinatio=
ns of GOP leaders in those states.

The best estimates now suggest that Rubio can count on at least 50 delegate=
 votes on the first ballot and may have to relinquish somewhere between 30 =
and 40. The remainder =97 as many as 81 =97 are somewhere in limbo.

Rubio=92s delegates could be crucial, should Trump fall short of the 1,237 =
delegates that he needs to take the nomination on the first ballot.

They also give him leverage, although those close to Rubio says that he is =
not sure what he would do with it.

=93It=92s about keeping doors open =97 to step through and do what, who kno=
ws?=94 said one adviser, who asked for anonymity because the topic is a sen=
sitive one.

Rubio declined a request for an interview.

He has insisted that he has no interest in being someone else=92s pick for =
vice president, or in putting his name back in the presidential mix, should=
 the convention reach a deadlock.

Asked by Univision in a weekend interview about his plans for his delegates=
, Rubio said in Spanish: =93What I want to see at the convention is for the=
 party to name someone as a candidate who is conservative and who can win. =
That, and if my delegates can have a role, can play a role in reaching that=
 goal, we=92re probably open to that, but we haven=92t reached that point y=
et.=94

=93I really don=92t have secret or comprehensive plans about what I=92m goi=
ng to do at the convention,=94 the Florida senator added. =93We=92re just k=
eeping those options open in order to be able to contribute in a positive w=
ay to the party naming a candidate who is conservative and can win.=94

Meanwhile, his delegates have their own ideas about how they might use thei=
r clout.

Puerto Rico=92s, for instance, plan to vote on the first ballot for Rubio, =
as their rules require, but say their support in later ones would hinge on =
one issue: statehood for their island.

=93Whoever wants our vote needs to pay attention to our particular issues, =
as well as our struggle for equality as U.S. citizens. If that=92s not take=
n into consideration, we could care less what the polls say,=94 said San Ju=
an attorney Elias Sanchez, a delegate who also co-chaired Rubio=92s Puerto =
Rico campaign.

Rubio endorsed statehood, but of the remaining field, only Kasich has. Cruz=
 and Trump have said they support the =93right of self-determination,=94 wh=
ich the delegates say is not enough.

That=92s why last week=92s meeting with Rafael Cruz was appreciated, delega=
tes said, but didn=92t seal the deal for the senator from Texas. Ultimately=
, they plan to vote as a bloc for their second choice, whomever that turns =
out to be.

In Arkansas, other considerations are in play, as state Republicans prepare=
 to gather next month to pick their 40 delegates =97 including nine who wil=
l vote for Rubio on the first ballot.

Bart Hester, an Arkansas state senator, said that he and others who backed =
the Florida senator would like to see his delegate slots filled by seasoned=
 state leaders =97 ideally the governor, lieutenant governor and GOP lawmak=
ers.

=93If we go to a brokered convention, emotions are going to be high. There=
=92s going to be a lot of alternatives,=94 Hester said. =93It=92s about bei=
ng a good steward, to make sure we got people there that have a history of =
making good decisions and being level-headed people. It=92s best for all Re=
publicans involved.=94

Rubio himself does not appear to be exerting much pressure.

In Minnesota, the only state that Rubio won, the senator =93hasn=92t been p=
rescriptive with us at all,=94 said Jeff Johnson, a Hennepin County commiss=
ioner who chaired Rubio=92s campaign and now backs Cruz.

Virginia GOP Chairman John Whitbeck said, =93We haven=92t heard anything ot=
her than that letter=94 from Rubio asking to retain his delegates.

Even without a request from Rubio, Virginia=92s rules require it to cast 16=
 of its 49 votes for Rubio on the first ballot. The same holds true in Minn=
esota, where Rubio won 17 delegates, and Tennessee, where he won nine. And =
Kansas, where he won six.

But after that, Whitbeck said, =93this is all new territory for all of us.=
=94

In D.C., Rubio won 10 delegates but already one of his supporters has annou=
nced her plans for later ballots.

Rina Shah Bharara, who was chosen to vote for Rubio, told Fox News this mon=
th that she will vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton if Trump wins the GOP no=
mination. As if that wasn=92t awkward enough, the local party is investigat=
ing reports that Bharara isn=92t even a District resident.

Bharara didn=92t return requests for comment. But her situation means that =
party leaders likely won=92t be able to decide what to do about Rubio=92s d=
elegates until at least June.

By then, Trump is likely to be the presumptive nominee =97 or in a spot whe=
re Rubio=92s delegates could keep the prize just beyond his grasp.
