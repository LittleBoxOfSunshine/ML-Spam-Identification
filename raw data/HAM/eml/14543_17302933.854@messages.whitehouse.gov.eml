PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20





1:15 P.M. EDT





 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Monday. Before we get star=
ted I wanted to just bring to your attention a statement that was issued =
today by the National Governors Association. So the NGA is a bipartisan o=
rganization that represents governors from across the country. They issue=
d a statement, and I was going to take the liberty of reading it to you.



 So this is a direct quote from the NGA: The nation is on the threshold o=
f a public health emergency as it faces the likely spread of the Zika vir=
us. As with all such emergencies, advanced planning and preparation is es=
sential to prevent injury and death. A key component to averting infectio=
us disease outbreaks is to prevent incident levels from reaching a critic=
al tipping point, after which there is a rapid increase in the number of =
infections. This is particularly true of the Zika virus. The most importa=
nt way we can protect people is to minimize infections and prevent a conc=
entration of cases which can lead to outbreak and children born with seve=
re, lifelong birth defects, such as microcephalis.=20



 As Congress returns from recess today, the nations governors urge the ad=
ministration and Congress to work together to reach agreement on the appr=
opriate funding levels needed to prepare for and combat the Zika virus. W=
e also ask they act as expeditiously as possible to ensure those funds ar=
e available for states, territories and the public at large.



 So this obviously is consistent with the argument that the administratio=
n has been making for more than two months now that given the public heal=
th emergency that exists around the Zika virus, it's critical that Congre=
ss act quickly to provide the necessary funding to our public health prof=
essionals and to states to ensure we can protect the American people. Tha=
t's what the President has been advocating for for quite some time, and w=
e're hopeful that Republicans will drop their opposition and actually wor=
k with Democrats to get this done.



 So with that, Kevin, do you want to get us started today?



 Q Sure, Josh. Thank you. So now that North Carolina has sued to keep in =
place this so-called bathroom law, how will that affect the review that a=
gencies were undertaking that could have limited federal dollars to the s=
tate? Will the administration hold off on those reviews now that theres a=
 lawsuit and let it play out in court?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any change in the posture of that review. =
The position of the North Carolina government has not changed. Theyre ass=
erting that this mean-spirited law is somehow consistent with the Civil R=
ights Act and with our values. The Department of Justice has obviously sp=
oken to its compliance with the law given their enforcement role. So for =
questions about that, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice. And I t=
hink the President has spoken pretty powerfully to the idea that what the=
 state of North Carolina has passed -- in a one-day special session -- is=
 inconsistent with the values of fairness and equality and justice that w=
e hold dear in this country.



 And I think it should be evident from the response from the business com=
munity that what the North Carolina government has done is inconsistent w=
ith the best interests of the people of North Carolina and the economy of=
 North Carolina. That obviously will be something that North Carolina off=
icials will have to deal with, but there has been a reluctance on the par=
t of businesses that had previously committed to expanding the amount of =
business they do in North Carolina from engaging with a government that j=
ust makes it easier to discriminate against their employees and potential=
 customers.



 Q What are the ramifications of Iran test-firing another ballistic missi=
le? And has the nuclear deal and the subsequent lifting of certain sancti=
ons emboldened Iran to undertake these provocations?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, we are aware of Iranian claims of additional b=
allistic -- let me say that again -- we're aware of Iranian claims of an =
additional ballistic missile launch. I would note we're also aware of sta=
tements from the defense minister indicating that such a launch did not t=
ake place. So we're still trying to get to the bottom of what exactly tra=
nspired.



 I think the clearest impact of the successful completion of the internat=
ional agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is we can=
 now verify that Iran has not obtained a nuclear weapon. And in fact, we =
have verified that Iran has taken significant steps to actually roll back=
 their nuclear program. And the worst-case, dire predictions of the deals=
 critics did not at all come to pass. What did come to pass is exactly wh=
at this administration indicated our objectives were, which were to curta=
il Irans nuclear program, guarantee access for international inspectors w=
ho could verify that Irans nuclear program only exist for peaceful purpos=
es.



 Q So last week, you talked about a criticism of the administrations sell=
ing of the Iran deal in the wake of the New York Times profile of Ben Rho=
des as sour grapes. And I wanted to -- hes now written kind of a follow-u=
p -- and I wanted to ask, if that was the case, why has he felt the need =
to explain himself more? And did the President or anyone else at the Whit=
e House ask him to do that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't spoken to the President about this story, s=
o this was not something that was written at the request of the President=
. I think what motivated Ben to discuss this further is that there was an=
 attempt and there has been an attempt by opponents of the Iran deal to s=
uggest that somehow the effort to protect the deal was based solely on sp=
in.



 The fact is, as I just mentioned, we can evaluate the Iran deal now in t=
erms of the impact that it has had on our national security and on Irans =
nuclear program. So we're no longer in a situation in which we have to ar=
gue about what the impact of this agreement will be. We actually now can =
verify what the impact of the agreement is.



 And what is clear is that Iran has eliminated 98 percent of its highly e=
nriched uranium stockpile. Iran has disconnected thousands of centrifuges=
. Iran has essentially rendered harmless its heavy-water plutonium reacto=
r. And Iran has complied with its commitment to give international inspec=
tors widespread access to the country to verify its compliance with the a=
greement.



 Our opponents, and opponents of this deal, had suggested that Iran would=
 never go along with it, that Iran would never implement the terms of the=
 agreement. They were wrong about that. Our critics often suggested that =
there would never be a way to verify Irans claims that they had gone alon=
g with the agreement. They were wrong about that, too. The international =
inspectors at the IAEA have gotten the access that they have needed to ve=
rify Irans compliance with the agreement.



 What our critics have also suggested is that the agreement would open th=
e door to hundreds of billions of dollars in cash for the Iranian economy=
. That has not occurred either. In fact, we actually see some in Iran sug=
gesting that they want -- that they havent gotten as much funding out of =
the deal as they expected.=20



 So the truth is its hard to think of a scenario or a single fact that cr=
itics of this agreement predicted that actually came to pass. In fact, ti=
me and time and time again, almost regardless of which factor you conside=
r, the critics of the deal have been wrong. And I think this is an indica=
tion that our efforts to protect the agreement were rooted firmly in fact=
. And that's the point that Ben wanted to reiterate in the context of his=
 online post today.



 Roberta.



 Q I wanted to ask about the Philippines election. Im curious to know whe=
ther the White House has any reaction to the candidate who appears all bu=
t certain to have won. He has said that he wants multilateral talks to re=
solve the South China Sea disputes -- talks with Japan, Australia, the Un=
ited States, and China. And Im wondering what the White House thinks of t=
hat idea, and whether the White House has any general reaction to his ele=
ction and his campaign.=20



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have a reaction to the election at this point. Well=
 let all the votes be tallied before we weigh in with a specific response=
 to any of the statements that were made by the candidates.



 I can just tell you, in general, that when it comes to resolving the com=
peting claims in the South China Sea, the United States is not a claimant=
 to any of those land features, but we have urged all of the countries th=
at are to resolve their differences through diplomacy and through well-es=
tablished international procedures for doing so.



 We're strongly supportive of that effort because we benefit from the kin=
d of rules-based order that allows the free flow of commerce in that regi=
on of the world, and its obviously in our economic and strategy interest =
for the flow to continue uninterrupted. And any sort of destabilizing act=
ivities there would not be in our interest.=20



 So while we are not a claimant to any of those land features, we do have=
 interest in those differences being resolved through diplomacy and witho=
ut disrupting the broader international order.



 Q So would well-established diplomatic procedures include the possibilit=
y of having multilateral talks?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I havent seen the specific proposal that this one par=
ticular Filipino candidate for president has put forward. But well obviou=
sly wait for the results to come, and then well then have more of a react=
ion to offer in terms of his election and any proposals that that may put=
 on the table.



 Q And just a quick one. This weekend Saudi Arabia named a new oil minist=
er. And Im wondering whether this White House reaction to this key appoin=
tment -- whether the White House is expecting a new era of transparency, =
as this oil minister is younger, or any sort of thoughts about this signi=
ficant change?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have any specific comments in reaction to some poli=
tical changes inside of Saudi Arabia. Obviously, the King and the governm=
ent there are making decisions consistent with their own interests.=20



 I would point out that the new energy minister did make clear that the p=
olitical changes did not signal any significant short-term changes in the=
ir energy policy. But for any developments on that front, Id refer you to=
 his statement and any additional statements that they choose to put out.=




 But obviously the United States continues to consider Saudi Arabia as an=
 important partner in that region of the world. And that certainly was pa=
rt of the reason that President Obama traveled to Saudi Arabia just a cou=
ple of weeks ago and engaged in serious and lengthy consultations with th=
e Saudi government while he was there.



 JC.



 Q Is there any statement you may have on the Presidents thoughts on the =
election of Sadiq Khan as the first Muslim mayor of the city of London?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, JC, obviously, we saw those news reports over the wee=
kend. This is obviously an historic development for a historic city. Obvi=
ously, the political debate inside of the UK and in London is obviously c=
harged with a lot of different issues. And this outcome obviously reflect=
s the will of the people of London and I certainly wouldnt second-guess t=
hem from here. But there is no denying the historical significance of Mr.=
 Khans election.=20



 Q Some see it as a strong get-out-the-vote effort by Pakistani Brits who=
 were very, very -- joined very strongly together to dissuade or discoura=
ge some of the racism that has come up for the last few months in Great B=
ritain and some of the concepts that may exist even in this country. Some=
 are using a parallel there, calling it an interesting one.

=20

 MR. EARNEST: Well, I dont know enough about the election in order to off=
er my own analysis here about what may have motivated the voters of Londo=
n. But obviously this is an historic election.



 April.



 Q Josh, I want to go back to Zika. Has this administration gotten any wo=
rd on the tests for treatment or the status on what's next for those who =
have it, and also on efforts to prevent -- what's the status on what's ha=
ppening?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont have an updated status for you in terms of the work =
that's being done at the CDC and the NIH on a range of diagnostic or vacc=
ine development. What I do know is there our public health professionals =
have indicated that, if given additional resources, that there's more tha=
t they could do to speed up the development of critical diagnostic tools =
and speed up the development of a vaccine. One of the limiting factors is=
 lab capacity, and additional resources could be devoted to expanding lab=
 capacity that would allow for the more effective use of diagnostic tests=
, both in terms of using them more broadly, but also in terms of getting =
a more prompt response to the tests.=20



 The other thing that our public health professionals have indicated is t=
hat we're going to be relying on the private sector to do a lot of the wo=
rk around vaccine development. Particularly when it comes to widespread t=
esting in eventually the manufacturing of a vaccine, we're going to rely =
on the private sector that has resources that it can devote to that effor=
t. But we know that that would require a multiyear commitment on the part=
 of the private sector to produce a vaccine in quantities that are that l=
arge.=20



 So that's why we have made a strong case to the United States Congress t=
hat they dont just need to provide funding expeditiously, as a bipartisan=
 group of governors has indicated, but we also need them to make a longer=
-term commitment to those funds so that the private sector can be confide=
nt about making their own long-term commitment that will be necessary to =
complete the testing and manufacture of a vaccine that could protect the =
American people from Zika.



 So this is an urgent effort that requires a long-term commitment. And th=
ose are two things that Congress isnt very good at. They arent very good =
about acting quickly, and they arent very good about making long-term com=
mitments to things. But for the good of the American people and for the s=
afety of our public health, we need Congress to act quickly to make a lon=
g-term commitment to the resources that our public health professionals n=
eed to keep us safe from the Zika virus.



 Q So you have world health organizations, the CDC, and now the governors=
 and others are saying that this is going to be a pandemic. What are the =
Republicans saying to you or to the President or to leg affairs here, or =
whomever, the reasoning as to why they are not making this an urgent issu=
e right now?



 MR. EARNEST: Frankly, I dont know what good explanation there could be p=
ossibly be.=20



 Q What is the explanation they've given you?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'll leave it to Republicans to make their ow=
n case about what explanation they have for ignoring the advice of our pu=
blic health professionals, ignoring the urging of our public health profe=
ssionals, and not providing much-needed resources to the effort to combat=
 Zika. We know that there are resources that could be used to expand the =
use of diagnostic tests and to accelerate the development of a vaccine. W=
e also know that there are resources that can and should be used to fight=
 mosquitos. This is a mosquito-borne illness. And if we can provide addit=
ional resources to state and local authorities who are trying to fight mo=
squito populations, we can have a positive impact on reducing the spread,=
 or potential spread of this virus.



 So there are common-sense things that Congress can and should be doing t=
o fund the effort to protect the American people from the Zika virus. And=
 for the life of me, I dont think that anybody can offer up a legitimate =
explanation for why they havent taken these common-sense steps that we kn=
ow would enhance the safety and security of the American people.



 Q So what do you say to this Democratic congressional leader who says --=
 they just texted me this -- there's a fear of the GOP looking like they'=
re spending money without making cuts elsewhere, as it relates to funding=
 for Zika?=20



 MR. EARNEST: I dont think the American people are going to think that's =
a very good excuse. When faced with a public health emergency, I dont thi=
nk that the American people are going to have much sympathy for Republica=
ns who are concerned about political criticism from conservative, right-w=
ing ideologues. I dont think that's a very good excuse for not doing your=
 job. And I dont think the American people are going to think that's a le=
gitimate excuse if Republican members of Congress choose to make it in th=
is case.



 Q And lastly, on another subject. Howard, over the weekend -- very power=
ful. How much did the President have input in the speech? It was a strong=
 race speech, I would say. Well, it was -- I would say it was a race spee=
ch. How much input did he have in the speech? And when did he decide that=
 it was going to be more of a race speech? As you said, it was kind of mo=
ving into the future with all the issues and opportunities and obstacles =
that were in front of them, but it was also a huge race speech.



 MR. EARNEST: The President spent a lot of his own time drafting and revi=
sing that speech. And I know that he was working on it as recently as Fri=
day afternoon. So this obviously -- this is a speech that reflected his o=
wn efforts to write and edit and revise the speech in the days leading up=
 to delivering it.



 Q Will there be one more or maybe two more, or however many more of thes=
e kind of speeches before he leaves? Because he is historically the first=
 black President in the United States, and he put out some information th=
at we never heard put in the ways he presented them Saturday.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we got eight months to go, so stay tuned.



 Jon, nice to see you today.

=20

 Q Good to see you, Josh. Just a couple other questions. I know you were =
asked last week on this Ben Rhodes profile. One, the article describes Be=
n as the single-most influential voice shaping American foreign policy, a=
side from the President himself. Is that a characterization that you'd sa=
y is accurate?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, there's no denying that Ben's relationship with the P=
resident and his close work with the President on a range of foreign poli=
cy issues since President Obama was merely a candidate for the Presidency=
 means that the President relies on Ben for a lot of advice. But what's a=
lso true is the President is fortunate to have a team of national securit=
y officials that have a lot of experience working on these issues that th=
e President also relies on.=20



So certainly somebody like the Secretary of State, John Kerry, wields a l=
ot of influence when it comes to this administration's policy and the Pre=
sident's own thinking. The President has for years worked closely with Su=
san Rice -- who's National Security Advisor -- on a range of issues. She =
obviously served at the United Nations representing the United States at =
the United Nations for a number years during the first term. So she is so=
mebody who has had both influential positions, as well as the kind of rel=
ationship with the President that allows her to influence his thinking. O=
bviously somebody like Ash Carter is somebody who has years of experience=
 working at the Pentagon and at the Department of Defense, and he can use=
 that experience to help the President make difficult policy decisions.



So there are many people who plan an influential role in guiding the Pres=
ident's thinking when it comes to a range of foreign policy issues. But B=
en is, by all accounts, I think an influential figure.



Q One of the things he talks about in this article is the foreign policy =
"blob" as something that the President sought to kind of stand against. A=
nd the article says, according to Rhodes, the blob includes Hillary Clint=
on, Robert Gates, and other Iraq war promotors from both parties who now =
whine incessantly about the collapse in American security in Europe and t=
he Middle East. So I'm just wondering on this -- the foreign policy blob =
-- does the White House view that Hillary Clinton is part of that foreign=
 policy blob, or is that just a view of Ben Rhodes?



MR. EARNEST: I will say that I've spent a lot of time with Ben over the y=
ears, but also on a couple of foreign trips with long flights just in the=
 last couple of months. I have not heard him use the term "blob." I'm not=
 suggesting that he's misquoted; I'm just saying I dont know the direct f=
rame of reference in which he used that word.



 Q Do you think Hillary Clinton is part of the foreign policy blob?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not even sure what that means. But obviously, Sec=
retary Clinton is somebody I think I would also put in the category of in=
fluencing the President's thinking and influencing this administration's =
policy --

=20

 Q It's not often we see a major profile of somebody who, in your words a=
t least, is an influential voice in the forming American foreign policy, =
describing Hillary Clinton as something that would -- where the President=
's stands on foreign policy -- a little blob, and whatever you want to us=
e -- it's clearly a derogatory description here coming from one of the Pr=
esident's top foreign policy advisors.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, stepping back from that specific term, I think what i=
s true is that one of the things that the incoming President of the Unite=
d States vowed to do in 2009 was to bring change to Washington, D.C. And =
that was interpreted in a lot of ways -- first, in terms of his commitmen=
t to trying to fight the influence of special interests in Washington. Ce=
rtainly pursuing a different kind of economic policy than the one that wa=
s pursued by the previous administration. But we've also spent a lot of t=
ime over the last seven years -- and you certainly have covered a good ch=
unk of this -- sort of pushing back against the foreign policy establishm=
ent in Washington, D.C. that did support what in hindsight were really ba=
d foreign policy decisions. One of them was to invade Iraq in 2003, somet=
hing that --



 Q Supported by Hillary Clinton.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, something that then State Senator Barack Obama strong=
ly opposed.=20



 So I think the point is this -- is that President Obama has worked hard =
to implement a foreign policy that he believes strongly advances the inte=
rests of the United States around the globe, but doesnt just rely on the =
conventional wisdom of the foreign policy establishment in Washington, D.=
C. Certainly the President has benefitted tremendously from the advice of=
 experienced foreign policy hands inside this administration. Vice Presid=
ent Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, former Secretary of State Hilla=
ry Clinton, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter -- these are all people that =
have a lot of experience in the national security establishment in Washin=
gton. But what the President has sought to do is to incorporate that advi=
ce but also to make sure that hes thinking smartly about the most effecti=
ve way to use U.S. influence, to use the United States military to advanc=
e our interests around the globe.



 And there is a tendency that's undeniable on the part of the foreign pol=
icy establishment in Washington, D.C. to turn to the military option, in =
the Presidents view, often prematurely. And it is that kind of thinking t=
hat contributed to --=20



 Q You're including Ash Carter and Clinton in that foreign policy establi=
shment.



 MR. EARNEST: I'm including them in the category of people whove got an e=
normous amount of foreign policy experience that has been used to give th=
e President excellent advice when it comes to advancing our national secu=
rity interests and formulating a foreign policy that has made the America=
n people safer. I think what is also true is there is a tendency generall=
y when it comes to the debate in Washington, D.C. about the foreign polic=
y establishment in Washington that makes -- that prioritizes the use of t=
he United States military often in a way to sort of protect the strength =
of the United States. President Obama strongly believes, and I think many=
 members of his national security team agree, that there are other ways t=
hat the United States of America can project our strength in a way that b=
etter advances our national security interests around the globe.



 Q One more quote from this. This is a quote from Ben in the story I just=
 wondered if you could interpret for me. The average reporter we talked t=
o is 27 years old and their only reporting experience consists of being a=
round political campaigns. That's a sea change. They literally know nothi=
ng. What exactly is he talking about there?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I guess at some point youll have an opportunit=
y to talk to him about that quote. I think what is clear is --



 Q Is that the average reporter you talk to?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess, looking around this room, unfortunately -- (=
laughter) -- not many of us meet that 27-year-old threshold. I think I ca=
n speak confidently on behalf of --



 Q I mean, it's kind, but -- (laughter.)=20



 MR. EARNEST: Not just young at heart, but also young in age here.=20



 Q We're the ones talking to the 27-year-old spokesmen. (Laughter.)



 MR. EARNEST: What I would say to you is that I can speak confidently on =
behalf of the President and on behalf of the White House that we obviousl=
y work hard to engage respectfully with the White House press corps that =
is quite serious about understanding exactly whats happening in the White=
 House and describing that situation to your readers and listeners. And I=
 think that everybody in this White House has worked hard to engage in th=
at kind of respectful dialogue not just because it advances the countrys =
interests for the citizens to understand exactly what President Obama is =
doing, but also because it's critically important to our democracy.=20



 The President spoke at the White House Correspondents Dinner just over a=
 week ago where he talked about how important it is for professional, ind=
ependent journalists to hold people in power accountable. That is critica=
l to the success of our democracy, and it is why the President and the re=
st of us here at the White House have worked hard to engage in that debat=
e in a respectful way that reflects the need for the American public and =
our citizens to be informed about the issues of the day.



 Q On Zika, given theres an active current threat from the virus in Puert=
o Rico, and also, of course, strong ties between that island and many cit=
ies and states in the mainland, how much concern is there that the island=
s financial situation could contribute to a more full-blown public health=
 crisis there that could affect the mainland? And if and when, or if Cong=
ress eventually allocates this money, presumably some of it would go to P=
uerto Rico, right?

=20

 MR. EARNEST: Well, let me answer that question a couple different ways. =
Some of the financial turmoil in Puerto Rico is having a negative impact =
on the public health care system inside of Puerto Rico, and given the fac=
t that there are reported cases of the Zika virus in Puerto Rico, this se=
ems like a pretty bad time for investments in Puerto Ricos public health =
system to be cut. Yet that's exactly what the Puerto Rican government is =
having to do because they have not been given the restructuring authority=
 that they need by Republicans in Congress.



 So there is a concern about how the interplay between these two issues c=
ould have a broader negative impact not just on the 3 million Americans w=
ho live in Puerto Rico but potentially on the U.S. mainland as well. So t=
hat's why the administration has prioritized both of these issues -- both=
 our efforts to try to address the financial challenges in Puerto Rico, b=
ut also to make sure that we are providing the necessary resources to sta=
te and local officials across the country to fight the Zika virus in thei=
r communities. And, yes, that would include providing resources to the go=
vernment in Puerto Rico to, for example, more effectively concentrate eff=
orts to fight the mosquito population.=20



 Q And also, on Howard -- there were a lot of things in that speech that =
were interesting beyond race. The President talked a lot about voting and=
 activism and being a change agent. He talked about how America and the w=
orld, including race relations, in most ways is much better than when he =
graduated college. And he used a line we've heard a lot from him recently=
, saying that if he had to choose any time in world history to be born, a=
nd didnt know what your position would be, youd choose now. That's sounds=
 like an implicit review of the make America great again sloganeering. Ca=
n we expect this to be a large part of the message that he delivers on th=
e campaign trail in the coming months, maybe particularly to young or div=
erse crowds?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- I can assure you that President Obama deli=
vered a commencement address at Howard University this weekend with the g=
raduates of Howard University on his mind, with the class of 2016 in univ=
ersities across the country thinking about entering the workforce. And he=
 didnt have the presidential campaign on his mind. He was focused on thes=
e graduates, and he was focusing on the graduates not just at Harvard but=
 -- I'm sorry -- at Howard, but also colleges and universities all across=
 the country.



 And I recognize that political coverage is omnipresent these days. But t=
his was a speech that was really a message to those graduates. And it doe=
s provide a lot of insight into the way the President thinks about a rang=
e of these issues and the consequences it has for graduates of Howard and=
 other esteemed universities across the country. But it was not -- there =
will be ample time for the President to make his election argument to you=
ng voters across the country, and there may be some common themes. But wh=
at the President was focused on here was delivering what I think is a pow=
erful message to the voters -- or to the graduates of Howard University.



 Q And last, on Hiroshima. When can we expect a decision on whether the P=
resident will go? Whats being weighed? Is it logistics? Is it politics, p=
olicy, desire? What sort of is going into the decision of whether he goes=
?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President made an observation in 2009 when he tra=
veled to Japan about his interest in traveling to Hiroshima. Given that t=
he President is scheduled to depart for Asia in about a week and a half h=
ere, our work to plan that trip is something we need to complete relative=
ly soon. And so we'll have more information about the Presidents itinerar=
y when hes traveling in Asia relatively soon.



 All right. Ron.=20



 Q On the commencement beat, this photograph of the West Point graduates =
with the clenched fists, what is the Presidents thought about that as Com=
mander-in-Chief?



 MR. EARNEST: I didnt talk to him about it. Obviously the officials at We=
st Point will be responsible for enforcing the rules of that institution =
consistent with the way that they have been established. At this point, I=
 wouldn't weigh in with a view on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief just b=
ecause I haven't talked to him about it.



 Q Because it happened around the same time of his commencement speech at=
 Howard and a lot of black pride, so on and so forth. And that seems to b=
e what some of the cadets are saying that was an expression of. And that'=
s why I'm surprised the President doesnt have a thought. Theres no indica=
tion of what he thinks about this or feels about this?



 MR. EARNEST: I just haven't talked to him about that particular issue to=
day.=20



 Q On the North Carolina situation, I just want to clarify, there was thi=
s agency review going on about funding and so forth, and now you have the=
 lawsuit, the threat. So where does the process stand on funding cuts, po=
tentially, to North Carolina because of the law?



 MR. EARNEST: Remember these are two different things. The first is there=
s a policy question to be answered about what impact this North Carolina =
law would have on the way in which the federal government funds some prog=
rams in the state of North Carolina, and there are a range of agencies th=
at are considering the policy implications of HB2. Theres a separate ques=
tion that is considered by the Department of Justice, independent of any =
White House judgment, about whether or not HB2 is consistent with the Civ=
il Rights law -- the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to be specific.=20



 And the Department of Justice issued a letter expressing their concerns =
about the fact that, in their view, HB2 is inconsistent with the Civil Ri=
ghts Act. It does appear that this is a question that will go to the cour=
ts, so I don't want to wade into this too far. But the policy review is b=
eing conducted at the agency level. It's still ongoing. But the Departmen=
t of Justice question about whether or not this is consistent with the Ci=
vil Rights Act is something that will apparently be litigated in the cour=
ts.=20



 Q So what is the Presidents view about the involvement in terms of these=
 funding issues? Has he been aggressively pushing the agencies to look at=
 this matter?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's actually the agencies themselves, shortl=
y after the law was passed --



 Q Right, you said that one time, and it seemed a little bit inconceivabl=
e about how this happens in North Carolina, and then, independently, all =
these agencies, without any direction or motivation, just independently, =
would look at this issue without the Presidents involvement or the White =
House saying --



 MR. EARNEST: I think this is an indication that the agencies take their =
jobs pretty seriously. And they certainly are going to coordinate with on=
e another, theyre going to coordinate with the White House and theyre goi=
ng to coordinate with the Department of Justice as they make these policy=
 decisions. We obviously will want to make sure that whatever policy cons=
equences are realized, that they are consistent across agencies. But that=
's a process that is ongoing.=20



 So, yes, the White House is involved in that policy review process, but =
primarily to coordinate the activities of the agencies that are involved.=




 Q Right. So is it conceivable that this law could defy the civil rights =
laws yet still be consistent with any particular agencys policies?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, what these agencies are reviewing right now is=
 what impact the law has on their policies.



 Q I think the real question is how aggressively is the administration go=
ing to go after the funding of North Carolina now that it clearly believe=
s that this law is violating the civil rights of -- it is not consistent =
with the civil rights law?



 MR. EARNEST: Look, I don't think this is an issue of going after North C=
arolinas funding. I think the question is simply a policy one in terms of=
 evaluating what impact this law has on policy questions related to fundi=
ng that North Carolina uses a variety of programs inside their state. So =
this is something that officials at a variety of agencies will consider. =
But we will be working to try to coordinate those decisions so that there=
 can be a pretty consistent interpretation of this policy across agencies=
.



 Q And if I can follow up on the 27-year-old reporter -- (laughter.) Just=
 we all make -- is it fair to say that that was -- it's clearly not an ac=
curate comment. Is it fair to say it was an unfortunate comment? Or is he=
 going to have more to say about that? I mean, it seems like a really -- =
quite a putdown, frankly, of the press corps.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I assure you that's -- look, based on the conversatio=
ns that I've had with Ben over the last couple of days, I assure you that=
's not how it was intended. And based on that reaction, I'm confident he =
would say it differently if given the chance.=20



But, look, all of you have had multiple opportunities to talk to Ben on a=
 range of foreign policy issues, and I think all of you appreciate the co=
mmitment that he has demonstrated to working with all of you to help info=
rm your viewers and readers. And I think that's an indication of how seri=
ously Ben takes this process. It certainly is reflective of the approach =
that the White House in general has taken to working with reporters, to e=
ngaging in a public debate about the wisdom of the policies this administ=
ration has put forward. And Ben has been a persuasive advocate for the Pr=
esidents policies, but also an eager participant in that debate.



Q Not to make this personal about him. It, in fact, raises a larger issue=
 of how the administration views the press corps generally and the relati=
onship over the -- I haven't been here all eight years, but it has been a=
t times, and it should be, contentious. And I guess to what extent is thi=
s some indication that the Presidents thinking about the press corps is n=
ot perhaps as complimentary as we would like it to be, or as positive as =
we perhaps think it should be?



MR. EARNEST: I guess I would encourage you to consider the Presidents own=
 words on this, and whether you want to consider the statements that the =
President made at the Correspondents Dinner, or the statements that the P=
resident delivered to college journalists in this room just a couple days=
 before the Correspondents Dinner -- in both settings, the President paid=
 tribute to the critically important role that independent journalists ha=
ve in the success of our democracy.



And I think, look, as you point out, there is built-in friction between t=
he White House press corps and the White House. That is always going to b=
e there. And the day that it's not, the day that there is not friction be=
tween the White House press corps and the White House is the day that you=
 guys stop doing your jobs. The day that you walk in here and you sit in =
the front row and you say, well, you know what, Josh, I think you just an=
swered all my questions here at the briefing, theres not another single t=
hing I could possibly ask about -- that's the day you haven't taken serio=
usly your responsibilities to push and prod and hold the administration a=
nd the President accountable for the decisions that hes making and for th=
e consequences of those decisions.



And I think the fact that I come out here and stand here for an hour, hou=
r and a half every day to answer your questions is an indication that we =
take that process quite seriously.=20



Q Do you think that in the coming months or weeks that the President migh=
t increase his level of engagement with the press? I remember I was struc=
k that day that he stood here and took about, oh, many, many questions fr=
om the students, but his interactions with us are, I would say, more limi=
ted. That's not over the course of the whole -- but the question is, can =
there be -- or given some of whats been said here and the thought here, d=
o you think the President might rethink the level of access and engagemen=
t he has with the press corps? Does he feel that it's appropriate --



MR. EARNEST: I think -- look, last Friday, the President stood at this po=
dium and delivered an opening statement and took four questions from peop=
le in this room. And I think that's an indication of the Presidents commi=
tment to engaging with all of you and answering your questions and being =
accountable to you and to the American public for the decisions that hes =
making.



And, look, if theres ever a day that you guys walk in this room and say, =
you know what, I think we've heard enough from the President today, or yo=
u know what, we've gotten all kinds of questions that we've been able to =
ask the President, is the day that you stop doing your job. You're suppos=
ed to sit there and say, why can't we get more access to the President? W=
hy can't the President spend more time answering our questions? That's yo=
ur job. That's what you're supposed to advocate for.



And that's the nature of our arrangement here. I think the question reall=
y is not whether or not the White House press corps is going to be satisf=
ied with the number of questions the President has taken from the press c=
orps -- you shouldnt be. I think the question is, is there a commitment, =
institutionally, on the part of the White House that starts at the top to=
 answer as many questions as possible and spending the time necessary to =
help the American people and the journalists who cover the White House th=
e most understand exactly whats happening here.=20



And I think by -- I'm quite proud, and I think the President is quite pro=
ud of the efforts that we undertake on a daily basis to help all of you u=
nderstand exactly what the President is doing and why hes doing it. And t=
o be clear, the President understands that's part of his job. Part of the=
 job of the President of the United States is to communicate with the Ame=
rican public, and certainly to participate and engage in a process where =
you have independent journalists whove got years of experience, either on=
 the campaign trail or around the world, who are here to hold the Preside=
nt accountable and to hold his administration accountable.=20



Again, that is part of what makes our democracy successful. And youve hea=
rd the President make this observation after returning from travels overs=
eas -- well, actually, theres a better example of this. The President had=
 this conversation with Vladimir Putin on the telephone where President P=
utin made an observation about some news coverage of the President back h=
ere in Washington. And the President noted to President Putin that while =
President Obama has the opportunity to talk to reporters, he doesnt have =
an opportunity to edit their pieces, and that sometimes that makes for a =
little bumpiness. And sometimes the President feels as if his message is =
being blurred, but that's part of our process. And that's what makes our =
country and our democracy strong. And it's why the President, so willingl=
y and freely, engages in that process.



Byron.



Q Thanks, Josh. Last week, the President granted clemency to 58 nonviolen=
t drug offenders. At the time, you guys noted that hes granted more commu=
tations than the previous six Presidents combined. But when it comes to t=
he use of his pardon power, he lags pretty far behind other modern and hi=
storical Presidents. Hes only granted 70 pardons. George W. Bush has gran=
ted 180. Bill Clinton granted nearly 400. Why is the President so relucta=
nt to pardon people?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, we've got eight months to go, so I think it's t=
oo early to draw that conclusion. The second thing I would point out is t=
he President has been aggressively advocating for criminal justice reform=
 legislation. In terms of the potential impact of that legislation, it wo=
uld have a positive impact on many more Americans, particularly when it c=
omes to bringing greater justice to our criminal justice system.



Whats also true is this administration has worked hard to upgrade the pro=
cesses that we have in place internally for considering clemency requests=
. That effort to make that process more efficient has resulted in changes=
 both here at the White House and at the Department of Justice to streaml=
ine this process. The administration has also worked with outside organiz=
ations, again, to try to make this process function at a higher level. An=
d I think the benefits of all of that work is something that we've seen i=
n recent months with an increase in people whove been granted clemency.



And the President is certainly hopeful that at least over the next eight =
months that we'll continue to benefit from that work. I think what is als=
o true is theres no denying that the next President of the United States =
will inherit a higher-functioning clemency system than the one that Presi=
dent Obama inherited. And that also has the potential to make a differenc=
e in the lives of Americans who are ready for a second chance.



Q But when it comes to pardons specifically, is there something the Presi=
dent likes better about clemency over offering a blanket pardon for a cri=
me?



MR. EARNEST: No -- well, it's hard to answer that question, Byron, just b=
ecause each of these cases are considered on a case-by-case basis. So it'=
s hard to make grand pronouncements about the use of the granting of clem=
ency in the form of a commutation as opposed to a pardon.=20



But what I can tell you is, after a lot of work, we now have in place a m=
uch better system for considering these kinds of requests. There is a bac=
klog that has built up that we're working through. But because of improve=
ments at the Department of Justice, because of better coordination with s=
ome outside organizations, and because of a commitment on the part of thi=
s President to using this presidential authority to bring more justice to=
 our criminal justice system, we've seen clemency granted at higher rates=
 over the last several months. And hopefully that progress will continue.=




But again, none of this will ever be a replacement for the kind of crimin=
al justice reform legislation that has bipartisan support in Congress, th=
at would have a much broader impact in terms of making our communities sa=
fer, but also bringing greater justice to our criminal justice system.



Q One more on this. A pardon generally restores lost rights, like the rig=
ht to vote or possess a firearm. The commutation does not. Does the admin=
istrations hesitance to use the pardon power have anything to do with the=
 fact that it would restore rights, whether firearms or voting? And broad=
ly, does the White House believe in the right of ex-felons to get their r=
ights back, whether to own a firearm or vote, after serving their time?



MR. EARNEST: Well, again, when it comes to issuing pardons, that is somet=
hing that is done on the merits and is not done with any consideration to=
ward voting rights. More generally, I can tell you that it is the policy =
of the administration that we strongly support those who have paid their =
debt to society being given the opportunity to get access to their consti=
tutional rights once again.



And so I know that Governor McAuliffe in Virginia has recently made some =
news with this effort, and that's something that, in general, the adminis=
tration has been supportive of. I'll leave it there.



Q And firearms? Voting, but --



MR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of a position that we've taken on this q=
uestion related to firearms.=20



Mark.=20



Q On the question of commutations, can you tell us what the process is by=
 which the President goes through applications? Does the pardon attorney =
come over, sit with him, run down -- because there are thousands of appli=
cations. Who goes through the process, weaning applicants and making the =
final decisions? Or is he just presented with 58 and that's how it happen=
ed last week?



MR. EARNEST: The way that this works -- and the Department of Justice can=
 give you some more granular detail on this -- but there are attorneys at=
 the Department of Justice that do consider applications that have been s=
ubmitted through the formal process for people who are seeking clemency. =
And those attorneys will review the individual cases, determine whether o=
r not they meet a set of criteria. And if they do, they are then forwarde=
d to the White House for consideration both by the White House counsel an=
d by the President of the United States.=20



And that's generally how the process works. We can provide you some addit=
ional details on it.=20



Q But can you say if in the last batch, did the President receive more th=
an 58 commutation prospects and then he ruled yes for some and no for oth=
ers?



MR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that. I don't know that we're goi=
ng to be, frankly, willing to disclose that much detail, because this wou=
ld sort of fall into the category of advice that the President is getting=
 from his attorneys. But let me take a look at that and see if we can giv=
e you a little bit more insight into this.=20



But just to go back to your original question, the President is not the o=
ne who is sort of combing through the large stack of cases --



Q No, no, I get that. But what I want to know, does the counsel, White Ho=
use counsel go through it first, and then sit down with the President and=
 go through them one by one? Or does the President get a batch and goes t=
hrough it himself?



MR. EARNEST: I know that the White House counsel is certainly part of tha=
t process. A lot of this can be done on paper, and so the President does =
take the time to review individual cases that have been recommended for c=
lemency. I do know that.=20



Okay. Margaret.=20



Q North Korea. Over the weekend, Kim Jong-il delivered a speech. He seeme=
d to tout nuclear weapons development, but also said they were going to f=
ulfill their nuclear nonproliferation requirements. What does the White H=
ouse make of what he said?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Margaret, as with many countries, we're much more focu=
sed on their actions, the actions of North Korea, than we are on their wo=
rds. There are a set of concerns that we have raised about the way North =
Koreas conduct is inconsistent with their international obligations when =
it comes to their nuclear program.=20



And we've made clear that once North Korea demonstrates a commitment to c=
oming back into compliance with those international obligations, the Unit=
ed States and the rest of the international community would be prepared t=
o enter into negotiations with them and begin to give them access to the =
international community that theyve been denied for some time now. And th=
eyve been denied -- been isolated because of their insistence on violatin=
g these basic international norms that just about everybody else lives up=
 to.



Q So you see this as neither hopeful, nor worrisome.=20



MR. EARNEST: We see this as a piece of -- as a factor that can be incorpo=
rated into a broader analysis about the situation there. But ultimately, =
we give greater weight to the actions that North Korea chooses to carry o=
ut. And there are a set of specific actions that we have made clear North=
 Korea needs to undertake in order to escape the international isolation =
that they face right now.



 Q On North Carolina, I know you're not going to want to get ahead of whe=
re the AG goes later today. And we know broadly what the President thinks=
 in terms of where North Carolina is with its own laws. But fundamentally=
, what are the President's views on whether transgender should be a prote=
cted status under federal law? And has he ever called on Congress to do t=
hat?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I'm going to have to look this up for you. I know tha=
t there has been legislation that has been put forward to consider this s=
pecific question, and let me follow up with you if we've taken a specific=
 position on this.



 I think what I can just say generally is -- and you've heard the Preside=
nt say this on a couple of occasions -- the law that was passed by North =
Carolina, this HB2 law, it's just mean-spirited because it seeks to discr=
iminate against people because of who they are. And it, frankly, is incon=
sistent with the kinds of values that we cherish in this country. It's al=
so inconsistent with the economic interests of the state of North Carolin=
a. And you've seen a number of businesses indicate that they are not will=
ing to invest in North Carolina -- or at least hesitant to invest in Nort=
h Carolina because of this particular piece of legislation.=20



So, Deutsche Bank has already announced it was cancelling planned expansi=
on of its operations in Cary, North Carolina. That expansion would have a=
dded 250 jobs to the state of North Carolina. PayPal announced that it wa=
s canceling plans to open a global payment center in Charlotte, North Car=
olina, which had been expected to bring 400 jobs to that city. You've hea=
rd the NBA announce that they were potentially moving the 2017 All-Star g=
ame. The state of North Carolina lost their NBA franchise a few years ago=
 and went to great lengths to try to win the confidence of the NBA to get=
 that franchise back there. Basketball is obviously a cherished pastime o=
f the people of North Carolina, and this would just be another setback.



 So I think it is clear exactly what the impact of passing this law has b=
een. And ultimately the governor and state legislators will be the ones t=
hat will have to defend to the people of North Carolina exactly why they =
went down this route. The irony is, is that the state of North Carolina, =
for a generation, has sought to cultivate a business-friendly climate. Th=
is was a state whose economy largely rested on the agriculture industry, =
and they've worked hard to develop research and development capacities, a=
nd to develop Charlotte as a financial hub. And much of that progress has=
 been dealt a setback by the mean-spirited politics of the governor and s=
ome Republicans in the state legislature. But exactly how that all gets c=
onsidered by the people of North Carolina is something that they'll have =
to determine.



 Q Because, arguably, the next administration may not have the same inter=
pretation as this administration's Department of Justice. So without that=
 federal protection, you could continue to have these arguments state by =
state. So does the President want that? Is he encouraging -- is there any=
 kind of effort on the Hill that he's really trying to court opinion to g=
et this to be protected status?



 MR. EARNEST: Let me take a look at our record on this and see if I can g=
et you some specifics about what legislation we have supported in Congres=
s.



 Q And a really quick one. In that same New York Times piece, there was m=
ention of the President's two letters -- or two that we know of -- that w=
ere written to the Supreme Leader of Iran, or to Iran's leadership at lea=
st. And in the article, it framed it saying that Panetta, CIA chief, then=
 SecDef,was not included or consulted on the letters when they were writt=
en, and had no knowledge of them. At least that's how it was made in the =
article. Can you confirm that to be the case? Or can you explain who was =
part of the writing of these letters to the Iranian leadership?



 MR. EARNEST: I can't account for who may have been in the loop on the wr=
iting of those letters and who wasnt. Obviously, the President drew upon =
the advice of his national security team in terms of trying to pursue a d=
iplomatic opening with the Supreme Leader and with other leading official=
s in Iran. But I, frankly, can't speak to whether or not then-CIA Directo=
r Leon Panetta was shown a draft of the letter before it was sent.



 Q And it would suggest, or some are definitely interpreting that as an i=
ndication that perhaps he was not one of the top national security adviso=
rs to the President, or considered to be someone who needed to be in the =
know in the room and consulted with on something that was pretty substant=
ial in terms of outreach.

=20

 MR. EARNEST: Listen, I assure you that President Obama would not have ma=
de the decision to promote his CIA Director to be the Secretary of Defens=
e if he didnt have complete confidence in the advice and wisdom that he w=
as receiving from Leon Panetta.



 Q Will you able, you think, to tell us who was part of that drafting of =
those letters?



 MR. EARNEST: I'll take a look and see if we can get you some more detail=
s on that, but I can't promise that we'll have any information on it.



 Kevin.



 Q Thanks, Josh. I'm not sure if you made this clear, but has the Preside=
nt -- do you know if the President has read that New York Times magazine =
article about Ben?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont know whether he has or not. I havent spoken to him a=
bout it.



 Q Okay, got it. Ben told Jake Tapper of CNN on April 6th, and I quote, "=
Under this deal you will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relate=
s to the nuclear facilities that Iran has." Is that a lie?



 MR. EARNEST: No. To their nuclear facilities, there is 24/7 access to Ir=
an's -- to verify their compliance with the agreement.



 Q 24/7 access, anytime, anywhere.



 MR. EARNEST: To their nuclear facilities. That's the quote you just read=
 me, right?



 Q Yes.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Okay.



 Q Can you state categorically that no senior official in this administra=
tion has ever lied publicly about any aspect of the Iran nuclear deal?



 MR. EARNEST: Kevin, I think the facts of this agreement and the benefits=
 of this agreement make clear that the national security of the United St=
ates of America has been enhanced, and Iran's effort to acquire a nuclear=
 weapon has been set back. In fact, Iran has now committed to not seeking=
 to acquire to a nuclear weapon, and we can now verify that they're not a=
ble to acquire a nuclear weapon.=20



It is our critics who either falsely or just wrongly suggested that Iran =
would never go along with the agreement. They have. They falsely or wrong=
ly suggested that we would never be able to verify through the internatio=
nal community that Iran would abide by the agreement. They have. It is ou=
r critics who have suggested that Iran would experience hundreds of billi=
ons of dollars in benefits -- a financial windfall from this agreement. T=
hey have not. In fact, we have seen the Iran government complain about th=
e fact that they havent gotten the kind of financial benefits that they e=
xpected.



 So I recognize that there is an attempt by those who either lied or got =
it wrong to try to relitigate this fight. But the fact of the matter is, =
when you take a look at the concrete results of this agreement, Iran is n=
ot able to obtain a nuclear weapon; we can verify that their nuclear prog=
ram is only focused on peaceful purposes; and we have succeeded in making=
 the United States safer, in make Israel safer, and making our partners i=
n the region safer because Iran is not able to obtain a nuclear weapon.=20=




This wasnt just a priority identified by President Obama. Preventing Iran=
 from obtaining a nuclear weapon was a priority that was identified by Pr=
ime Minister Netanyahu and other leaders in the Gulf that work closely wi=
th the United States to advance our national security. That's the crux of=
 this argument. And the facts indicate that the strategy that the Preside=
nt laid out was remarkably successful.



 Q I just want to make sure -- I want to give you another run on it, beca=
use I'm not sure if you misspoke. I said, can you state categorically tha=
t no senior official in this administration ever lied publicly about any =
aspect of the deal.



 MR. EARNEST: There is no evidence that that ever occurred. And what I wo=
uld encourage you and other critics of the deal to do is to look at the f=
acts and to look at the results. We can verify them now, and the facts ar=
e clear.=20



 Q Last week, you called the House Republican plan to prioritize military=
 readiness concerns and have war funding expire next April as grossly irr=
esponsible. And yet back in, I think it was 2008, then-Senator Obama, and=
 Senator Clinton, for that matter, voted for a similar timeline. Can you =
square the difference?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of that vote in 2008. We can always take a lo=
ok at it. But I'm sure it was different.



 Q Okay. I can actually read that to you, if youd like. But I can send it=
 to you, if you prefer.



 MR. EARNEST: We'll follow up.



 Q Okay, thank you, Josh.



 MR. EARNEST: Angela.



 Q Thanks, Josh. Senator Hatch was here at the White House today for the =
basketball team event. He, of course, is a Republican who has spoken in c=
omplimentary terms in the past about the nominee for the Supreme Court op=
ening. Did the President have a chance to have any private conversations =
with the Senator today on that topic?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific private conversations the Pre=
sident may have had. But if they're private conversations, we probably wo=
uldnt talk about them publicly anyway. But certainly President Obama and =
Senator Hatch agree about the historical significance of the exciting 198=
3 NCAA championship game. And the President was honored to welcome the na=
tional champion North Carolina State Wolfpack Men's Basketball Team to th=
e White House today.=20

=20

 Q And Donald Trump has been talking about how he would approach U.S. deb=
t, and there seems to be some inconsistencies in how he says he would app=
roach that. But one of the things he's proposed is he'd be open to renego=
tiating U.S. debt in case the economy were to tank. That's not the approa=
ch that the President took when he was new in office. But what does he th=
ink about that idea being floated right now from the Republican nominee?



 MR. EARNEST: Over the course of the President's seven years in office, y=
ou've had multiple opportunities to evaluate the priority that the Presid=
ent has placed on protecting the full faith and credit of the United Stat=
es of America. We saw an effort by congressional Republicans in 2011 to h=
old hostage the full faith and credit of the United States to accomplish =
some of their ideological aims. The President stood steadfast and has mad=
e clear time and time again that he's committed to protecting the full fa=
ith and credit of the United States.=20



 The President made that a priority throughout a series of rancorous budg=
et negotiations with congressional Republicans, because this is a princip=
le that is critical to our nation's short-term and long-term economic hea=
lth. The United States of America is a global leader when it comes to our=
 economic strength, because the world has confidence in the full faith an=
d credit of the United States. And the President does not believe that th=
at full faith and credit should be subjected to negotiation or the threat=
 of hostage-taking.=20



 So the President has made this a priority. That is a priority that other=
 American Presidents -- in fact, every other American President has made =
clear that protecting the full faith and credit of the United States is c=
ritically important, Democrats and Republicans. And the President's effor=
t to protect the full faith and credit of the United States has been stro=
ngly endorsed by the American business community because they understand =
the repercussions that our economy would sustain if that were called into=
 question.=20



 So the President's view on all of this I think is clear, based on a trac=
k record that all of you can evaluate. But I'll let the individual presid=
ential candidates make the case for why that should change if that's what=
 they believe.



 John.



 Q Thanks a lot, Josh. Just a question regarding the ballistic missile te=
st which was recently conducted by Iran.



 MR. EARNEST: I'd just note, John, that the defense minister of Iran, sho=
rtly before I came out here, came out and said that that missile test did=
 not take place.

=20

 Q That's interesting. The Pentagon claims that -- we have a Pentagon sou=
rce that says that it did indeed take place. But let me go forward as it =
relates just to the issue of ballistic missile tests. There have been a n=
umber of them since the Iran nuclear deal. And as Iran points out, rightl=
y so, this is not in violation of the Iran nuclear deal, but it does appe=
ar to be in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution. What are t=
he consequences of that violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution=
?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, John, as you point out, the United Nations has expres=
sed concerns with Iran's continued development of a ballistic missile pro=
gram. So those were concerns that were expressed by the United Nations bo=
th before the completion of an international agreement to prevent Iran fr=
om obtaining a nuclear weapon. Those were concerns that we have expressed=
 even in the aftermath of the deal.=20



 So the United States continues to work with the international community =
to impose costs on Iran to impose sanctions on Iran because of their viol=
ation of these international violations. What President Obama has also so=
ught to do is to deepen our coordination with our partners in the Gulf wh=
o are most directly threatened by Iran's ballistic missile program. And t=
hat was the substance of extensive negotiations that the President had wi=
th our GCC partners in Saudi Arabia just a couple of weeks ago.=20



 The President believes that both by providing some additional expertise,=
 but also helping the Gulf Coast -- the GCC partners work more effectivel=
y to coordinate their efforts, that we can actually strengthen the abilit=
y of our partners to counter that threat.



 What we've also indicated should be done -- and the United States has wo=
rked effectively with our partners in this regard, too -- is to improve o=
ur interdiction efforts to make it harder for Iran to obtain, through ill=
icit means, materials and resources and expertise that could be used to b=
enefit their ballistic missile program. So we've worked hard to do that, =
as well, with some success.=20

=20

 So our strategy to counter Iran's ballistic missile program is one that'=
s rooted in our ability to work with the international community to achie=
ve this objective. I think what is clear is that the world is safer becau=
se we can definitively say that there is no chance that Iran is going to =
put a nuclear weapon at the top of one of those ballistic missiles becaus=
e of the international effort that was led by Barack Obama to prevent Ira=
n from obtaining a nuclear weapon.



 Q So do you not anticipate the U.N. Security Council imposing any type o=
f additional sanctions on Iran for their ballistic missile testing?



 MR. EARNEST: That certainly is a possibility. It always it. But again, i=
n this particular case, there are doubts about whether that actually occu=
rred, because the Iran defense minister said on the record that it didnt.=
 But we obviously have ways to evaluate that, and we'll work with the int=
ernational community to do so.



 Q Was it a mistake that this particular issue -- ballistic missile testi=
ng -- was not included in the Iran nuclear deal?



 MR. EARNEST: No, again, because our focus in the context of the Iran dea=
l was to work with the international community to prevent Iran from obtai=
ning a nuclear weapon. That was the number one threat, I think for obviou=
s reasons. The concerns the international community, including the United=
 States, has about Iran's ballistic missile program are longstanding conc=
erns. Those concerns continue.=20



Our efforts to counter their ballistic missile program havent waned in th=
e aftermath of the Iran deal. In fact, we've actually stepped up our effo=
rts to coordinate with our GCC partners, with Saudi Arabia and with Israe=
l, both to put in place an architecture to counter Iran's ballistic missi=
le program, but also to ramp up enforcement of international sanctions th=
at prevent Iran from being able to acquire resources and materials throug=
h illicit means.



 So we've stepped up that coordination, and we're going to continue to ap=
ply pressure to Iran to come into compliance with their international obl=
igations.



 Gardiner.



 Q A Mexican judge just ruled that El Chapo can be extradited to the Unit=
ed States. Do you happen to know, Josh, where he might be incarcerated or=
 when the timing of that might happen?



 MR. EARNEST: I wasnt aware of this announcement. It may have just occurr=
ed in the last hour or so. What I will say is that the Department of Just=
ice has, for years now, filed charged against Mr. Guzman. These are charg=
es that have been in place for years. And as a result of those charges, t=
he United States has sought extradition and to bring him to justice in U.=
S. courts.



 But obviously that requires the Department of Justice to work with the M=
exican government. They have him in custody now. And so for updates on th=
ose efforts, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice.



 Q Al Qaeda chief, Ayman al-Zawahiri, released an audio tape over the wee=
kend -- his first since January -- urging jihadists to unify in Syria. Gi=
ven al Qaeda's diminished stature these days, particularly in Syria, how =
important are these utterances anymore in the context of the fight there?=




 MR. EARNEST: Well, Gardiner, we obviously take quite seriously the threa=
t that is posed by al Qaeda and other extremists that seek to carry out v=
iolence against the United States or our interests around the world. And =
the President has been vigilant about countering that threat.=20



Let me give you a good example. This is an announcement that was made, I =
believe, over the weekend by my colleagues at United States Central Comma=
nd. They announced that in the last week in April, the United States mili=
tary had conducted four counterterrorism airstrikes against al Qaeda figu=
res in Yemen. Yemen is a place that, despite all the turmoil that's there=
, that we dont talk a lot about in here, but it is a place where we know =
that some of the world's most dangerous terrorists are seeking to establi=
sh a foothold and plot and plan against the United States. And these coun=
terterrorism strikes are an indication that the President takes quite ser=
iously the threat from AQAP that emanates from Yemen.



But more generally, we have talked a lot in here about the effort to degr=
ade and ultimately destroy ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. And the President h=
as laid out a comprehensive strategy for doing so. He's assembled a coali=
tion of 65 nations to work with the United States to degrade and ultimate=
ly destroy that organization. We know there are other extremist organizat=
ions that are operating in Syria, in particular, and there have been U.S.=
 airstrikes conducted against leading figures and fighters who are associ=
ated with those other extremist networks.



So the President is well aware that there are dangers that emanate from I=
raq and in Syria, and that would explain the robust response, both milita=
rily and otherwise, from the United States to protect the American people=
.



Thanks a lot, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Good aft=
ernoon, everybody.&nbsp; Happy Monday.&nbsp; Before we get started I wanted=
 to just bring to your attention a statement that was issued today by the N=
ational Governors Association.&nbsp; So the NGA is a bipartisan organizatio=
n
 that represents governors from across the country.&nbsp; They issued a sta=
tement, and I was going to take the liberty of reading it to you.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is a direct quote f=
rom the NGA:&nbsp; &#8220;The nation is on the threshold of a public health=
 emergency as it faces the likely spread of the Zika virus.&nbsp; As with a=
ll such emergencies, advanced planning and preparation is essential to
 prevent injury and death.&nbsp; A key component to averting infectious dis=
ease outbreaks is to prevent incident levels from reaching a critical tippi=
ng point, after which there is a rapid increase in the number of infections=
.&nbsp; This is particularly true of the Zika
 virus.&nbsp; The most important way we can protect people is to minimize i=
nfections and prevent a concentration of cases which can lead to outbreak a=
nd children born with severe, lifelong birth defects, such as microcephalis=
.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;As Congress returns =
from recess today, the nation&#8217;s governors urge the administration and=
 Congress to work together to reach agreement on the appropriate funding le=
vels needed to prepare for and combat the Zika virus.&nbsp; We also ask
 they act as expeditiously as possible to ensure those funds are available =
for states, territories and the public at large.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this obviously is consis=
tent with the argument that the administration has been making for more tha=
n two months now that given the public health emergency that exists around =
the Zika virus, it's critical that Congress act quickly
 to provide the necessary funding to our public health professionals and to=
 states to ensure we can protect the American people.&nbsp; That's what the=
 President has been advocating for for quite some time, and we're hopeful t=
hat Republicans will drop their opposition
 and actually work with Democrats to get this done.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with that, Kevin, do you=
 want to get us started today?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, J=
osh.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; So now that North Carolina has sued to keep in =
place this so-called bathroom law, how will that affect the review that age=
ncies were undertaking that could have limited federal dollars to the state=
?&nbsp; Will
 the administration hold off on those reviews now that there&#8217;s a laws=
uit and let it play out in court?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
aware of any change in the posture of that review.&nbsp; The position of th=
e North Carolina government has not changed.&nbsp; They&#8217;re asserting =
that this mean-spirited law is somehow consistent with the Civil Rights Act
 and with our values. The Department of Justice has obviously spoken to its=
 compliance with the law given their enforcement role.&nbsp; So for questio=
ns about that, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice.&nbsp; And I thin=
k the President has spoken pretty powerfully
 to the idea that what the state of North Carolina has passed -- in a one-d=
ay special session -- is inconsistent with the values of fairness and equal=
ity and justice that we hold dear in this country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think it should be ev=
ident from the response from the business community that what the North Car=
olina government has done is inconsistent with the best interests of the pe=
ople of North Carolina and the economy of North Carolina.&nbsp;
 That obviously will be something that North Carolina officials will have t=
o deal with, but there has been a reluctance on the part of businesses that=
 had previously committed to expanding the amount of business they do in No=
rth Carolina from engaging with
 a government that just makes it easier to discriminate against their emplo=
yees and potential customers.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What ar=
e the ramifications of Iran test-firing another ballistic missile?&nbsp; An=
d has the nuclear deal and the subsequent lifting of certain sanctions embo=
ldened Iran to undertake these provocations?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ke=
vin, we are aware of Iranian claims of additional ballistic -- let me say t=
hat again -- we're aware of Iranian claims of an additional ballistic missi=
le launch.&nbsp; I would note we're also aware of statements from
 the defense minister indicating that such a launch did not take place.&nbs=
p; So we're still trying to get to the bottom of what exactly transpired.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the clearest impact=
 of the successful completion of the international agreement to prevent Ira=
n from obtaining a nuclear weapon is we can now verify that Iran has not ob=
tained a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; And in fact, we have verified
 that Iran has taken significant steps to actually roll back their nuclear =
program.&nbsp; And the worst-case, dire predictions of the deal&#8217;s cri=
tics did not at all come to pass.&nbsp; What did come to pass is exactly wh=
at this administration indicated our objectives
 were, which were to curtail Iran&#8217;s nuclear program, guarantee access=
 for international inspectors who could verify that Iran&#8217;s nuclear pr=
ogram only exist for peaceful purposes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So last=
 week, you talked about a criticism of the administration&#8217;s selling o=
f the Iran deal in the wake of the New York Times profile of Ben Rhodes as =
sour grapes.&nbsp; And I wanted to -- he&#8217;s now written kind of a foll=
ow-up -- and
 I wanted to ask, if that was the case, why has he felt the need to explain=
 himself more?&nbsp; And did the President or anyone else at the White Hous=
e ask him to do that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
haven't spoken to the President about this story, so this was not something=
 that was written at the request of the President.&nbsp; I think what motiv=
ated Ben to discuss this further is that there was an attempt and
 there has been an attempt by opponents of the Iran deal to suggest that so=
mehow the effort to protect the deal was based solely on spin.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact is, as I just ment=
ioned, we can evaluate the Iran deal now in terms of the impact that it has=
 had on our national security and on Iran&#8217;s nuclear program.&nbsp; So=
 we're no longer in a situation in which we have to argue about what
 the impact of this agreement will be.&nbsp; We actually now can verify wha=
t the impact of the agreement is.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what is clear is that I=
ran has eliminated 98 percent of its highly enriched uranium stockpile.&nbs=
p; Iran has disconnected thousands of centrifuges.&nbsp; Iran has essential=
ly rendered harmless its heavy-water plutonium reactor.&nbsp; And Iran
 has complied with its commitment to give international inspectors widespre=
ad access to the country to verify its compliance with the agreement.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our opponents, and opponent=
s of this deal, had suggested that Iran would never go along with it, that =
Iran would never implement the terms of the agreement.&nbsp; They were wron=
g about that.&nbsp; Our critics often suggested that there would
 never be a way to verify Iran&#8217;s claims that they had gone along with=
 the agreement.&nbsp; They were wrong about that, too.&nbsp; The internatio=
nal inspectors at the IAEA have gotten the access that they have needed to =
verify Iran&#8217;s compliance with the agreement.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What our critics have also =
suggested is that the agreement would open the door to hundreds of billions=
 of dollars in cash for the Iranian economy.&nbsp; That has not occurred ei=
ther.&nbsp; In fact, we actually see some in Iran suggesting that
 they want -- that they haven&#8217;t gotten as much funding out of the dea=
l as they expected.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the truth is it&#8217;s =
hard to think of a scenario or a single fact that critics of this agreement=
 predicted that actually came to pass.&nbsp; In fact, time and time and tim=
e again, almost regardless of which factor you consider, the critics
 of the deal have been wrong.&nbsp; And I think this is an indication that =
our efforts to protect the agreement were rooted firmly in fact.&nbsp; And =
that's the point that Ben wanted to reiterate in the context of his online =
post today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roberta.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wante=
d to ask about the Philippine&#8217;s election.&nbsp; I&#8217;m curious to =
know whether the White House has any reaction to the candidate who appears =
all but certain to have won.&nbsp; He has said that he wants multilateral t=
alks to resolve
 the South China Sea disputes -- talks with Japan, Australia, the United St=
ates, and China.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m wondering what the White House thinks =
of that idea, and whether the White House has any general reaction to his e=
lection and his campaign.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have a reaction to the election at this point.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll let all th=
e votes be tallied before we weigh in with a specific response to any of th=
e statements that were made by the candidates.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can just tell you, in gen=
eral, that when it comes to resolving the competing claims in the South Chi=
na Sea, the United States is not a claimant to any of those land features, =
but we have urged all of the countries that are to resolve
 their differences through diplomacy and through well-established internati=
onal procedures for doing so.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're strongly supportive o=
f that effort because we benefit from the kind of rules-based order that al=
lows the free flow of commerce in that region of the world, and it&#8217;s =
obviously in our economic and strategy interest for the flow
 to continue uninterrupted.&nbsp; And any sort of destabilizing activities =
there would not be in our interest.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So while we are not a claim=
ant to any of those land features, we do have interest in those differences=
 being resolved through diplomacy and without disrupting the broader intern=
ational order.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So woul=
d well-established diplomatic procedures include the possibility of having =
multilateral talks?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
haven&#8217;t seen the specific proposal that this one particular Filipino =
candidate for president has put forward.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ll obviously wa=
it for the results to come, and then we&#8217;ll then have more of a reacti=
on to offer
 in terms of his election and any proposals that that may put on the table.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And jus=
t a quick one.&nbsp; This weekend Saudi Arabia named a new oil minister.&nb=
sp; And I&#8217;m wondering whether this White House reaction to this key a=
ppointment -- whether the White House is expecting a new era of transparenc=
y, as this
 oil minister is younger, or any sort of thoughts about this significant ch=
ange?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have any specific comments in reaction to some political changes inside of =
Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; Obviously, the King and the government there are making=
 decisions consistent with their own interests.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would point out that the =
new energy minister did make clear that the political changes did not signa=
l any significant short-term
<span style=3D"color:black">changes in their energy policy.&nbsp; </span>Bu=
t for any developments on that front, I&#8217;d refer you to his statement =
and any additional statements that they choose to put out.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But obviously the United St=
ates continues to consider Saudi Arabia as an important partner in that reg=
ion of the world.&nbsp; And that certainly was part of the reason that Pres=
ident Obama traveled to Saudi Arabia just a couple of weeks
 ago and engaged in serious and lengthy consultations with the Saudi govern=
ment while he was there.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JC.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is ther=
e any statement you may have on the President&#8217;s thoughts on the elect=
ion of Sadiq Khan as the first Muslim mayor of the city of London?<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, JC=
, obviously, we saw those news reports over the weekend.&nbsp; This is obvi=
ously an historic development for a historic city.&nbsp; Obviously, the pol=
itical debate inside of the UK and in London is obviously charged with
 a lot of different issues.&nbsp; And this outcome obviously reflects the w=
ill of the people of London and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t second-guess the=
m from here.&nbsp; But there is no denying the historical significance of M=
r. Khan&#8217;s election.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some se=
e it as a strong get-out-the-vote effort by Pakistani Brits who were very, =
very -- joined very strongly together to dissuade or discourage some of the=
 racism that has come up for the last few months in Great Britain and
 some of the concepts that may exist even in this country.&nbsp; Some are u=
sing a parallel there, calling it an interesting one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
don&#8217;t know enough about the election in order to offer my own analysi=
s here about what may have motivated the voters of London.&nbsp; But obviou=
sly this is an historic election.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, I=
 want to go back to Zika.&nbsp; Has this administration gotten any word on =
the tests for treatment or the status on what's next for those who have it,=
 and also on efforts to prevent -- what's the status on what's happening?<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t have an updated status for you in terms of the work that's being done=
 at the CDC and the NIH on a range of diagnostic or vaccine development.&nb=
sp; What I do know is there our public health professionals have indicated
 that, if given additional resources, that there's more that they could do =
to speed up the development of critical diagnostic tools and speed up the d=
evelopment of a vaccine.&nbsp; One of the limiting factors is lab capacity,=
 and additional resources could be devoted
 to expanding lab capacity that would allow for the more effective use of d=
iagnostic tests, both in terms of using them more broadly, but also in term=
s of getting a more prompt response to the tests.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing that our pu=
blic health professionals have indicated is that we're going to be relying =
on the private sector to do a lot of the work around vaccine development.&n=
bsp; Particularly when it comes to widespread testing in eventually
 the manufacturing of a vaccine, we're going to rely on the private sector =
that has resources that it can devote to that effort.&nbsp; But we know tha=
t that would require a multiyear commitment on the part of the private sect=
or to produce a vaccine in quantities
 that are that large.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's why we have made =
a strong case to the United States Congress that they don&#8217;t just need=
 to provide funding expeditiously, as a bipartisan group of governors has i=
ndicated, but we also need them to make a longer-term commitment
 to those funds so that the private sector can be confident about making th=
eir own long-term commitment that will be necessary to complete the testing=
 and manufacture of a vaccine that could protect the American people from Z=
ika.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is an urgent effort=
 that requires a long-term commitment.&nbsp; And those are two things that =
Congress isn&#8217;t very good at.&nbsp; They aren&#8217;t very good about =
acting quickly, and they aren&#8217;t very good about making long-term comm=
itments
 to things.&nbsp; But for the good of the American people and for the safet=
y of our public health, we need Congress to act quickly to make a long-term=
 commitment to the resources that our public health professionals need to k=
eep us safe from the Zika virus.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you =
have world health organizations, the CDC, and now the governors and others =
are saying that this is going to be a pandemic.&nbsp; What are the Republic=
ans saying to you or to the President or to leg affairs here, or whomever,
 the reasoning as to why they are not making this an urgent issue right now=
?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Frankly,=
 I don&#8217;t know what good explanation there could be possibly be.&nbsp;=
&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is=
 the explanation they've given you?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, li=
sten, I'll leave it to Republicans to make their own case about what explan=
ation they have for ignoring the advice of our public health professionals,=
 ignoring the urging of our public health professionals, and
 not providing much-needed resources to the effort to combat Zika.&nbsp; We=
 know that there are resources that could be used to expand the use of diag=
nostic tests and to accelerate the development of a vaccine.&nbsp; We also =
know that there are resources that can and
 should be used to fight mosquitos.&nbsp; This is a mosquito-borne illness.=
&nbsp; And if we can provide additional resources to state and local author=
ities who are trying to fight mosquito populations, we can have a positive =
impact on reducing the spread, or potential
 spread of this virus.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there are common-sense t=
hings that Congress can and should be doing to fund the effort to protect t=
he American people from the Zika virus.&nbsp; And for the life of me, I don=
&#8217;t think that anybody can offer up a legitimate explanation
 for why they haven&#8217;t taken these common-sense steps that we know wou=
ld enhance the safety and security of the American people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what=
 do you say to this Democratic congressional leader who says -- they just t=
exted me this -- there's a fear of the GOP looking like they're spending mo=
ney without making cuts elsewhere, as it relates to funding for Zika?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t think the American people are going to think that's a very good excus=
e.&nbsp; When faced with a public health emergency, I don&#8217;t think tha=
t the American people are going to have much sympathy for Republicans who a=
re
 concerned about political criticism from conservative, right-wing ideologu=
es.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think that's a very good excuse for not doing your =
job.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t think the American people are going to think t=
hat's a legitimate excuse if Republican members of Congress
 choose to make it in this case.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And las=
tly, on another subject.&nbsp; Howard, over the weekend -- very powerful.&n=
bsp; How much did the President have input in the speech?&nbsp; It was a st=
rong race speech, I would say.&nbsp; Well, it was -- I would say it was a r=
ace speech.&nbsp; How
 much input did he have in the speech?&nbsp; And when did he decide that it=
 was going to be more of a race speech?&nbsp; As you said, it was kind of m=
oving into the future with all the issues and opportunities and obstacles t=
hat were in front of them, but it was also
 a huge race speech.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The Pres=
ident spent a lot of his own time drafting and revising that speech.&nbsp; =
And I know that he was working on it as recently as Friday afternoon.&nbsp;=
 So this obviously -- this is a speech that reflected his own efforts
 to write and edit and revise the speech in the days leading up to deliveri=
ng it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will th=
ere be one more or maybe two more, or however many more of these kind of sp=
eeches before he leaves?&nbsp; Because he is historically the first black P=
resident in the United States, and he put out some information that we neve=
r
 heard put in the ways he presented them Saturday.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 got eight months to go, so stay tuned.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jon, nice to see you today.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good to=
 see you, Josh.&nbsp; Just a couple other questions.&nbsp; I know you were =
asked last week on this Ben Rhodes profile.&nbsp; One, the article describe=
s Ben as the single-most influential voice shaping American foreign policy,=
 aside from
 the President himself.&nbsp; Is that a characterization that you'd say is =
accurate?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
ere's no denying that Ben's relationship with the President and his close w=
ork with the President on a range of foreign policy issues since President =
Obama was merely
<span style=3D"color:black">a candidate for the Presidency means that the P=
resident relies on Ben for a lot of advice.&nbsp; But what's also true is t=
he President
</span>is fortunate to have a team of national security officials that have=
 a lot of experience working on these issues that the President also relies=
 on.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So certainly somebody lik=
e the Secretary of State, John Kerry, wields a lot of influence when it com=
es to this administration's policy and the President's own thinking.&nbsp; =
The President has for years worked closely
 with Susan Rice -- who's National Security Advisor -- on a range of issues=
.&nbsp; She obviously served at the United Nations representing the United =
States at the United Nations for a number years during the first term.&nbsp=
; So she is somebody who has had both influential
 positions, as well as the kind of relationship with the President that all=
ows her to influence his thinking.&nbsp; Obviously somebody like Ash Carter=
 is somebody who has years of experience working at the Pentagon and at the=
 Department of Defense, and he can use
 that experience to help the President make difficult policy decisions.<spa=
n style=3D"color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"color:blac=
k"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"color:blac=
k">So there are many people who plan an influential role in guiding the Pre=
sident's thinking when it comes to a range of foreign policy issues.&nbsp; =
But Ben is, by all accounts, I think an influential
 figure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"color:blac=
k"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"color:blac=
k">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the things he talks about in this article is =
the foreign policy &quot;blob&quot; as something that the President sought =
to kind of stand against.&nbsp; And the article says, according to Rhodes,
 the blob includes Hillary Clinton, Robert Gates, and other Iraq war promot=
ors from both parties who now whine incessantly about the collapse in Ameri=
can
</span>security in Europe and the Middle East. So I'm just wondering on thi=
s -- the foreign policy blob -- does the White House view that Hillary Clin=
ton is part of that foreign policy blob, or is that just a view of Ben Rhod=
es?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I will=
 say that I've spent a lot of time with Ben over the years, but also on a c=
ouple of foreign trips with long flights just in the last couple of months.=
&nbsp; I have not heard him use the term &quot;blob.&quot;&nbsp;
 I'm not suggesting that he's misquoted; I'm just saying I don&#8217;t know=
 the direct frame of reference in which he used that word.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you =
think Hillary Clinton is part of the foreign policy blob?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'=
m not even sure what that means.&nbsp; But obviously, Secretary Clinton is =
somebody I think I would also put in the category of influencing the Presid=
ent's thinking and influencing this administration's policy --<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's no=
t often we see a major profile of somebody who, in your words at least, is =
an influential voice in the forming American foreign policy, describing Hil=
lary Clinton as something that would -- where the President's stands
 on foreign policy -- a little blob, and whatever you want to use -- it's c=
learly a derogatory description here coming from one of the President's top=
 foreign policy advisors.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, st=
epping back from that specific term, I think what is true is that one of th=
e things that the incoming President of the United States vowed to do in 20=
09 was to bring change to Washington, D.C.&nbsp; And that was interpreted
 in a lot of ways -- first, in terms of his commitment to trying to fight t=
he influence of special interests in Washington.&nbsp; Certainly pursuing a=
 different kind of economic policy than the one that was pursued by the pre=
vious administration.&nbsp; But we've also
 spent a lot of time over the last seven years -- and you certainly have co=
vered a good chunk of this -- sort of pushing back against the foreign poli=
cy establishment in Washington, D.C. that did support what in hindsight wer=
e really bad foreign policy decisions.&nbsp;
 One of them was to invade Iraq in 2003, something that --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support=
ed by Hillary Clinton.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
 MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, something that then State Senator Barack Obama st=
rongly opposed.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
 So I think the point is this -- is that President Obama has worked hard to=
 implement a foreign policy that he believes strongly advances the interest=
s of the United States around the globe, but doesn&#8217;t just
 rely on the conventional wisdom of the foreign policy establishment in Was=
hington, D.C.&nbsp; Certainly the President has benefitted tremendously fro=
m the advice of experienced foreign policy hands inside this
</span>administration.&nbsp; Vice President Biden, Secretary of State John =
Kerry, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Ash =
Carter -- these are all people that have a lot of experience in the nationa=
l security establishment in Washington.&nbsp;
 But what the President has sought to do is to incorporate that advice but =
also to make sure that he&#8217;s thinking smartly about the most effective=
 way to use U.S. influence, to use the United States military to advance ou=
r interests around the globe.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there is a tendency tha=
t's undeniable on the part of the foreign policy establishment in Washingto=
n, D.C. to turn to the military option, in the President&#8217;s view, ofte=
n prematurely.&nbsp; And it is that kind of thinking that contributed
 to -- <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're =
including Ash Carter and Clinton in that foreign policy establishment.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm incl=
uding them in the category of people who&#8217;ve got an enormous amount of=
 foreign policy experience that has been used to give the President excelle=
nt advice when it comes to advancing our national security interests
 and formulating a foreign policy that has made the American people safer.&=
nbsp; I think what is also true is there is a tendency generally when it co=
mes to the debate in Washington, D.C. about the foreign policy establishmen=
t in Washington that makes -- that prioritizes
 the use of the United States military often in a way to sort of protect th=
e strength of the United States.&nbsp; President Obama strongly believes, a=
nd I think many members of his national security team agree, that there are=
 other ways that the United States of
 America can project our strength in a way that better advances our nationa=
l security interests around the globe.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One mor=
e quote from this.&nbsp; This is a quote from Ben in the story I just wonde=
red if you could interpret for me.&nbsp; &#8220;The average reporter we tal=
ked to is 27 years old and their only reporting experience consists of bein=
g around political
 campaigns.&nbsp; That's a sea change.&nbsp; They literally know nothing.&#=
8221;&nbsp; What exactly is he talking about there?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I guess at some point you&#8217;ll have an opportunity to talk to him =
about that quote.&nbsp; I think what is clear is --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that=
 the average reporter you talk to?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
guess, looking around this room, unfortunately -- (laughter) -- not many of=
 us meet that 27-year-old threshold.&nbsp; I think I can speak confidently =
on behalf of --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean,=
 it's kind, but -- (laughter.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Not just=
 young at heart, but also young in age here.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're t=
he ones talking to the 27-year-old spokesmen.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; What I w=
ould say to you is that I can speak confidently on behalf of the President =
and on behalf of the White House that we obviously work hard to engage resp=
ectfully with the White House press corps that is quite serious
 about understanding exactly what&#8217;s happening in the White House and =
describing that situation to your readers and listeners.&nbsp; And I think =
that everybody in this White House has worked hard to engage in that kind o=
f respectful dialogue not just because it advances
 the country&#8217;s interests for the citizens to understand exactly what =
President Obama is doing, but also because it's critically important to our=
 democracy.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President spoke at the =
White House Correspondents&#8217; Dinner just over a week ago where he talk=
ed about how important it is for professional, independent journalists to h=
old people in power accountable.&nbsp; That is critical to the success
 of our democracy, and it is why the President and the rest of us here at t=
he White House have worked hard to engage in that debate in a respectful wa=
y that reflects the need for the American public and our citizens to be inf=
ormed about the issues of the day.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Zika=
, given there&#8217;s an active current threat from the virus in Puerto Ric=
o, and also, of course, strong ties between that island and many cities and=
 states in the mainland, how much concern is there that the island&#8217;s =
financial
 situation could contribute to a more full-blown public health crisis there=
 that could affect the mainland?&nbsp; And if and when, or if Congress even=
tually allocates this money, presumably some of it would go to Puerto Rico,=
 right?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, le=
t me answer that question a couple different ways.&nbsp; Some of the financ=
ial turmoil in Puerto Rico is having a negative impact on the public health=
 care system inside of Puerto Rico, and given the fact that there
 are reported cases of the Zika virus in Puerto Rico, this seems like a pre=
tty bad time for investments in Puerto Rico&#8217;s public health system to=
 be cut.&nbsp; Yet that's exactly what the Puerto Rican government is havin=
g to do because they have not been given the
 restructuring authority that they need by Republicans in Congress.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is a concern about=
 how the interplay between these two issues could have a broader negative i=
mpact not just on the 3 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico but poten=
tially on the U.S. mainland as well.&nbsp; So that's why the
 administration has prioritized both of these issues -- both our efforts to=
 try to address the financial challenges in Puerto Rico, but also to make s=
ure that we are providing the necessary resources to state and local offici=
als across the country to fight
 the Zika virus in their communities.&nbsp; And, yes, that would include pr=
oviding resources to the government in Puerto Rico to, for example, more ef=
fectively concentrate efforts to fight the mosquito population.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And als=
o, on Howard -- there were a lot of things in that speech that were interes=
ting beyond race.&nbsp; The President talked a lot about voting and activis=
m and being a change agent. He talked about how America and the world, incl=
uding
 race relations, in most ways is much better than when he graduated college=
.&nbsp; And he used a line we've heard a lot from him recently, saying that=
 if he had to choose any time in world history to be born, and didn&#8217;t=
 know what your position would be, you&#8217;d choose
 now.&nbsp; That's sounds like an implicit review of the &#8220;make Americ=
a great again&#8221; sloganeering.&nbsp; Can we expect this to be a large p=
art of the message that he delivers on the campaign trail in the coming mon=
ths, maybe particularly to young or diverse crowds?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think -- I can assure you that President Obama delivered a commencement add=
ress at Howard University this weekend with the graduates of Howard Univers=
ity on his mind, with the class of 2016 in universities across
 the country thinking about entering the workforce.&nbsp; And he didn&#8217=
;t have the presidential campaign on his mind.&nbsp; He was focused on thes=
e graduates, and he was focusing on the graduates not just at Harvard but -=
- I'm sorry -- at Howard, but also colleges and
 universities all across the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I recognize that politi=
cal coverage is omnipresent these days.&nbsp; But this was a speech that wa=
s really a message to those graduates.&nbsp; And it does provide a lot of i=
nsight into the way the President thinks about a range of these
 issues and the consequences it has for graduates of Howard and other estee=
med universities across the country.&nbsp; But it was not -- there will be =
ample time for the President to make his election argument to young voters =
across the country, and there may be
 some common themes.&nbsp; But what the President was focused on here was d=
elivering what I think is a powerful message to the voters -- or to the gra=
duates of Howard University.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And las=
t, on Hiroshima.&nbsp; When can we expect a decision on whether the Preside=
nt will go?&nbsp; What&#8217;s being weighed?&nbsp; Is it logistics?&nbsp; =
Is it politics, policy, desire?&nbsp; What sort of is going into the decisi=
on of whether he goes?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e President made an observation in 2009 when he traveled to Japan about his=
 interest in traveling to Hiroshima.&nbsp; Given that the President is sche=
duled to depart for Asia in about a week and a half here, our work
 to plan that trip is something we need to complete relatively soon.&nbsp; =
And so we'll have more information about the President&#8217;s itinerary wh=
en he&#8217;s traveling in Asia relatively soon.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Ron.&nbsp;=
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the =
commencement beat, this photograph of the West Point graduates with the cle=
nched fists, what is the President&#8217;s thought about that as Commander-=
in-Chief?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I didn&#=
8217;t talk to him about it.&nbsp; Obviously the officials at West Point wi=
ll be responsible for enforcing the rules of that institution consistent wi=
th the way that they have been established.&nbsp; At this point, I wouldn't
 weigh in with a view on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief just because I ha=
ven't talked to him about it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because=
 it happened around the same time of his commencement speech at Howard and =
a lot of black pride, so on and so forth.&nbsp; And that seems to be what s=
ome of the cadets are saying that was an expression of.&nbsp; And that's wh=
y I'm
 surprised the President doesn&#8217;t have a thought.&nbsp; There&#8217;s =
no indication of what he thinks about this or feels about this?<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I just h=
aven't talked to him about that particular issue today.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the =
North Carolina situation, I just want to clarify, there was this agency rev=
iew going on about funding and so forth, and now you have the lawsuit, the =
threat.&nbsp; So where does the process stand on funding cuts, potentially,
 to North Carolina because of the law?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Remember=
 these are two different things.&nbsp; The first is there&#8217;s a policy =
question to be answered about what impact this North Carolina law would hav=
e on the way in which the federal government funds some programs in the
 state of North Carolina, and there are a range of agencies that are consid=
ering the policy implications of HB2.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a separate questi=
on that is considered by the Department of Justice, independent of any Whit=
e House judgment, about whether or not HB2
 is consistent with the Civil Rights law -- the Civil Rights Act of 1964, t=
o be specific.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Department of Justi=
ce issued a letter expressing their concerns about the fact that, in their =
view, HB2 is inconsistent with the Civil Rights Act.&nbsp; It does appear t=
hat this is a question that will go to the courts, so I don't
 want to wade into this too far.&nbsp; But the policy review is being condu=
cted at the agency level.&nbsp; It's still ongoing.&nbsp; But the Departmen=
t of Justice question about whether or not this is consistent with the Civi=
l Rights Act is something that will apparently
 be litigated in the courts.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what=
 is the President&#8217;s view about the involvement in terms of these fund=
ing issues?&nbsp; Has he been aggressively pushing the agencies to look at =
this matter?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think it's actually the agencies themselves, shortly after the law was pass=
ed --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right, =
you said that one time, and it seemed a little bit inconceivable about how =
this happens in North Carolina, and then, independently, all these agencies=
, without any direction or motivation, just independently, would look
 at this issue without the President&#8217;s involvement or the White House=
 saying --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
this is an indication that the agencies take their jobs pretty seriously.&n=
bsp; And they certainly are going to coordinate with one another, they&#821=
7;re going to coordinate with the White House and they&#8217;re going to co=
ordinate
 with the Department of Justice as they make these policy decisions.&nbsp; =
We obviously will want to make sure that whatever policy consequences are r=
ealized, that they are consistent across agencies.&nbsp; But that's a proce=
ss that is ongoing.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, yes, the White House is=
 involved in that policy review process, but primarily to coordinate the ac=
tivities of the agencies that are involved.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&=
nbsp; So is it conceivable that this law could defy the civil rights laws y=
et still be consistent with any particular agency&#8217;s policies?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, what these agencies are reviewing right now is what impact the law has=
 on their policies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think=
 the real question is how aggressively is the administration going to go af=
ter the funding of North Carolina now that it clearly believes that this la=
w is violating the civil rights of -- it is not consistent with the civil
 rights law?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Look, I =
don't think this is an issue of going after North Carolina&#8217;s funding.=
&nbsp; I think the question is simply a policy one in terms of evaluating w=
hat impact this law has on policy questions related to funding that North
 Carolina uses a variety of programs inside their state.&nbsp; So this is s=
omething that officials at a variety of agencies will consider.&nbsp; But w=
e will be working to try to coordinate those decisions so that there can be=
 a pretty consistent interpretation of this
 policy across agencies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if =
I can follow up on the 27-year-old reporter -- (laughter.)&nbsp; Just we al=
l make -- is it fair to say that that was -- it's clearly not an accurate c=
omment.&nbsp; Is it fair to say it was an unfortunate comment?&nbsp; Or is =
he going
 to have more to say about that?&nbsp; I mean, it seems like a really -- qu=
ite a putdown, frankly, of the press corps.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
assure you that's -- look, based on the conversations that I've had with Be=
n over the last couple of days, I assure you that's not how it was intended=
.&nbsp; And based on that reaction, I'm confident he would say it
 differently if given the chance.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But, look, all of you hav=
e had multiple opportunities to talk to Ben on a range of foreign policy is=
sues, and I think all of you appreciate the commitment that he has demonstr=
ated to working with all of you to help
 inform your viewers and readers. And I think that's an indication of how s=
eriously Ben takes this process.&nbsp; It certainly is reflective of the ap=
proach that the White House in general has taken to working with reporters,=
 to engaging in a public debate about
 the wisdom of the policies this administration has put forward.&nbsp; And =
Ben has been a persuasive advocate for the President&#8217;s policies, but =
also an eager participant in that debate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not t=
o make this personal about him.&nbsp; It, in fact, raises a larger issue of=
 how the administration views the press corps generally and the relationshi=
p over the -- I haven't been here all eight years, but it
 has been at times, and it should be, contentious.&nbsp; And I guess to wha=
t extent is this some indication that the President&#8217;s thinking about =
the press corps is not perhaps as complimentary as we would like it to be, =
or as positive as we perhaps think it should
 be?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I gues=
s I would encourage you to consider the President&#8217;s own words on this=
, and whether you want to consider the statements that the President made a=
t the Correspondents&#8217; Dinner, or the statements
 that the President delivered to college journalists in this room just a co=
uple days before the Correspondents&#8217; Dinner -- in both settings, the =
President paid tribute to the critically important role that independent jo=
urnalists have in the success of our democracy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I think, look, as you=
 point out, there is built-in friction between the White House press corps =
and the White House. That is always going to be there.&nbsp; And the day th=
at it's not, the day that there is not friction
 between the White House press corps and the White House is the day that yo=
u guys stop doing your jobs.&nbsp; The day that you walk in here and you si=
t in the front row and you say, well, you know what, Josh, I think you just=
 answered all my questions here at the
 briefing, there&#8217;s not another single thing I could possibly ask abou=
t -- that's the day you haven't taken seriously your responsibilities to pu=
sh and prod and hold the administration and the President accountable for t=
he decisions that he&#8217;s making and for
 the consequences of those decisions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I think the fact that=
 I come out here and stand here for an hour, hour and a half every day to a=
nswer your questions is an indication that we take that process quite serio=
usly.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do yo=
u think that in the coming months or weeks that the President might increas=
e his level of engagement with the press?&nbsp; I remember I was struck tha=
t day that he stood here and took about, oh, many, many
 questions from the students, but his interactions with us are, I would say=
, more limited.&nbsp; That's not over the course of the whole -- but the qu=
estion is, can there be -- or given some of what&#8217;s been said here and=
 the thought here, do you think the President
 might rethink the level of access and engagement he has with the press cor=
ps?&nbsp; Does he feel that it's appropriate --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I thin=
k -- look, last Friday, the President stood at this podium and delivered an=
 opening statement and took four questions from people in this room.&nbsp; =
And I think that's an indication of the President&#8217;s
 commitment to engaging with all of you and answering your questions and be=
ing accountable to you and to the American public for the decisions that he=
&#8217;s making.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And, look, if there&#8217=
;s ever a day that you guys walk in this room and say, you know what, I thi=
nk we've heard enough from the President today, or you know what, we've got=
ten all kinds of questions that we've been
 able to ask the President, is the day that you stop doing your job.&nbsp; =
You're supposed to sit there and say, why can't we get more access to the P=
resident?&nbsp; Why can't the President spend more time answering our quest=
ions?&nbsp; That's your job.&nbsp; That's what you're
 supposed to advocate for.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that's the nature of =
our arrangement here.&nbsp; I think the question really is not whether or n=
ot the White House press corps is going to be satisfied with the number of =
questions the President has taken from the
 press corps -- you shouldn&#8217;t be.&nbsp; I think the question is, is t=
here a commitment, institutionally, on the part of the White House that sta=
rts at the top to answer as many questions as possible and spending the tim=
e necessary to help the American people and
 the journalists who cover the White House the most understand exactly what=
&#8217;s happening here.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I think by -- I'm qui=
te proud, and I think the President is quite proud of the efforts that we u=
ndertake on a daily basis to help all of you understand exactly what the Pr=
esident is doing and why he&#8217;s doing
 it.&nbsp; And to be clear, the President understands that's part of his jo=
b.&nbsp; Part of the job of the President of the United States is to commun=
icate with the American public, and certainly to participate and engage in =
a process where you have independent journalists
 who&#8217;ve got years of experience, either on the campaign trail or arou=
nd the world, who are here to hold the President accountable and to hold hi=
s administration accountable.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Again, that is part of wh=
at makes our democracy successful.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ve heard the Preside=
nt make this observation after returning from travels overseas -- well, act=
ually, there&#8217;s a better example of this.&nbsp; The President
 had this conversation with Vladimir Putin on the telephone where President=
 Putin made an observation about some news coverage of the President back h=
ere in Washington.&nbsp; And the President noted to President Putin that wh=
ile President Obama has the opportunity
 to talk to reporters, he doesn&#8217;t have an opportunity to edit their p=
ieces, and that sometimes that makes for a little bumpiness.&nbsp; And some=
times the President feels as if his message is being blurred, but that's pa=
rt of our process.&nbsp; And that's what makes our
 country and our democracy strong.&nbsp; And it's why the President, so wil=
lingly and freely, engages in that process.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Byron.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
s, Josh.&nbsp; Last week, the President granted clemency to 58 nonviolent d=
rug offenders.&nbsp; At the time, you guys noted that he&#8217;s granted mo=
re commutations than the previous six Presidents combined.&nbsp; But when
 it comes to the use of his pardon power, he lags pretty far behind other m=
odern and historical Presidents.&nbsp; He&#8217;s only granted 70 pardons.&=
nbsp; George W. Bush has granted 180.&nbsp; Bill Clinton granted nearly 400=
.&nbsp; Why is the President so reluctant to pardon people?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Byron, we've got eight months to go, so I think it's too early to draw that=
 conclusion.&nbsp; The second thing I would point out is the President has =
been aggressively advocating for criminal justice
 reform legislation.&nbsp; In terms of the potential impact of that legisla=
tion, it would have a positive impact on many more Americans, particularly =
when it comes to bringing greater justice to our criminal justice system.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What&#8217;s also true is=
 this administration has worked hard to upgrade the processes that we have =
in place internally for considering clemency requests.&nbsp; That effort to=
 make that process more efficient has resulted
 in changes both here at the White House and at the Department of Justice t=
o streamline this process.&nbsp; The administration has also worked with ou=
tside organizations, again, to try to make this process function at a highe=
r level.&nbsp; And I think the benefits of
 all of that work is something that we've seen in recent months with an inc=
rease in people who&#8217;ve been granted clemency.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the President is cert=
ainly hopeful that at least over the next eight months that we'll continue =
to benefit from that work.&nbsp; I think what is also true is there&#8217;s=
 no denying that the next President of the United
 States will inherit a <span style=3D"color:black">higher-functioning </spa=
n>clemency system than the one that President Obama inherited.&nbsp; And th=
at also has the potential to make a difference in the lives of Americans wh=
o are ready for a second chance.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But w=
hen it comes to pardons specifically, is there something the President like=
s better about clemency over offering a blanket pardon for a crime?<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No -- =
well, it's hard to answer that question, Byron, just because each of these =
cases are considered on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; So it's hard to make gr=
and pronouncements about the use of the granting
 of clemency in the form of a commutation as opposed to a pardon.&nbsp; <o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But what I can tell you i=
s, after a lot of work, we now have in place a much better system for consi=
dering these kinds of requests.&nbsp; There is a backlog that has built up =
that we're working through.&nbsp; But because
 of improvements at the Department of Justice, because of better coordinati=
on with some outside organizations, and because of a commitment on the part=
 of this President to using this presidential authority to bring more justi=
ce to our criminal justice system,
 we've seen clemency granted at higher rates over the last several months.&=
nbsp; And hopefully that progress will continue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But again, none of this w=
ill ever be a replacement for the kind of criminal justice reform legislati=
on that has bipartisan support in Congress, that would have a much broader =
impact in terms of making our communities
 safer, but also bringing greater justice to our criminal justice system.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One m=
ore on this.&nbsp; A pardon generally restores lost rights, like the right =
to vote or possess a firearm.&nbsp; The commutation does not.&nbsp; Does th=
e administration&#8217;s hesitance to use the pardon power have anything
 to do with the fact that it would restore rights, whether firearms or voti=
ng?&nbsp; And broadly, does the White House believe in the right of ex-felo=
ns to get their rights back, whether to own a firearm or vote, after servin=
g their time?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
again, when it comes to issuing pardons, that is something that is done on =
the merits and is not done with any consideration toward voting rights.&nbs=
p; More generally, I can tell you that it is the
 policy of the administration that we strongly support those who have paid =
their debt to society being given the opportunity to get access to their co=
nstitutional rights once again.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so I know that Govern=

that's something that, in general, the administration has been supportive o=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The wa=
y that this works -- and the Department of Justice can give you some more g=
ranular detail on this -- but there are attorneys at the Department of Just=

 been submitted through the formal process for people who are seeking cleme=
ncy.&nbsp; And those attorneys will review the individual cases, determine =
whether or not they meet a set of criteria.&nbsp; And if they do, they are =
then forwarded to the White House for consideration

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But just to go back to yo=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I know=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we've made clear that=
 once North Korea demonstrates a commitment to coming back into compliance =
with those international obligations, the United States and the rest of the=
 international community would be prepared
 to enter into negotiations with them and begin to give them access to the =
international community that they&#8217;ve been denied for some time now.&n=
bsp; And they&#8217;ve been denied -- been isolated because of their insist=
ence on violating these basic international norms
 that just about everybody else lives up to.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So yo=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; We see=
 this as a piece of -- as a factor that can be incorporated into a broader =
analysis about the situation there.&nbsp; But ultimately, we give greater w=
eight to the actions that North Korea chooses
 to carry out.&nbsp; And there are a set of specific actions that we have m=
ade clear North Korea needs to undertake in order to escape the internation=
al isolation that they face right now.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Nort=
h Carolina, I know you're not going to want to get ahead of where the AG go=
es later today.&nbsp; And we know broadly what the President thinks in term=
s of where North Carolina is with its own laws.&nbsp; But fundamentally, wh=
at are
 the President's views on whether transgender should be a protected status =
under federal law?&nbsp; And has he ever called on Congress to do that?<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'=
m going to have to look this up for you.&nbsp; I know that there has been l=
egislation that has been put forward to consider this specific question, an=
d let me follow up with you if we've taken a specific position on
 this.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think what I can just say=
 generally is -- and you've heard the President say this on a couple of occ=
asions -- the law that was passed by North Carolina, this HB2 law, it's jus=
t mean-spirited because it seeks to discriminate against
 people because of who they are.&nbsp; And it, frankly, is inconsistent wit=
h the kinds of values that we cherish in this country.&nbsp; It's also inco=
nsistent with the economic interests of the state of North Carolina.&nbsp; =
And you've seen a number of businesses indicate
 that they are not willing to invest in North Carolina -- or at least hesit=
ant to invest in North Carolina because of this particular piece of legisla=
tion.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, Deutsche Bank has alr=
eady announced it was cancelling planned expansion of its operations in Car=
y, North Carolina.&nbsp; That expansion would have added 250 jobs to the st=
ate of North Carolina.&nbsp; PayPal announced
 that it was canceling plans to open a global payment center in Charlotte, =
North Carolina, which had been expected to bring 400 jobs to that city.&nbs=
p; You've heard the NBA announce that they were potentially moving the 2017=
 All-Star game.&nbsp; The state of North Carolina
 lost their NBA franchise a few years ago and went to great lengths to try =
to win the confidence of the NBA to get that franchise back there.&nbsp; Ba=
sketball is obviously a cherished pastime of the people of North Carolina, =
and this would just be another setback.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think it is clear exac=
tly what the impact of passing this law has been.&nbsp; And ultimately the =
governor and state legislators will be the ones that will have to defend to=
 the people of North Carolina exactly why they went down this
 route.&nbsp; The irony is, is that the state of North Carolina, for a gene=
ration, has sought to cultivate a business-friendly climate.&nbsp; This was=
 a state whose economy largely rested on the agriculture industry, and they=
've worked hard to develop research and development
 capacities, and to develop Charlotte as a financial hub.&nbsp; And much of=
 that progress has been dealt a setback by the mean-spirited politics of th=
e governor and some Republicans in the state legislature.&nbsp; But exactly=
 how that all gets considered by the people
 of North Carolina is something that they'll have to determine.<o:p></o:p><=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because=
, arguably, the next administration may not have the same interpretation as=
 this administration's Department of Justice.&nbsp; So without that federal=
 protection, you could continue to have these arguments state by state.&nbs=
p; So
 does the President want that?&nbsp; Is he encouraging -- is there any kind=
 of effort on the Hill that he's really trying to court opinion to get this=
 to be protected status?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Let me t=
ake a look at our record on this and see if I can get you some specifics ab=
out what legislation we have supported in Congress.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a r=
eally quick one.&nbsp; In that same New York Times piece, there was mention=
 of the President's two letters -- or two that we know of -- that were writ=
ten to the Supreme Leader of Iran, or to Iran's leadership at least.&nbsp; =
And
 in the article, it framed it saying that Panetta, CIA chief, then SecDef,w=
as not included or consulted on the letters when they were written, and had=
 no knowledge of them.&nbsp; At least that's how it was made in the article=
.&nbsp; Can you confirm that to be the case?&nbsp;
 Or can you explain who was part of the writing of these letters to the Ira=
nian leadership?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I can't =
account for who may have been in the loop on the writing of those letters a=
nd who wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; Obviously, the President drew upon the advice of=
 his national security team in terms of trying to pursue a diplomatic
 opening with the Supreme Leader and with other leading officials in Iran.&=
nbsp; But I, frankly, can't speak to whether or not then-CIA Director Leon =
Panetta was shown a draft of the letter before it was sent.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it =
would suggest, or some are definitely interpreting that as an indication th=
at perhaps he was not one of the top national security advisors to the Pres=
ident, or considered to be someone who needed to be in the know in the
 room and consulted with on something that was pretty substantial in terms =
of outreach.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Listen, =
I assure you that President Obama would not have made the decision to promo=
te his CIA Director to be the Secretary of Defense if he didn&#8217;t have =
complete confidence in the advice and wisdom that he was receiving
 from Leon Panetta.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will yo=
u able, you think, to tell us who was part of that drafting of those letter=
s?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'll tak=
e a look and see if we can get you some more details on that, but I can't p=
romise that we'll have any information on it.<o:p></o:p></p>

 Josh.&nbsp; I'm not sure if you made this clear, but has the President -- =
do you know if the President has read that New York Times magazine article =
about Ben?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, g=

nder this deal you will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relates t=

p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nbsp=
; To their nuclear facilities, there is 24/7 access to Iran's -- to verify =
their compliance with the agreement.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24/7 ac=
cess, anytime, anywhere.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; To their=
 nuclear facilities.&nbsp; That's the quote you just read me, right?<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nb=
sp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Okay.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you=
 state categorically that no senior official in this administration has eve=
r lied publicly about any aspect of the Iran nuclear deal?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Kevin, I=
 think the facts of this agreement and the benefits of this agreement make =
clear that the national security of the United States of America has been e=
nhanced, and Iran's effort to acquire a nuclear weapon has
 been set back.&nbsp; In fact, Iran has now committed to not seeking to acq=
uire to a nuclear weapon, and we can now verify that they're not able to ac=
quire a nuclear weapon.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">It is our critics who eit=
her falsely or just wrongly suggested that Iran would never go along with t=
he agreement.&nbsp; They have.&nbsp; They falsely or wrongly suggested that=
 we would never be able to verify through the
 international community that Iran would abide by the agreement.&nbsp; They=
 have.&nbsp; It is our critics who have suggested that Iran would experienc=
e hundreds of billions of dollars in benefits -- a financial windfall from =
this agreement.&nbsp; They have not.&nbsp; In fact,
 we have seen the Iran government complain about the fact that they haven&#=
8217;t gotten the kind of financial benefits that they expected.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I recognize that there i=
s an attempt by those who either lied or got it wrong to try to relitigate =
this fight.&nbsp; But the fact of the matter is, when you take a look at th=
e concrete results of this agreement, Iran is not able to obtain
 a nuclear weapon; we can verify that their nuclear program is only focused=
 on peaceful purposes; and we have succeeded in making the United States sa=
fer, in make Israel safer, and making our partners in the region safer beca=
use Iran is not able to obtain a
 nuclear weapon.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This wasn&#8217;t just a =
priority identified by President Obama.&nbsp; Preventing Iran from obtainin=
g a nuclear weapon was a priority that was identified by Prime Minister Net=
anyahu and other leaders in the Gulf that work
 closely with the United States to advance our national security.&nbsp; Tha=
t's the crux of this argument.&nbsp; And the facts indicate that the strate=
gy that the President laid out was remarkably successful.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just =
want to make sure -- I want to give you another run on it, because I'm not =
sure if you misspoke.&nbsp; I said, can you state categorically that no sen=
ior official in this administration ever lied publicly about any aspect of
 the deal.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; There is=
 no evidence that that ever occurred.&nbsp; And what I would encourage you =
and other critics of the deal to do is to look at the facts and to look at =
the results.&nbsp; We can verify them now, and the facts are clear.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last we=
ek, you called the House Republican plan to prioritize military readiness c=
oncerns and have war funding expire next April as grossly irresponsible.&nb=
sp; And yet back in, I think it was 2008, then-Senator Obama, and Senator
 Clinton, for that matter, voted for a similar timeline.&nbsp; Can you squa=
re the difference?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
aware of that vote in 2008.&nbsp; We can always take a look at it.&nbsp; Bu=
t I'm sure it was different.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. &=
nbsp;I can actually read that to you, if you&#8217;d like.&nbsp; But I can =
send it to you, if you prefer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; We'll fo=
llow up.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, t=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; Senator Hatch was here at the White House today for the basket=
ball team event.&nbsp; He, of course, is a Republican who has spoken in com=
plimentary terms in the past about the nominee for the Supreme Court openin=
g.&nbsp;
 Did the President have a chance to have any private conversations with the=
 Senator today on that topic?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
aware of any specific private conversations the President may have had.&nbs=
p; But if they're private conversations, we probably wouldn&#8217;t talk ab=
out them publicly anyway.&nbsp; But certainly President Obama and Senator H=
atch
 agree about the historical significance of the exciting 1983 NCAA champion=
ship game.&nbsp; And the President was honored to welcome the national cham=
pion North Carolina State Wolfpack Men's Basketball Team to the White House=
 today.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Don=
ald Trump has been talking about how he would approach U.S. debt, and there=
 seems to be some inconsistencies in how he says he would approach that.&nb=
sp; But one of the things he's proposed is he'd be open to renegotiating U.=
S.
 debt in case the economy were to tank.&nbsp; That's not the approach that =
the President took when he was new in office.&nbsp; But what does he think =
about that idea being floated right now from the Republican nominee?<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Over the=
 course of the President's seven years in office, you've had multiple oppor=
tunities to evaluate the priority that the President has placed on protecti=
ng the full faith and credit of the United States of America.&nbsp;
 We saw an effort by congressional Republicans in 2011 to hold hostage the =
full faith and credit of the United States to accomplish some of their ideo=
logical aims.&nbsp; The President stood steadfast and has made clear time a=
nd time again that he's committed to
 protecting the full faith and credit of the United States.&nbsp; <o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President made that a p=
riority throughout a series of rancorous budget negotiations with congressi=
onal Republicans, because this is a principle that is critical to our natio=
n's short-term and long-term economic health.&nbsp; The United
 States of America is a global leader when it comes to our economic strengt=
h, because the world has confidence in the full faith and credit of the Uni=
ted States.&nbsp; And the President does not believe that that full faith a=
nd credit should be subjected to negotiation
 or the threat of hostage-taking. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the President has made t=
his a priority.&nbsp; That is a priority that other American Presidents -- =
in fact, every other American President has made clear that protecting the =
full faith and credit of the United States is critically important,
 Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp; And the President's effort to protect the=
 full faith and credit of the United States has been strongly endorsed by t=
he American business community because they understand the repercussions th=
at our economy would sustain if that
 were called into question. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the President's view on =
all of this I think is clear, based on a track record that all of you can e=
valuate.&nbsp; But I'll let the individual presidential candidates make the=
 case for why that should change if that's what they believe.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks =
a lot, Josh.&nbsp; Just a question regarding the ballistic missile test whi=
ch was recently conducted by Iran.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'd just=
 note, John, that the defense minister of Iran, shortly before I came out h=
ere, came out and said that that missile test did not take place.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's =
interesting.&nbsp; The Pentagon claims that -- we have a Pentagon source th=
at says that it did indeed take place.&nbsp; But let me go forward as it re=
lates just to the issue of ballistic missile tests.&nbsp; There have been a=
 number of
 them since the Iran nuclear deal.&nbsp; And as Iran points out, rightly so=
, this is not in violation of the Iran nuclear deal, but it does appear to =
be in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution.&nbsp; What are the=
 consequences of that violation of the U.N.
 Security Council resolution?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Jo=
hn, as you point out, the United Nations has expressed concerns with Iran's=
 continued development of a ballistic missile program.&nbsp; So those were =
concerns that were expressed by the United Nations both before the
 completion of an international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a =
nuclear weapon.&nbsp; Those were concerns that we have expressed even in th=
e aftermath of the deal.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the United States contin=
ues to work with the international community to impose costs on Iran to imp=
ose sanctions on Iran because of their violation of these international vio=
lations.&nbsp; What President Obama has also sought to do is
 to deepen our coordination with our partners in the Gulf who are most dire=
ctly threatened by Iran's ballistic missile program.&nbsp; And that was the=
 substance of extensive negotiations that the President had with our GCC pa=
rtners in Saudi Arabia just a couple
 of weeks ago.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President believes that=
 both by providing some additional expertise, but also helping the Gulf Coa=
st -- the GCC partners work more effectively to coordinate their efforts, t=
hat we can actually strengthen the ability of our partners
 to counter that threat.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we've also indicated s=
hould be done -- and the United States has worked effectively with our part=
ners in this regard, too -- is to improve our interdiction efforts to make =
it harder for Iran to obtain, through illicit means, materials
 and resources and expertise that could be used to benefit their ballistic =
missile program.&nbsp; So we've worked hard to do that, as well, with some =
success.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So our strategy to counter =
Iran's ballistic missile program is one that's rooted in our ability to wor=
k with the international community to achieve this objective.&nbsp; I think=
 what is clear is that the world is safer because we can definitively
 say that there is no chance that Iran is going to put a nuclear weapon at =
the top of one of those ballistic missiles because of the international eff=
ort that was led by Barack Obama to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear w=
eapon.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So do y=
ou not anticipate the U.N. Security Council imposing any type of additional=
 sanctions on Iran for their ballistic missile testing?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That cer=
tainly is a possibility.&nbsp; It always it.&nbsp; But again, in this parti=
cular case, there are doubts about whether that actually occurred, because =
the Iran defense minister said on the record that it didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; Bu=
t we
 obviously have ways to evaluate that, and we'll work with the internationa=
l community to do so.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it =
a mistake that this particular issue -- ballistic missile testing -- was no=
t included in the Iran nuclear deal?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, agai=
n, because our focus in the context of the Iran deal was to work with the i=
nternational community to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.&nbs=
p; That was the number one threat, I think for obvious reasons.&nbsp;
 The concerns the international community, including the United States, has=
 about Iran's ballistic missile program are longstanding concerns.&nbsp; Th=
ose concerns continue.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Our efforts to counter th=
eir ballistic missile program haven&#8217;t waned in the aftermath of the I=
ran deal. In fact, we've actually stepped up our efforts to coordinate with=
 our GCC partners, with Saudi Arabia and with
 Israel, both to put in place an architecture to counter Iran's ballistic m=
issile program, but also to ramp up enforcement of international sanctions =
that prevent Iran from being able to acquire resources and materials throug=
h illicit means.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we've stepped up that co=
ordination, and we're going to continue to apply pressure to Iran to come i=
nto compliance with their international obligations.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Mexic=
an judge just ruled that El Chapo can be extradited to the United States.&n=
bsp; Do you happen to know, Josh, where he might be incarcerated or when th=
e timing of that might happen?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I wasn&#=
8217;t aware of this announcement.&nbsp; It may have just occurred in the l=
ast hour or so.&nbsp; What I will say is that the Department of Justice has=
, for years now, filed charged against Mr. Guzman.&nbsp; These are charges =
that
 have been in place for years.&nbsp; And as a result of those charges, the =
United States has sought extradition and to bring him to justice in U.S. co=
urts.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But obviously that requires=
 the Department of Justice to work with the Mexican government.&nbsp; They =
have him in custody now. And so for updates on those efforts, I'd refer you=
 to the Department of Justice.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al Qaed=
a chief, Ayman al-Zawahiri, released an audio tape over the weekend -- his =
first since January -- urging jihadists to unify in Syria.&nbsp; Given al Q=
aeda's diminished stature these days, particularly in Syria, how important
 are these utterances anymore in the context of the fight there?<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ga=
rdiner, we obviously take quite seriously the threat that is posed by al Qa=
eda and other extremists that seek to carry out violence against the United=
 States or our interests around the world.&nbsp; And the President
 has been vigilant about countering that threat.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Let me give you a good ex=
ample.&nbsp; This is an announcement that was made, I believe, over the wee=
kend by my colleagues at United States Central Command.&nbsp; They announce=
d that in the last week in April, the United States
 military had conducted four counterterrorism airstrikes against al Qaeda f=
igures in Yemen.&nbsp; Yemen is a place that, despite all the turmoil that'=
s there, that we
<span style=3D"color:black">don&#8217;t talk </span>a lot about in here, bu=
t it is a place where we know that some of the world's most dangerous terro=
rists are seeking to establish a foothold and plot and plan against the Uni=
ted States. And these counterterrorism strikes
 are an indication that the President takes quite seriously the threat from=
 AQAP that emanates from Yemen.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But more generally, we ha=
ve talked a lot in here about the effort to degrade and ultimately destroy =
ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.&nbsp; And the President has laid out a comprehen=
sive strategy for doing so.&nbsp; He's assembled
 a coalition of 65 nations to work with the United States to degrade and ul=
timately destroy that organization.&nbsp; We know there are other extremist=
 organizations that are operating in Syria, in particular, and there have b=
een U.S. airstrikes conducted against
 leading figures and fighters who are associated with those other extremist=
 networks.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the President is well =
aware that there are dangers that emanate from Iraq and in Syria, and that =
would explain the robust response, both militarily and otherwise, from the =
United States to protect the American
 people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Thanks a lot, everybody.&=
nbsp; We'll see you tomorrow.<o:p></o:p></p>
