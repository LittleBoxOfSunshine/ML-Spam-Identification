POLITICO: Marco Rubio-backed insurance market covers 80 people<http://www.p=
olitico.com/story/2015/04/marco-rubio-florida-insurance-market-117055.html>
In 2008, while Democrats were declaring that the time was right for nationa=
l health care reform, Marco Rubio, the speaker of the Florida House, had a =
ready response: Florida should build a market-based system that would help =
contain the cost of insurance and make it more available.
Rubio pushed his no-mandate health insurance exchange, dubbed Florida Healt=
h Choices, through the state Legislature that year. "It's about competition=
, it's about choice, and it's about the marketplace," he told The Palm Beac=
h Post at the time.
Florida Health Choices, which finally opened last year, now covers 80 peopl=
e.
Obamacare, which Rubio wants to repeal, covers 1.6 million in Florida alone=
. And 93 percent <http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2015/MarketPlaceEnroll=
ment/Mar2015/ib_2015mar_enrollment.pdf> of them are subsidized.
Rubio started pushing his vision well before Barack Obama entered the White=
 House and began work on what would become the Affordable Care Act. But by =
the time Florida Health Choices launched post-Obamacare, the response by Fl=
oridians was tepid. The newly declared GOP presidential candidate didn't in=
clude it in his campaign's vision for how to repeal and replace the federal=
 law. Nor did he mention it in a recent Fox News op-ed headlined "My three =
part plan for the post-Obamacare era."
By the Feb. 15 Obamacare enrollment deadline, Florida Health Choices had si=
gned up 56 individuals, and as of the middle of this week it had gained 24 =
more, CEO Rose Naff said in an interview. The state has set aside $2.4 mill=
ion for the exchange since 2008 - an initial $1.5 million infusion that yea=
r and $900,000 in 2013.
Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said the senator continues to support a "tr=
ue free-market exchange," and she blamed Obamacare's subsidies for luring b=
uyers away from Florida Health Choices.
"What's in Obamacare is neither free-market or truly an exchange," she said=
. "It is unfortunate that this disastrous health care law is impacting the =
Florida Health Choices program, which is exactly the kind of consumer-based=
 health care solution Americans are looking for."
But critics say the struggles of the Florida plan illustrate the vast hurdl=
es that Rubio and other Republican presidential candidates would face in se=
eking to replace Obamacare with a market-oriented plan - their usual answer=
 to how they would cover the millions of people now insured under the Affor=
dable Care Act. The Florida plan may be voluntary. It may be an easy way to=
 shop online, either for health insurance or smaller dental or vision polic=
ies. But it doesn't subsidize low-income or middle-class families the way O=
bamacare does.
"It makes sense that he doesn't talk about it right now," Ron Pollack, exec=
utive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group that supports Oba=
macare, said of Rubio. Referring to the subsidies, Pollack added, "The noti=
on of promoting coverage in a way that does not enable people to get one of=
 the significant benefits of the Affordable Care Act ... is really harmful =
and would cause millions of people to be far worse off than they are today.=
"
Florida's Naff has a different perspective, saying, "I know the numbers see=
m small, but it's been steady." She added, "There is really no rational com=
parison between HealthCare.gov<http://healthcare.gov/> and Florida Health C=
hoices. We're not giving it away."
Obamacare's been big in Florida, which has signed up more people than any o=
ther state. And that happened even though Republican Gov. Rick Scott and th=
e Legislature have refused to set up a state exchange that meets ACA requir=
ements or expand Medicaid.
Rubio included Florida Health Choices in his 2006 book, "100 Innovative Ide=
as for Florida's Future." In the state Legislature, he clashed over it with=
 then-Gov. Charlie Crist, who Rubio would go on to defeat in the 2010 Senat=
e race. A report<http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/FileStores/Web/HouseContent/=
Approved/Announcements/Uploads/Documents/interim_projects/2007-2008%20Inter=
im%20Projects%20Full%20Report.pdf> from Rubio's office when he was Florida =
House speaker said his plan relied on "sound market principles" and "challe=
nges the way health care is currently financed and purchased."
Exchanges as a concept have garnered backing from Republicans for years. In=
 Massachusetts, then-Gov. Mitt Romney built the state's health care reform =
plan around exchanges in a system that was the precursor to Obamacare. Form=
er Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour pushed for his state to create an exchang=
e before Obama was in the White House. Utah also had a version for small bu=
sinesses.
But that backing of exchanges didn't translate into support for Obamacare. =
To the contrary, conservatives saw the ACA exchanges as a corruption of the=
ir idea, too heavily regulated, too filled with mandates.
Rubio has long called for repeal of the Democrats' health law, and he stres=
sed that again as he formally announced his 2016 presidential run in Miami =
on Monday evening. He has also pitched broad outlines of a "replace" plan, =
drawing on ideas often floated by conservatives like letting people buy ins=
urance across state lines. But his outline doesn't make any mention of inco=
rporating exchanges, even a slimmed-down version akin to Florida Health Cho=
ices.
In the Fox News op-ed<http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/03/23/my-three-pa=
rt-plan-for-post-obamacare-era/>, Rubio called for "advanceable, refundable=
 tax credits that all Americans can use to purchase health insurance." He a=
lso suggested he would target the current tax breaks for job-based insuranc=
e and set up high-risk pools to help people with costly pre-existing medica=
l conditions get coverage.
Obamacare will almost certainly still be an issue in the 2016 campaign. But=
 how it plays out five years after passage, and what kind of detail voters =
will be seeking from candidates, is not yet clear.
Jamie Burnett, a Republican strategist based in the crucial primary state o=
f New Hampshire, said Obamacare will still resonate in the campaign, but he=
alth care will likely be talked about in the broader context of the economy=
 rather than a singular battle cry.
"I think people will want to talk about where things stand today. Is this r=
eally what we should have done, and is there a better way to get at it whil=
e preserving some common things that people agree on?" Burnett said. If a R=
epublican candidate doesn't have a clear and compelling message for moving =
beyond the Affordable Care Act, he added, "I think that's going to be very =
problematic for them and their candidacy."
A Democratic nominee could potentially use the low enrollment figures from =
Florida Health Choices against Rubio should he secure the nomination, but t=
he state-focused issue may not matter to most voters, Burnett said.
Other Republicans in Florida say they aren't worried about the low enrollme=
nt figures.
"If I'm selling hamburgers, and across the street they're selling hamburger=
s for free or subsidized, I know my outlook is not going to be as good," sa=
id state Sen. Aaron Bean, who played a large role in creating the Florida e=
xchange. "But who knows where [the ACA's] going to end up."
Ironically, some health care experts think the Rubio-envisioned state excha=
nge could be Obamacare's salvation in Florida if the Supreme Court rules ag=
ainst the Obama administration in King v. Burwell - which would result in 3=
4 states, including Florida, being cut off from the law's subsidies.
That would mean the subsidies could flow only through state exchanges. Flor=
ida Health Choices could pave the way for that state-run exchange, but not =
without some pretty big changes.
"It is a base state exchange that the state could work from or use as a rap=
id contracting vehicle," said Cindy Gillespie, a senior managing director a=
t McKenna Long & Aldridge who worked on the Massachusetts exchange. But Flo=
rida would need to pass legislation to make it fully compliant with the ACA=
, she said.
Some Florida lawmakers, like Bean, have no intention of doing that.
"This gives us our independence," he said of the current program. "This is =
Florida's version."

<span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt">Exchanges as a concept have garnered backi=
ng from Republicans for years. In Massachusetts, then-Gov. Mitt Romney buil=
t the state&#8217;s health care reform plan around exchanges in a system th=
at was the precursor to Obamacare. Former
 Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour pushed for his state to create an exchange =
before Obama was in the White House. Utah also had a version for small busi=
nesses.</span><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

lt:auto;line-height:21.0pt">
<span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt">But that backing of exchanges didn&#8217;t=
 translate into support for Obamacare. To the contrary, conservatives saw t=
he ACA exchanges as a corruption of their idea, too heavily regulated, too =
filled with mandates.</span><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></s=

<span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt">Rubio has long called for repeal of the De=
mocrats&#8217; health law, and he stressed that again as he formally announ=
ced his 2016 presidential run in Miami on Monday evening. He has also pitch=
ed broad outlines of a &#8220;replace&#8221; plan, drawing
 on ideas often floated by conservatives like letting people buy insurance =
across state lines. But his outline doesn&#8217;t make any mention of incor=
porating exchanges, even a slimmed-down version akin to Florida Health Choi=
ces.</span><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt">Obamacare will almost certainly still be a=

<span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt">Jamie Burnett, a Republican strategist bas=

 resonate in the campaign, but health care will likely be talked about in t=

 rather than a singular battle cry.</span><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt">=

<span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt">&#8220;I think people will want to talk ab=
out where things stand today. Is this really what we should have done, and =
is there a better way to get at it while preserving some common things that=
 people agree on?&#8221; Burnett said. If a Republican
 candidate doesn&#8217;t have a clear and compelling message for moving bey=
