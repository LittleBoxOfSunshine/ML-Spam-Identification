Thanks Alex. Unfortunately 5pm is going to be too late for us. Any chance y=
ou have availability before 2pm? If not, would something tomorrow work by c=
hance?

Let me know and we can figure out something that works for everyone.

Thanks!

Hi Tim,

Great to hear from you! I'm looping in Meagan here from the Jefferson. It s=
ounds like Thursday's a pretty busy day for them. Would it be possible to m=
eet at 5pm at the Jefferson? Meagan, does that work best for your team?

Thanks!

Hey Jordan,

Bobby tells me that you'd be the right POC for the upcoming DNC roundtable =
with POTUS on the 18th, correct? We'd ideally like to setup a walkthrough t=

Advance team to link up with for the meeting.

Thanks a lot,
