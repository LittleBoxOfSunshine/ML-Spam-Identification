Gentlemen -- I wanted touch touch base with some guidance of how we want to
be talking about the map for the general.  We don't want to name states
beyond the Obama map in 2012.


Let me know if you have any questions.


Zac


Trump Map:

   - This presidential election--like all of them in the last 20
   years--will be very competitive. We will have to fight hard for every vote.
   - We'll be examining this more closely as states move beyond the
   primaries and some polarizing contests, but we expect the battleground
   states to look very similar to 2012. Given the results in 2012, this would
   mean Trump would have to make major inroads into states that President
   Obama won in both 2008 and 2012 to win.
   - Since the last election, demographic changes have made states like
   Florida and North Carolina even more competitive for Democrats.
   - When it comes to partisanship, we're a fairly evenly divided country,
   but this is likely the first time in a generation where we may have a
   better opportunity to appeal to more Republicans.
   - Biggest threat to Democrats holding the White House is complacency.
   Every Democrat needs to take Donald Trump at his word that he will do
   everything he says he will--and Democrats need to turn out for Hillary
   Clinton and Democrats up and down the ticket.
