GOP likely to revoke Nevada's early-state status

'Nevada does nothing for us,' says one RNC committeeman.

Nevada is likely to lose its place as the first Western state to vote in th=
e Republican presidential nomination contest, several GOP leaders tell POLI=
TICO.

For three successive elections, the state has been grouped in the vaunted c=
lass of early-voting states, joining Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina=
 as the bellwethers that garner the most attention from presidential candid=
ates and help winnow voters=92 choices. But for the third straight primary =
season, Nevada=92s caucuses have been wracked by embarrassing procedural er=
rors<http://www.mediaite.com/online/shtshow-political-twitter-flooded-with-=
problems-arising-from-nevada-caucuses/>, low turnout, confusion among atten=
dees<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/nevada-caucuses-republicans-2195=
94> and questions about the integrity of the process<http://www.politico.co=
m/news/stories/0212/72480_Page2.html>.

Story Continued Below

Republican National Committee members say there=92s growing momentum behind=
 an effort to strip Nevada of its early place in line =97 handing it instea=
d to either Colorado or Arizona.

=93The long knives are out for Nevada,=94 said one RNC committeeman. =93Nev=
ada does nothing for us.=94

The review of the state=92s pecking order is likely to be just one piece of=
 the GOP=92s wholesale review of a nominating process that just produced on=
e of the most acrimonious primary seasons in memory and ended with Donald T=
rump as the party=92s nominee.

The RNC=92s Rules Committee is expected to address the issue when it conven=
es in July prior to the national convention in Cleveland. And its recommend=
ations will be passed to a committee of convention delegates that has the u=
ltimate say.

The early states are the subject of perennial debate among Republican leade=
rs, who wonder whether they=92re the best suited to thin the field of presi=
dential contenders. Texas=92s GOP chairman Tom Mechler and Utah RNC Committ=
eewoman Enid Mickelsen proposed in January to eliminate all four early stat=
es=92 protected status =96 and they=92ve been targeted before. Typically, t=
hose debates fade once the presidential nomination process is over =96 and =
the presumptive GOP nominee generally defends these states=92 hallowed posi=
tion.

But Nevada, a state where Trump crushed rivals by more than 20 percentage p=
oints, is unlikely to escape the axe this time, Republican leaders argue.

=93They will not tamper with the [broader] rule,=94 said one national conve=
ntion delegate and veteran Republican leader. =93But Nevada is likely to go=
.

Bruce Hough, Utah=92s RNC committeeman, supports eliminating all early stat=
es in favor of a randomized primary calendar. But he argued that Nevada, in=
 particular, hasn=92t earned its status.

=93You have to demonstrate that you have a solid political organization, wh=
ich your party is capable of running,=94 he said. Hough noted that Nevada=
=92s neighbors came to its aid in 2012 to help the state through its caucus=
 woes. =93It was almost like a shadow party there four years ago,=94 he sai=
d. =93There are a bunch of issues they have to resolve.=94

Nevada GOP chairman Michael McDonald did not respond to requests for commen=
t. But not all Nevada GOP leaders are planning to go quietly. Nevada=92s RN=
C Committeewoman Diana Orrock said she=92s open to an early-state rotation =
=96 but only if it applies to all four regions of the country. She=92d figh=
t any effort to single out Nevada for punishment.

=93I will vigorously fight against that because it should be equally applie=
d,=94 she said. Noting that the state only has six electoral votes, Orrock =
added, =93If we don=92t have early carve-out status, candidates aren=92t go=
ing to bother coming to Nevada.=94

Not all Nevadans are surprised they=92d be in the party=92s crosshairs.

=93As much as I would hate to see the caucus stripped from NV, given how ha=
rd many of us worked to get it, the concern is understandable,=94 said Pete=
r Ernaut, a veteran Nevada GOP strategist who=92s advised Gov. Brian Sandov=
al and Sen. John Ensign. =93Maybe it's time to take the microphone away unt=
il some level of civility returns. I am tired of my home state being a publ=
ic spectacle. Nevada is better than this.=94

Most RNC members contacted declined to be named to avoid antagonizing colle=
agues in Nevada, but seven interviewed agreed that momentum is growing to b=
ox out Nevada from the 2020 early-state group.

=93They had that embarrassment four years ago when they couldn=92t figure o=
ut who won,=94 said one RNC committeeman. =93As a state they have little cr=
edibility with other members.=94

Instead, RNC members are looking for a state with more strategic value. Lik=
e Nevada, Colorado and Arizona feature large Latino populations. And Colora=
do, in particular, has become a crucial swing state in the general election=
. Though Nevada, too, is considered a swing state, its caucuses =96 130 loc=
ations across 17 counties this year =96 lend themselves to low turnout and =
do little to build up the Republican Party for the fall campaign, the RNC o=
fficials argued.

Colorado is preparing to vie for the opportunity to supplant Nevada.

=93We are absolutely working on the strategy to try to put ourselves in tha=
t position,=94 said Colorado GOP chairman Steve House.

House has pushed state lawmakers to enact legislation establishing a statew=
ide presidential primary, which he said RNC members would view favorably. T=
he bill is being actively considered by lawmakers but has only cleared earl=
y procedural hurdles.

House said Colorado Democrats are generally on board as well. =93If we can =
turn this into a presidential primary state, then we can make a very good c=
ase for being the first state in the West,=94 he said.

Hough, the Utah RNC committeeman, said other states should be in the mix to=
o =96 including his own.

=93If you want to reward Republicanism, then why not Utah that has had a gr=
eat string of Republican governors and dominant state legislatures?=94 he w=
ondered. =93I don=92t hold any hope that little old Utah would be in the mi=
x. But hey, I would certainly argue the case.=94
