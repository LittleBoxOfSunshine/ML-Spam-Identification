Just What Were Donald Trump's Ties to the Mob?<http://www.politico.com/maga=

in his signature book, The Art of the Deal, Donald Trump boasted that when =
he wanted to build a casino in Atlantic City, he persuaded the state attorn=
ey general to limit the investigation of his background to six months. Most=
 potential owners were scrutinized for more than a year. Trump argued that =
he was =93clean as a whistle=94=97young enough that he hadn=92t had time to=
 get into any sort of trouble. He got the sped-up background check, and eve=
ntually got the casino license.

But Trump was not clean as a whistle. Beginning three years earlier, he=92d=
 hired mobbed-up firms to erect Trump Tower and his Trump Plaza apartment b=
uilding in Manhattan, including buying ostensibly overpriced concrete from =
a company controlled by mafia chieftains Anthony =93Fat Tony=94 Salerno and=
 Paul Castellano. That story eventually came out in a federal investigation=
, which also concluded that in a construction industry saturated with mob i=
nfluence, the Trump Plaza apartment building most likely benefited from con=
nections to racketeering. Trump also failed to disclose that he was under i=
nvestigation by a grand jury directed by the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, who=
 wanted to learn how Trump obtained an option to buy the Penn Central railr=
oad yards on the West Side of Manhattan.


These questions ate at me as I wrote about Atlantic City for The Philadelph=
ia Inquirer, and then went more deeply into the issues in a book, Temples o=
f Chance: How America Inc. Bought Out Murder Inc. to Win Control of the Cas=
ino Business. In all, I=92ve covered Donald Trump off and on for 27 years, =
and in that time I=92ve encountered multiple threads linking Trump to organ=
ized crime. Some of Trump=92s unsavory connections have been followed by in=
vestigators and substantiated in court; some haven=92t. And some of those l=
inks have continued until recent years, though when confronted with evidenc=
e of such associations, Trump has often claimed a faulty memory. In an Apri=
l 27 phone call to respond to my questions for this story, Trump told me he=
 did not recall many of the events recounted in this article and they =93we=
re a long time ago.=94 He also said that I had =93sometimes been fair, some=
times not=94 in writing about him, adding =93if I don=92t like what you wri=
te, I=92ll sue you.=94Why did Trump get his casino license anyway? Why didn=
=92t investigators look any harder? And how deep did his connections to cri=
minals really go?

I=92m not the only one who has picked up signals over the years. Wayne Barr=
ett, author of a 1992 investigative biography of Trump=92s real-estate deal=
ings, has tied Trump to mob and mob-connected men.

No other candidate for the White House this year has anything close to Trum=
p=92s record of repeated social and business dealings with mobsters, swindl=
ers, and other crooks. Professor Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian=
, said the closest historical example would be President Warren G. Harding =
and Teapot Dome, a bribery and bid-rigging scandal in which the interior se=
cretary went to prison. But even that has a key difference: Harding=92s ass=
ociates were corrupt but otherwise legitimate businessmen, not mobsters and=
 drug dealers.

This is part of the Donald Trump story that few know. As Barrett wrote in h=
is book, Trump didn=92t just do business with mobbed-up concrete companies:=
 he also probably met personally with Salerno at the townhouse of notorious=
 New York fixer Roy Cohn, in a meeting recounted by a Cohn staffer who told=
 Barrett she was present. This came at a time when other developers in New =
York were pleading with the FBI to free them of mob control of the concrete=
 business.

From the public record and published accounts like that one, it=92s possibl=
e to assemble a clear picture of what we do know. The picture shows that Tr=
ump=92s career has benefited from a decades-long and largely successful eff=
ort to limit and deflect law enforcement investigations into his dealings w=
ith top mobsters, organized crime associates, labor fixers, corrupt union l=
eaders, con artists and even a one-time drug trafficker whom Trump retained=
 as the head of his personal helicopter service.

Now that he=92s running for president, I pulled together what=92s known =96=
 piecing together the long history of federal filings, court records, biogr=
aphical anecdotes, and research from my and Barrett=92s files. What emerges=
 is a pattern of business dealings with mob figures=97not only local figure=
s, but even the son of a reputed Russian mob boss whom Trump had at his sid=
e at a gala Trump hotel opening, but has since claimed under oath he barely=
 knows.

Neither Trump=92s campaign spokesperson, Hope Hicks, nor Jason Greenblatt, =
the executive vice president and chief legal officer at the Trump Organizat=
ion, responded to several emailed requests for comment on the issues raised=
 in this article.

Here, as close as we can get to the truth, is what really happened.

***

After graduating in 1968 from the University of Pennsylvania, a rich young =
man from the outer boroughs of New York City sought his fortune on the isla=
nd of Manhattan. Within a few years Donald J. Trump had made friends with t=
he city=92s most notorious fixer, lawyer Roy Cohn, who had become famous as=
 lead counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy. Among other things Cohn was now a=
 mob consigliere, with clients including =93Fat Tony=94 Salerno, boss of th=
e Genovese crime family, the most powerful Mafia group in New York, and Pau=
l Castellano, head of what was said to be the second largest family, the Ga=
mbinos.

This business connection proved useful when Trump began work on what would =
become Trump Tower, the 58-story highrise where he still lives when he=92s =
not at his Florida estate.


Anthony 'Fat Tony' Salerno, boss of the Genovese Crime Family, is photograp=
hed leaving the U.S. federal courthouse inThere was something a little pecu=
liar about the construction of Trump Tower, and subsequent Trump projects i=
n New York. Most skyscrapers are steel girder construction, and that was es=
pecially true in the 1980s, says John Cross of the American Iron & Steel In=
stitute. Some use pre-cast concrete. Trump chose a costlier and in many way=
s riskier method: ready-mix concrete. Ready-mix has some advantages: it can=
 speed up construction, and doesn=92t require costly fireproofing. But it m=
ust be poured quickly or it will harden in the delivery truck drums, ruinin=
g them as well as creating costly problems with the building itself. That l=
eaves developers vulnerable to the unions: the worksite gate is union contr=
olled, so even a brief labor slowdown can turn into an expensive disaster.

Salerno, Castellano and other organized crime figures controlled the ready-=
mix business in New York, and everyone in construction at the time knew it.=
 So did government investigators trying to break up the mob, urged on by ma=
jor developers such as the LeFrak and Resnick families. Trump ended up not =
only using ready-mix concrete, but also paying what a federal indictment of=
 Salerno later concluded were inflated prices for it =96 repeatedly =96 to =
S & A Concrete, a firm Salerno and Castellano owned through fronts, and pos=
sibly to other mob-controlled firms. As Barrett noted, by choosing to build=
 with ready-mix concrete rather than other materials, Trump put himself =93=
at the mercy of a legion of concrete racketeers.=94

Salerno and Castellano and other mob families controlled both the concrete =
business and the unions involved in delivering and pouring it. The risks th=
is created became clear from testimony later by Irving Fischer, the general=
 contractor who built Trump Tower. Fischer said concrete union =93goons=94 =
once stormed his offices, holding a knife to throat of his switchboard oper=
ator to drive home the seriousness of their demands, which included no-show=
 jobs during construction of Trump Tower.

But with Cohn as his lawyer, Trump apparently had no reason to personally f=
ear Salerno or Castellano=97at least, not once he agreed to pay inflated co=
ncrete prices. What Trump appeared to receive in return was union peace. Th=
at meant the project would never face costly construction or delivery delay=
s.

The indictment on which Salerno was convicted in 1988 and sent to prison, w=
here he died, listed the nearly $8 million contract for concrete at Trump P=
laza, an East Side high-rise apartment building, as one of the acts establi=
shing that S &A was part of a racketeering enterprise. (While the concrete =
business was central to the case, the trial also proved extortion, narcotic=
s, rigged union elections and murders by the Genovese and Gambino crime fam=
ilies in what Michael Chertoff, the chief prosecutor, called =93the largest=
 and most vicious criminal business in the history of the United States.'')

FBI agents subpoenaed Trump in 1980 to ask about his dealing with John Cody=
, a Teamsters official described by law enforcement as a very close associa=
te of the Gambino crime family. The FBI believed that Cody previously had o=
btained free apartments from other developers. FBI agents suspected that Co=
dy, who controlled the flow of concrete trucks, might get a free Trump Towe=
r apartment. Trump denied it. But a female friend of Cody=92s, a woman with=
 no job who attributed her lavish lifestyle to the kindness of friends, bou=
ght three Trump Tower apartments right beneath the triplex where Donald liv=
ed with his wife Ivana. Cody stayed there on occasion and invested $500,000=
 in the units. Trump, Barrett reported, helped the woman get a $3 million m=
ortgage without filling out a loan application or showing financials.

In the summer of 1982 Cody, then under indictment, ordered a citywide strik=
e=97but the concrete work continued at Trump Tower. After Cody was convicte=
d of racketeering, imprisoned and lost control of the union, Trump sued the=
 woman for $250,000 for alteration work. She countersued for $20 million an=
d in court papers accused Trump of taking kickbacks from contractors, asser=
ting this could =93be the basis of a criminal proceeding requiring an attor=
ney general=92s investigation=94 into Trump. Trump then quickly settled, pa=
ying the woman a half-million dollars. Trump said at the time and since the=
n that he hardly knew those involved and there was nothing improper his dea=
lings with Cody or the woman.

***

There were other irregularities in Trump=92s first big construction project=
. In 1979, when Trump hired a demolition contractor to take down the Bonwit=
 Teller department store to make way for Trump Tower, he hired as many as 2=
00 non-union men to work alongside about 15 members of the House Wreckers U=
nion Local 95. The non-union workers were mostly illegal Polish immigrants =
paid $4 to $6 per hour with no benefits, far below the union contract. At l=
east some of them did not use power tools but sledgehammers, working 12 hou=
rs a day or more and often seven days a week. Known as the =93Polish brigad=
e,=94 many didn=92t wear hard hats. Many slept on the construction site.

Normally the use of nonunion workers at a union job site would have guarant=
eed a picket line. Not at this site, however. Work proceeded because the Ge=
novese family principally controlled the union; this was demonstrated by ex=
tensive testimony, documents and convictions in federal trials, as well as =
a later report by the New York State Organized Crime Task Force.

When the Polish workers and a union dissident sued for their pay and benefi=
ts, Trump denied any knowledge that illegal workers without hard hats were =
taking down Bonwit with sledgehammers. The trial, however, demonstrated oth=
erwise: Testimony showed that Trump panicked when the nonunion Polish men t=
hreatened a work stoppage because they had not been paid. Trump turned to D=
aniel Sullivan, a labor fixer and FBI informant, who told him to fire the P=
olish workers.

Trump knew the Polish brigade was composed of underpaid illegal immigrants =
and that S&A was a mob-owned firm, according to Sullivan and others. "Donal=
d told me that he was having his difficulties and he admitted to me that =
=97 seeking my advice =97 that he had some illegal Polish employees on the =
job. I reacted by saying to Donald that 'I think you are nuts,'" Sullivan t=
estified at the time. "I told him to fire them promptly if he had any brain=
s." In an interview later, Sullivan told me the same thing.

In 1991, a federal judge, Charles E. Stewart Jr., ruled that Trump had enga=
ged in a conspiracy to violate a fiduciary duty, or duty of loyalty, to the=
 workers and their union and that the =93breach involved fraud and the Trum=
p defendants knowingly participated in his breach.=94 The judge did not fin=
d Trump=92s testimony to be sufficiently credible and set damages at $325,0=
00. The case was later settled by negotiation, and the agreement was report=
edly sealed.

BI agents subpoenaed Trump in 1980 to ask about his dealing with John Cody,=
 a Teamsters official described by law enforcement as a very close associat=
e of the Gambino crime family. The
 FBI believed that Cody previously had obtained free apartments from other =
developers. FBI agents suspected that Cody, who controlled the flow of conc=
rete trucks, might get a free Trump Tower apartment. Trump denied it. But a=
 female friend of Cody=92s, a woman
 with no job who attributed her lavish lifestyle to the kindness of friends=
, bought three Trump Tower apartments right beneath the triplex where Donal=
d lived with his wife Ivana. Cody stayed there on occasion and invested $50=
0,000 in the units. Trump, Barrett
 reported, helped the woman get a $3 million mortgage without filling out a=
 loan application or showing financials.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">I=
n the summer of 1982 Cody, then under indictment, ordered a citywide strike=
=97but the concrete work continued at Trump Tower. After Cody was convicted=
 of racketeering, imprisoned and lost
 control of the union, Trump sued the woman for $250,000 for alteration wor=
k. She countersued for $20 million and in court papers accused Trump of tak=
ing kickbacks from contractors, asserting this could =93be the basis of a c=
riminal proceeding requiring an attorney
 general=92s investigation=94 into Trump. Trump then quickly settled, payin=
g the woman a half-million dollars. Trump said at the time and since then t=
hat he hardly knew those involved and there was nothing improper his dealin=
gs with Cody or the woman.</p>

b style=3D"box-sizing: border-box;">There were other irregularities</b>&nbs=
p;in Trump=92s first big construction project. In 1979, when Trump hired a =
demolition contractor to take down the Bonwit
 Teller department store to make way for Trump Tower, he hired as many as 2=
00 non-union men to work alongside about 15 members of the House Wreckers U=
nion Local 95. The non-union workers were mostly illegal Polish immigrants =
paid $4 to $6 per hour with no benefits,
 far below the union contract. At least some of them did not use power tool=
s but sledgehammers, working 12 hours a day or more and often seven days a =
week. Known as the =93Polish brigade,=94 many didn=92t wear hard hats. Many=
 slept on the construction site.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">N=
ormally the use of nonunion workers at a union job site would have guarante=
ed a picket line. Not at this site, however. Work proceeded because the Gen=
ovese family principally controlled
 the union; this was demonstrated by extensive testimony, documents and con=
victions in federal trials, as well as a later report by the New York State=
 Organized Crime Task Force.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">W=
hen the Polish workers and a union dissident<b style=3D"box-sizing: border-=
box;">&nbsp;</b>sued for their pay and benefits, Trump denied any knowledge=
 that illegal workers without hard hats were
 taking down Bonwit with sledgehammers. The trial, however, demonstrated ot=
herwise: Testimony showed that Trump panicked when the nonunion Polish men =
threatened a work stoppage because they had not been paid. Trump turned to =
Daniel Sullivan, a labor fixer and
 FBI informant, who told him to fire the Polish workers.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">T=
rump knew the Polish brigade was composed of underpaid illegal immigrants a=
nd that S&amp;A was a mob-owned firm, according to Sullivan and others. &qu=
ot;Donald told me that he was having his difficulties
 and he admitted to me that =97 seeking my advice =97 that he had some ille=
gal Polish employees on the job. I reacted by saying to Donald that 'I thin=
k you are nuts,'&quot; Sullivan testified at the time. &quot;I told him to =
fire them promptly if he had any brains.&quot; In an
 interview later, Sullivan told me the same thing.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">I=
n 1991, a federal judge, Charles E. Stewart Jr., ruled that Trump had engag=
ed in a conspiracy to violate a fiduciary duty, or duty of loyalty, to the =
workers and their union and that the
 =93breach involved fraud and the Trump defendants knowingly participated i=
n his breach.=94 The judge did not find Trump=92s testimony to be sufficien=
tly credible and set damages at $325,000. The case was later settled by neg=
otiation, and the agreement was reportedly
 sealed.</p>
