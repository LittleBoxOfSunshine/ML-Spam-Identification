For Immediate Release May 23, 2016





REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA

AND PRESIDENT TRN I QUANG OF VIETNAM

IN JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE



Presidential Palace

Hanoi, Vietnam







12:59 P.M. ICT



 PRESIDENT QUANG: (As interpreted.) Your Excellency, President of the Uni=
ted States of America, Mr. Barack Obama, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf =
of the leaders of the party state and the people of Vietnam, once again I=
'd like to warmly welcome President Barack Obama and the high-level deleg=
ation of the U.S. government on your official visit to Vietnam.=20

=20

 Mr. President and I had a very productive talk on bilateral relations, r=
egional and global issues of common interest. We discussed the implementa=
tion of the joint statement on Vietnam-U.S. Comprehensive Partnership sig=
ned in July 2013, and the Joint Vision Statement between the two countrie=
s in July of 2015 concluded between the high-level leaders of the two cou=
ntries. We agreed that important progress in bilateral relations have bee=
n made in recent years. Both sides committed to implementing the principl=
es of respect for each other's independence, sovereignty, territorial int=
egrity, and political regime.=20



 During President Obama's official visit, Vietnam and the U.S. agreed to =
a joint statement on strengthening the comprehensive partnership with add=
ed substance, depth, and effectiveness. Both sides agreed to place develo=
pment cooperation at the center of the bilateral ties.=20



 On this occasion, important deals were also reached in terms of trade, h=
ealth care, humanitarian assistance, education and training, law enforcem=
ent and judicial cooperation, and people-to-people exchanges, as well. Bo=
th sides agreed to give higher priorities to addressing war legacy issues=
 and committed -- continue to work together in this regard.



 The U.S. will work with Vietnam on the passing of Bien Hoa Airport after=
 both sides successfully conclude the cleanup project at Danang Airport. =
Vietnam very much appreciates the U.S. decision to completely lift the ba=
n on lethal weapon sales to Vietnam, which is clear proof that both count=
ries have completely normalized the relations.



 President Obama and I also discussed the future direction of bilateral t=
ies and measures to further deepen bilateral cooperation. We underscored =
the importance of confidence-building and priority for development cooper=
ation in trade and investment, science and technology, human resource dev=
elopment, and addressing climate change. Both sides reaffirmed the commit=
ment to promptly ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, or TP=
P.=20



 With respect to regional and global issues, President Obama and I agreed=
 that we should set up collaboration at regional and international forums=
, and that the U.S. will support Vietnam in successfully hosting the 2017=
 APEC Summit, as well as participating in U.N. peacekeeping operations.=20=




 We also exchanged views on recent developments in the South China Sea. W=
e reiterated continued cooperation on addressing climate change and susta=
inable use of the Mekong River water resources. We believe that promised =
growth in Vietnam-U.S relations not only brings about benefits for each c=
ountry, but also contributes to peace, stability, cooperation and develop=
ment in the Asia Pacific and world, and the ASEAN-U.S. relationships as w=
ell.



 I want to thank President Obama personally, the American leadership, and=
 people and American friends for their goodwill and significant contribut=
ions to the normalization and the continued development of the Vietnam-U.=
S. relations. I wish President Obama and the members of your delegation a=
 successful visit to Vietnam with fond memories of our country, culture, =
and hospitality of the Vietnamese people.=20



 Once again, thank you very much for the presence of American and Vietnam=
ese press and media here today. Thank you very much.



 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good afternoon. Xin cho. Thank you, President Quang, fo=
r your generous words. And let me thank you and the government and the pe=
ople of Vietnam for the sincere welcome and hospitality that has been ext=
ended to me and to my delegation.=20



Over the past century, our two nations have known cooperation and then co=
nflict, painful separation, and a long reconciliation. Now, more than two=
 decades of normalized ties between our governments allows us to reach a =
new moment.=20



Its clear from this visit that both our peoples are eager for an even clo=
ser relationship, a deeper relationship. And I was moved to see so many p=
eople lining the streets as we were driving into town today. I bring gree=
tings and friendship of the American people, including some outstanding m=
embers of Congress who are joining me on this visit, and so many Vietname=
se Americans whose families bind us together and remind us of the values =
that we share.



I've indicated before that one of my highest foreign policy priorities as=
 President is to ensure that the United States continues to play a larger=
 and long-term role in the Asia Pacific, which is vital to our security a=
nd to our prosperity. We believe the people of this region should live in=
 security, prosperity and dignity. In pursuit of this vision, were more d=
eeply engaged across the Asia Pacific than we have been in decades, and t=
hat includes our Comprehensive Partnership with Vietnam.



If you consider where we have been and where we are now, the transformati=
on in the relations between our two countries is remarkable. Over the pas=
t two decades, our trade has surged nearly a hundredfold, supporting jobs=
 and opportunities in both countries. Since I took office, weve boosted U=
.S. exports to Vietnam by more than 150 percent. Were now the single larg=
est market for Vietnams exports. American companies are one of the top in=
vestors here.=20



With our Fulbright programs, thousands of our students and scholars have =
studied together. And more than 13,000 young people across Vietnam are le=
arning new skills as part of our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative=
. Vietnam has become one of the top 10 countries with students in the Uni=
ted States. This year, weve welcomed nearly 19,000 -- the most ever. And =
last year, Vietnam welcomed nearly half a million American tourists to th=
is country -- and I will assure you that more are on the way.



Our two governments are also cooperating more closely than ever. As part =
of our engagement with ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, were working toget=
her to advance regional security and stability. Vietnam has welcomed Amer=
ican navy ships to your ports. Our militaries are conducting more exchang=
es and partnering on maritime security.=20



Together, were pursuing the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- not only to supp=
ort trade, but to draw our nations closer together and reinforce regional=
 cooperation. Were doing more to meet global challenges, from preventing =
nuclear terrorism to promoting global health security, so that outbreaks =
of disease dont become epidemics. And with this visit, the United States =
and Vietnam have agreed to a significant upgrade in our cooperation acros=
s the board.=20



Were taking new steps to give our young people the education and skills t=
hat they need to succeed. And Im very pleased that, for the first time, t=
he Peace Corps will come to Vietnam. Our Peace Corps volunteers will focu=
s on teaching English, and the friendship that our people forge will brin=
g us closer together for decades to come.



American academic and technology leaders -- including Intel, Oracle, Ariz=
ona State University and others -- will help Vietnamese universities boos=
t training in science, technology, engineering and math. Harvard Medical =
School, Johnson & Johnson, GE and others will join with Vietnam universit=
ies to improve medical education. And now that the government of Vietnam =
has granted the necessary license, we can say that Fulbright University V=
ietnam -- this countrys first nonprofit, independent university -- can mo=
ve forward and open its doors and welcome its first class this fall.=20



Were increasing trade. With Vietnams announcement on multiple entry visas=
, it will be easier for Americans to come here and do business and travel=
. President Quang and I just attended a signing ceremony that many of you=
 saw, where American and Vietnamese companies are moving ahead with the n=
ew commercial deals worth more than $16 billion. Boeing will sell 100 air=
craft to VietJet. Pratt & Whitney will sell advanced engines. GE Wind wil=
l partner with the Vietnamese government to develop more wind power. Deal=
s like these are a win for both of our countries -- helping to fuel Vietn=
ams economic growth and supporting tens of thousands of American jobs.=20=




We agreed to work to ratify and implement the Trans-Pacific Partnership a=
s soon as possible, because it will support vital economic reforms here, =
further integrate Vietnam into the global economy, and reduce tariffs on =
American exports to Vietnam. And we discussed the high standards that Vie=
tnam has committed to meet under TPP on labor, the environment and intell=
ectual property. And I conveyed that the United States is prepared to off=
er technical assistance to Vietnam as it works to fully implement these s=
tandards so that TPP delivers the benefits that our peoples expect.



With regard to security, the United States will continue to do our part t=
o address the painful legacy of war. On behalf of the American people, in=
cluding our veterans, I want to thank the government and the people of Vi=
etnam for the many years of cooperation to account for Americans missing =
in action -- solemn efforts that we'll continue together. Well continue t=
o help remove unexploded landmines and bombs. And now that our joint effo=
rt to remove dioxin -- Agent Orange -- from Danang Airport is nearly comp=
lete, the United States will help in the cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base.=20=




Weve agreed to continue deepening our defense cooperation, including patr=
ol boats and training for Vietnams Coast Guard, and to work more closely =
together in responding to humanitarian disasters. And I can also announce=
 that the United States is fully lifting the ban on the sale of military =
equipment to Vietnam that has been in place for some 50 years. As with al=
l our defense partners, sales will need to still meet strict requirements=
, including those related to human rights. But this change will ensure th=
at Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself and remo=
ves a lingering vestige of the Cold War. It also underscores the commitme=
nt of the United States to a fully normalized relationship with Vietnam, =
including strong defense ties with Vietnam and this region for the long t=
erm.=20



More broadly, the United States and Vietnam are united in our support for=
 a regional order, including in the South China Sea -- where internationa=
l norms and rules are upheld, where there is freedom of navigation and ov=
erflight, where lawful commerce is not impeded, and where disputes are re=
solved peacefully, through legal means, in accordance with international =
law. I want to repeat that the United States will continue to fly, sail, =
and operate wherever international law allows, and we will support the ri=
ght of all countries to do the same.



Even as we make important progress in the ways that Ive just described, t=
here continue to be areas where our two governments disagree, including o=
n democracy and human rights. And I made it clear that the United States =
does not seek to impose our form of government on Vietnam or on any natio=
n. We respect Vietnams sovereignty and independence. At the same time, we=
 will continue to speak out on behalf of human rights that we believe are=
 universal, including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of=
 religion and freedom of assembly. And that includes the right of citizen=
s, through civil society, to organize and help improve their communities =
and their country.=20



We believe -- and I believe -- that nations are stronger and more prosper=
ous when these universal rights are upheld, and when our two countries co=
ntinue to discuss these issues as part of our human rights dialogue in a =
spirit of constructive and cooperative effort.=20



And finally, the United States and Vietnam are expanding our cooperation =
in ways that benefit the world. Under our growing climate change partners=
hip, well support Vietnam as it works to meet its commitments under the P=
aris agreement. Because our two countries and others have committed to jo=
ining the agreement this year, were within striking distance of it enteri=
ng into force before anybody expected.=20



In the meantime, well help communities in vulnerable regions, like the Me=
kong Delta adapt to a changing climate and assist Vietnams transition to =
a low-carbon economy. And that includes the low-carbon energy that will c=
ome from our cooperation on civil nuclear power. And as Vietnam prepares =
to deepen its commitment to U.N. peacekeeping, the United States is proud=
 to support Vietnams new peacekeeping training center.



So, again, President Quang, thank you for your hospitality. Thank you for=
 our work together. Im looking forward to the opportunity to visit with t=
he Vietnamese people. Maybe I will enjoy some c ph sa . I believe that th=
e relationship between the Vietnam people and the United States can be on=
e of the most important in this critical part of the world. And I believe=
 that the upgrade in our ties that weve achieved today will deliver great=
er security, prosperity, and dignity for both of our peoples for many dec=
ades to come.=20



Xin cm n.



Q I'm from the Vietnam News Agency. I have a question for President Quang=
. Your Excellency, could you advise us and make some comment on the notab=
le advances in Vietnam-U.S. relations over the past two decades? Thank yo=
u.



 PRESIDENT QUANG: (As interpreted.) Thank you for your question. I want t=
o affirm that over the past two decades, since the establishment of diplo=
matic relations between the two countries in July 1995, Vietnam-U.S. rela=
tions have made great strides in many fields. In terms of politics and di=
plomacy, Vietnam and the U.S. are former enemies turned friends. And now =
we are comprehensive partners.=20



The high-level leaders of the two countries often pay a visit to each oth=
er, and the relations have grown very well bilaterally and multilaterally=
. We share the common interests regarding the regional and international =
issues. And our common interests grow day by day, particularly in relatio=
n to the maintenance of peace, stability, cooperation and development in =
the region.



 With respect to economic cooperation, I'm very pleased to inform you tha=
t the two-way trade has grown 130-fold to U$S 44.5 billion last year. The=
 U.S. is currently the seventh-largest investor in Vietnam, and I hope th=
at the U.S. will soon become the biggest investor in Vietnam, as Ambassad=
or Ted Osius once mentioned. The bilateral trade between the two countrie=
s has enormous potential to grow, particularly once the TPP enters into e=
ffect.=20



 Regarding education and training cooperation, we have obtained many impo=
rtant progression. Take, for example, the Fulbright University in Vietnam=
 has recently received its operating license. The number of Vietnamese st=
udents studying in the U.S. has grown 56-fold to 28,000 students -- the h=
ighest number among the ASEAN countries. And our cooperation on defense a=
nd security continues to grow in line with the needs of both sides.=20



 The cooperation in remedying the war legacy is now growing more substant=
ively. The two countries have recently completed the phase one of environ=
mental cleanup at Danang Airport, and we will continue to implement the s=
econd phase of the project at various other sites, including Bien Hoa Air=
port. Together with the progress in bilateral ties, Vietnam and U.S. are =
working together and enhancing the collaboration on regional and internat=
ional issues of common interest in international forums.=20



 The advances in the bilateral relations stems from the fact that we incr=
easingly share common concerns and interests. And both side fully realize=
 the (inaudible) to respect each other's independence, sovereignty, polit=
ical regimes, and legitimate interests. The visit of President Barack Oba=
ma this time to Vietnam will surely create stronger momentum for the deve=
lopment and promotion of Vietnam-U.S. relations in the future contributin=
g to maintenance of peace stability, cooperation and development in Asia =
Pacific and the wider world.



 Thank you very much.



 Q I have a question for both Presidents about the lifting of the arms em=
bargo. To what extent do you see the need to build up Vietnam's military =
deterrent against China's behavior in the South China Sea as part of this=
 decision? Could this include expanded U.S. access to Vietnamese ports, i=
ncluding Cam Ranh Bay?



 Directly for President Obama, to what degree will the U.S. decide on wea=
pons sales based on human rights considerations?



 And for President Quang, how do you respond to the U.S. push for improve=
d human rights situation in Vietnam?



 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, Matt, the decision to lift the ban was not based =
on China or any other considerations. It was based on our desire to compl=
ete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards normalization with =
Vietnam -- a process that began with some very courageous and difficult c=
onversations decades ago, including led by our current Secretary of State=
 John Kerry, and Senators Tom Carper and John McCain, and a whole bunch o=
f other Vietnam veterans, as well as their counterparts in the Vietnamese=
 government.=20



 And over time, what we've seen is a progressive deepening and broadening=
 of the relationship. And what became apparent to me and my administratio=
n at this point was, is that given all the work we do together across the=
 spectrum of economic, trade, security and humanitarian efforts, that it =
was appropriate for us not to have a blanket across-the-board ban. Now, e=
very sale that we make to everybody is viewed as a particular transaction=
, and we examine what's appropriate and what's not, and there's some very=
 close allies of ours where we may not make a particular sale until we ha=
ve a better sense of how that piece of equipment may end up being used. S=
o we're going to continue to engage in the case-by-case evaluations of th=
ese sales. But what we do not have is a ban that's based on an ideologica=
l division between our two countries, because we think, at this stage, bo=
th sides have established a level of trust and cooperation, including bet=
ween our militaries, that is reflective of common interests and mutual re=
spect.



 In fact, one of the things that happened through this Comprehensive Part=
nership is a dialogue between the U.S. and Vietnamese military that we ha=
dnt seen in a very long time. And we already have U.S. vessels that have =
come here to port. We expect that there will be deepening cooperation bet=
ween our militaries, oftentimes around how do we respond to humanitarian =
disasters in this region. There may be occasions in which that means that=
 additional U.S. vessels might visit, but I want to emphasize that we wil=
l do so only at the invitation and with the cooperation of the Vietnamese=
 government, fully respecting their sovereignty and their sensitivities.

=20

 Now, there is, I think, a genuine mutual concern with respect to maritim=
e issues between the United States and Vietnam, and I've made no secret o=
f that. Vietnam, along with ASEAN, met at my invitation in Sunnylands, Ca=
lifornia, and we put forward a very close statement that it is important =
for us to maintain the freedom of navigation and the governance of intern=
ational norms and rules and law that have helped to create prosperity and=
 promoted commerce and peace and security in this region. And it's my bel=
ief that, with respect to the South China Sea -- although the United Stat=
es doesnt support any particular claim -- we are supportive of the notion=
 that these issues should be resolved peacefully, diplomatically, in acco=
rdance with international rules and norms, and not based on who's the big=
ger party and who can throw their weight around a little bit more.



 At the same time, as I indicated in my initial statement, the United Sta=
tes is going to continue to fly and set courses for our ships as internat=
ional law allows. Our hope is that, ultimately, various claimants and var=
ious disputes can be resolved, and we'll do everything that we can to pro=
mote that. In the meantime, part of our cooperation with Vietnam is to im=
prove their maritime security posture for a whole host of reasons. But I =
want to emphasize that my decision to lift the ban really was more reflec=
tive of the changing nature of the relationship.



 The last point, with respect specifically to human rights, as I indicate=
d in my opening statement, this is an area where we still have difference=
s. There's been modest progress on some of the areas that we've identifie=
d as a concern. TPP actually is one of the things that's prompting a seri=
es of labor reforms here in Vietnam that could end up being extraordinari=
ly significant. But that is not directly tied to the decision around mili=
tary sales.



 PRESIDENT QUANG: (As interpreted.) Thank you very much for the question.=
 I just want to make some comments on the human rights cooperation in the=
 general relations between the two countries. Excellencies, ladies and ge=
ntlemen, the consistent position and viewpoint of the Vietnamese state an=
d government is to protect and promote human rights. This is clearly codi=
fied and stipulated in the national constitution of Vietnam in 2013. We a=
re now institutionalizing all the regulations into our laws and -- docume=
nts to respect and promote the human rights in Vietnam.



 Over the past 30 years of reform in Vietnam, Vietnam has achieved remark=
able progress in socioeconomic development, defense and security, especia=
lly in protection and promotion of human rights and the rights of every c=
itizen in Vietnam. Those achievements have been highly recognized and off=
iciated by the international community. One of the examples -- very good =
examples to showcase Vietnam's progress, that Vietnam has been elected as=
 a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council in 2016.=20



 As President Obama mentioned earlier, between the two countries, Vietnam=
 and the U.S., we do have some differences in some fields, and it is very=
 easy to understand, particularly on human rights. We are of the view tha=
t based on the respect and the spirit of mutual understanding, we need to=
 work closely together and expand our dialogue together. And by so doing,=
 we can narrow the gap in understanding and narrowing the differences bet=
ween the countries, especially on human rights.



 And the floor is still open. I invite other questions.=20



 Q (As interpreted.) You have visited over 50 countries during your term =
as U.S. President, and Vietnam is among the last ones on the list. So wha=
t does that say about the Vietnam-U.S. relation? And how important does t=
he U.S. view Vietnam in its foreign policy? Thank you.



 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I would have liked to have gotten here sooner. An=
d maybe one of the ways of thinking about it is, we have an expression in=
 the United States -- we save the best for last. (Laughter.) So it's a re=
markable country. It's a beautiful country. And I told the President that=
, unfortunately, when I visit, I'm usually in meetings all day long. So h=
opefully, when I'm no longer President, I can come here with my family an=
d I can spend a little more time, and travel the country a little bit mor=
e, and get to know the people and eat the food, and have a more relaxing =
schedule.



 But the reason I'm here is because Vietnam is extremely important not ju=
st to the region, but I think to the world. First of all, I think highlig=
hting the changes that have taken place between our two countries, how ju=
st a generation ago we were adversaries and now we are friends, should gi=
ve us hope, should be a reminder of the ability for us to transform relat=
ionships when we have a dialogue that's based on mutual interests and mut=
ual respect and people-to-people exchanges.



 Second, Vietnam is a large, vital, growing country in a large, vital, an=
d growing region of the world. I've said this before: The Asia Pacific re=
gion is growing as fast as any place around the world. It is a young and =
dynamic region. It is full of entrepreneurial spirit, and you're seeing n=
ew companies and new jobs being created constantly. So the United States =
wants to be a part of that.=20



And we, historically, have had good relations with many countries in this=
 region. We want to make sure that as Vietnam grows and becomes more pros=
perous and achieves greater opportunity, that the young people of Vietnam=
 have a chance to partner with the young people of the United States -- t=
rading, exchanging ideas, working on scientific projects, starting busine=
sses together -- because I think that will be good for both countries.



And we think that it is important, from my perspective, that as a leader =
in ASEAN, that we engage Vietnam bilaterally because we want to continue =
to strengthen our cooperation with the multilateral organizations like th=
e East Asia Summit and ASEAN where we think we've seen some very real pro=
gress over the last several years -- on everything from commercial issues=
 to disease control to humanitarian issues.=20



One of the things that we increasingly discover is it's harder and harder=
 to solve problems by ourselves. It's much easier for us to be able to ta=
ckle big problems like climate change, or the outbreak of disease, or res=
ponding to humanitarian disasters when we have an architecture of coopera=
tion already established.=20



So on all these fronts, we've seen remarkable progress. The announcements=
 that we're making today I think should give people an indication of the =
next stage of the U.S.-Vietnamese relationship. These are big deals, all =
the things that we mentioned here today. And it indicates a broader and d=
eeper relationship that I'm confident will continue to grow in the future=
.



Q Thank you. President Obama, the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems fairly =
stalled in Congress, and other countries are looking to follow the U.S. l=
ead in terms of how they advance their approval of the agreement. With th=
e deals today announced for Boeing and GE, and your visit here to Vietnam=
, are you looking to change your strategy in how you seek approval for th=
e Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress? And do you think that the agreem=
ent should be amended to address currency manipulation?



Secondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban lead=
er, Muhammad Mansour, and on Pakistans concern about that strike happenin=
g on its soil? Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensi=
ve in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline=
 leader might take his place?



For President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for t=
he Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for=
 the deal in the end? And how do you respond to Chinas criticism of the U=
.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that =
risks regional peace?



PRESIDENT OBAMA: So, first of all, on TPP, Angela, I haven't been around =
as long as Senator Carper or Secretary Kerry, but I've spent enough time =
in the Senate to know that every trade deal is painful, because folks are=
 always seeing if they can get an even better deal. And especially when y=
ou have multiple parties involved, folks are going to be scrutinizing it,=
 theyre going to be debating it, and in an election year, you can anticip=
ate that some folks are going to try to score political points off it.



Having said that, I remain confident we're going to get it done. And the =
reason I'm confident is because it's the right thing to do. It's good for=
 the country. It's good for America. It's good for the region. It's good =
for the world.



And I know I've said this to you before, but let me reiterate: This is th=
e fastest-growing part of the world. This represents an enormous market f=
or the United States. Most countries here already sell their stuff to the=
 United States, and we have relatively low tariffs. In other words, we pu=
t relatively low taxes on goods that are coming into the United States. I=
n contrast, tariffs are significantly higher for United States goods bein=
g sold here.



So a deal that gets rid of 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods into the largest, f=
astest-growing markets of the world -- that's a good deal for American bu=
sinesses and American workers.=20



Number two, one of the biggest complaints about trade deals historically =
has been that it opens up our markets to countries with lower wages, hars=
her labor practices, less environmental regulation. Well, if you're signi=
ng up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you are making commitments that =
are enforceable to raise labor standards, to ensure that workers have a v=
oice to attend to environmental problems. And so this gives us the abilit=
y to engage with a country like Vietnam and work with them on all those f=
ronts -- the precise things that people, in the past, have been concerned=
 about when it comes to trading with other countries.



So I have not yet seen a credible argument that once we get TPP in place =
we're going to be worse off. We are demonstrably better off. American wor=
kers and American businesses are better off if we get this deal passed. A=
nd I'm confident we will get it passed.



Now, the politics of it will be noisy. That was true when I, for example,=
 inherited the Korea Free Trade Agreement, or the Colombia and Panamanian=
 Free Trade Agreements when I came into office. But we got them done. And=
 I'm confident that we'll get them done this time, as well, although ther=
e will be ups and downs and bumps along the way.



With respect to currency manipulation, we have provisions in TPP that adv=
ance the transparency and reporting functions that allow us to monitor wh=
ether we think that currency manipulation is taking place. One of the deb=
ates that took place -- and there have been some who argue that we should=
 have enforceable provisions that if you see a currency going down too fa=
r that we should be able to impose tariffs on that country. The problem i=
s, is that it's very hard to sort out sometimes why a currency is going d=
own and whether it's actually being manipulated. And frankly, for us to b=
ind other countries to commitments about their monetary policy would mean=
 we were also binding our Federal Reserve to the claims of other countrie=
s in terms of how it implements our monetary policy, and that's not somet=
hing that we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to o=
ur monetary policy in that way.



But we have strengthened a number of the provisions that are already cont=
ained in TPP that will allow us to put on notice folks who we think are e=
ngaging in competitive devaluations.=20



Finally, on the Taliban leader, Mr. Mansour. It has been confirmed that h=
e is dead. And he is an individual who, as head of the Taliban, was speci=
fically targeting U.S. personnel and troops inside of Afghanistan who wer=
e there as part of the mission that I've set to be able to maintain a cou=
nterterrorism platform and provide assistance and training to the Afghan =
military forces there. So this does not represent a shift in our approach=
. We are not reentering the day-to-day combat operations that are current=
ly being conducted by Afghan security forces. Our job is to help Afghanis=
tan secure its own country, not to have our men and women in uniform enga=
ge in that fight for them.



On the other hand, where we have a high-profile leader who has been consi=
stently part of operations and plans to potentially harm U.S. personnel, =
and who has been resistant to the kinds of peace talks and reconciliation=
 that ultimately could bring an end to decades of war in Afghanistan, the=
n it is my responsibility as Commander-in-Chief not to stand by, but to m=
ake sure that we send a clear signal to the Taliban and others that we're=
 going to protect our people. And that's exactly the message that has bee=
n sent.



PRESIDENT QUANG: (As interpreted.) Let me respond to this question concer=
ning the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- TPP. In our view, TPP is a signific=
ant trade and economic linkage, contributing to sustaining the dynamism a=
nd the role as a driver for economic growth in our country, as well as in=
 the Asia Pacific region. And for Vietnam, TPP and Vietnams participation=
 in TPP is one step undertaken by the Vietnamese government in our proces=
s of extensive international integration.



PRESIDENT OBAMA: Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. We're not getting a t=
ranslation.=20



INTERPRETER: Testing one, two, three. Can you hear, Mr. President?



PRESIDENT OBAMA: Okay. Because I'm sure that he was saying something very=
 wise and important, and we want to make sure that we all heard it.=20



PRESIDENT QUANG: (As interpreted.) So I am glad to add that Vietnam, toge=
ther with other TPP countries, have been making efforts to narrow differe=
nces, to promote cooperation in the spirit of mutual understanding and mu=
tual respect. And we try to reduce differences in a spirit of constructiv=
eness and understanding, and paying attention to one anothers legitimate =
interests. And the finalization of TPP is also the successful outcomes of=
 all 12 members of the TPP, rather than any individual effort. And we are=
 prepared to ratify TPP, and we stand ready to implement all the commitme=
nts under TPP.



MODERATOR: Your Excellency, now we have a technical problem with the tran=
slation system. So, Mr. President -- President Quang, could you please re=
peat again your answer?=20



PRESIDENT QUANG: (As interpreted.) Yes, I want to redirect my comments on=
 TPP. In our view, the TPP is a very significant trade and economic linka=
ge contributing to the sustainment of dynamism and the role as a driver o=
f economic growth in Asia Pacific region.



As for Vietnam, TPP is a one step forward in implementation of the countr=
ys deep and comprehensive international integration policy, which aims at=
 promoting the national economic growth of Vietnam. Vietnam has worked to=
gether with other member countries to narrow the differences in the spiri=
t of constructiveness, understanding, and playing new attention to one an=
others legitimate interests. The finalization of TPP is also the result o=
f the endeavors from 12 members of the agreement, rather than the individ=
ual effort of any single country. And Vietnam is now very actively promot=
ing and accelerating the ratification of the TPP, and Vietnam is committe=
d to fully implementing all the policies and provisions of the TPP.=20



MODERATOR: Thank you very much, President Trn i Quang, and President Bara=
ck Obama.=20



Ladies and gentlemen, with that, I declare the press conference adjourned=
. And please stay in the room for the departure of the two Presidents. Th=
ank you very much.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT QUANG:&nbsp; (As =
interpreted.)&nbsp; Your Excellency, President of the United States of Amer=
ica, Mr. Barack Obama, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the leaders of th=
e party state and the people of Vietnam, once again I'd like to
 warmly welcome President Barack Obama and the high-level delegation of the=
 U.S. government on your official visit to Vietnam.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President and I had a v=
ery productive talk on bilateral relations, regional and global issues of c=
ommon interest.&nbsp; We discussed the implementation of the joint statemen=
t on Vietnam-U.S. Comprehensive Partnership signed in July
 2013, and the Joint Vision Statement between the two countries in July of =
2015 concluded between the high-level leaders of the two countries.&nbsp; W=
e agreed that important progress in bilateral relations have been made in r=
ecent years.&nbsp; Both sides committed to
 implementing the principles of respect for each other's independence, sove=
reignty, territorial integrity, and political regime.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During President Obama's of=
ficial visit, Vietnam and the U.S. agreed to a joint statement on strengthe=
ning the comprehensive partnership with added substance, depth, and effecti=
veness.&nbsp; Both sides agreed to place development cooperation
 at the center of the bilateral ties.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this occasion, important=
 deals were also reached in terms of trade, health care, humanitarian assis=
tance, education and training, law enforcement and judicial cooperation, an=
d people-to-people exchanges, as well.&nbsp; Both sides agreed
 to give higher priorities to addressing war legacy issues and committed --=
 continue to work together in this regard.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. will work with Vie=
tnam on the passing of Bien Hoa Airport after both sides successfully concl=
ude the cleanup project at Danang Airport.&nbsp; Vietnam very much apprecia=
tes the U.S. decision to completely lift the ban on lethal
 weapon sales to Vietnam, which is clear proof that both countries have com=
pletely normalized the relations.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Obama and I also =
discussed the future direction of bilateral ties and measures to further de=
epen bilateral cooperation.&nbsp; We underscored the importance of confiden=
ce-building and priority for development cooperation in trade
 and investment, science and technology, human resource development, and ad=
dressing climate change.&nbsp; Both sides reaffirmed the commitment to prom=
ptly ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, or TPP.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to regional an=
d global issues, President Obama and I agreed that we should set up collabo=
ration at regional and international forums, and that the U.S. will support=
 Vietnam in successfully hosting the 2017 APEC Summit,
 as well as participating in U.N. peacekeeping operations. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also exchanged views on =
recent developments in the South China Sea.&nbsp; We reiterated continued c=
ooperation on addressing climate change and sustainable use of the Mekong R=
iver water resources.&nbsp; We believe that promised growth in Vietnam-U.S
 relations not only brings about benefits for each country, but also contri=
butes to peace, stability, cooperation and development in the Asia Pacific =

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Over the past century, ou=

 and a long reconciliation.&nbsp; Now, more than two decades of normalized =

 reach a new moment.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">It=E2=80=99s clear from t=

a deeper relationship.&nbsp; And I was moved to see so many people lining t=

 bring greetings and friendship of the American people, including some outs=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I've indicated before tha=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">If you consider where we =
have been and where we are now, the transformation in the relations between=
 our two countries is remarkable.&nbsp; Over the past two decades, our trad=

 jobs and opportunities in both countries.&nbsp; Since I took office, we=E2=

 Vietnam has become one of the top 10 countries with students in the United=

 responding to humanitarian disasters.&nbsp; And I can also
 announce that the United States is fully lifting the ban on the sale of mi=
litary equipment to Vietnam that has been in place for some 50 years.&nbsp;=
 As with all our defense partners, sales will need to still meet strict req=
uirements, including those related to
 human rights.&nbsp; But this change will ensure that Vietnam has access to=
 the equipment it needs to defend itself and removes a lingering vestige of=
 the Cold War.&nbsp; It also underscores the commitment of the United State=

 Vietnam, including strong defense ties with Vietnam and this region for th=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Even as we make important=
 progress in the ways that I=E2=80=99ve just described, there continue to b=

 States does not seek to impose our form of government on Vietnam or on any=
 nation.&nbsp; We respect Vietnam=E2=80=99s sovereignty and independence.&n=
bsp; At the same time, we will continue to speak out on behalf of human rig=
hts that we believe are universal, including freedom
 of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and freedom of assemb=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We believe -- and I belie=

 Thank you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT QUANG:&nbsp; (As =
interpreted.)&nbsp; Thank you for your question.&nbsp; I want to affirm tha=
t over the past two decades, since the establishment of diplomatic relation=
s between the two countries in July 1995, Vietnam-U.S. relations have
 made great strides in many fields.&nbsp; In terms of politics and diplomac=
y, Vietnam and the U.S. are former enemies turned friends.&nbsp; And now we=
 are comprehensive partners.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The high-level leaders of=
 the two countries often pay a visit to each other, and the relations have =
grown very well bilaterally and multilaterally.&nbsp; We share the common i=
nterests regarding the regional and international
 issues.&nbsp; And our common interests grow day by day, particularly in re=
lation to the maintenance of peace, stability, cooperation and development =
in the region.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to economic co=
operation, I'm very pleased to inform you that the two-way trade has grown =
130-fold to U$S 44.5 billion last year.&nbsp; The U.S. is currently the sev=
enth-largest investor in Vietnam, and I hope that the U.S.
 will soon become the biggest investor in Vietnam, as Ambassador Ted Osius =
once mentioned.&nbsp; The bilateral trade between the two countries has eno=
rmous potential to grow, particularly once the TPP enters into effect.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding education and tra=
ining cooperation, we have obtained many important progression.&nbsp; Take,=
 for example, the Fulbright University in Vietnam has recently received its=
 operating license.&nbsp; The number of Vietnamese students studying
 in the U.S. has grown 56-fold to 28,000 students -- the highest number amo=
ng the ASEAN countries.&nbsp; And our cooperation on defense and security c=
ontinues to grow in line with the needs of both sides.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cooperation in remedyin=
g the war legacy is now growing more substantively.&nbsp; The two countries=
 have recently completed the phase one of environmental cleanup at Danang A=
irport, and we will continue to implement the second phase
 of the project at various other sites, including Bien Hoa Airport.&nbsp; T=
ogether with the progress in bilateral ties, Vietnam and U.S. are working t=
ogether and enhancing the collaboration on regional and international issue=
s of common interest in international
 forums. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advances in the bilater=
al relations stems from the fact that we increasingly share common concerns=
 and interests.&nbsp; And both side fully realize the (inaudible) to respec=
t each other's independence, sovereignty, political regimes,
 and legitimate interests.&nbsp; The visit of President Barack Obama this t=
ime to Vietnam will surely create stronger momentum for the development and=
 promotion of Vietnam-U.S. relations in the future contributing to maintena=
nce of peace stability, cooperation and
 development in Asia Pacific and the wider world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have =
a question for both Presidents about the lifting of the arms embargo.&nbsp;=
 To what extent do you see the need to build up Vietnam's military deterren=
t against China's behavior in the South China Sea as part of this decision?=
&nbsp;
 Could this include expanded U.S. access to Vietnamese ports, including Cam=
 Ranh Bay?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directly for President Obam=
a, to what degree will the U.S. decide on weapons sales based on human righ=
ts considerations?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for President Quang, ho=
w do you respond to the U.S. push for improved human rights situation in Vi=
etnam?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well=
, Matt, the decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other co=
nsiderations.&nbsp; It was based on our desire to complete what has been a =
lengthy process of moving towards normalization with Vietnam --
 a process that began with some very courageous and difficult conversations=
 decades ago, including led by our current Secretary of State John Kerry, a=
nd Senators Tom Carper and John McCain, and a whole bunch of other Vietnam =
veterans, as well as their counterparts
 in the Vietnamese government.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And over time, what we've s=
een is a progressive deepening and broadening of the relationship.&nbsp; An=
d what became apparent to me and my administration at this point was, is th=
at given all the work we do together across the spectrum of
 economic, trade, security and humanitarian efforts, that it was appropriat=
e for us not to have a blanket across-the-board ban.&nbsp; Now, every sale =
that we make to everybody is viewed as a particular transaction, and we exa=
mine what's appropriate and what's not,
 and there's some very close allies of ours where we may not make a particu=
lar sale until we have a better sense of how that piece of equipment may en=
d up being used.&nbsp; So we're going to continue to engage in the case-by-=
case evaluations of these sales.&nbsp; But
 what we do not have is a ban that's based on an ideological division betwe=
en our two countries, because we think, at this stage, both sides have esta=
blished a level of trust and cooperation, including between our militaries,=
 that is reflective of common interests
 and mutual respect.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, one of the things =
that happened through this Comprehensive Partnership is a dialogue between =
the U.S. and Vietnamese military that we hadn=E2=80=99t seen in a very long=
 time.&nbsp; And we already have U.S. vessels that have come here to
 port.&nbsp; We expect that there will be deepening cooperation between our=
 militaries, oftentimes around how do we respond to humanitarian disasters =
in this region.&nbsp; There may be occasions in which that means that addit=
ional U.S. vessels might visit, but I want
 to emphasize that we will do so only at the invitation and with the cooper=
ation of the Vietnamese government, fully respecting their sovereignty and =
their sensitivities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, there is, I think, a g=
enuine mutual concern with respect to maritime issues between the United St=
ates and Vietnam, and I've made no secret of that.&nbsp; Vietnam, along wit=
h ASEAN, met at my invitation in Sunnylands, California, and
 we put forward a very close statement that it is important for us to maint=
ain the freedom of navigation and the governance of international norms and=
 rules and law that have helped to create prosperity and promoted commerce =
and peace and security in this region.&nbsp;
 And it's my belief that, with respect to the South China Sea -- although t=
he United States doesn=E2=80=99t support any particular claim -- we are sup=
portive of the notion that these issues should be resolved peacefully, dipl=
omatically, in accordance with international
 rules and norms, and not based on who's the bigger party and who can throw=
 their weight around a little bit more.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, as I indi=
cated in my initial statement, the United States is going to continue to fl=
y and set courses for our ships as international law allows.&nbsp; Our hope=
 is that, ultimately, various claimants and various disputes
 can be resolved, and we'll do everything that we can to promote that.&nbsp=
; In the meantime, part of our cooperation with Vietnam is to improve their=
 maritime security posture for a whole host of reasons.&nbsp; But I want to=
 emphasize that my decision to lift the ban
 really was more reflective of the changing nature of the relationship.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last point, with respec=
t specifically to human rights, as I indicated in my opening statement, thi=
s is an area where we still have differences.&nbsp; There's been modest pro=
gress on some of the areas that we've identified as a concern.&nbsp;
 TPP actually is one of the things that's prompting a series of labor refor=
ms here in Vietnam that could end up being extraordinarily significant.&nbs=
p; But that is not directly tied to the decision around military sales.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT QUANG:&nbsp; (As =
interpreted.)&nbsp; Thank you very much for the question.&nbsp; I just want=
 to make some comments on the human rights cooperation in the general relat=
ions between the two countries.&nbsp; Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
 the consistent position and viewpoint of the Vietnamese state and governme=
nt is to protect and promote human rights.&nbsp; This is clearly codified a=
nd stipulated in the national constitution of Vietnam in 2013.&nbsp; We are=
 now institutionalizing all the regulations
 into our laws and -- documents to respect and promote the human rights in =
Vietnam.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past 30 years of r=
eform in Vietnam, Vietnam has achieved remarkable progress in socioeconomic=
 development, defense and security, especially in protection and promotion =
of human rights and the rights of every citizen in Vietnam.&nbsp;
 Those achievements have been highly recognized and officiated by the inter=
national community.&nbsp; One of the examples -- very good examples to show=
case Vietnam's progress, that Vietnam has been elected as a member of the U=
.N. Human Rights Council in 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As President Obama mentione=
d earlier, between the two countries, Vietnam and the U.S., we do have some=
 differences in some fields, and it is very easy to understand, particularl=
y on human rights.&nbsp; We are of the view that based on the
 respect and the spirit of mutual understanding, we need to work closely to=
gether and expand our dialogue together.&nbsp; And by so doing, we can narr=
ow the gap in understanding and narrowing the differences between the count=
ries, especially on human rights.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the floor is still open=
.&nbsp; I invite other questions.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (As int=
erpreted.)&nbsp; You have visited over 50 countries during your term as U.S=
. President, and Vietnam is among the last ones on the list.&nbsp; So what =
does that say about the Vietnam-U.S. relation?&nbsp; And how important does=
 the U.S.
 view Vietnam in its foreign policy?&nbsp; Thank you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well=
, I would have liked to have gotten here sooner.&nbsp; And maybe one of the=
 ways of thinking about it is, we have an expression in the United States -=
- we save the best for last.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So it's a remarkable
 country.&nbsp; It's a beautiful country.&nbsp; And I told the President th=
at, unfortunately, when I visit, I'm usually in meetings all day long.&nbsp=
; So hopefully, when I'm no longer President, I can come here with my famil=
y and I can spend a little more time, and travel
 the country a little bit more, and get to know the people and eat the food=
, and have a more relaxing schedule.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the reason I'm here is =
because Vietnam is extremely important not just to the region, but I think =
to the world.&nbsp; First of all, I think highlighting the changes that hav=
e taken place between our two countries, how just a generation
 ago we were adversaries and now we are friends, should give us hope, shoul=
d be a reminder of the ability for us to transform relationships when we ha=
ve a dialogue that's based on mutual interests and mutual respect and peopl=
e-to-people exchanges.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Vietnam is a large,=
 vital, growing country in a large, vital, and growing region of the world.=
&nbsp; I've said this before:&nbsp; The Asia Pacific region is growing as f=
ast as any place around the world.&nbsp; It is a young and dynamic region.&=
nbsp;
 It is full of entrepreneurial spirit, and you're seeing new companies and =
new jobs being created constantly.&nbsp; So the United States wants to be a=
 part of that.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we, historically, hav=
e had good relations with many countries in this region.&nbsp; We want to m=
ake sure that as Vietnam grows and becomes more prosperous and achieves gre=
ater opportunity, that the young people of
 Vietnam have a chance to partner with the young people of the United State=
s -- trading, exchanging ideas, working on scientific projects, starting bu=
sinesses together -- because I think that will be good for both countries.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we think that it is i=
mportant, from my perspective, that as a leader in ASEAN, that we engage Vi=
etnam bilaterally because we want to continue to strengthen our cooperation=
 with the multilateral organizations
 like the East Asia Summit and ASEAN where we think we've seen some very re=
al progress over the last several years -- on everything from commercial is=
sues to disease control to humanitarian issues.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">One of the things that we=
 increasingly discover is it's harder and harder to solve problems by ourse=
lves.&nbsp; It's much easier for us to be able to tackle big problems like =
climate change, or the outbreak of disease,
 or responding to humanitarian disasters when we have an architecture of co=
operation already established.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So on all these fronts, w=
e've seen remarkable progress.&nbsp; The announcements that we're making to=
day I think should give people an indication of the next stage of the U.S.-=
Vietnamese relationship.&nbsp; These are big deals,
 all the things that we mentioned here today.&nbsp; And it indicates a broa=
der and deeper relationship that I'm confident will continue to grow in the=
 future.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
 you.&nbsp; President Obama, the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems fairly sta=
lled in Congress, and other countries are looking to follow the U.S. lead i=
n terms of how they advance their approval of the agreement.&nbsp;
 With the deals today announced for Boeing and GE, and your visit here to V=
ietnam, are you looking to change your strategy in how you seek approval fo=
r the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress?&nbsp; And do you think that th=
e agreement should be amended to address
 currency manipulation?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Secondly, President Obama=
, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader, Muhammad Mansour, and o=
n Pakistan=E2=80=99s concern about that strike happening on its soil?&nbsp;=
 Can you also comment on whether this signals a new
 offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more ha=
rdline leader might take his place?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">For President Quang, are =
you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnershi=
p in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end?&nbsp; A=
nd how do you respond to China=E2=80=99s criticism
 of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asi=
a that risks regional peace?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; So=
, first of all, on TPP, Angela, I haven't been around as long as Senator Ca=
rper or Secretary Kerry, but I've spent enough time in the Senate to know t=
hat every trade deal is painful, because
 folks are always seeing if they can get an even better deal.&nbsp; And esp=
ecially when you have multiple parties involved, folks are going to be scru=
tinizing it, they=E2=80=99re going to be debating it, and in an election ye=
ar, you can anticipate that some folks are going
 to try to score political points off it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Having said that, I remai=
n confident we're going to get it done.&nbsp; And the reason I'm confident =
is because it's the right thing to do.&nbsp; It's good for the country.&nbs=
p; It's good for America.&nbsp; It's good for the region.&nbsp;
 It's good for the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I know I've said this=
 to you before, but let me reiterate:&nbsp; This is the fastest-growing par=
t of the world.&nbsp; This represents an enormous market for the United Sta=
tes.&nbsp; Most countries here already sell their stuff
 to the United States, and we have relatively low tariffs.&nbsp; In other w=
ords, we put relatively low taxes on goods that are coming into the United =
States.&nbsp; In contrast, tariffs are significantly higher for United Stat=
es goods being sold here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So a deal that gets rid o=
f 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods into the largest, fastest-growing markets of t=
he world -- that's a good deal for American businesses and American workers=
.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Number two, one of the bi=
ggest complaints about trade deals historically has been that it opens up o=
ur markets to countries with lower wages, harsher labor practices, less env=
ironmental regulation.&nbsp; Well, if you're
 signing up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you are making commitments t=
hat are enforceable to raise labor standards, to ensure that workers have a=
 voice to attend to environmental problems.&nbsp; And so this gives us the =
ability to engage with a country like
 Vietnam and work with them on all those fronts -- the precise things that =
people, in the past, have been concerned about when it comes to trading wit=
h other countries.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I have not yet seen a =
credible argument that once we get TPP in place we're going to be worse off=
.&nbsp; We are demonstrably better off.&nbsp; American workers and American=
 businesses are better off if we get this deal
 passed.&nbsp; And I'm confident we will get it passed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, the politics of it w=
ill be noisy.&nbsp; That was true when I, for example, inherited the Korea =
Free Trade Agreement, or the Colombia and Panamanian Free Trade Agreements =
when I came into office.&nbsp; But we got them
 done.&nbsp; And I'm confident that we'll get them done this time, as well,=
 although there will be ups and downs and bumps along the way.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">With respect to currency =
manipulation, we have provisions in TPP that advance the transparency and r=
eporting functions that allow us to monitor whether we think that currency =
manipulation is taking place.&nbsp; One of
 the debates that took place -- and there have been some who argue that we =
should have enforceable provisions that if you see a currency going down to=
o far that we should be able to impose tariffs on that country.&nbsp; The p=
roblem is, is that it's very hard to
 sort out sometimes why a currency is going down and whether it's actually =
being manipulated.&nbsp; And frankly, for us to bind other countries to com=
mitments about their monetary policy would mean we were also binding our Fe=
deral Reserve to the claims of other
 countries in terms of how it implements our monetary policy, and that's no=
t something that we would do.&nbsp; We would not give up sovereignty with r=
espect to our monetary policy in that way.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But we have strengthened =
a number of the provisions that are already contained in TPP that will allo=
w us to put on notice folks who we think are engaging in competitive devalu=
ations.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Finally, on the Taliban l=
eader, Mr. Mansour.&nbsp; It has been confirmed that he is dead.&nbsp; And =
he is an individual who, as head of the Taliban, was specifically targeting=
 U.S. personnel and troops inside of Afghanistan
 who were there as part of the mission that I've set to be able to maintain=
 a counterterrorism platform and provide assistance and training to the Afg=
han military forces there.&nbsp; So this does not represent a shift in our =
approach.&nbsp; We are not reentering the
 day-to-day combat operations that are currently being conducted by Afghan =
security forces.&nbsp; Our job is to help Afghanistan secure its own countr=
y, not to have our men and women in uniform engage in that fight for them.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">On the other hand, where =
we have a high-profile leader who has been consistently part of operations =
and plans to potentially harm U.S. personnel, and who has been resistant to=
 the kinds of peace talks and reconciliation
 that ultimately could bring an end to decades of war in Afghanistan, then =
it is my responsibility as Commander-in-Chief not to stand by, but to make =
sure that we send a clear signal to the Taliban and others that we're going=
 to protect our people.&nbsp; And that's
 exactly the message that has been sent.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT QUANG:&nbsp; (A=
s interpreted.)&nbsp; Let me respond to this question concerning the Trans-=
Pacific Partnership -- TPP.&nbsp; In our view, TPP is a significant trade a=
nd economic linkage, contributing to sustaining the
 dynamism and the role as a driver for economic growth in our country, as w=
ell as in the Asia Pacific region.&nbsp; And for Vietnam, TPP and Vietnam=
=E2=80=99s participation in TPP is one step undertaken by the Vietnamese go=
vernment in our process of extensive international
 integration.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Mr=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRESIDENT QUANG:&nbsp; (A=

 TPP countries, have been making efforts to narrow differences, to promote =
cooperation in the spirit of mutual understanding

constructiveness and understanding, and paying attention to one another=E2=

 successful outcomes of all 12 members of the TPP,
