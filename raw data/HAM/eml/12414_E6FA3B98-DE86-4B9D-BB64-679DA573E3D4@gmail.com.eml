 an alternative event Saturday night.</p>

<p style=3D"font-size:16px"></p>
<p style=3D"font-size:16px">Alaskan Democrats gave&nbsp;Sanders 81.6&nbsp;p=

<p>At the State Democratic Convention in Anchorage, one of the big jobs par=
ty leaders have is to elect delegates to attend the national convention in =
July, when the presidential nominee will be decided.</p>
<p>Back in March, candidate Bernie Sanders won the state=E2=80=99s Democrat=
ic caucus in a big way. All 16 of the state=E2=80=99s regular delegates who=
 will go the national convention in Philadelphia are pledged to vote for hi=
m. But the state also has four super delegates who
 can vote for whomever they want.</p>
<p>Casey Steinau is one of the super delegates. Steinau is the chairman of =
the Alaska Democratic Party, but as a super delegate, she=E2=80=99s undecla=
red.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9DI am the chairman of the party and I believe that it is my job =
to represent 100 percent of the Alaska Democrats and I take that roll very =
seriously,=E2=80=9D Steinau said. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think my persona=
l preferences should be influencing anyone.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>But the idea that super delegates can vote for whomever they want doesn=
=E2=80=99t sit well with many Democrats.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CI think there probably will be a resolution or a platform chang=
e or something coming out of this convention which says we don=E2=80=99t ne=
cessarily agree with this and we would ask the DNC to reassess it,=E2=80=9D=
 Steinau said.</p>
<p>Steinau said the resolution might ask to get rid of super delegates alto=
gether or require them to vote for the person who won the state caucus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ddemocrats who support Hilary Clinton are also attending the =
convention. Carolyn Lee with the Hilary for Alaska campaign said there are =
a lot of people who like both candidates.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CWe are also getting a lot of Bernie supporters coming up and sa=
ying, =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m going to be with Hilary in a couple of weeks but=
 today I=E2=80=99m with Bernie,=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D Lee said.</p>
<p>Steinau said she was hopeful Alaska Democrats would support whichever ca=
ndidate wins the Party=E2=80=99s nomination.</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CThey both bring so much to the table and at the end of the day =
when that person is decided I know that we will come together as a united f=
ront.=E2=80=9D</p>
