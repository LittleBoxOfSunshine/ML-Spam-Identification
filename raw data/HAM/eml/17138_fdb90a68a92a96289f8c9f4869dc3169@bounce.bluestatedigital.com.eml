Friend--

This election comes down to three simple things:

1. We've got to elect a Democratic president. We have to.
We've seen who the alternative is.

2. We have to get more Democrats elected to the Senate and
the House who will support a Democratic president.

3. We've got to elect Democratic governors and legislators=20
all across the country. There are so many important decisions=20
that are being made in our statehouses, from funding for=20
women's health services to protecting the rights of our LGBT
neighbors. We can't take anything for granted.

The Democratic National Committee is the only official Democratic=20
Party organization that is committed to all three -- to electing=20
Democrats in every state at every level of office.

So before the deadline at the end of this month, I'm asking
you to support them with a donation of $3 or more. Can you
step up?

Thanks.
