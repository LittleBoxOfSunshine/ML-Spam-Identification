Subject: RE: Video Request: Trump Rally in WV at 7pm

Trump is ramping up attempts to tie HRC to Clinton Administration
- Now doing it on more than just NAFTA

Trump Rally in Charleston, West Virginia:

Stephen Miller intro

(Interlude music, mostly Rolling Stones)

Trump Remarks:

We love the miners. Bring back coal.
Not as fun now that I'm the only one left
- Wish the primary was still going

Told me I didn't have to go to WV now that I won
- But I asked if they already knew we were planning to go.
- And I wanted to come

Hits HRC on comments on coal miners

Always been fascinated with the mines and construction
- Know more about tractors than the people that work at Caterpillar

No longer complain about the rigged system because I won
- Had to knock them out

Bobby Knight endorsement story

Took courage to run for president
- Different kind of courage than you have. I don't think I have that kind of courage

Touts victories in the Northeast

Announces endorsement from WV Coal Association
- It was an easy decision between me and Hillary
- Trump accepts hard hat and puts it on

Not allowed to use hairspray anymore because of the ozone
- Hairspray not as good anymore

Need all kinds of energy so we're not in the hands of OPEC

Tells West Virginians not to vote, and to save it for the general

Accepts Vincente Fox apology
Border patrol endorsement

Over Regulation is killing our families
- Killing jobs

Criticizing NAFTA and Clinton Administration
- Hillary was a part of "almost everything" in the Clinton Administration. "Almost"

Manufacturing and jobs being stripped
- "would rather be a coal miner than a statistician"

Crooked Hillary
- Sanders has one thing right. Knows we're being ripped off on trade

Carrier Air Conditioning

Don't have to go to Wharton, don't have to go to high school, to know we're getting ripped off on trade

Don't need to give subsidies or loans to keep companies in the US
- They are rich. Too complex to give incentives
- Just talk to them and tell them the consequences of moving
- Conservatives hate me because I say we should tax companies sending units back to U.S. from Mexico

I normally tell you to go vote, but you don't have to anymore
- Your general

NAFTA was a total Clinton deal

HRC said what she did about coal miners because it was the one time she was talking without a teleprompter

John Denver was a good friend of mine
- That really is a great song (County Roads was played as walk-on music)

Win again
- Take care of vets, get rid of Common Core, education local, get rid of Obamacare, build the wall

"We're going to let people come into our country. We're going to let A LOT of people come into our country. But they are going to come in legally-- legally."

Promises to come back to West Virginia at least one or two more times before November
- Very important state in West Virginia

America First
