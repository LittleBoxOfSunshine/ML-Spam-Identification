Donald Trump's position on transgender rights is incoherent, not "nuanced"<=
http://www.vox.com/2016/5/17/11689500/donald-trump-transgender-bathrooms>
VOX // GERMAN LOPEZ

The Washington Post picked an interesting word<https://www.washingtonpost.c=
om/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/16/trump-rescind-obamas-transgender-direct=
ives-but-protect-everybody/> to describe Donald Trump's new position on leg=
al protections for transgender people: "nuanced."

A better word, however, might be "incoherent."

Trans people are "a very, very small portion of the population, but as I sa=
id, you have to protect everybody, including small portions of the populati=
on," Trump told the Post. But he added that it should be left to the states=
, most of which he said would "make the right decisions." So he would resci=
nd the Obama administration's guidelines<http://www.vox.com/2016/5/13/11669=
172/obama-administration-transgender-bathrooms> telling federally funded sc=
hools to respect the rights of trans people, including their right to use a=
 bathroom that aligns with their gender identity.

In other words, Trump thinks trans people should be protected by the law, b=
ut he wants to take away the only federal policy clearly doing just that in=
 public schools. Pressed on this incoherent position, he invoked the old ma=
ntra of "states' rights."

As a concept, leaving something to the states makes sense if there's someth=
ing local and state governments can do better than the federal government, =
or if it would be too burdensome or unwieldy for the federal government to =
get involved. A good example of that: fire departments. There's really no r=
eason to think a federal fire department would be particularly more effecti=
ve in a big city or county than a local one. (Obviously, some exceptions ma=
y apply with wildfires and in sparsely populated or low-income areas.)

Discrimination in schools is not one of those issues. The history and curre=
nt experience make that very clear.
...

We have seen how this plays out already - in the 1960s, when the federal go=
vernment had to step in to force schools to stop discriminating against bla=
ck people. It's one of the big reasons the Civil Rights Act passed in the f=
irst place.

Similarly, the federal government passed Title IX in the 1970s after it bec=
ame clear that states were failing to ensure equal opportunities for women =
in schools.

Now the country is seeing the same kind of failure with trans people. For o=
ne, most states do not have explicit anti-discrimination protections for tr=
ans people in the workplace, housing, education, or public accommodations (=
hotels, restaurants, and other places that serve the public). So it's not e=
xplicitly illegal under most states' laws to fire, evict, or refuse service=
 to someone entirely because she's trans.
...

In fact, some states are actively discriminating against trans people. That=
's what North Carolina did when it passed a law<http://www.vox.com/2016/2/2=
3/11100552/charlotte-north-carolina-lgbtq-pat-mccrory> that banned local no=
ndiscrimination ordinances that include sexual orientation and gender ident=
ity, and banned trans people from using the bathroom that aligns with their=
 gender identity in schools and government buildings.

Some people might wonder why denying trans people access to the bathroom fo=
r their gender identity is discrimination. It's simple: Forcing trans peopl=
e to use the bathroom that doesn't align with their gender identity acts as=
 a reminder that, as far as society has come on some LGBTQ issues, it's sti=
ll not completely willing to accept trans people and their identities - eve=
n if trans people pose no danger to anyone else<http://www.vox.com/cards/tr=
ansgender-myths-fiction-facts/transgender-bathroom-bills>. So to trans peop=
le, this is just another slight by society. And it's a slight most states a=
llow - and that North Carolina explicitly embraced.

This is why the Obama administration got involved. If the country believes =
that anti-LGBTQ discrimination should be illegal (and majorities do in ever=
y state<http://www.vox.com/2016/2/19/11054174/nondiscrimination-law-support=
-map>), but states aren't stopping that discrimination from happening, it m=
akes sense for the federal government - which has historically done this wh=
en states fail - to intervene, especially in schools the federal government=
 funds. That's exactly what happened.
