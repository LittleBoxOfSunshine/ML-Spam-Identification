 DNC Chair Statement on Democratic Presidential Debate

DES MOINES - Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schu=
ltz issued the following statement on the DNC/Iowa Democratic Party/CBS/KCC=
I/Des Moines Register Debate held at Drake University tonight:

"Democrats, like people the world over, woke up today with a heavy heart bu=
t proud to stand with the people of Paris and our allies across the globe i=
n the wake of the horrific violence they experienced last night. Tonight, t=
he American people tuned in to hear directly from three extremely qualified=
 candidates running to be their Commander-in-Chief and build on President O=
bama's legacy of bringing terrorists to justice and keeping American civili=
ans safe.

"What they heard was a spirited debate, one that showed that our Democratic=
 candidates have a firm grasp on America's foreign policy challenges, while=
 respecting voters and keeping the discussion at a serious and substantive =
level. Our candidates also showed that they are the only ones running for p=
resident who understand the importance of investing in the middle class and=
 strengthening the economy to keep America moving forward.

"Our candidates are the only ones committed to making college affordable, t=
o raising the federal minimum wage, to protecting our seniors, to fixing th=
e broken immigration system, and to addressing climate change.

"Tonight provided a stark contrast from what we saw all week from the Repub=
lican field, with an embarrassing debate at which they characterized issues=
 like raising the federal minimum wage as a 'disaster' and proved they are =
out of touch, stuck on the failed policies of the past and mired in extremi=
sm. On the economy, this week, Republican candidates offered their worn out=
 proposals  to continue pursuing tax cuts for the wealthy, fixating on taki=
ng us back to the same kind of policies that were in place when our economy=
 was losing 800,000 jobs a month as the last Republican president left offi=
ce. And when it comes to national security and tackling terrorism, all Repu=
blicans could offer was more of the same reckless foreign policy in the vei=
n of Dick Cheney and George W. Bush. The American people can't afford to go=
 backwards.

"I congratulate all of our candidates tonight on a debate that made me even=
 more proud than ever to be a Democrat. Our 45th president was on stage ton=
ight in Des Moines."
