Bernie Sanders and Allies Aim to Shape Democrats' Agenda After Primaries<ht=

By Nicholas Confessore

APRIL 24, 2016



Even as his chances of winning the Democratic presidential nomination slip =
away, Senator Bernie Sanders<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/ele=
ctions/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?inline=3Dnyt-per> and his allies a=
re trying to use his popularity to expand his political influence, setting =
up an ideological struggle for the soul of the Democratic Party<http://topi=
cs.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/democratic_party/i=
ndex.html?inline=3Dnyt-org> in the post-Obama era.

Aides to Mr. Sanders have been pressing party officials for a significant r=
ole in drafting the platform for the Democratic convention in July, aiming =
to lock in strong planks on issues like a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage,=
 breaking up Wall Street banks and banning natural gas "fracking."

Amid his unexpectedly strong showing in the Democratic primaries, Mr. Sande=
rs has tapped his two-million-person donor list to raise money for liberal =
congressional candidates in New York, Nevada and Washington State. And in t=
he waning months of Barack Obama's presidency, Mr. Sanders's allies are tes=
ting their muscle against the White House, mounting a public attack on the =
president's housing secretary, Juli=E1n Castro, over his department's sales=
 of delinquent mortgages to banks and private equity firms.

"There is a greater goal here," said Representative Ra=FAl M. Grijalva of A=
rizona, a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who sent a l=
etter to Mr. Castro criticizing the mortgage sales. "The contribution of Be=
rnie that will be lasting for us is that we will coalesce around an agenda.=
"

The pressure from Mr. Sanders and his allies is putting the party establish=
ment, which is closely aligned with Hillary Clinton<http://www.nytimes.com/=
interactive/2016/us/elections/hillary-clinton-on-the-issues.html?inline=3Dn=
yt-per>, in a delicate position. Democratic leaders are wary of steering th=
e party too far left, but do not want to alienate the Sanders supporters wh=
ose votes Mrs. Clinton needs in November, or risk losing the vast new donor=
 base Mr. Sanders has created.

The institutional bulwarks against Mr. Sanders are significant: Hundreds of=
 the party's "superdelegates" have endorsed Mrs. Clinton, a signal of her b=
road support among the party's power brokers. The Democratic National Commi=
ttee<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/de=
mocratic_national_committee/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-org> now relies on Mrs.=
 Clinton's fund-raising to provide a fifth of its monthly income, an arrang=
ement the Sanders campaign has criticized.

And Mrs. Clinton is well positioned to block any proposals she would not wa=
nt to defend in a general election. In January, the party chairwoman, Repre=
sentative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, appointed dozens of Clinton =
supporters and advisers to the three standing committees of the Democratic =
Party convention. Of 45 potential members submitted by Mr. Sanders, she app=
ointed just three, according to Mr. Sanders's campaign.

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, a top Clinton surrogate, will be co-c=
hairman of the platform committee. Barney Frank, a former Massachusetts con=
gressman and fierce critic of Mr. Sanders and his Wall Street proposals, wi=
ll be a co-chairman of the rules committee, which governs procedure on the =
convention floor. Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said he=
 believed the campaign would ultimately be well represented on all the comm=
ittees as more members are named. But he questioned how Ms. Wasserman Schul=
tz had chosen her discretionary appointments.

"Not only are they supporting Clinton, but they have been extremely critica=
l of Bernie Sanders," Mr. Longabaugh said. "That doesn't seem like the righ=
t way to go if we want to have a convention that is evenhanded."

Luis Miranda, a spokesman for the Democratic National Convention<http://top=
ics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/democratic_national_co=
nvention/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-org>, said the party was "committed to an =
open, inclusive and representative process" to draft the platform.

"Both of our campaigns will be represented on the drafting committee," Mr. =
Miranda said.

Some fissures within the Democratic family may be inevitable. For eight yea=
rs, Mr. Obama's presidency has muted ideological disagreement within the pa=
rty. His moral authority as the country's first black commander in chief, h=
is popularity with grass-roots Democratic voters and his political battles =
with Congress have worked to squelch the kind of ideological battles that h=
ave divided the Republican Party.

But the Democrats' liberal wing, including lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth=
 Warren of Massachusetts, has become more restive in Mr. Obama's second ter=
m. Liberal groups have pressured the president on recent appointments to th=
e Treasury Department and his deportation policies. At the same time, a you=
nger generation of activists is challenging presidential candidates in both=
 parties on issues of criminal justice, police violence and the rights of u=
ndocumented immigrants.

"A boldly populist, people-oriented type of platform is massively appealing=
 to those who have come of age during the financial meltdown and the period=
 afterward," said Kurt Walters, the campaign director at Rootstrikers, a gr=
oup that favors limiting the influence of big donors in politics.

The party is relatively unified on raising the minimum wage to $15, and Mrs=
. Clinton recently voiced qualified support. But there is a risk, some Demo=
crats said, that Mr. Sanders - an independent who is not actually a member =
of the party - would push the party to embrace positions that could later h=
urt Mrs. Clinton and other Democratic candidates.

Mr. Sanders is almost certain to win a prime-time speaking slot at the summ=
er convention, providing one of the biggest audiences yet for his views. So=
me Democrats said they feared a left-wing equivalent of Pat Buchanan's sear=
ing speech at the 1992 Republican convention, when Mr. Buchanan, who had fa=
iled to win his party's nomination, called for a "cultural war" against "li=
berals and radicals."

Matt Bennett, a founder of the center-left think tank Third Way, said Mrs. =
Clinton had so far avoided tacking too far left to compete effectively in a=
 general election. "They need to be careful not to go so far as to hand the=
 Republicans something to beat them over the head with," Mr. Bennett said. =
"Bans on anything tend to be politically problematic."

The campaign against Mr. Castro's policies at the Department of Housing and=
 Urban Development, called "Don't Sell Our Homes to Wall Street," could for=
eshadow the kind of leverage progressives would like to exert after Novembe=
r. Mr. Castro, one of the country's most prominent young Latino politicians=
, is seen as a potential vice-presidential pick<http://www.nytimes.com/2016=
/04/24/us/politics/hillary-clinton-vice-president.html> for Mrs. Clinton.

But the pressure tactics are also likely to sow more of the bitterness that=
 has come to dominate Mr. Sanders's primary battle with Mrs. Clinton.

This month, Mr. Sanders asked his supporters to contribute money to Lucy Fl=
ores, a former Nevada assemblywoman running for Congress.

In his email, Mr. Sanders also suggested that Emily's List, a political act=
ion committee that is dedicated to electing women who support abortion righ=
ts and is close to Mrs. Clinton, had spurned Ms. Flores in her race because=
 she had endorsed Mr. Sanders. Emily's List, which has endorsed Ms. Flores =
in past campaigns, backed another Democratic candidate.

The claim drew a sharp response from Emily's List, one of the most powerful=
 groups in mainstream Democratic politics.

"We support several candidates who have endorsed him, so he should stick to=
 issues rather than disingenuous attacks," said Marcy Stech, a spokeswoman =
for Emily's List.

But in an interview, Ms. Flores said she believed there was a broader agend=
a at play in the group's decision.

"It's just like with the presidential race," Ms. Flores said. "The Democrat=
ic Party and the establishment have their ideas about who they want to supp=
ort."
