Claire,

Jordan forgot to include us in the delinquents, but I think that's because
he assumed I sent these yesterday. In fairness, I meant to actually, but
here they are. Sorry about that.

Let us know if we need to send a spreadsheet with contacts for them, but
all these folks are pretty well known donors to women's groups/causes.

Thanks,

Michael

are possibilities)

Come on - you are so busy you can't send Claire a few names.  Before 9 am
eastern please. And that's today. Like in 45 minutes.

other cool perks. Obviously they can go to the summit too.
