The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Justin --

Fifty years ago this week, a young guy named John Lewis and
a group of about 600 brave men and women set out to cross a
bridge in Selma, Alabama to begin their march towards
Montgomery in pursuit of access and equality for themselves
and for us all.

The trials that this special group of patriots faced along
their 54-mile journey displayed to the rest of our country
and the world that change was necessary. Through their
struggle, we made huge gains for voting rights that helped
reshape the course of America's future.

But even after five decades of progress, this fundamental
right to use one's voice at the ballot box is still being
threatened today.

While I was in Selma this weekend, I listened with a full
heart to President Obama's remarks -- how America is a
constant work in progress. And the operative word here is
work, Justin -- because without the hard work from the
President, you, and Democrats from all over the country, we
can't ever expect to make or sustain progress. This work, to
continuously stride towards a more perfect union, requires
consistency and diligence from all of us in order to
make our Founding Fathers' words our reality.

We need to strengthen the Voting Rights Act so that we can
keep working towards the promise of our country's most
fundamental freedom -- the right to represent one's self
through our voting process. That's why I'm asking you to
stand up on behalf of each of these heroes by signing your
name to protect voting rights for every single American:

Thanks for remembering those who stood up before us, Justin.
Now, let's keep our progress going.
