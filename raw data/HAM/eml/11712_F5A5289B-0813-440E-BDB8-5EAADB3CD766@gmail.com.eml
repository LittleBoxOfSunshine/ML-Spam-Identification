<p class=3D"MsoNormal">There are rumors about Sanders supporters preparing =
for civil disobedience and organized disruptions at the Democratic conventi=
on itself. OK, but then what? History has shown that convention protests, e=
ven intra-party protests, can lead
 to meaningful change, but even if progressive activists literally started =
fires on the convention floor, in a display of violent catharsis, how does =
that bring Sanders and his allies any closer to their goals?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><i>[Sanders=E2=80=99] newly resolute attitude is als=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">It=E2=80=99s worth noting, however, that the nationa=

 to make sure Sanders appeared on the New Hampshire and D.C. primary ballot=
