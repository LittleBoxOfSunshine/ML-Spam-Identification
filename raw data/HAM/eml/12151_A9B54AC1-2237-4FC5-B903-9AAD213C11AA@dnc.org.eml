Could potentially use this part along with that story about the cost of his trade policies yesterday. Since actually, it could be way worse...

Saying "Who the hell cares about a trade war?"
- $505 billion trade deficit with China
- "Let there be something"
- A trade war can't be worse than a $505 billion trade deficit

Trump on Morning Joe:

Why are you up early this morning tweeting?
- Because I like getting up early and I like tweeting. I like getting the message out

Polls against Hillary?
- Leading in Rasmussen
- HRC has bad 'judgement'
- Benghazi is an example of her bad judgment

Would you have stayed out of Libya?
- I would have stayed out of Iraq, Libya

Would you have stayed out of Syria?
- I would have stayed out of Syria and wouldn't have gone after Assad as hard
- Would still take out ISIS
- Focus on ISIS not Assad
- Lindsey Graham called me, which was nice, but I disagree with him on this
- Russia is on the side of Assad, which is a complicating factor

Visiting North Korea and meeting with Kim Jong Un? But attacking Great Britain?
- Would never go there. The last place I would go
- Not attacking Great Britain or David Cameron
- They invited me to visit 10 Downing Street, and I might do it

Orea joke at Chris Christie fundraiser?
- You don't think that was appropriate?

Robert Gates comments about scaring allies?
- He knows nothing about me, he knows nothing about what I said
- I know he has a great reputation, but we need a new group with better thinking
- I want Japan and South Korea to pay up
- We can't afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Germany, NATO, Japan, South Korea
- Bob Gates is misrepresenting

Gates is one of the brightest foreign policy minds?
- Really? Look where our country is?

Trigger-happy with your words on Twitter?
- Whats wrong with them
- "I can practically guarantee what happened to that plane"
- If another couple planes go down, you will have a massive depression worldwide because no one will travel
- 4 more years of a weak Hillary Clinton will not work

Saying "Who the hell cares about a trade war?"
- $505 billion trade deficit with China
- "Let there be something"
- A trade war can't be worse than a $505 billion trade deficit
- Killing us with currency manipulation
- Hits Bob Gates again. Then criticizes him for lack of loyalty

45% tariff just a negotiating position?
- I hate to tell China that
- But I'll tell China now, I'll impose it if they don't behave

Bernie Sanders as a running mate?
- Great question
- The one thing we agree on is trade
- He will lose because his system is rigged. He should run as an independent
