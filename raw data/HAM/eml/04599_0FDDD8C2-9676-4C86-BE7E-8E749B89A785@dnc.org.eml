Trump was gracious, tone was spot on and that is the Trump we are going to see more of moving forward. What you are going to see from me and him moving forward

Donald trump will become the nominee, didn't promise him anything, he is going to become part of the party. They join the party, we don't join them. 

We talked about bringing the party together and unifying. 

Trump still had to get to 1237. It's up to Kasich to decide what he's going to do.

We need to get going, get more boots on the ground. 

CNN showing poll- Only 7% of the GOP voters see the party as united. 
That's why I'm here on CNN at 630 Wisconsin time talking to you. Have to work at it. 

Hits HRC- she won't sign a Paul Ryan budget or elect conservatives to SCOTUS 

I didn't have to pour Bailey's in my cereal this morning, I had coffee already this morning, it's not needed
