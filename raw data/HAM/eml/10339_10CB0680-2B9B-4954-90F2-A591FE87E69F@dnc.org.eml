HRC has a legacy of nation building and special privileges for everyone except Americans

Reinforcing "Temporary hold" on refugees

What are we bringing refugees to our county for? When they can stay in the region of the world where they feel most comfortable

Women are not single issue voters, says trump has 10 point lead among Hispanics, does unbelievably well with African Americans

What women want, in my opinion is safety for their homeland

Media hyping up rifts in campaign that aren't there. We have a small tight knit campaign and says he is still campaign manager.
