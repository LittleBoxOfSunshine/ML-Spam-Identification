Excerpts from DNC Press Call with Reps. Elizabeth Esty, Pete Aguilar, Brady=
 Campaign President Dan Gross, and Gun Violence Prevention Advocates discus=
sing Donald Trump at the NRA Leadership Forum

This morning, Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty, Congressman Pete Aguilar, Brady=
 Campaign President Dan Gross, and gun violence prevention advocates held a=
 conference call to discuss Donald Trump's appearance at the National Rifle=
 Association Leadership Forum.

Below find excerpts as prepared for delivery.


Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty (CT-5)



Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut is in my district. I a=
m sickened and horrified that in the three-and-a-half years since those sho=
otings, nothing has been done to combat gun violence. I lay the blame on th=
e NRA and the Members of Congress who are beholden to them.
Despite the fact that 90 percent of Americans supported action on gun refor=
m after the Newtown tragedy, the NRA and their allies worked to defeat the =
bill by spreading rumors and falsehoods. Meanwhile, news of shootings acros=
s the country still dominate the headlines.
Both of our Democratic presidential candidates have proposed solutions to a=
ddress this crisis, and President Obama's executive actions earlier this ye=
ar addresses this crisis by expanding background checks,  effectively enfor=
cing the laws already on the books, increasing mental health treatment, and=
 funding research for gun safety technology.
Congressman Pete Aguilar (CA-31)
...
We have held so many moments of silence for those lost to gun violence. We =
have prayed for their families, and we have vowed to take steps so that thi=
s would never happen again. Our words are empty if our actions don't back t=
hem up.

No single reform could have stopped the tragedy that unfolded in San Bernar=
dino, but that's not an excuse to ignore the need for a national discussion=
 around gun safety.
 ...
I don't know how officials at the NRA or the Republican Party sleep at nigh=
t, knowing that we can and should do more to protect our communities. There=
's an emptiness to our unanswered prayers for change when we don't take ste=
ps to work for the type of change that we want. I don't want to hold anothe=
r moment of silence - I want Congress to work towards a sensible solution a=
nd I want the Republican Party to realize that they answer to the American =
public, not the NRA.

Dan Gross, President of the Brady Campaign

...As the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump has mad=
e gun violence in America a campaign trail punchline. In January, the front=
 runner speculated that he could "stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and sho=
ot somebody" without hurting his popularity.
...
Make no mistake: this presidential election represents a critical crossroad=
s for this issue and for our collective safety. Lives are literally at stak=
e. The choice between Democrats and Donald Trump will be a referendum on gu=
n violence in America - and the result will make a big difference either he=
lping to fight or fuel the problem.
...
As he prepares to address the National Rifle Association as today's keynote=
 speaker, I challenge Donald Trump to stand by the 74% of NRA members who w=
ant expanded Brady background checks and I call on him to support Senator S=
chumer's recently introduced Brady Bill 2.0 that expands background checks =
to all gun sales.

Po Murray, Chair of the Newtown Action Alliance

I have lived in Sandy Hook for 17 years. I am a mother of 4 children, all g=
raduates of Sandy Hook Elementary School. The shooter lived in my neighborh=
ood. I lost my neighbors and our children's teachers. The entire community =
was and continues to be heartbroken. We made a promise to take action to en=
d gun violence.
...
Donald Trump appeals to the worst elements in our country. If he were elect=
ed president, we should be afraid of the toxic combustion that could result=
 from his hateful rhetoric plus his reckless views on guns.
...
It's crystal clear that Donald Trump stands with the NRA and the gun indust=
ry---not the families of Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Columbine or others im=
pacted by gun violence. America will not be great without meaningful common=
 sense gun measures. More and more American families are touched by gun vio=
lence every single day. We need the voters to elect a President who will pr=
ioritize and lead on the issue of gun violence prevention to make America s=
afe again.

Tom Mauser, father of Columbine victim Daniel Mauser and spokesman for Colo=
rado Ceasefire

What's most disturbing to me about Donald Trump is his view on background c=
hecks. At Columbine, where my son was killed, background checks were an imp=
ortant issue.
...
What are we going to do about the 33,000 plus gun deaths and 70,000 plus gu=
n injuries that we suffer every year?
...
I'm looking forward to an election where we really put the question to him:=
 why do you not support the 90 percent of Americans, Mr. Trump, that suppor=
t stronger background checks?
