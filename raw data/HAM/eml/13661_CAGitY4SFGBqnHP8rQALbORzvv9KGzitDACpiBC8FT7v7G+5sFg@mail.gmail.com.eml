Hey guys --

Heads up: we are moving away from calling Trump's speech incoherent etc...
and more making the point that it's dangerous. It's not that he's in over
his head -- it's that he's advocating for some very dangerous policies that
undermine our national interest and our security.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zac
