Subject: Travel pool 7/more Dreamplex and lid

Obama interviewed the entrepreneurs for about 20 minutes before they turn=
ed the tables and asked him some questions. The first was, "When you were=
 a kid did you dream of becoming president one day?'

The president responded: "No. Some people, they had a very clear vision f=
or themselves. I was not as well organized as all of you when I was young=
. It wasn't until i was in college that i began to develop a sense of wan=
ting to make a difference and even then i didn't know how i might do it. =
I was actually very skeptical of politics. I thought politicians were not=
 always looking out for the people, too often they were looking out for t=
hemselves. I worked in communities trying to hold politicians accountable=
. The first job I did was in the non profit sector. Not until I finished =
law school did I think I might be interested in politics. I went law scho=
ol with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman; he was much smarter tha=
n me. Not until I came out of law school did I think I might run for offi=
ce some day."

Obama then said young people today are more sophisticated and the interne=
t has allowed more ideas to reach them when thinking about their careers =
and lives and what they can do. He said young people now not thinking the=
y'll work 30-40 years in same job "because the economy is just changing s=
o quickly."

He said a rule in Silicon Valley is that if you haven't failed, you're pr=
obably not a good entrepreneur because "the first idea you have is not go=
ing to work. You have to be resilient and learn from your failures."

The other woman asked whether Malia could visit Vietnam, but Potus chuckl=
ed and noted she's nearly 18 and implied she no longer listens to him: "I=
f you want her to come to Vietnam, I shouldn't be the one to tell her. Yo=
u should tell her."

Obama said the world is interconnected more than every and easier for ent=
repreneurs with good ideas to aim globally. He then was asked about the T=
PP and he said he's confident it will pass and gave a long answer about t=
he benefits of the deal. He said past deals and outflows of jobs to China=
 and Mexico gave impression that trade deals are bad for US economy but h=
e emphasized that the US economy gained a lot of jobs in other sectors an=
d trade deals are on positive a benefit. He said some people remain skept=
ical because of past deals but overall the American public supports such =
deals.
"The good news is the majority of Americans still believe in trade. The b=
ad news is politics in the United States is not always, how should I put =
it, reasonable. That's the word I want. but I'm confident we're going to =
get it done. In past negotiations on trade deals, even though there was a=
 lot of opposition at end of the day we get it don."

"Nothing's easy in Washington these days. But despite the lack of coopera=
tion in Congress, I seem to be able to get a lot of things done anyways. =
It could be easier. I would have a lot less gray hair if Congress was wor=
king effectively." He gave shouts out to Congressmen  Castro and O'Rourke=
 who were among the crowd and joined him on the trip.

After the session, the motorcade drove a couple miles to the Potus hotel =
and we have a lid.
