THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release April 28, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST

WITH COLLEGE REPORTERS



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20







3:22 P.M. EDT



MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Its nice to see you all. Welcome =
to the White House. And welcome to the White House Briefing Room. This is=
 obviously the room where, every day, or almost every day, I come and do =
a briefing with the White House Press Corps. So these are journalists who=
 have devoted a significant portion of their lives to covering the White =
House very closely.=20



And we often talk about how this is the venue where independent, professi=
onal journalists ask tough questions. And this is where the President of =
the United States sends a senior member of his staff to come out and answ=
er those questions. People can ask whatever they want, and the whole thin=
g takes place on the record, for everybody to see, on camera. And it is a=
n important part of our democracy, and Im glad that well be able to do it=
 in a way that all of you can participate in at least this unique way.



So with that, Im mostly interested in answering the questions that youre =
interested in talking about. So lets move around. So yes, this young lady=
 in the back, Ill let you go first.



Q I was wondering if you think theres a problem with the way that the med=
ia actually reports negatively on the gun control issues. And maybe there=
s not enough positive influence -- or positive press of how it has helped=
 -- the Second Amendment right has helped in certain situations.



MR. EARNEST: Well, this question about public perception of gun safety po=
licy is an important one. Public polls indicate that a strong majority of=
 Americans across the country support common-sense gun safety legislation=
. And thats not just Democrats who strongly support it. We know that many=
 of those polls indicate that a strong majority of Republicans support co=
mmon-sense gun safety legislation. There are a number of other polls that=
 indicate a majority of gun owners support common-sense gun safety legisl=
ation.



So it does raise some questions about whats going on here. And the Presid=
ent has made the point that theres no shortage of attention thats devoted=
 to gun violence.



Now, there are frequently, tragically, high-profile shootings that happen=
 all too frequently. There are also shootings that happen particularly in=
 urban communities that happen every day that dont get any attention. And=
 I think it is hard to assess exactly what impact all of that has on publ=
ic opinion.=20



But what the President has observed is, in some ways this isnt a question=
 about public opinion, its a question about broken politics. Because all =
of the evidence indicates that a majority of the American public supports=
 common-sense gun safety legislation that would make it harder for people=
 who shouldnt have guns from getting them -- criminals, people with menta=
l problems.



And there are laws that we can pass that dont infringe on the constitutio=
nal rights of law-abiding Americans, but could take some steps that would=
 make it harder for people who shouldnt get a gun from getting one. And t=
hats not going to prevent every incident of gun violence; there are peopl=
e who are still going to be killed because of guns.=20



But if we can do something to make the country just a little bit safer, t=
o prevent even one incident of gun violence, then why wouldnt we take tha=
t action, particularly if we know it wouldnt undermine the constitutional=
 rights of law-abiding Americans?



And the way that the President has answered this question is, were only g=
oing to be able to pass those policies through Congress once enough peopl=
e come forward and say, you know what, Im going to be a single-issue vote=
r -- Democrat or Republican; Im only going to support somebody who suppor=
ts and vows to make a priority out of common-sense gun safety legislation=
.



And the President has taken that approach himself. And he has said that h=
e wont raise money or articulate his support for someone who doesnt suppo=
rt that kind of common-sense approach. And he hopes a lot of other Americ=
ans will take the same approach.



This gentleman right here.



Q I was just wondering where the Presidents daughter will be going to col=
lege. (Laughter.)=20



MR. EARNEST: That is a pertinent question these days. Obviously, the deci=
sion deadline is coming soon. We have worked to assiduously protect the p=
rivacy of the Presidents two daughters. And theyre private citizens who o=
bviously occupy a fairly prominent role in public life. And fortunately, =
much of the mainstream media has been very respectful of understanding th=
at these are two girls -- they didnt run for office, they didnt ask for a=
ll this attention. But the attention that is directed their way is unders=
tandable.



And I would anticipate that well have an announcement about her choice at=
 some point soon. Were going to do it in a way so that nobody gets scoope=
d. Were not going to leak it to somebody. So all of the reporters that ar=
e eager to get that scoop can just relax and know that well be making an =
announcement at an appropriate time.



Thanks for the good question. Yes, maam.



Q We talked a lot about student loan debt today, and one of the questions=
 that I didnt hear much talk about is admission cost for public college, =
and I think thats one of the main issues for me personally. I do have stu=
dent loans and things like that, but the initial cost is the problem that=
 I see. What is the federal government doing to lower public college cost=
s so that people can afford and not have to go into debt and take out stu=
dent loans in order to go to college and pursue a higher education?



MR. EARNEST: This is an excellent question. You have pressure on both sid=
es, right? We want to exert upward pressure on the ability of students to=
 afford to pay for college, but we also want to apply some downward press=
ure on the cost of college to make it a little easier for everybody to af=
ford. Thats going to save taxpayers money, but it also is going to save s=
tudents money as well.



And we spend a lot of time talking about what the President has done to m=
ake a college education more affordable and more available to middle-clas=
s families and middle-class students. So youve heard us talk about the Pe=
ll grant program and how weve significantly expanded the Pell grant progr=
am. The President fought hard for something called the American Opportuni=
ty tax credit that offers a tax credit to middle-class families who are p=
aying college tuition. The President recently succeeded in making that ta=
x credit permanent; we are obviously quite pleased about that.



But on the other side of the ledger, we have been looking for creative wa=
ys to try to apply some downward pressure to college costs. And there hav=
e been a range of policies that have been considered as it relates to tyi=
ng federal funding for colleges and universities to their ability to keep=
 college costs low.



 Now, this is a little bit of a controversial notion, and let me explain =
to you why. Too many state governments, in their zeal to cut government s=
pending, are reducing their support for public colleges and universities.=
 That's a bad thing. That is a really poor choice. It's a short-sighted d=
ecision to make -- to cut an investment in something that's going to be c=
ritical to the long-term success of your state.



 And what many college administrators legitimately say is, look, I'm gett=
ing less support from the state government, and if I want to continue to =
provide a high-quality education to the student body, I've got to get tha=
t money from somewhere.



 So part of the responsibility certainly does lie at the state level, and=
 making sure that states continue to understand that they have a responsi=
bility to invest in the quality of an education that's being offered at s=
tate-run institutions.=20



 This gentleman in the back. Yes, you. (Laughter.)



 Q At Truman State University, it takes approximately two to three weeks =
for a student to get their first meeting with a mental health counselor, =
and that's not even before the heavy, like, midterms and finals times. So=
 what is the administration doing to support mental health on American co=
llege campuses?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Dan, the President has actually done more than any ot=
her President to expand access to mental health care all across the count=
ry. This was, of course, included in Obamacare. The President made mental=
 health care a priority by ensuring parity between medical care that peop=
le had access to but also mental health care as well. There also was exte=
nsive funding that was included in the Affordable Care Act for community =
health centers that often are a facility that can provide mental health c=
are services.



 Of course, the Affordable Care Act also expanded Medicaid coverage, whic=
h meant more people had access to the kind of health care, including ment=
al health care, that they need. So this administration has certainly been=
 at the forefront of trying to expand access to quality mental health car=
e for people all across the country.



 I think the question that you're asking is also not totally unrelated to=
 the question that was just asked -- that as state-run institutions are f=
acing tighter budgets, and as they see state governments reduce the level=
 of support they're providing state institutions, it means that some stat=
e schools are having to make cutbacks. And unfortunately, that means maki=
ng cutbacks in areas that are critical to the health and wellbeing of the=
 student body. And I think you identified one area.



 So this administration is certainly going to continue to look for ways t=
o expand mental health care coverage. We're going to look for ways to pro=
vide additional support to colleges and universities that's using that mo=
ney in the right way, and we're going to continue to encourage states to =
do the right thing.



 Yes, this young lady in the front.



 Q Today we talked a lot about sexual assault on college campuses, which =
has become an epidemic in recent years. There's some controversy around t=
he fact that universities often regulate their own sexual assault cases. =
So with that in mind, do you think that the federal government should pro=
vide more oversight in the regulation of sexual assault cases on college =
campuses?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President certainly does believe that ending sexu=
al assault on college campuses should be a top priority -- not just of st=
ate and local governments but also of higher education officials. College=
s and universities, and the administrators who are responsible for runnin=
g them, have to take responsibility for addressing this problem. And this=
 is a problem that is pervasive on college campuses.



 And we have seen, particularly in recent years, students become more awa=
re of a need to make solving this problem a priority. And I think it is f=
air to say that on too many college campuses, administrators have been a =
little late to the game. And there is some more work that I think can be =
done, as a policy matter, to try to ensure that these situations are reso=
lved fairly and consistent with the law, to make sure that the rights of =
everybody involved are properly protected and accounted for.



 But I think this also is the kind of situation that shouldn't just rely =
on government to solve; that, ultimately, students need to take some resp=
onsibility for the kind of campus climate that exists in their community.=
 This is why the President has been a leading advocate of something calle=
d the It's On Us campaign. The It's On Us campaign essentially is where m=
en and women take responsibility for intervening in situations that could=
 potentially lead to sexual abuse or sexual assault. And it requires some=
 social courage to step up and intervene in a situation where you might b=
e concerned about the safety of somebody involved. And there's a natural =
human tendency to think to yourself, well, that looks like a messy situat=
ion, I don't want to get involved, particularly when it might be a situat=
ion where alcohol or drugs could be involved.



But the truth is we all need to hold ourselves accountable, not just for =
making sure that we are treating each other with respect, but also making=
 sure that were going to take responsibility for the climate and the cult=
ure on our campus, and that if we see something wrong were not going to h=
esitate to stand up and speak out and make sure that everybody thats in o=
ur community is safe.



So weve encouraged people to go to ItsOnUs.org and to take the pledge. Iv=
e done that, and the President and the Vice President have done that. And=
 we are hopeful that that kind of engagement, people taking that pledge, =
will lead to the kind of change on college campuses across the country th=
at wed like to see and that will ultimately make more college students sa=
fe.



This gentleman right here.



Q Could your administration discuss a bit on recent calls in the election=
 cycle, especially from the Democratic side, over making college more aff=
ordable, as in free, just like most Western European nations? We just wer=
e speaking with the Secretary of Education John King, and I kind of found=
 it ironic that the Secretary of Education for the richest country in the=
 history of the world is still paying his graduate student debt. So could=
 you comment on maybe making -- on the comments that, you know, the presi=
dential candidates are saying?



MR. EARNEST: Well, let me just talk to you about what the administration =
has done. So obviously, as I mentioned earlier, weve been very focused on=
 looking for ways that we can expand the assistance that we provide to mi=
ddle-class students and students that are trying to get into the middle c=
lass. Weve also been looking for ways that we can expand assistance to fa=
milies who are paying for their child to get a college education. And wev=
e been looking for creative policy ways that we can put downward pressure=
 on college costs, and making clear to college administrators that they h=
ave a responsibility to try to keep a limit on the growth in education co=
sts.



Weve also been encouraging of state governments, that they need to look f=
or ways to at least protect the amount of support that they provide to st=
ate-run colleges and universities, if not expand that support.



The other thing that the President called for in his State of the Union a=
ddress last year in early 2015 -- the President put forward a specific id=
ea that actually is already being implemented in a handful of states, inc=
luding the state of Tennessee, and that is to offer a free community coll=
ege education to every student thats willing to work for it.



And the idea here is that if you can offer up a free community college ed=
ucation to hardworking students that are getting good grades and doing th=
eir homework and continuing to maintain a workload, that you can essentia=
lly cut the cost of a four-year education in half. The first two years at=
 a community college they could get for free. And that would make a tangi=
ble impact on the ability of students who are trying to prepare themselve=
s for a 21st century global economy.



It also would have an impact on I think what are often called nontraditio=
nal college students -- that you have people who have started out their c=
areer in one field and either they lose their job or they recognize they =
want to change to a different field, but they cant move to that new job u=
ntil they get some additional training.



So giving more workers the opportunity to go to community college for a c=
ouple of years, have that paid for by the federal government, and then co=
me out with enhanced skills that would allow them to make an even better =
contribution to the local economy -- thats a win-win. And this is what th=
eyve done in the state of Tennessee, and its been very beneficial to the =
state. Theyve seen an economic benefit associated with a better-educated =
workforce.



So the President has proposed, look, if theres a Republican governor in t=
he state of Tennessee who can make this program work in his state, why sh=
ouldnt Democrats and Republicans work together in Washington to give that=
 opportunity to every American? And unfortunately, Republicans have been =
resistant to this idea, even -- these are Republicans in Congress that ha=
ve been resistant to this idea even though Republicans in Tennessee have =
seen firsthand that it works great.



So the President is going to continue to advocate for this kind of reform=
, and is hopeful that we can build some momentum, such that maybe the nex=
t Congress will be more willing to take it up than this one has been.



Yes, this young lady right there.



Q The role of the press secretary is to be an honest broker between the a=
dministration and the press. How do you balance making the President look=
 good with honestly communicating all sides of the policies that the admi=
nistration is doing? And also, how do you think journalists can improve t=
heir coverage of government affairs?



MR. EARNEST: That is a good question. (Laughter.) How long do you have? (=
Laughter.) I have worked to conspicuously avoid playing media critic in t=
his role. It might affect my ability to be an honest broker if I spent a =
lot of time critiquing the performance of the independent press corps. So=
 I think Im going to dodge your second question, but let me see if I can =
give you a thoughtful answer to your first one.



The basic function of the press secretary is to help the American people =
understand what the President is doing and why hes doing it. In some ways=
, that is the basic function of the job. Reporters have a similar mandate=
 -- that they want to give their readers or their viewers or their listen=
ers greater insight into what it is the President is doing, and try to he=
lp their readers or listeners understand why hes doing it.



So the approach that I have taken is to try to learn those facts for myse=
lf -- to not just understand sort of the basic talking points, but to act=
ually try to delve into the policy and understand why particular decision=
s have been made, either by the President or by other senior decision-mak=
ers in his administration -- and then to also try to put those decisions =
into context, to help people understand the Presidents approach to proble=
m-solving or the Presidents approach to a whole set of issues so that the=
y can understand why a particular decision was made.



As people sort of assess the relationship between the White House Press C=
orps and the White House Press Office, the thing that I often remind jour=
nalists who occasionally will decide to write about this issue is that th=
eres supposed to be some tension between the White House Press Office and=
 the White House Press Corps. If there wasnt, it would be a pretty good i=
ndication that somebody wasnt doing their job. If theres ever a day that =
one of the professionals in the White House Press Corps walks into my off=
ice and says, you know, you guys have been totally transparent today, you=
ve answered all of my questions, youve given me access to all the informa=
tion that I need, thanks a lot, I have no complaints -- theyre not doing =
their job.



Even if we have been extraordinarily transparent -- which we have been --=
 (laughter) -- its incumbent upon those journalists to say, you should gi=
ve us more. Thats their job. And its my job to try to be as accommodating=
 as I can, while at the same time protecting the Presidents ability to ma=
ke a decision, but also making sure that the context of that decision is =
not lost.



So thats why reporters who are interested in having a positive working re=
lationship with the White House -- my expectation for them is not that th=
eyre going to write stories that are good for the White House every day, =
that make the President look good or make the White House look good or ma=
ke the administration look good. Sometimes there are tough stories. And w=
hen you consider some of the more complicated questions that this adminis=
tration has had to deal with, its plausible that people are going to read=
 stories that dont make the President or the administration or the White =
House look good.



The situation in Syria right now is tragic. There are millions of innocen=
t people who have been displaced from their homes. And the administration=
 and the President has put forward a bold strategy that exceeded the orig=
inal expectations that people had for what wed be able to do to influence=
 this situation, but so far, it continues to be the case that there are i=
nnocent people dying in Syria.



And so many stories that are written about Syria dont make the President =
look good. But what I challenge reporters to do is, even if we accept the=
 situation in Syria is bad, and its a situation that the White House and =
the President has not solved, despite how hard hes worked to try, what I =
do want people to understand is why is this situation so complicated, wha=
t is it that the President has tried to do, and why is it that hes tried =
that approach and not something else.



And if reporters succeed in using their skills as a journalist and as a w=
riter and a storyteller and a broadcaster to explain our approach, then I=
 cant really complain. Theyve done their job. And if I have confidence in=
 our approach, then Im going to have confidence in the idea that if someb=
ody makes an honest effort to explain that approach to the American peopl=
e, well, then were going to persuade some people that what were doing is =
the right thing to do, even if its not showing the immediate results that=
 we would like.



This gentleman right here.



Q Bouncing off the previous couple questions about access, I was wonderin=
g if you could comment on the access or, in some cases, reduced or lack o=
f access of young people and college students across the country to fully=
 participate in public service and the life of our country. There's been =
reports in the past couple years about certain sorts of hostile echo cham=
bers that pop up in D.C. because of the lack of ability for funding for i=
nternships for places like the White House, where we sit today, Congress,=
 other federal agencies, et cetera.=20



There's a tension there, obviously, because the idea of public service to=
 necessitate something. But on the other hand, if some people are boxed o=
ut of being able to participate while they're in college, something that =
we're very lucky to do today, there's tens of thousands more of us who wo=
uld love to be able to be sitting in this seat right now. So I was wonder=
ing if you could comment on any possible changes in the ways the White Ho=
use or across the federal government -- access for college students going=
 forward to more fully participate and represent the mosaic of America in=
 D.C.



 MR. EARNEST: Look, the President often says that the most important role=
 in our democracy is not the role of President, but actually the role of =
citizen. And looking for ways to engage people in the process of governin=
g this country is something that the President has made a priority. And t=
his is one of the reasons that we're hosting this event here today, is th=
e President is interested in cultivating your interest in government and =
certainly your interest in playing an important role in our democracy by =
considering a career as a professional journalist.



 So I think that's the first way that I would answer your question. The s=
econd way is that people don't have to work in politics or even cover pol=
itics full time in order to be engaged in our democracy. What people do h=
ave to do is they have to make an effort to go and inform themselves and =
educate themselves about what's happening in your community or in our cou=
ntry. And that is a big challenge. And that's not something that the gove=
rnment can do for you, and that's not something that necessarily includes=
 a paycheck. But that is a responsibility that we all have as citizens of=
 this country -- to educate ourselves about the questions that are being =
raised about our government, to establish some priorities in our own righ=
t for the direction of the country.=20



 And one of the observations that the President often makes about the med=
ia is that there are places you can go on the Internet to just go and rea=
d articles or opinions written by a whole bunch of people just like you w=
ho have the same views. And it requires a certain amount of self-discipli=
ne to actually seek out different points of view. So listening or invitin=
g input from people who may not share your worldview is a valuable thing.=
 And it's something that is critical if we're going to be good citizens o=
f our country and active participants in our democracy. And the President=
 gave -- as you think about this, the President gave a commencement addre=
ss at the University of Michigan where he talked a lot about sort of the =
role of citizenship in a modern democracy like ours. So you can hear more=
 directly from the President on that.



 This young lady right there.



 Q Earlier today we talked with Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on restora=
tive justice work, like within school districts, for students who are get=
ting suspended or expelled. And my question is, what is the administratio=
n doing to work with school districts who want to go after those initial =
acts?



 MR. EARNEST: It's nice to meet you. You may have heard a little bit abou=
t this from Secretary John King. The Department of Education has worked c=
losely with states and school districts across the country, and I know th=
at Secretary King's predecessor, Arne Duncan, was very interested in this=
 issue as well. What you often find in the federal government, particular=
ly when it comes to education, is that we have a tradition in this countr=
y of local control of schools. Now, that's a good thing. We want communit=
ies to be engaged and to play the predominant role in setting policies an=
d guidelines for how the schools in those communities are going to operat=
e.



 But what the federal government can do is to offer some expertise and to=
 share best practices, and bring schools and administrators together to h=
elp them understand how these problems are being handled in other communi=
ties. And so what this administration has done is made an effort to try t=
o lift up best practices, to seek out the most effective educators, parti=
cularly when it comes to disciplinary policies, and make sure that we're =
sharing those ideas with other schools.



 And there's plenty of academic data and research to indicate that there =
is some bias inherent in the way that some schools administer discipline,=
 and that does put some students -- particularly minority students -- at =
a disadvantage. And helping well-intentioned administrators recognize the=
 potential for bias and give them some tips for how to work around and ov=
ercome it is a really valuable thing. And I know that this is something t=
hat the Department of Education has made a real priority.



 Yes, that gentleman right there.



 Q What is the future of historically black colleges and universities aft=
er the Obama administration?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, under President Obama's leadership, funding for histo=
rically black colleges and universities has increased. President Obama ha=
s had an opportunity to deliver a couple of commencement addresses at HBC=
Us. In both of those speeches, the President has talked about how importa=
nt a role those institutions play not just in a modern African American c=
ommunity in the United States, but actually a role they have to play in o=
ur country.=20



 The President is actually going to speak at Howard University later this=
 summer at their commencement. The President is looking forward to that o=
pportunity and it will be an opportunity for him to both reflect on the t=
radition that's built into HBCUs of providing a good, high-quality educat=
ion to African Americans, but he'll also talk about the responsibility th=
at those who graduate from those kinds of institutions have to contribute=
 not just to the African American community but to our country as a whole=
. And this is something the President feels strongly about, and something=
 he'll talk about again later this summer when he speaks at Howard.



 Yes, ma'am.



 Q We just released our sexual assault climate survey, or the results of =
the survey, rather. And it turned out Fordham is reporting sexual assault=
 just a little bit above the national average, which is around 5 percent =
right now -- we're reporting at 8 percent. So I was wondering if the admi=
nistration is doing anything to incentivize colleges to increase that per=
centage to make it easier and more accessible for victims to report their=
 sexual assault so we can get more accurate numbers on how sexual assault=
 exists on college campuses.=20

 MR. EARNEST: Well -- that seems like a bad thing. (Loud noise.) It's tha=
t remote there, guys. There we go. That's never happened before. (Laughte=
r.) So, I'm sorry that had to happen to you.



 You've asked a very serious question. What the administration has done i=
s tried to work with colleges and universities to help them establish a c=
lear process for reporting these kinds of crimes when they occur, and mak=
ing sure that there's a process internally for handling them appropriatel=
y, consistent with fairness but also consistent with the law. So that is =
certainly an important step.

=20

 The other thing that we believe is important is transparency. As student=
s are considering which college or institution to attend, they should und=
erstand exactly what the climate is like on that campus -- how safe are t=
hey going to be if they go to school there; how much of a priority have s=
chool administrators made the safety of their students. So that kind of t=
ransparency is important as well.

=20

 But look, as I was saying earlier, this can't just be about government. =
This also has to be about students taking responsibility for what happens=
 on their campus and what kind of community they want to be a part of, an=
d how willing are they to engage in that community to assert the kinds or=
 norms and mutual respect that we'd all like to have, particularly when w=
e're living in a community like a college campus where we're sort of enco=
uraged to try new things and to explore new experiences; that having a sa=
fe environment in which to do that is particularly important.

=20

 Yes, that gentleman right there.

=20

 Q We've heard a lot today, especially from the Education Secretary, of P=
ay As You Earn loan repayment plans for student loans. However, the reaso=
n we're talking about it is because 70 percent, according to the GAO -- 7=
0 percent of delinquent borrowers are eligible for Pay As You Earn, but a=
rent on the plan. How did the number get so high?

=20

 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a couple of reasons. One is that th=
e Pay As You Earn program is something that's relatively new, and we are =
setting a goal today to try to expand the number of people who take advan=
tage of this program. The Pay As You Earn program essentially caps your s=
tudent loan repayment rates at 10 percent of your income.=20

=20

 The President has also fought hard to establish the CFPB.



 (The President enters the room.)

fternoon, everybody.&nbsp; It&#8217;s nice to see you all.&nbsp; Welcome to=
 the White House.&nbsp; And welcome to the White House Briefing Room.&nbsp;=
 This is obviously the room where, every day, or almost every day,
 I come and do a briefing with the White House Press Corps.&nbsp; So these =
are journalists who have devoted a significant portion of their lives to co=
vering the White House very closely.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we often talk about h=
ow this is the venue where independent, professional journalists ask tough =
questions.&nbsp; And this is where the President of the United States sends=
 a senior member of his staff to come out
 and answer those questions.&nbsp; People can ask whatever they want, and t=
he whole thing takes place on the record, for everybody to see, on camera.&=
nbsp; And it is an important part of our democracy, and I&#8217;m glad that=
 we&#8217;ll be able to do it in a way that all of you
 can participate in at least this unique way.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So with that, I&#8217;m m=
ostly interested in answering the questions that you&#8217;re interested in=
 talking about.&nbsp; So let&#8217;s move around.&nbsp; So yes, this young =
lady in the back, I&#8217;ll let you go first.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was=
 wondering if you think there&#8217;s a problem with the way that the media=
 actually reports negatively on the gun control issues.&nbsp; And maybe the=
re&#8217;s not enough positive influence -- or positive press of how
 it has helped -- the Second Amendment right has helped in certain situatio=
ns.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
this question about public perception of gun safety policy is an important =
one.&nbsp; Public polls indicate that a strong majority of Americans across=
 the country support common-sense gun safety legislation.&nbsp;
 And that&#8217;s not just Democrats who strongly support it.&nbsp; We know=
 that many of those polls indicate that a strong majority of Republicans su=
pport common-sense gun safety legislation.&nbsp; There are a number of othe=
r polls that indicate a majority of gun owners support
 common-sense gun safety legislation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So it does raise some que=
stions about what&#8217;s going on here.&nbsp; And the President has made t=
he point that there&#8217;s no shortage of attention that&#8217;s devoted t=
o gun violence.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, there are frequently=
, tragically, high-profile shootings that happen all too frequently.&nbsp; =
There are also shootings that happen particularly in urban communities that=
 happen every day that don&#8217;t get any attention.&nbsp;
 And I think it is hard to assess exactly what impact all of that has on pu=
blic opinion.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But what the President ha=
s observed is, in some ways this isn&#8217;t a question about public opinio=
n, it&#8217;s a question about broken politics.&nbsp; Because all of the ev=
idence indicates that a majority of the American public
 supports common-sense gun safety legislation that would make it harder for=
 people who shouldn&#8217;t have guns from getting them -- criminals, peopl=
e with mental problems.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And there are laws that w=
e can pass that don&#8217;t infringe on the constitutional rights of law-ab=
iding Americans, but could take some steps that would make it harder for pe=
ople who shouldn&#8217;t get a gun from getting
 one.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s not going to prevent every incident of gun vio=
lence; there are people who are still going to be killed because of guns.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But if we can do somethin=
g to make the country just a little bit safer, to prevent even one incident=
 of gun violence, then why wouldn&#8217;t we take that action, particularly=
 if we know it wouldn&#8217;t undermine the constitutional
 rights of law-abiding Americans?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the way that the Pres=
ident has answered this question is, we&#8217;re only going to be able to p=
ass those policies through Congress once enough people come forward and say=
, you know what, I&#8217;m going to be a single-issue
 voter -- Democrat or Republican; I&#8217;m only going to support somebody =
who supports and vows to make a priority out of common-sense gun safety leg=
islation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the President has tak=
en that approach himself.&nbsp; And he has said that he won&#8217;t raise m=
oney or articulate his support for someone who doesn&#8217;t support that k=
ind of common-sense approach.&nbsp; And he hopes a lot of
 other Americans will take the same approach.<o:p></o:p></p>

 citizens who obviously occupy a fairly prominent role in public life.&nbsp=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ta=
lked a lot about student loan debt today, and one of the questions that I d=
idn&#8217;t hear much talk about is admission cost for public college, and =
I think that&#8217;s one of the main issues for me personally.&nbsp;
 I do have student loans and things like that, but the initial cost is the =
problem that I see.&nbsp; What is the federal government doing to lower pub=
lic college costs so that people can afford and not have to go into debt an=
d take out student loans in order to
 go to college and pursue a higher education?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; This i=
s an excellent question.&nbsp; You have pressure on both sides, right?&nbsp=
; We want to exert upward pressure on the ability of students to afford to =
pay for college, but we also want to apply some downward
 pressure on the cost of college to make it a little easier for everybody t=
o afford.&nbsp; That&#8217;s going to save taxpayers money, but it also is =
going to save students money as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we spend a lot of tim=
e talking about what the President has done to make a college education mor=
e affordable and more available to middle-class families and middle-class s=
tudents.&nbsp; So you&#8217;ve heard us talk about
 the Pell grant program and how we&#8217;ve significantly expanded the Pell=
 grant program.&nbsp; The President fought hard for something called the Am=
erican Opportunity tax credit that offers a tax credit to middle-class fami=
lies who are paying college tuition.&nbsp; The President
 recently succeeded in making that tax credit permanent; we are obviously q=
uite pleased about that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But on the other side of =
the ledger, we have been looking for creative ways to try to apply some dow=
nward pressure to college costs.&nbsp; And there have been a range of polic=
ies that have been considered as it relates
 to tying federal funding for colleges and universities to their ability to=
 keep college costs low.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, this is a little bit o=
f a controversial notion, and let me explain to you why.&nbsp; Too many sta=
te governments, in their zeal to cut government spending, are reducing thei=
r support for public colleges and universities.&nbsp; That's a bad
 thing.&nbsp; That is a really poor choice.&nbsp; It's a short-sighted deci=
sion to make -- to cut an investment in something that's going to be critic=
al to the long-term success of your state.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what many college admin=
istrators legitimately say is, look, I'm getting less support from the stat=
e government, and if I want to continue to provide a high-quality education=
 to the student body, I've got to get that money from
 somewhere.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So part of the responsibili=
ty certainly does lie at the state level, and making sure that states conti=
nue to understand that they have a responsibility to invest in the quality =
of an education that's being offered at state-run institutions.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This gentleman in the back.=
&nbsp; Yes, you.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Trum=
an State University, it takes approximately two to three weeks for a studen=
t to get their first meeting with a mental health counselor, and that's not=
 even before the heavy, like, midterms and finals times.&nbsp; So what is
 the administration doing to support mental health on American college camp=
uses?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Da=
n, the President has actually done more than any other President to expand =
access to mental health care all across the country.&nbsp; This was, of cou=
rse, included in Obamacare.&nbsp; The President made mental health care
 a priority by ensuring parity between medical care that people had access =
to but also mental health care as well.&nbsp; There also was extensive fund=
ing that was included in the Affordable Care Act for community health cente=
rs that often are a facility that can
 provide mental health care services.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the Affordable C=
are Act also expanded Medicaid coverage, which meant more people had access=
 to the kind of health care, including mental health care, that they need.&=
nbsp; So this administration has certainly been at the forefront
 of trying to expand access to quality mental health care for people all ac=
ross the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the question that y=
ou're asking is also not totally unrelated to the question that was just as=
ked -- that as state-run institutions are facing tighter budgets, and as th=
ey see state governments reduce the level of support they're
 providing state institutions, it means that some state schools are having =
to make cutbacks.&nbsp; And unfortunately, that means making cutbacks in ar=
eas that are critical to the health and wellbeing of the student body.&nbsp=
; And I think you identified one area.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this administration is c=
ertainly going to continue to look for ways to expand mental health care co=
verage.&nbsp; We're going to look for ways to provide additional support to=
 colleges and universities that's using that money in the right
 way, and we're going to continue to encourage states to do the right thing=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, this young lady in the=
 front.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today w=
e talked a lot about sexual assault on college campuses, which has become a=
n epidemic in recent years.&nbsp; There's some controversy around the fact =
that universities often regulate their own sexual assault cases.&nbsp; So w=
ith
 that in mind, do you think that the federal government should provide more=
 oversight in the regulation of sexual assault cases on college campuses?<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e President certainly does believe that ending sexual assault on college ca=
mpuses should be a top priority -- not just of state and local governments =
but also of higher education officials.&nbsp; Colleges and universities,
 and the administrators who are responsible for running them, have to take =
responsibility for addressing this problem.&nbsp; And this is a problem tha=
t is pervasive on college campuses.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we have seen, particula=
rly in recent years, students become more aware of a need to make solving t=
his problem a priority.&nbsp; And I think it is fair to say that on too man=
y college campuses, administrators have been a little late
 to the game.&nbsp; And there is some more work that I think can be done, a=
s a policy matter, to try to ensure that these situations are resolved fair=
ly and consistent with the law, to make sure that the rights of everybody i=
nvolved are properly protected and accounted
 for.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think this also is th=
e kind of situation that shouldn't just rely on government to solve; that, =
ultimately, students need to take some responsibility for the kind of campu=
s climate that exists in their community.&nbsp; This is why
 the President has been a leading advocate of something called the It's On =
Us campaign.&nbsp; The It's On Us campaign essentially is where men and wom=
en take responsibility for intervening in situations that could potentially=
 lead to sexual abuse or sexual assault.&nbsp;
 And it requires some social courage to step up and intervene in a situatio=
n where you might be concerned about the safety of somebody involved.&nbsp;=
 And there's a natural human tendency to think to yourself, well, that look=
s like a messy situation, I don't want
 to get involved, particularly when it might be a situation where alcohol o=
r drugs could be involved.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But the truth is we all n=
eed to hold ourselves accountable, not just for making sure that we are tre=
ating each other with respect, but also making sure that we&#8217;re going =
to take responsibility for the climate and
 the culture on our campus, and that if we see something wrong we&#8217;re =
not going to hesitate to stand up and speak out and make sure that everybod=
y that&#8217;s in our community is safe.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we&#8217;ve encouraged=
 people to go to ItsOnUs.org and to take the pledge.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve done =
that, and the President and the Vice President have done that.&nbsp; And we=
 are hopeful that that kind of engagement, people taking that
 pledge, will lead to the kind of change on college campuses across the cou=
ntry that we&#8217;d like to see and that will ultimately make more college=
 students safe.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This gentleman right here=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could=
 your administration discuss a bit on recent calls in the election cycle, e=
specially from the Democratic side, over making college more affordable, as=
 in free, just like most Western European nations?&nbsp;
 We just were speaking with the Secretary of Education John King, and I kin=
d of found it ironic that the Secretary of Education for the richest countr=
y in the history of the world is still paying his graduate student debt.&nb=
sp; So could you comment on maybe making
 -- on the comments that, you know, the presidential candidates are saying?=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
let me just talk to you about what the administration has done.&nbsp; So ob=
viously, as I mentioned earlier, we&#8217;ve been very focused on looking f=
or ways that we can expand the assistance that we provide
 to middle-class students and students that are trying to get into the midd=
le class.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve also been looking for ways that we can expand a=
ssistance to families who are paying for their child to get a college educa=
tion.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve been looking for creative
 policy ways that we can put downward pressure on college costs, and making=
 clear to college administrators that they have a responsibility to try to =
keep a limit on the growth in education costs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We&#8217;ve also been enc=
ouraging of state governments, that they need to look for ways to at least =
protect the amount of support that they provide to state-run colleges and u=
niversities, if not expand that support.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The other thing that the =
President called for in his State of the Union address last year in early 2=
015 -- the President put forward a specific idea that actually is already b=
eing implemented in a handful of states,
 including the state of Tennessee, and that is to offer a free community co=
llege education to every student that&#8217;s willing to work for it.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the idea here is that=
 if you can offer up a free community college education to hardworking stud=
ents that are getting good grades and doing their homework and continuing t=
o maintain a workload, that you can
 essentially cut the cost of a four-year education in half.&nbsp; The first=
 two years at a community college they could get for free.&nbsp; And that w=
ould make a tangible impact on the ability of students who are trying to pr=
epare themselves for a 21st century global
 economy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">It also would have an imp=
act on I think what are often called nontraditional college students -- tha=
t you have people who have started out their career in one field and either=
 they lose their job or they recognize
 they want to change to a different field, but they can&#8217;t move to tha=
t new job until they get some additional training.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So giving more workers th=
e opportunity to go to community college for a couple of years, have that p=
aid for by the federal government, and then come out with enhanced skills t=
hat would allow them to make an even
 better contribution to the local economy -- that&#8217;s a win-win.&nbsp; =
And this is what they&#8217;ve done in the state of Tennessee, and it&#8217=
;s been very beneficial to the state.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve seen an economic =
benefit associated with a better-educated workforce.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the President has prop=
osed, look, if there&#8217;s a Republican governor in the state of Tennesse=
e who can make this program work in his state, why shouldn&#8217;t Democrat=
s and Republicans work together in Washington to
 give that opportunity to every American?&nbsp; And unfortunately, Republic=
ans have been resistant to this idea, even -- these are Republicans in Cong=
ress that have been resistant to this idea even though Republicans in Tenne=
ssee have seen firsthand that it works
 great.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the President is going=
 to continue to advocate for this kind of reform, and is hopeful that we ca=
n build some momentum, such that maybe the next Congress will be more willi=
ng to take it up than this one has been.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Yes, this young lady righ=
t there.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The r=
ole of the press secretary is to be an honest broker between the administra=
tion and the press.&nbsp; How do you balance making the President look good=
 with honestly communicating all sides of the policies that
 the administration is doing?&nbsp; And also, how do you think journalists =
can improve their coverage of government affairs?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That i=
s a good question.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; How long do you have?&nbsp; (Lau=
ghter.)&nbsp; I have worked to conspicuously avoid playing media critic in =
this role.&nbsp; It might affect my ability to be an honest broker
 if I spent a lot of time critiquing the performance of the independent pre=
ss corps.&nbsp; So I think I&#8217;m going to dodge your second question, b=
ut let me see if I can give you a thoughtful answer to your first one.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The basic function of the=
 press secretary is to help the American people understand what the Preside=
nt is doing and why he&#8217;s doing it.&nbsp; In some ways, that is the ba=
sic function of the job.&nbsp; Reporters have a similar
 mandate -- that they want to give their readers or their viewers or their =
listeners greater insight into what it is the President is doing, and try t=
o help their readers or listeners understand why he&#8217;s doing it.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the approach that I ha=
ve taken is to try to learn those facts for myself -- to not just understan=
d sort of the basic talking points, but to actually try to delve into the p=
olicy and understand why particular
 decisions have been made, either by the President or by other senior decis=
ion-makers in his administration -- and then to also try to put those decis=
ions into context, to help people understand the President&#8217;s approach=
 to problem-solving or the President&#8217;s
 approach to a whole set of issues so that they can understand why a partic=
ular decision was made.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As people sort of assess =
the relationship between the White House Press Corps and the White House Pr=
ess Office, the thing that I often remind journalists who occasionally will=
 decide to write about this issue is
 that there&#8217;s supposed to be some tension between the White House Pre=
ss Office and the White House Press Corps.&nbsp; If there wasn&#8217;t, it =
would be a pretty good indication that somebody wasn&#8217;t doing their jo=
b.&nbsp; If there&#8217;s ever a day that one of the professionals
 in the White House Press Corps walks into my office and says, you know, yo=
u guys have been totally transparent today, you&#8217;ve answered all of my=
 questions, you&#8217;ve given me access to all the information that I need=
, thanks a lot, I have no complaints -- they&#8217;re
 not doing their job.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Even if we have been extr=
aordinarily transparent -- which we have been -- (laughter) -- it&#8217;s i=
ncumbent upon those journalists to say, you should give us more.&nbsp; That=
&#8217;s their job.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s my job to try to be as
 accommodating as I can, while at the same time protecting the President&#8=
217;s ability to make a decision, but also making sure that the context of =
that decision is not lost.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that&#8217;s why repor=
ters who are interested in having a positive working relationship with the =
White House -- my expectation for them is not that they&#8217;re going to w=
rite stories that are good for the White House every
 day, that make the President look good or make the White House look good o=
r make the administration look good.&nbsp; Sometimes there are tough storie=
s.&nbsp; And when you consider some of the more complicated questions that =
this administration has had to deal with,
 it&#8217;s plausible that people are going to read stories that don&#8217;=
t make the President or the administration or the White House look good.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The situation in Syria ri=
ght now is tragic.&nbsp; There are millions of innocent people who have bee=
n displaced from their homes.&nbsp; And the administration and the Presiden=
t has put forward a bold strategy that exceeded
 the original expectations that people had for what we&#8217;d be able to d=
o to influence this situation, but so far, it continues to be the case that=
 there are innocent people dying in Syria.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so many stories that =
are written about Syria don&#8217;t make the President look good.&nbsp; But=
 what I challenge reporters to do is, even if we accept the situation in Sy=
ria is bad, and it&#8217;s a situation that the White
 House and the President has not solved, despite how hard he&#8217;s worked=
 to try, what I do want people to understand is why is this situation so co=
mplicated, what is it that the President has tried to do, and why is it tha=
t he&#8217;s tried that approach and not something
 else.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And if reporters succeed =
in using their skills as a journalist and as a writer and a storyteller and=
 a broadcaster to explain our approach, then I can&#8217;t really complain.=
&nbsp; They&#8217;ve done their job.&nbsp; And if I have confidence
 in our approach, then I&#8217;m going to have confidence in the idea that =
if somebody makes an honest effort to explain that approach to the American=
 people, well, then we&#8217;re going to persuade some people that what we&=
#8217;re doing is the right thing to do, even if it&#8217;s
 not showing the immediate results that we would like.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bounc=
ing off the previous couple questions about access, I was wondering if you =
could comment on the access or, in some cases, reduced or lack of access of=
 young people and college students across the country
 to fully participate in public service and the life of our country.&nbsp; =
There's been reports in the past couple years about certain sorts of hostil=
e echo chambers that pop up in D.C. because of the lack of ability for fund=
ing for internships for places like the
 White House, where we sit today, Congress, other federal agencies, et cete=
ra.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">There's a tension there, =
obviously, because the idea of public service to necessitate something.&nbs=
p; But on the other hand, if some people are boxed out of being able to par=
ticipate while they're in college, something
 that we're very lucky to do today, there's tens of thousands more of us wh=
o would love to be able to be sitting in this seat right now.&nbsp; So I wa=
s wondering if you could comment on any possible changes in the ways the Wh=
ite House or across the federal government
 -- access for college students going forward to more fully participate and=
 represent the mosaic of America in D.C.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Look, th=
e President often says that the most important role in our democracy is not=
 the role of President, but actually the role of citizen.&nbsp; And looking=
 for ways to engage people in the process of governing this country
 is something that the President has made a priority.&nbsp; And this is one=
 of the reasons that we're hosting this event here today, is the President =
is interested in cultivating your interest in government and certainly your=
 interest in playing an important role
 in our democracy by considering a career as a professional journalist.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think that's the first=
 way that I would answer your question.&nbsp; The second way is that people=
 don't have to work in politics or even cover politics full time in order t=
o be engaged in our democracy.&nbsp; What people do have to do is
 they have to make an effort to go and inform themselves and educate themse=
lves about what's happening in your community or in our country.&nbsp; And =
that is a big challenge.&nbsp; And that's not something that the government=
 can do for you, and that's not something
 that necessarily includes a paycheck.&nbsp; But that is a responsibility t=
hat we all have as citizens of this country -- to educate ourselves about t=
he questions that are being raised about our government, to establish some =
priorities in our own right for the direction
 of the country. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one of the observations=
 that the President often makes about the media is that there are places yo=
u can go on the Internet to just go and read articles or opinions written b=
y a whole bunch of people just like you who have the same
 views.&nbsp; And it requires a certain amount of self-discipline to actual=
ly seek out different points of view.&nbsp; So listening or inviting input =
from people who may not share your worldview is a valuable thing.&nbsp; And=
 it's something that is critical if we're going
 to be good citizens of our country and active participants in our democrac=
y.&nbsp; And the President gave -- as you think about this, the President g=
ave a commencement address at the University of Michigan where he talked a =
lot about sort of the role of citizenship
 in a modern democracy like ours.&nbsp; So you can hear more directly from =
the President on that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This young lady right there=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier=
 today we talked with Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on restorative justice=
 work, like within school districts, for students who are getting suspended=
 or expelled.&nbsp; And my question is, what is the administration doing to
 work with school districts who want to go after those initial acts?<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; It's nic=
e to meet you.&nbsp; You may have heard a little bit about this from Secret=
ary John King.&nbsp; The Department of Education has worked closely with st=
ates and school districts across the country, and I know that Secretary
 King's predecessor, Arne Duncan, was very interested in this issue as well=
.&nbsp; What you often find in the federal government, particularly when it=
 comes to education, is that we have a tradition in this country of local c=
ontrol of schools.&nbsp; Now, that's a good
 thing.&nbsp; We want communities to be engaged and to play the predominant=
 role in setting policies and guidelines for how the schools in those commu=
nities are going to operate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what the federal govern=
ment can do is to offer some expertise and to share best practices, and bri=
ng schools and administrators together to help them understand how these pr=
oblems are being handled in other communities.&nbsp; And so
 what this administration has done is made an effort to try to lift up best=
 practices, to seek out the most effective educators, particularly when it =
comes to disciplinary policies, and make sure that we're sharing those idea=
s with other schools.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there's plenty of acade=
mic data and research to indicate that there is some bias inherent in the w=
ay that some schools administer discipline, and that does put some students=
 -- particularly minority students -- at a disadvantage.&nbsp;
 And helping well-intentioned administrators recognize the potential for bi=
as and give them some tips for how to work around and overcome it is a real=
ly valuable thing.&nbsp; And I know that this is something that the Departm=
ent of Education has made a real priority.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that gentleman right t=
here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is=
 the future of historically black colleges and universities after the Obama=
 administration?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, un=
der President Obama's leadership, funding for historically black colleges a=
nd universities has increased.&nbsp; President Obama has had an opportunity=
 to deliver a couple of commencement addresses at HBCUs.&nbsp; In both
 of those speeches, the President has talked about how important a role tho=
se institutions play not just in a modern African American community in the=
 United States, but actually a role they have to play in our country.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President is actually g=
oing to speak at Howard University later this summer at their commencement.=
&nbsp; The President is looking forward to that opportunity and it will be =
an opportunity for him to both reflect on the tradition that's
 built into HBCUs of providing a good, high-quality education to African Am=
ericans, but he'll also talk about the responsibility that those who gradua=
te from those kinds of institutions have to contribute not just to the Afri=
can American community but to our
 country as a whole.&nbsp; And this is something the President feels strong=
ly about, and something he'll talk about again later this summer when he sp=
eaks at Howard.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, ma'am.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=
sp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We just released our sexual assault climate survey,=
 or the results of the survey, rather.&nbsp; And it turned out Fordham is r=
eporting sexual assault just a little bit above the national average, which
 is around 5 percent right now -- we're reporting at 8 percent.&nbsp; So I =
was wondering if the administration is doing anything to incentivize colleg=
es to increase that percentage to make it easier and more accessible for vi=
ctims to report their sexual assault
 so we can get more accurate numbers on how sexual assault exists on colleg=
e campuses.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well -- =
that seems like a bad thing.&nbsp; (Loud noise.)&nbsp; It's that remote the=
re, guys.&nbsp; There we go.&nbsp; That's never happened before.&nbsp; (Lau=
ghter.)&nbsp; So, I'm sorry that had to happen to you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've asked a very serious=
 question.&nbsp; What the administration has done is tried to work with col=
leges and universities to help them establish a clear process for reporting=
 these kinds of crimes when they occur, and making sure that
 there's a process internally for handling them appropriately, consistent w=
ith fairness but also consistent with the law.&nbsp; So that is certainly a=
n important step.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing that we bel=
ieve is important is transparency.&nbsp; As students are considering which =
college or institution to attend, they should understand exactly what the c=
limate is like on that campus -- how safe are they going to
 be if they go to school there; how much of a priority have school administ=
rators made the safety of their students.&nbsp; So that kind of transparenc=
y is important as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But look, as I was saying e=
arlier, this can't just be about government.&nbsp; This also has to be abou=
t students taking responsibility for what happens on their campus and what =
kind of community they want to be a part of, and how willing
 are they to engage in that community to assert the kinds or norms and mutu=
al respect that we'd all like to have, particularly when we're living in a =
community like a college campus where we're sort of encouraged to try new t=
hings and to explore new experiences;
 that having a safe environment in which to do that is particularly importa=
nt.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that gentleman right t=
here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've h=
eard a lot today, especially from the Education Secretary, of Pay As You Ea=
rn loan repayment plans for student loans.&nbsp; However, the reason we're =
talking about it is because 70 percent, according to the GAO -- 70 percent
 of delinquent borrowers are eligible for Pay As You Earn, but aren&#8217;t=
 on the plan.&nbsp; How did the number get so high?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think there are a couple of reasons.&nbsp; One is that the Pay As You Earn =
program is something that's relatively new, and we are setting a goal today=
 to try to expand the number of people who take advantage of this
 program.&nbsp; The Pay As You Earn program essentially caps your student l=
oan repayment rates at 10 percent of your income.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President has also foug=
ht hard to establish the CFPB.<o:p></o:p></p>
