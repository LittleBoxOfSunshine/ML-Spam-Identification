You can quote me with this:<br>
<br>
Because the Party=E2=80=99s platform is a statement of our values, the DNC =
is committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both of our =
campaigns will be represented on the Drafting committee, and just as we did=
 in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate.<br>
<br>
FOR BACKGROUND<br>
<br>
The rules governing our process for appointments to convention standing com=
mittees were established in 2014 long before any candidates declared and fo=
llow the same process that have governed these appointments for many cycles=
.&nbsp; The co-chairs of all of the committees and the At-Large members wer=
e elected by the DNC Executive Committee members in January 2016. That meet=
ing was open to the public and all of the campaigns were participants in th=
at process.<br>
<br>
The overwhelming remainder (87%) of the Standing Committee membership is el=
ected by each state=E2=80=99s National Convention Delegates after being nom=
inating by the presidential campaigns, proportional to each campaign=E2=80=
=99s percentage of the state wide vote.<br>
<br>
The Platform drafting committee is a subcommittee of the larger platform co=
mmittee. Those members have not yet been named but the appointments will be=
 made in consultation with both campaigns, as has been the case in past cyc=
les.&nbsp; Both campaigns are fully aware of our process.<br>
