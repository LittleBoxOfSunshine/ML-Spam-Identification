Hey Jordan,

Bobby tells me that you'd be the right POC for the upcoming DNC roundtable =
with POTUS on the 18th, correct? We'd ideally like to setup a walkthrough t=
his Thursday the 12th at the Jefferson if that works for you? If so, just l=
et me know a good time to schedule the walkthrough, and who you'd like our =
Advance team to link up with for the meeting.

Thanks a lot,

Tim
