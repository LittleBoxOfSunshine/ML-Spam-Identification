I am good with "faith" - it speaks to values and ideals more than
individuals.

This month, we celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month by marking the impo=
rtant contributions that Jews have made to American life.<br>
<br>
From a young age, I was taught that a central tenet of our faith is tikkun =
olam =E2=80=93 or - repairing the world. As Jews and as active citizens, my=
 parents helped me understand that it is our responsibility to help and adv=
ocate for others.<br>
<br>
</span>This year's theme - education - builds upon that legacy of tikkun ol=
am. We know that education can be the silver bullet for parents who want to=
 give their children a better life or a chance to escape the cycle of pover=
ty. Education is also our best defense against bigotry and ignorance in soc=
iety. Jewish Americans have made major contributions to American education =
system, most notably Julius Rosenwald's effort to help build more than 5,00=
0 schools in the American South. By fighting for a better education for all=
 Americans, Jewish Americans can do our part to repair our country and the =
world.<br>

There's a reason why two-thirds of Jews identify with the Democratic Party:=
 because the Democratic Party's values are in sync with the values of the J=
ewish community, like tzedakah, or charity, gemilut hasadim, the gift of lo=
ving kindness, and the cause of social justice. This Jewish American Herita=
ge Month, I'm proud to call myself a Democrat because I know that we are no=
t only advancing the causes of our party but of the Jewish faith.<br>
