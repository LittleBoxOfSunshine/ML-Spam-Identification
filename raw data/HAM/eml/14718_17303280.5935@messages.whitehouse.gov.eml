For Immediate Release May 10, 2016

REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

HONORING THE 2016 NCAA CHAMPION=20

UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT HUSKIES



East Room







2:41 P.M. EDT



THE PRESIDENT: Hey! (Applause.) Everybody, have a seat. You guys have bee=
n through this before. You know what to do. (Laughter.) Sit down. So ther=
e's an old saying: You cant win all the time. (Laughter.) Except this tea=
m seems to consistently want to bust that clich. Ladies and gentlemen, fo=
r the fourth year in a row, give it up for the NCAA Champion, UConn Huski=
es! (Applause.)=20



As you might be able to tell, there are some Huskies fans in the house. (=
Laughter.) Almost the entire congressional delegation from Connecticut. M=
r. Larry McHugh, Chairman of the University Of Connecticut Board Of Trust=
ees. David Benedict, the University of Connecticuts Athletic Director.=20=




When I called Coach Geno to congratulate him for winning the title -- aga=
in -- I told him wed have his room ready for him when he gets here. It's =
a small room, with a cot. He doesnt get the Lincoln bedroom. But he does =
seem to spend an awful lot of time here. As it turns out, the Huskies are=
 generous hosts, as well. Ive got an open invitation to join their Xbox 3=
60 Rock Band group, the Delta Commas. (Laughter.) In nine months I will h=
ave some time on my hands.=20



But congratulations, Coach, on your 11th national championship. (Applause=
.) What an extraordinary record. He has now broken the record set by the =
legendary John Wooden for the most championships by a head coach in Divis=
ion I sports. And this season, the Huskies broke another NCAA record -- t=
hey won the most consecutive national championships by one team. Coach Au=
riemmas players will tell you he is one of the foremost experts on tough =
love. I'm pretty good at that, too. You can ask Malia and Sasha. (Laughte=
r.) But to an entire generation of athletes and young women, he has been =
a lifelong teacher and friend. And all of us, even Huskies rivals, are go=
ing to be cheering him on when he takes Team USA to the Womens Basketball=
 Gold Medal in the Olympics this year. (Applause.) Bring on the Gold!



This team has gone undefeated twice in the past four years, including thi=
s past season. It is a testament not only to Geno, but to the captain of =
this team, and the NCAA Player of the Year -- Breanna Stewart. (Applause.=
) When she was a freshman, Breanna said she came to UConn to win four cha=
mpionships. And I'm sure Coach was thinking, eh, don't put so much pressu=
re on yourself. (Laughter.) But if you got it, if you can back it up, the=
n you're not being cocky, you're just being accurate. (Laughter.) And thi=
s team embraced her challenge.



Breanna and her fellow seniors -- Morgan Tuck and Moriah Jefferson -- led=
 the team by making sure everybody else knew what was expected of them. E=
ntering the first game of the season, they were 0-0 like everybody else. =
They were playing on the road. Some of their best players had graduated, =
and expectations were high. But they quickly put any uncertainty to rest,=
 blowing out Ohio State by 44 points. Theyd win the rest of their games b=
y an average of almost 40 points. Tough defense won the championship rema=
tch against Notre Dame. Overall toughness won a hostile road game against=
 the second-best team in the country, South Carolina, before a sellout cr=
owd of 18,000 fired-up fans. And from then on, they just marched straight=
 to their fourth title.=20



But thanks to Coach Auriemma, this team has never let victory go to their=
 heads. Theyre academic All-Stars. Over half the team has a GPA of a 3.0 =
or higher. (Applause.) On Sunday, the seniors walked across the stage and=
 received their diploma. And theyre community leaders, as well. They run =
a basketball clinic at Halloween for local kids. A food drive leading up =
to Thanksgiving. A blood drive for the Red Cross. They collect toiletries=
 from their hotel stays throughout the year to donate to families in need=
. They filmed a video for elementary school students on the importance of=
 being kind to one another. So these young women know what it means to gi=
ve back to a community that gives them so much.



I have a feeling this team will be back again. I will not be -- I'll be h=
onest, Coach, Ill miss the visits, our annual phone calls. But I just wan=
t to say how incredibly proud I am of all that they have achieved. These =
women have broken so many records. We dont have time to run through all o=
f them, but throughout they've done it with grace and good humor and good=
 sportsmanship, and an outlook that serves as an example for young athlet=
es -- boys and girls -- to look up to. Their triumphs are an example of t=
he ways that sports can bring an incredible sense of competitive fire, bu=
t also teamwork and cooperation, discipline and hard work to a young pers=
ons life. They're going to continue to be great athletes. They're going t=
o continue to be great role models.=20



I told them earlier that one of the things this program has done is that =
each year it has set a high bar for excellence, and each year you see the=
 women's game getting better and better and better, and giving all the ot=
her teams around the country a mark to shoot for. And that is good not ju=
st for young women who can see an example of extraordinary athletic accom=
plishment that they can shoot for, but it's good for the boys, too, becau=
se maybe the boys get a sense that they can't mess with the girls because=
 the girls know what it means to be great athletes and great competitors.=




So we could not be prouder of them, couldnt be prouder of the coach, coul=
dnt be prouder of the program. Congratulations national champions, the UC=
onn Huskies. (Applause.)=20



 COACH AURIEMMA: You know, the first time we came here in 2009, and then =
we came back and we all enjoyed it, and we came back -- (laughter) -- and=
 I remember saying to President Obama, I said, you know, your fourth year=
 is coming up. And I said, I dont know what the future holds. I said, I k=
now we're going to be back. (Laughter and applause.)=20



THE PRESIDENT: That was true.



COACH AURIEMMA: And he said, so am I. (Laughter and applause.)=20



THE PRESIDENT: That was true, too.=20



 COACH AURIEMMA: So, taking that, I was hoping that we could get the rest=
 of the NCAA, after four years of Stewie and Ry and Mo, we could just hav=
e a vote and see if we could have them for another four years. (Laughter.=
) And, unfortunately, it doesnt work that way. We were fortunate to have =
Tuck and Moriah and Stewie for four years, and Briana joined us -- Pulido=
. They've done something that is pretty incredible in the sense that ever=
y other player that goes to college for the rest of the time that they pl=
ay basketball can never beat, can never top what they've done. Somebody c=
an tie them, somebody can do exactly what they've done. But they go to be=
d at night, every night, knowing that no one in the history of basketball=
 has ever done what they've done, and no one will ever be able to do more=
 than they've done. And that's something that we all are really proud of.=
 (Applause.)=20



 The trips down here are memorable because we know that the President is =
a tremendous basketball fan. He keeps on top of things. He picks us every=
 year in the NCAA tournament. (Laughter.)=20



 THE PRESIDENT: It's really tough. Clairvoyant. (Laughter.)=20



 COACH AURIEMMA: And you know -- that's the last thing I'll say -- you kn=
ow, what I'm going to miss the most is -- I dont know if you've ever gott=
en a phone call from the President -- (laughter) -- but my phone rings, a=
nd I look at my phone and there is just, like, lines and it says "Unknown=
 Call." And I'm like, I'm not answering this. (Laughter.) I dont know who=
 it is. So I dont answer. And then next day -- unknown call. I put it awa=
y. The third day, it said, you better answer this. (Laughter.) And I pick=
ed it up, and he's on the phone. And I'm going to miss the relationship. =
I'm going to miss coming down here. I'm going to miss his support that we=
 have.=20



But if you've been paying attention to what's going on in the media these=
 last six or seven months, as time goes by, we're probably going to miss =
him more than he misses us. Thank you. (Applause.)=20



THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Very nice. (Applause.) Thank you. That was very=
 kind. (Applause.) Thank you. I should point out -- I dont know if maybe =
this is a secret -- but we couldnt bring it out here. In addition to the =
traditional jersey and basketball, Coach brought me a rocking chair. (Lau=
ghter.) Now, I'm not taking this as an insult. I'm assuming it was meant =
with love. But, Coach, I do want you to know I'm not going out to pasture=
 here. (Laughter.) In fact, I might even be able to come to one your game=
s live. (Applause.) So dont think you got rid of me that easily.=20
