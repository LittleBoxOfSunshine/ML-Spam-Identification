*Subject:* In-town pool report #2: POTUS talks to college reporters



At 3:52 pm, President Obama came out as White House press secretary Josh =
Earnest was doing a special briefing for college reporters who were visit=
ing the White House for the day. (More details on the White House College=
 Reporter Day below.) The presidents appearance was open press, and laste=
d for more than 38 minutes, so this will be just a brief synopsis of Obam=
as extended press conference with college students.=20



The briefing room was packed, with college students seated in the usual s=
pots occupied by members of the White House press corps, several of whom =
stood in the back to listen to the session. There were also a few childre=
n of full-time White House reporters in attendance, since it was Take You=
r Son and Daughter to Work Day. A murmur rippled through the room when Ob=
ama entered, as Earnest left the podium and the president began with one =
of his traditional openers, Hows it going everybody?



The president said he wanted to share a bit of breaking news (about expan=
ding one of the administrations student loan initiatives) and also touted=
 the importance of confirming his Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.=
 Referring to Senate Republicans refusal to hold a hearing and vote on Ga=
rlands nomination, he emphasized the idea that even when politicians have=
 big disagreements they need to demonstrate theres still a willingness to=
 follow the rules and treat people fairly.



He also singled out the White House press corps for praise, saying in con=
trast to many other countries, weve got this incredible free press and so=
me of the best journalists in the country operate here. He added that he =
doesnt make a practice of saying nice things about the reporters who cove=
r him when theyre present.



Obama then took a slew of questions from the student reporters, on issues=
 that included water contamination in Flint, what accomplishments hes pro=
ud of, the escalating cost of college, his refugee policy, immigration an=
d the importance of civic involvement.=20



While he mentioned some policies hes pleased to have enacted he concluded=
 that answer by saying that when it came to what hes most proud of, it wa=
s the fact that mainly, as the assistant to Michelle Obama, Ive raised tw=
o daughters who are amazing and that being able to do that while also bei=
ng focused on my job is something that I work hard on.



The editor-in-chief of the University of North Carolinas Daily Tar Heel, =
who asked the first question, took the opportunity to ask if Obama would =
be willing to grant an interview with his paper, which is one of the olde=
st college papers in the country. While the president would not commit on=
 the spot, he indicated he would likely do it, saying, I am favorably dis=
posed. But he warned, It will not be a really long interview.



Obama concluded the session by talking at length about how young people n=
eeded to work to change the current political system through voting. Ther=
es not dispute that our democracys not working as well as it should be, h=
e said, adding later, The people in power dont want things to change.



You cant just complain. Youve gotta vote, he told the group. Dont give aw=
ay your power.



You got me started. I went on a rant, didnt I? he observed.



At 4:31 pm, the president wrapped up his remarks. The student reporters a=
pplauded, and he left the room.



Background, per the White House, on the event:



Today, the White House is hosting the first-ever White House College Repo=
rter Day with 50 student reporters from dozens of colleges and universiti=
es around the nation. College Reporter Day will provides student reporter=
s the opportunity to engage with Senior Administration Officials on a ran=
ge of issues. Earlier today, After a welcome from Chief of Staff Denis Mc=
Donough, the students heard from White House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarre=
tt to discuss the "It's On Us" campaign to help put an end to sexual assa=
ult on college campuses; White House Senior Advisor Brian Deese and White=
 House Counsel Neil Eggleston on the President's nomination of Chief Judg=
e Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court; Secretary of Education John King,=
 Executive Director of First Lady Michelle Obama's Reach Higher initiativ=
e Eric Waldo, Deputy Assistant to the President for Education Policy Robe=
rto Rodriguez, and Special Assistant to the President for Higher Educatio=
n Ajita Menon on college access and affordability; and Director of the Of=
fice of Public Engagement Paulette Aniskoff and CNCS CEO Wendy Spencer to=
 talk about civic engagement and the importance of ensuring that all Amer=
icans have an equal voice in our democracy and how everybody can come tog=
ether to solve our nations challenges. The students also had the opportun=
ity to meet with members of the White House Correspondents Association. F=
inally, the students are participating in a press briefing with Press Sec=
retary Josh Earnest.
