Friend --

I hope you saw our exciting announcement last week around the newly formed =
Democratic Lawyers Council at the Democratic National Committee.=20

As part of this national announcement, we are hosting a National Kickoff =
Call on Tuesday, May 3rd at 2:00pm with special guests, Stephanie Cutter =
and David Simas. Participants will receive an insider's view of the 2016 =
presidential election and other progress updates.=20

You can sign up for the National Kickoff Call now using the following =
link: https://finance.democrats.org/page/s/DLCMay3Call =20

Additionally, if you would like to join the Democratic Lawyers Council =
today, you can reserve your spot here: =
https://finance.democrats.org/page/contribute/DLC2016=20

This election is too important for the legal community to sit on the =
sidelines. The next president may have the opportunity to appoint three to =
four Supreme Court justices and will weigh in on issues important to the =
legal community, including tort reform, judicial appointments, and =
criminal justice reform.

Thank you for your past and future support!
The Democratic Lawyers Council
