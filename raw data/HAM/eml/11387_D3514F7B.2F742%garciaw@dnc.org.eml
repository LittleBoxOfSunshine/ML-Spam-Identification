DNC calls Trump 'Dangerous Donald' on Cinco De Mayo<http://www.washingtonex=

Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz marked Ci=
nco de Mayo by arguing "Dangerous Donald" Trump would hurt relations with M=
exico.

"That Donald Trump became his party's presumptive nominee on the eve of Cin=
co de Mayo is fitting, a reminder of just how wrong his divisive and hatefu=
l rhetoric has been since the very first day of his campaign. Today is a re=
minder that Dangerous Donald would threaten America's relationships with ou=
r closest allies, and make our communities less safe," Wasserman Schultz wr=
ote on Thursday.

She added, "Like the brave souls that day in Puebla a century and a half ag=
o, we must show the spirit and determination every single day between now a=
nd Nov. 8th to defeat Trump and his Republican Party in November, and ensur=
e our country continues to live up to our history and our values."

Since Trump was proclaimed the presumptive GOP nominee on Tuesday night, th=
e DNC has sent out numerous statements condemning the Republican Party for =
choosing Trump to represent them. Throughout his campaign, Wasserman Schult=
z has also condemned Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants being "crimi=
nals" and "rapists.=94

"So as we celebrate a day that reminds us of our shared history, cultural a=
nd familial ties, the Democratic Party reaffirms our commitment to exemplif=
ying the values that made America great," Wasserman-Schultz concluded.

The Democratic Party seized on House Speaker Paul Ryan<http://thehill.com/p=
eople/paul-ryan>=92s refusal to back Donald Trump<http://thehill.com/people=
/donald-trump> on Thursday, slamming the GOP for refusing to accept its own=
 presumptive presidential nominee.

=93Well, that was awkward,=94 Democratic National Committee spokesman Mark =
Paustenbach said in a statement. =93Paul Ryan =97 the highest-ranking Repub=
lican in the country, and chair of the Republican National Convention =97 j=
ust said he can=92t support Dangerous Donald Trump=92s nomination for presi=
dent.=94

Paustenbach added, "Bring a hazmat suit if you=92re one of the remaining Re=
publican leaders still planning to stand with your nominee =96 Trump has go=
ne radioactive.=94

Earlier on Thursday, Ryan told CNN<http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/p=
aul-ryan-not-ready-support-endorse-donald-trump-presumptive-gop-nominee> th=
at he was =93not ready=94 to support Trump for president.

=93I hope to, though, and I want to,=94 he said. =93But what is required is=
 to unify this party. And the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will=
 have to come from our presumptive nominee.=94

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also blasted Ryan=92s =93co=
wardice=94 for refusing to confront the business mogul.

=93=91Not there right now=92 is just another one of the toothless statement=
s that have become Ryan=92s hallmark since becoming Speaker,=94 said DCCC s=
pokeswoman Meredith Kelly in a statement. =93For months, Paul Ryan refused =
to take on or rebuke Trump by name as he demeaned women, refused to disavow=
 the KKK, or insulted Hispanics. Trump is now poised to accept the GOP=92s =
nomination, and Ryan is scrambling because he knows what everyone else know=
s: Donald Trump is toxic for his own reputation, and for House Republicans.=
 His cowardice veiled as bravery is too little, too late.=94
