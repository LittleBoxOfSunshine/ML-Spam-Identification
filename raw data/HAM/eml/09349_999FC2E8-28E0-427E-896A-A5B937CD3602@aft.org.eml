These programs allow the progressives in the Department of Education to ind=

Donald Trump Promised To Ask Congress For The Full Repeal Of The Affordable=

amacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the De=
mocrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be diff=
icult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead th=
e effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industr=
y. But none of these positive reforms can be accomplished without Obamacare=
 repeal. On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to im=
mediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.=94 [Healthcare Reform to Make=

Trump Credited Ted Cruz=92s Efforts For Shutting Down The Government To Def=

 blessed a strategy that would include a rider that defunds Planned Parenth=

 any bill that includes such a defunding rider, which would imperil funding=
 legislation that Congress must pass by Sept. 30. That same strategy was pu=
shed by Cruz in 2013 in an effort to defund Obamacare, culminating in a 16-=
day government shutdown that did little stymie the president=92s signature =
healthcare law. Despite that history, Trump says the GOP should give the un=
compromising maneuver another go. Asked directly by conservative radio host=
 Hugh Hewitt if it=92s worth shutting down the federal government to strip =

TRUMP=92S HEALTH CARE PLAN LACKED DETAIL AND WOULD RESULT IN MORE UNINSURED=
 PEOPLE AND A HIGHER DEFICIT

Huffington Post: Donald Trump=92s Health Care Plan Would Dramatically Incre=
ase The Number Of People Who Would Be Uninsured And Did Not Address Protect=
ions For People With Pre-Existing Conditions. =93Let's start with what's no=
t in Trumpcare, apart from estimates of how much it would cost and how it w=
ould affect the health care system. He seems to have no notion about coveri=
ng the uninsured -- there are no tax credits or new government programs to =
help the millions who, without the substantial financial assistance that Ob=
amacare offers, could never afford decent coverage on their own. As a resul=

Hi John, Amy forwarded me your email. Here=92s our basic primer on Trump:


Dangerous Donald Trump Lacks the Judgment or Temperament to be President

Donald Trump=92s recklessness would hurt our economy, diminish our standing=
 in the world, and make our communities less safe. Trump is dangerous, and =
he lacks the judgment or temperament to be president.

His impending nomination is a reminder that for years the Republican Party =
has elevated extreme voices, using divisive campaigns that sought to exploi=
t unfounded fears for political gain. And just like Republicans in Washingt=
on have done for years, Dangerous Donald is only looking out for himself. H=
is plans would benefit those at the very top and would drag our country bac=
k to where we were when the last Republican president left office losing 80=
0,000 jobs a month. The American people can=92t afford to let him bully his=
 way into the Oval Office.



Dangerous Donald Trump has already damaged America=92s relationships across=
 the globe. His record of denigrating women has only gotten worse throughou=
t this campaign, at the same time that his divisive rhetoric has made our c=
ommunities less safe. And his business record is riddled with embarrassing =
failures that make it clear the American people can=92t afford to let him g=
et anywhere near the White House.


National Security: Even as a candidate, Dangerous Donald has damaged Americ=
a=92s relationships across the globe. In the White House, he would undeniab=
ly make America less safe.


=B7         Donald Trump has no foreign policy experience and rather than s=
eeking the advice of well-respected experts, Trump relies on his own misinf=
ormed ideas and in his own words, on his =93good brain.=94

=B7         Trump has falsely claimed that he knows =93more about ISIS than=
 the generals=94 and recommended that the U.S. military commit internationa=
l war crimes.

=B7         Trump=92s threat to pull back from our most important military =
alliances<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-and-the-end-=
of-nato/2016/03/04/e8c4b9ca-e146-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html> like NA=
TO, pull aid from our allies like Israel, and his gushing praise for dictat=
ors would put our country on a dangerous path.

=B7         Trump has refused to rule out using nuclear weapons on European=
 territory, and wants to allow countries that don=92t currently have nuclea=
r weapons to get them, reversing long-held goals of international nuclear d=
isarmament.

Wrong on Women: Dangerous Donald has a decades-long record of denigrating w=
omen and promoting misogyny. His policies would make it harder for women to=
 make their own choices when it comes to their healthcare or their career.

=B7         Trump once said you had to  treat women =93like s**t=94 and has=
 spent decades doing so himself by calling women names =96 =93fat pig,=94 =
=93slob,=94 or =93bimbo=94 =96 and saying a man needs a woman to support hi=
m at home rather than always be =93griping and bitching.=94

=B7         Trump would take away a woman=92s right to make her own healthc=
are choices and has said women who had abortions should be punished =96 but=
 not the doctors that performed them =96 and opposed exceptions for health =
of the mother because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to hav=
e an abortion.

=B7         Trump thinks ensuring equal pay for women should just be left u=
p to =93the marketplace=94 and once suggested family leave policies should =
actually be scaled back and noted pregnancy was =93an inconvenience for a b=
usiness.=94 Trump complained that when he employed mothers, they were not g=
iving him =93100 percent.=94

Divisive and Dangerous: Dangerous Donald exploited racial anxieties and cul=
tural fears in the pursuit of getting elected =96 to the point where his ra=
llies have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the me=
dia.

=B7         Trump spouts hateful and dangerous lies about Muslims and calle=
d to surveil mosques, to ban Muslims from entering the country and to creat=
e a database of all Muslims in America =96 including U.S. citizens =96 and =
could not answer when pressed on how this would be any different from Nazi =
Germany.

=B7         Trump called Mexican immigrants =93rapists=94 and criminals and=
 said they brought disease into the country, said you needed to check if Na=
tive Americans were =93real Indians,=94 and claimed that a =93well-educated=
 black has a tremendous advantage=94 =96 but apparently not an advantage in=
 finding housing in Trump properties, because in the 1970s, the Trump Organ=
ization was sued for discriminating against Blacks and Puerto Ricans.

=B7         Trump has been endorsed by former  KKK leader David Duke, and h=
is candidacy has been used as a recruiting tool for the white supremacist m=
ovement, which is no surprise since Trump refused to disavow David Duke and=
 the KKK four times in one interview.

=B7         Trump has fostered violence against protestors at his rallies, =
suggesting that a Black Lives Matter protester maybe =93should have been ro=
ughed up,=94 promising to pay the legal fees if someone would =93knock the =
hell=94 out of a protester and reminiscing about the old days when a protes=
ter would be =93carried off on a stretcher.=94

=B7         Trump repeatedly threatened the First Amendment by calling to =
=93open up=94 libel laws so he could sue reporters whenever they printed a =
story he did not like, made it a practice of banning media outlets he did n=
ot like from covering his rallies, and thought =93closing=94 parts of the I=
nternet was a rational strategy to combat ISIS.

Bad at Business, Bad for the Economy: Though he plays the part of a wealthy=
 and successful businessman, Dangerous Donald=92s real life record is riddl=
ed with embarrassing failures and cheap schemes designed to turn a quick bu=
ck at the expense of everyday Americans.


=B7         Despite his tough talk on trade deals and the loss of American =
jobs, Donald Trump manufactured his clothing line in countries he rails aga=
inst, like China and Mexico.

=B7         Dangerous Donald owes everything to the tens of millions of dol=
lars in loans and bailouts he received from his family.

=B7         Dangerous Donald=92s businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt, =
leaving investors, contractors and small businesses holding the bag for his=
 disastrous business decisions.

=B7         During one of his business bankruptcies, his personal finances =
were at the mercy of banks who put him on an =93allowance=94 of $400,000 pe=
r month.

=B7         His Trump =93University=94 fleeced thousands of Americans simpl=
y looking to get ahead.

=B7         Trump=92s unfounded predictions<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/03/=
trump-predicts-very-massive-recession-in-us.html> of recession under Presid=
ent Obama and warnings against investing in the stock market are reckless.

=B7         Economists have actually predicted Trump=92s policies could sta=
rt an international trade war and even destabilize the global economy<http:=
//www.cbsnews.com/media/is-donald-trump-a-menace-to-the-global-economy/>.

=B7         Trump=92s tax plan would overwhelmingly benefit the rich while =
costing the country $9.5 trillion to implement -- more than any other Repub=
lican plan proposed. It also violates his pledge not to increase the nation=
al debt.

=B7         Trump actually said at one of the Republican Party=92s debates =
that =93wages are too high=94 and opposed raising the minimum wage

=B7         Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would jeop=
ardize health care for 20 million Americans who=92ve been able to get cover=
age under Obamacare.

Republicans couldn=92t unite against him and failed to stand up to him duri=
ng their primary because they were playing to the same extreme base of thei=
r party. Democrats will be united and hold Donald Trump accountable every d=
ay until November 8th.
