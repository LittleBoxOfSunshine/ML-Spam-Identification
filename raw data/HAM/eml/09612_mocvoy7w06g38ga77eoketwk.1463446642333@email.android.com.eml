Nevada Democrats: Sanders Campaign Has Violent Streak

Nevada's Democratic party<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/democratic-p=
arty.htm> on Monday warned the Democratic National Committee<http://abcnews=
.go.com/topics/news/us/democratic-national-committee.htm> that Sen. Bernie =
Sanders' supporters have a penchant for violence and may seek to disrupt th=
e party's national convention in July, as they did during the Nevada conven=
tion Saturday.

The allegation is the latest fallout from a divisive Nevada Democratic conv=
ention that had to be shut down because security at the Paris Las Vegas hot=
el could no longer ensure order on Saturday night. The gathering closed wit=
h some Sanders supporters throwing chairs; later, some made death threats a=
gainst state party chairwoman Roberta Lange.

Sanders' backers had been protesting convention rules that ultimately led t=
o Hillary Clinton<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/hillary-clin=
ton.htm> winning more pledged delegates. Clinton won the state's caucuses i=
n February, 53-47, but Sanders backers hoped to pick up extra delegates by =
packing county and state party gatherings.

Sanders had released a statement Friday night asking supporters to work "to=
gether respectfully and constructively" at the convention. But the state pa=
rty alleged in its letter to the co-chairs of the DNC Rules and By-laws com=
mittee, "The explosive situation arose in large part because a portion of t=
he community of Sanders delegates arrived at the Nevada Democratic State Co=
nvention believing itself to be a vanguard intent upon sparking a street-fi=
ght rather than attending an orderly political party process."

Michael Briggs, a Sanders campaign spokesman, said, "We do not condone viol=
ence or encourage violence or even threats of violence." He added that the =
campaign "had no role in encouraging the activity that the party is complai=
ning about. We have a First Amendment and respect the rights of the people =
to make their voices heard."

On Saturday, Sanders backers shouted down the keynote speaker, Sen. Barbara=
 Boxer, and others they thought were tilting the rules in Clinton's favor. =
Protesters shouted obscenities and rushed the dais to protest rulings. The =
letter by the state party's general counsel, Bradley S. Schrager, warns tha=
t similarly chaotic scenes could unfold in Philadelphia, site of the Democr=
atic National Committee's July convention.

"We believe, unfortunately, that the tactics and behavior on display here i=
n Nevada are harbingers of things to come as Democrats gather in Philadelph=
ia in July for our National Convention," Schrager wrote. "We write to alert=
 you to what we perceive as the Sanders campaign's penchant for extra-parli=
amentary behavior =97 indeed, actual violence =97 in place of democratic co=
nduct in a convention setting, and furthermore what we can only describe as=
 their encouragement of, and complicity in, a very dangerous atmosphere tha=
t ended in chaos and physical threats to fellow Democrats."

Several Sanders backers have condemned some of the threats against Lange an=
d other actions Saturday. Former state assemblywoman Lucy Flores, a current=
 congressional candidate, said in a statement: "There were actions over the=
 weekend and at the Democratic convention that very clearly crossed the lin=
e. Progressives need to speak out against those: Making threats against som=
eone's life, defacing private property, and hurling vulgar language at our =
female leaders."

State party offices remained closed Monday for security reasons after Sande=
rs supporters posted Lange's home and business addresses, email and cell ph=
one number online. Copies of angry and threatening texts to Lange were incl=
uded with the letter.

Lange said she'd been receiving hundreds of profanity-laced calls and texts=
 from inside and outside of the U.S., threatening her life and her family. =
Lange said the restaurant where she works has received so many calls it had=
 to unplug the phone.

"It is endless, and the longer it goes the worse it gets," Lange said in an=
 interview. "I feel threatened everywhere I go."

When hotel security kicked the raucous Nevada Democratic Party convention o=
ut of the facility on Saturday night, Hillary Clinton and Democratic leader=
s across the country were put on notice: Expect serious turbulence before a=
rriving in Philadelphia this summer.

For several chaotic hours, legions of Bernie Sanders=92 backers lashed out =
in anger and frustration over Clinton=92s delegate win there. The Paris Las=
 Vegas hotel finally managed to shut down the event, but another group of a=
ngry Sanders fans descended on the state Democratic headquarters the next m=
orning.

To the state party officials across the nation who saw videos from the conv=
ention on the Internet and on cable news Monday morning, the Nevada debacle=
 served as a jarring reminder that the party is still a long way from unite=
d after its long slog of a primary.

=93I think maybe Nevada is a little bit of a wake-up call=94 to party leade=
rs, warned West Virginia Democratic Vice Chairman Christopher Regan. "If ev=
ery state chair is not talking about how we can make sure that doesn't happ=
en in our state, [for] those that have yet to go, you're just not doing you=
r job."

In interviews with state Democratic chairs and other party leaders in rough=
ly a dozen states =97 some of whom back Sanders, and some who support Clint=
on =97 the consensus is that the Nevada meltdown was an anomaly. But many w=
orry that it might also be a harbinger of trouble at upcoming state convent=
ions, and perhaps even the July national convention in Philadelphia.

=93It is really important for [Sanders], if it=92s clear to him by the time=
 the convention starts =97 and that=92s likely to happen =97 [that Clinton =
has won], that he send messages to his supporters through his lieutenants, =
through the heads of his delegations, that if Secretary Clinton has the nec=
essary delegates, then we=92ll have a roll call,=94 said former Pennsylvani=
a governor and DNC chairman Ed Rendell, the convention chairman and a veter=
an Clinton ally, conceding that a fight over the party=92s platform would s=
till be likely.

Democrats had hoped to portray the party as a picture of unity =96 to contr=
ast to what=92s expected to be a messy, contentious Republican affair a wee=
k earlier in Cleveland =96 but those hopes are fading as some level of unre=
st is now expected in various state Democratic conventions in upcoming week=
s.

Those concerns began surfacing in formal and informal communications on Sun=
day and Monday, said state Democratic officials =97 and it is certain to be=
 a glaring topic of conversation later this week in Philadelphia when state=
 party leaders gather for their quarterly meeting.

=93You=92ll see similar things happen in other state conventions elsewhere =
in the next few weeks. I don=92t know if it will be to the same extent as N=
evada,=94 predicted Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer=
-Labor Party, noting that he had already discussed the Nevada proceedings d=
uring a meeting with his own party on Monday morning, weeks before their ow=
n convention. =93I can=92t imagine that tensions will be this high come lat=
e July [at the national convention]. But obviously if they are, that would =
be a problem."

Others express a higher degree of alarm, and hope to head off any further c=
lashes by encouraging the Vermont senator to call for a cool-down.

=93I hope Senator Sanders would understand that he is not only damaging his=
 own reputation and standing, but also doing harm to the Democratic Party, =
unless he encourages his supporters to be more genteel in their protest,=94=
 said Don Fowler, the Democratic National Committee chairman from 1995 to 1=
997.

In Nevada, Saturday=92s convention fell into disarray even after Sanders an=
d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid =97 the state=92s leading Democrat =97 =
issued statements Friday urging a calm, respectful event following fraught =
county conventions last month.

The Vermont senator=92s backers at one point shouted down California Sen. B=
arbara Boxer, speaking on behalf of Clinton, while protesting party chairwo=
man Roberta Lange=92s stewardship of the event and accusing the local leade=
rship of stacking the rules and credentials against them when some delegate=
s =97 including those who were not registered Democrats =97 weren't accepte=
d.

Three hours after the event was scheduled to end, hotel security stepped in=
 to close out the proceedings but the turmoil didn=92t end there. Protestin=
g into the next day after Clinton came out on top, some angry participants =
posted Lange=92s phone number online, spurring thousands of death threats, =
according to the Nevada Democratic Party.

While many of the state Democratic conventions have gone off without a hitc=
h this year =97 both in states won by Clinton and by Sanders =97 the conten=
tiousness surrounding Nevada had some precedent.

In Colorado=92s April convention, Clinton-backing Sen. Michael Bennet was d=
rowned out by Sanders backers chanting =93change your vote,=94 referring to=
 his role as a super delegate. More recently in Maine, where Sanders won th=
e state=92s caucuses by a 2-1 margin but a majority of the state=92s 5 supe=
r delegates back Clinton, the Democratic convention approved a proposal for=
cing super delegates to proportionally align their support with the caucus =
results. Sanders supporters in the crowd booed and yelled =93sellout=94 and=
 =93go back to Massachusetts=94 at former Congressman Barney Frank, when he=
 called on them to unite behind Clinton.

State leaders said they can envision future gatherings getting even testier=
 as the race drags on and as Sanders keeps winning primaries, as he is expe=
cted to do on Tuesday.

"I am a little concerned about some of the procedural stuff, but I think we=
're prepared to have those conversations," said Wyoming Democratic Chairwom=
an Ana Cuprill, explaining that she had raised security concerns while plan=
ning the convention in her state, where Sanders won the popular vote but ti=
ed in the pledged delegate count.

To the Sanders team, such worries simply mean party officials should work o=
n finding a way to improve and clarify their procedures to be more inclusiv=
e toward supporters of a candidate who has won so many states and delegates=
.

=93We=92re still putting together the facts on what happened there at the t=
ime, but in general I can say that it would be in the Democratic Party=92s =
best interest for its leaders to figure out a way to welcome the millions o=
f people we have brought into Democratic Party politics this year, and make=
 them part of the process,=94 said Sanders=92 communications director Micha=
el Briggs. =93Smart, self-interested Democrats should figure out how to wel=
come those people rather than stiff-arm them."

"It=92s fair for [party leaders] to figure out what happened, and to try to=
 figure out a way to be more open and welcoming than the Nevada Democrats w=
ere for their own sake,=94 he added. =93Whoever is the nominee of this part=
y is going to need the support of as many people as possible, obviously, an=
d the way to do that is to take advantage of this boom in interest that has=
 happened because of Senator Sanders=92 message resonating all across the c=
ountry.=94

But most state leaders who spoke with POLITICO wouldn=92t commit to making =
changes, instead insisting, like Mississippi Democratic Chairman Rickey Col=
e, =93If you want to participate in the process, you have to know the rules=
."

Accordingly, those officials are now reviewing the plans for their own stat=
e conventions or gatherings =97 many spent Monday checking in with their st=
affs about their preparation. But they say they are more concerned about ho=
w Sanders=92 local fans read his campaign trail messaging, and fear that in=
sinuations that the nominating process is rigged =97 not to mention Sanders=
=92 consistent criticism of the party establishment =97 could lead to more =
unrest. They=92d prefer that the senator focus more of his campaign trail i=
re on Donald Trump.

South Carolina Democratic Chairman Jaime Harrison floated the idea of a pub=
lic event held in conjunction with Clinton, to send a message of party harm=
ony even if both candidates remain in the race for the foreseeable future.

In the meantime, in state after state, party leaders said they were aiming =
to ensure calm at their state conventions by explaining the rules and openi=
ng lines of communication between Clinton and Sanders supporters.

The alternative, said Texas Democratic Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, is a Tru=
mp presidency: =93If people walk away just because they don=92t get their w=
ay, it will result in the worst president in the history of the United Stat=
es."

Also, flagging that the top political reporter in Nevada, Jon Ralston, publ=
ished an article not so long ago in which he highlighted the fact that the =
NV Convention doesn=92t bode well for our Convention in July. Definitely so=
mething we should bear in mind going forward.

If what happens in Vegas happens in Philadelphia, the chances of a unified =
Democratic Party in the general election are virtually nonexistent and the =
odds of a President Trump suddenly don=92t look so long.

=85

Clinton has a difficult needle-threading job keeping the Sanders voters in =

NYT is out with a story. We expect to see a letter from the State Party sho=

n out of the facility on Saturday night, Hillary Clinton and Democratic lea=
ders across the country were put on notice: Expect serious turbulence befor=
e arriving in Philadelphia this
 summer.</p>
<p>For several chaotic hours, legions of Bernie Sanders=92 backers lashed o=
ut in anger and frustration over Clinton=92s delegate win there. The Paris =
Las Vegas hotel finally managed to shut down the event, but another group o=
f angry Sanders fans descended on the
 state Democratic headquarters the next morning.</p>
<div class=3D"story-interrupt format-s pos-alpha predetermined  fixed-story=

<div class=3D"interrupt-item ad"></div>
</div>
<p>To the state party officials across the nation who saw videos from the c=
onvention on the Internet and on cable news Monday morning, the Nevada deba=
cle served as a jarring reminder that the party is still a long way from un=
ited after its long slog of a primary.
</p>
<p>=93I think maybe Nevada is a little bit of a wake-up call=94 to party le=
aders, warned West Virginia Democratic Vice Chairman Christopher Regan. &qu=
ot;If every state chair is not talking about how we can make sure that does=
n't happen in our state, [for] those that
 have yet to go, you're just not doing your job.&quot;</p>
<p>In interviews with state Democratic chairs and other party leaders in ro=
ughly a dozen states =97 some of whom back Sanders, and some who support Cl=
inton =97 the consensus is that the Nevada meltdown was an anomaly. But man=
y worry that it might also be a harbinger
 of trouble at upcoming state conventions, and perhaps even the July nation=
al convention in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>=93It is really important for [Sanders], if it=92s clear to him by the t=
ime the convention starts =97 and that=92s likely to happen =97 [that Clint=
on has won], that he send messages to his supporters through his lieutenant=
s, through the heads of his delegations, that
 if Secretary Clinton has the necessary delegates, then we=92ll have a roll=
 call,=94 said former Pennsylvania governor and DNC chairman Ed Rendell, th=
e convention chairman and a veteran Clinton ally, conceding that a fight ov=
er the party=92s platform would still
 be likely.</p>
<div class=3D"summary"></div>
<p>Democrats had hoped to portray the party as a picture of unity =96 to co=
ntrast to what=92s expected to be a messy, contentious Republican affair a =
week earlier in Cleveland =96 but those hopes are fading as some level of u=
nrest is now expected in various state
 Democratic conventions in upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>Those concerns began surfacing in formal and informal communications on =
Sunday and Monday, said state Democratic officials =97 and it is certain to=
 be a glaring topic of conversation later this week in Philadelphia when st=
ate party leaders gather for their
 quarterly meeting.</p>
<p>=93You=92ll see similar things happen in other state conventions elsewhe=
re in the next few weeks. I don=92t know if it will be to the same extent a=
s Nevada,=94 predicted Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Far=
mer-Labor Party, noting that he had already
 discussed the Nevada proceedings during a meeting with his own party on Mo=
nday morning, weeks before their own convention. =93I can=92t imagine that =
tensions will be this high come late July [at the national convention]. But=
 obviously if they are, that would be
 a problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Others express a higher degree of alarm, and hope to head off any furthe=
r clashes by encouraging the Vermont senator to call for a cool-down.</p>
<p>=93I hope Senator Sanders would understand that he is not only damaging =
his own reputation and standing, but also doing harm to the Democratic Part=
y, unless he encourages his supporters to be more genteel in their protest,=
=94 said Don Fowler, the Democratic
 National Committee chairman from 1995 to 1997.</p>
<p>In Nevada, Saturday=92s convention fell into disarray even after Sanders=
 and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid =97 the state=92s leading Democrat =
=97 issued statements Friday urging a calm, respectful event following frau=
ght county conventions last month.</p>
<p>The Vermont senator=92s backers at one point shouted down California Sen=
. Barbara Boxer, speaking on behalf of Clinton, while protesting party chai=
rwoman Roberta Lange=92s stewardship of the event and accusing the local le=
adership of stacking the rules and credentials
 against them when some delegates =97 including those who were not register=
ed Democrats =97 weren't accepted.</p>
<p><span style=3D"background-color:rgb(255,255,255)">Three hours after the =
event was scheduled to end, hotel security stepped in to close out the proc=
eedings but the turmoil didn=92t end there. Protesting into the next day af=
ter Clinton came out on top, some angry
 participants posted Lange=92s phone number online, spurring thousands of d=
eath threats, according to the Nevada Democratic Party.</span></p>
<div style=3D"overflow:hidden; background-color:rgb(255,255,255); border:me=
dium none">
<p>While many of the state Democratic conventions have gone off without a h=
itch this year =97 both in states won by Clinton and by Sanders =97 the con=
tentiousness surrounding Nevada had some precedent.</p>
<p>In Colorado=92s April convention, Clinton-backing Sen. Michael Bennet wa=
s drowned out by Sanders backers chanting =93change your vote,=94 referring=
 to his role as a super delegate. More recently in Maine, where Sanders won=
 the state=92s caucuses by a 2-1 margin
 but a majority of the state=92s 5 super delegates back Clinton, the Democr=
atic convention approved a proposal forcing super delegates to proportional=
ly align their support with the caucus results. Sanders supporters in the c=
rowd booed and yelled =93sellout=94 and
 =93go back to Massachusetts=94 at former Congressman Barney Frank, when he=
 called on them to unite behind Clinton.</p>
<p>State leaders said they can envision future gatherings getting even test=
ier as the race drags on and as Sanders keeps winning primaries, as he is e=
xpected to do on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a little concerned about some of the procedural stuff, but I =
think we're prepared to have those conversations,&quot; said Wyoming Democr=
atic Chairwoman Ana Cuprill, explaining that she had raised security concer=
ns while planning the convention in her state,
 where Sanders won the popular vote but tied in the pledged delegate count.=
</p>
<p>To the Sanders team, such worries simply mean party officials should wor=
k on finding a way to improve and clarify their procedures to be more inclu=
sive toward supporters of a candidate who has won so many states and delega=
tes.</p>
<p>=93We=92re still putting together the facts on what happened there at th=
e time, but in general I can say that it would be in the Democratic Party=
=92s best interest for its leaders to figure out a way to welcome the milli=
ons of people we have brought into Democratic
 Party politics this year, and make them part of the process,=94 said Sande=
rs=92 communications director Michael Briggs. =93Smart, self-interested Dem=
ocrats should figure out how to welcome those people rather than stiff-arm =
them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It=92s fair for [party leaders] to figure out what happened, and t=
o try to figure out a way to be more open and welcoming than the Nevada Dem=
ocrats were for their own sake,=94 he added. =93Whoever is the nominee of t=
his party is going to need the support of as
 many people as possible, obviously, and the way to do that is to take adva=
ntage of this boom in interest that has happened because of Senator Sanders=
=92 message resonating all across the country.=94</p>
<div class=3D"fig-graphic"></div>
<div style=3D"overflow:hidden; border:medium none">
<p>But most state leaders who spoke with POLITICO wouldn=92t commit to maki=
ng changes, instead insisting, like Mississippi Democratic Chairman Rickey =
Cole, =93If you want to participate in the process, you have to know the ru=
les.&quot;</p>
<p>Accordingly, those officials are now reviewing the plans for their own s=
tate conventions or gatherings =97 many spent Monday checking in with their=
 staffs about their preparation. But they say they are more concerned about=
 how Sanders=92 local fans read his
 campaign trail messaging, and fear that insinuations that the nominating p=
rocess is rigged =97 not to mention Sanders=92 consistent criticism of the =
party establishment =97 could lead to more unrest. They=92d prefer that the=
 senator focus more of his campaign trail
 ire on Donald Trump.</p>
<p>South Carolina Democratic Chairman Jaime Harrison floated the idea of a =
public event held in conjunction with Clinton, to send a message of party h=
armony even if both candidates remain in the race for the foreseeable futur=
e.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in state after state, party leaders said they were aimi=
ng to ensure calm at their state conventions by explaining the rules and op=
ening lines of communication between Clinton and Sanders supporters.</p>
<p>The alternative, said Texas Democratic Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, is a =
Trump presidency: =93If people walk away just because they don=92t get thei=
r way, it will result in the worst president in the history of the United S=
tates.&quot;</p>
