Ok. The first one is still strong so given the external dynamics, going wit=
h the more measured tone in the first is fine.

DNC Statement on Nevada Democratic Party Letter

WASHINGTON =96 DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz today issued the fol=
lowing statement on a letter from the Nevada Democratic Party regarding thr=
eatening and violent behavior among some participants around their state pa=
rty convention this weekend:



=93We are deeply concerned about the troubling details laid out in the lett=
er from the Nevada Democratic Party. We will be reaching out to the leaders=
hip of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic Party=
 in denouncing the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vega=
s. Our democracy is undermined any time threats, intimidation, physical vio=
lence or damage to property are present. If there are legitimate concerns, =
they must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner.



=93The rules governing the Democratic Party delegate selection process have=
 been in place for decades and the specific procedures for this cycle were =
agreed upon in 2014. In Nevada on Saturday, the state party=92s credentials=
 committee was made up of an equal number of members representing both camp=
aigns. That=92s a testament to our party=92s fundamental belief in being in=
clusive, open to the public, and transparent. The process for nominating a =
Democratic Presidential candidate is not something taken lightly, it is a f=
our-year endeavor that is closely scrutinized and determined in public foru=
ms, just as it has been in past election cycles. There is no excuse for wha=
t happened in Nevada, and it is incumbent upon all of us in positions of le=
adership to speak out.=94
