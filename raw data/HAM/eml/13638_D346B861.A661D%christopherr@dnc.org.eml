 Chu. Please let me know if you have any flags or changes, and thank you!


###
REP JUDY CHU
Q: What inspired you to seek public office?
Growing up, I never actually thought I would be in elected office.  It is b=
ecause I never saw anyone like me in such positions, so it never occurred t=
o me that it was a possibility.
It wasn=92t until I took an Asian American Studies in college that a light =
went off in my head. I learned about the history of injustices in the Unite=
d States, and I learned how important it was for communities to organize if=
 they were to get anything done.

Not long after that, something terrible happened in the city I was living i=
n, Monterey Park, California. We experienced a wave of anti-immigrant backl=
ash and the city council passed an English-only ordinance.

That=92s when people said enough was enough.  I joined a multiethnic coalit=
ion to fight back. Together, we gathered thousands of signatures on petitio=
ns. The pressure was enough to get the resolution was overturned.
That fight showed me what power our community has when we stand together ag=
ainst injustices. And it=92s what emboldened me to start on a difficult but=
 successful path to public office. I went from city council all the way to =
becoming the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress in history.

I am proud to now serve as Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific America=
n Caucus, or what we call CAPAC. Our purpose is to make sure that the voice=
s and the priorities of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are heard thr=
oughout Congress, the federal government and throughout this country.
