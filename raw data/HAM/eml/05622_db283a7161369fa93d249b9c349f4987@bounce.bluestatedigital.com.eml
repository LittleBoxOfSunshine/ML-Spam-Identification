			Chicago, America=E2=80=99s third largest city, is plagued by violence an=
d poverty, made worse by racial and class divisions. A poll just released b=
y the Kaiser Foundation and the New York Times depicts a city that is losin=
g faith in its basic public institutions from the police to the mayor=E2=80=
=99s office. The vast majority think the city is on the wrong track, with t=
he greatest unity found in their unfavorable opinion about the job Mayor Ra=
hm Emanuel is doing.</p>
		<p>
			Chicago has nearly equal numbers of black, Hispanic and white residents,=
 but they live largely in separate sides of town and in separate realities.=
 African-Americans and Latinos are far unhappier with basic aspects of thei=
r neighborhoods, from parks to public schools. Crime and violence is the bi=
ggest issue for all Chicagoans, but while 41 percent of blacks think their =
neighborhoods are not safe or not too safe, only 17 percent of whites share=
 their fears. In the wake of the Laquan McDonald shooting =E2=80=94 where a=
 teenager was shot 16 times and killed by a white Chicago policeman, Chicag=
oans believe the police are biased, unaccountable and badly in need of refo=
rm.</p>
		<p>
			On the poverty-ridden south and west sides of town, parents fear for the=
 young. Among African-Americans, overwhelming majorities worry that it is l=
ikely or very likely that a young person in their neighborhood will end up =
in a gang (75 percent), abuse alcohol or drugs (83 percent), got to jail (8=
1 percent) or be a victim of violence (86 percent). These are measures of d=
espair.</p>
		<p>
			The Kaiser/NYT poll only documents what we already knew. It details the =
=E2=80=9Cwhereas.=E2=80=9D Any statement of action begins with the whereas =
=E2=80=94 whereas this is true, and this is true =E2=80=94 detailing the co=
nditions that demand action.</p>
		<p>
			What is missing in Chicago isn=E2=80=99t evidence of the whereas, it is =
the plan for the =E2=80=9Ctherefore.=E2=80=9D Whereas these conditions are =
unjust and unsustainable, therefore we will take the following actions. On =
police reform, Chicago is beginning to see the first stirrings of reform, a=
lthough nothing close to the comprehensive reforms demanded by the mayor=E2=
=80=99s own independent commission.</p>
		<p>
			But on violence, crime, jobs, housing, public schools, parks, trash remo=
val, violence and drugs, there is no plan for action, no =E2=80=9Ctherefore=
=E2=80=9D to address the wretched whereas. In Chicago, 60 percent of whites=
 think their neighborhood is a good or excellent place to raise children. S=
eventy percent of blacks think their neighborhood is only fair or poor (nea=
rly half =E2=80=94 44 percent =E2=80=94 say poor). More than two-thirds wou=
ld rather live somewhere else.</p>
		<p>
			Blacks and Latinos in Chicago believe that the mayor does not care about=
 people like them. While a majority of whites believe he cares, nearly two-=
thirds of black think he does not. The lack of action is assumed to express=
 a lack of concern.</p>
		<p>
			Look across the country at our major cities: Chicago is not alone. The p=
roblems of racial isolation, entrenched poverty, bad schools and lousy serv=
ices, dangerous streets, guns and drugs plague many of our cities. The =E2=
=80=9Ctherefore=E2=80=9D ought to be a national initiative, driving state a=
nd local activity, on jobs and urban development. But Washington is dysfunc=
tional, with even minor reforms held hostage by the obstructionist Congress=
. President Obama has chosen not to put this high on his priorities. And th=
e rich and entrenched interests that dominate our politics continue to igno=
re the misery.</p>
		<p>
			But a whereas without a therefore isn=E2=80=99t a stable reality. Trappe=
d people with no hope are like dry kindling, susceptible to any spark. If t=
he powerful don=E2=80=99t leave people with hope, people will express their=
 despair. Real action =E2=80=94 a serious plan for reform with the resource=
s needed to provide it =E2=80=94 is long past due.</p>
