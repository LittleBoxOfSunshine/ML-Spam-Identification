*         Turnberry resolves litigation on potential urban development boun=
dary expansion site: "Turnberry Associates has resolved litigation over a p=
roperty near Doral where it hopes to expand the county's urban development =
boundary.

Florida Asset Resolution Group, an affiliate of Fort Lauderdale-based BBX C=
apital (NYSE: BBX) filed a lawsuit in June against Turnberry Doral Developm=
ent, Jeffrey Soffer and Jacquelyn Soffer over a $12 million mortgage that w=
as originated by BankAtlantic. The lawsuit was not a foreclosure but sought=
 to force the borrowers to repay the loan." (South Florida Business Journal=
-January 24, 2014)

*         Settlement appears likely in Fontainebleau Las Vegas bankruptcy c=
ase; FONTAINEBLEAU LAS VEGAS: The Soffers are on the verge of settling with=
 creditors over the debacle once known as the Fontainebleau Las Vegas, a st=
ill-skeletal $2 billion high rise in Sin City that ranks as one of the bigg=
est busts of the U.S. real estate crisis.

A federal bankruptcy judge in Miami said Wednesday he was "inclined" to app=
rove a $178 million settlement that would pay contractors on the failed cas=
ino tower about 25 cents on the dollar. Contractors would divvy up about $8=
5 million for a total claims pool of $600 million, but which a creditor law=
yer said would probably end up closer to $350 million once negotiations are=
 finished.

The money will be paid out to creditors and lawyers in arbitration or by co=
urt order, a process that could add another year or two onto a case that be=
gan with a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in June 2009. Construction lenders =
would recoup about $89 million.

"I certainly have sympathy for all of the people who have money coming to t=
hem and seem to have been waiting forever,'' Judge A. Jay Cristol told an a=
udience about 70 lawyers (half of them participating by speaker phone) at a=
n afternoon hearing in downtown Miami.

The settlement money would come from the $93 million in sale proceeds paid =
by corporate raider Carl Icahn when he bought the unfinished tower out of b=
ankruptcy in 2010; the money has been in an frozen escrow account pending t=
he bankruptcy outcome. An additional $33 million would come from title comp=
anies that backed the project., as well as from a $50 million completion gu=
arantee funded by Jeff Soffer and his sister, Jacquelyn.

The brother-and-sister team run the family's real estate firm, Turnberry, w=
hich got its start with the creation of Aventura and now includes both the =
Aventura Mall and the Fontainebleau Miami Beach. The 68-story Fontainebleau=
 Vegas is described in court papers as essentially a tear-down: valuable fo=
r its land on the north end of the Strip, but burdened by a five-year-old, =
unfinished tower that Icahn may demolish.

While Judge Cristol said the settlement would probably meet his approval, h=
e said he would consider written objections by a Las Vegas contractor who w=
anted its $1 million lawsuit against Jeff Soffer protected from the settlem=
ent.

A $50 million settlement "by Mr. Soffer to get out of all the problems he i=
s currently facing is not a large amount," said Henry Marinello, a Miami la=
wyer representing the Tracy and Ryder Landscape Inc., a large Nevada-based =
landscaping contractor.

The settlement would end claims by lenders and contractors in the bankruptc=
y case, but the Soffers still face litigation involving the Fontainebleau V=
egas.

Jeff Soffer, the lead developer in both Fontainebleau projects, has blamed =
the Vegas debacle on Lehman Brothers cutting off funds after it collapsed i=
n 2008, followed by some of the nation's top banks holding back about $800 =
million in construction funds slated for completing the project. But lender=
s accused Soffer and his development team at Turnberry of mismanagement and=
 over-spending - allegations repeated by the bankruptcy trustee in a separa=
te suit seeking damages from Soffer and his top executives. That litigation=
 is still pending and will not be covered by the settlement.

The Soffers did not attend the hearing.

Jeff Soffer presided over Fontainebleau Vegas and put in $30 million cash c=
ollateral for the $50 million completion guarantee before the project start=
ed in 2007. His sister became part of the guarantee when she bought a judgm=
ent from a lender that had successfully sued to force Jeff to pay the remai=
ning $20 million. Both Soffers claimed they should get the money back since=
 the funds could only be used to complete a project that now had no hope of=
 being finished. The two essentially surrendered their claims to the money =
as part of the settlement, said Mario Romine, general counsel for Turnberry=
 Associates.

Soneet Kapila, a Fort Lauderdale accountant appointed as bankruptcy trustee=
 for the case, blamed the four years leading up to the a settlement on the =
fact that the case is one of the most complicated ever to be heard in South=
 Florida.

"When it is high-level and sophisticated litigation, there are a lot of thi=
ngs to resolve,'' he said. "It's the nature of it." (The Miami Herald-Novem=
ber 13, 2013)

*         SOFFERS SETTLE DISPUTE WITH BANK OVER LAS VEGAS FONTAINEBLEAU: "D=
eutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas and a Soffer family partnership have appare=
ntly resolved a $20 million dispute regarding the Fontainebleau Las Vegas.

Jacquelyn Soffer has been substituted as the plaintiff for Deutsche Bank in=
 the case, which would give her the right to collect $19.9 million in princ=
ipal $705,000 in interest plus attorneys fees in New York State Supreme Cou=
rt. The $3 billion project was never completed.

Soffer's brother, Jeffrey, was described by Deutsche Bank as being in contr=
ol of the partnership and named as a defendant. Jacquelyn Soffer was not.

Lenders, including bankrupt Lehman Brothers, have filed lawsuits alleging J=
eff Soffer still owes hundreds of millions for personal guarantees on finan=
cing for the stalled hotel/casino/resort complex in Las Vegas, which Carl I=
cahn purchased for $156 million in January 2010.

The Soffer family and Turnberry also have counterclaims against the Las Veg=
as resort's lenders. The counterclaims, which use details from an examiner'=
s report about the collapse of Lehman, said Lehman hid its true financial c=
ondition.

Jeff Soffer signed a settlement agreement with the bank in January, but the=
 counterclaims are still pending.

As part of the agreement, Deutsche Bank "assigned to [Jackie] Soffer all of=
 its rights, title and interest in the causes of action actually asserted i=
n this action, including the right to have judgment entered against the def=
endants herein."

A logical question is why would a bank substitute a defendant's sister in c=
ollecting the judgement.

Attempts to obtain an explanation regarding the matter from the Soffers or =
their spokesman, David Satterfield, were not successful by deadline.

Other attorneys offered several possible reasons: Jackie Soffer might have =
reached a lower settlement figure with the bank. The family might have want=
ed to equitably share the financial impact. The switch might be part of a b=
roader legal strategy regarding debts related to the Las Vegas resort.

The judgment for Jackie Soffer was registered with the New York State Supre=
me Court and signed by Judge Judith Gische on Feb. 16.

The Fontainebleau Las Vegas filed for bankruptcy in 2009. Jeff Soffer, lend=
ers and others involved in the project suffered losses, but Lehman Brothers=

*         NEW YORK INVESTORS GETTING TURNBERRY'S DAVIE COMMONS: "It looks l=
ike Aventura-based Turnberry Associates is giving up control of its controv=
ersial Davie Commons project to a group of New York investors with a differ=
ent plan for the property.

KeyBank (NYSE: KEY) filed a foreclosure lawsuit in July against Davie Commo=
ns Holdings, Jeffrey Soffer, Jacquelyn Soffer and Turnberry Davie Commons I=
nvestors. The Soffers lead Turnberry Associates, which also owns the Fontai=
nebleau Miami Beach.

KeyBank sold that $17.4 million mortgage for an undisclosed sum to KBNP LLC=
, which, state records show, is controlled by Turnberry Associates and list=
s Jacquelyn Soffer as its managing member. KBNP then won an $18.7 million f=
oreclosure judgment against Davie Commons that has the 152.6-acre site set =
for online auction March 14.

New York real estate investor Gill Li said Jacquelyn Soffer has a small min=
ority ownership in KBNP. He is among several New York investors who are par=
tners in that company. The Soffers are cooperating in the foreclosure actio=
n.

*         SOFFER'S SPENDING DRAWS FIRE IN SUIT: "A bitter legal fight has e=
rupted between one of South Florida's biggest business celebrities, Jeffrey=
 Soffer of the Turnberry companies, and Bruce Weiner, a former CEO of Turnb=
erry Residential LP.

The litigation has turned nasty, with Weiner alleging that Soffer siphoned =
millions of dollars from Turnberry companies for "upkeep of his baronial li=
festyle." The suit is the latest in a string of legal and financial entangl=
ements for Soffer, who was forced to abandon his largest project, the $3 bi=
llion Fontainebleau Las Vegas, in a bankruptcy.

Soffer is famous for flashy spending, driving racecars and dating supermode=
ls including Elle Macpherson. Weiner takes direct aim at those spending hab=
its in his lawsuit.

"Among the dramatic examples of Jeff Soffer's abuse ... was a multimillion-=
dollar 40th birthday he threw for himself that was headlined by a live perf=
ormance by Prince," Weiner alleges in his complaint. Tabloids estimated the=
 party alone cost $2 million.

Soffer fired the first shot in the battle. After firing Weiner in May 2010,=
 he alleged in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court that Weiner betrayed Turnber=
ry by privately negotiating to provide development services to Orlando-base=
d Starwood Vacation Ownership on its new project, the St. Regis Bal Harbor =
Resort.

Turnberry alleged that Weiner, as CEO of Turnberry Residential, violated hi=
s fiduciary duties as an officer by forming a new company - Bal Star LLC - =
and arranging the Starwood deal. Turnberry alleged Weiner had the obligatio=
n to bring the St. Regis deal to them. Also named in the suit is Robert Vol=
lrath, Turnberry's former CFO.

"We've alleged that Turnberry, at this point, owns the Starwood deal," Turn=
berry attorney Michael Olin said. "Turnberry made these guys very wealthy p=
eople. At the end of the day, they went off on their own and took the Starw=
ood deal for themselves. They violated all their fiduciary duties to their =
employer."

Circuit Judge Gill Freeman rejected Turnberry's first complaint, telling at=
torneys it was not clear enough about the corporate structure of the Turnbe=
rry companies and what duties Weiner and Vollrath owed to them. The company=
 is preparing to refile the suit.

In the meantime, Weiner filed his own counterclaim against Turnberry, namin=
g Soffer and his sister, Jacquelyn Soffer in the suit.

Fort Lauderdale lawyer Tom Angelo is one of Weiner's attorneys.

"Their filing the lawsuit necessitated Bruce filing his counterclaim," Ange=
lo said. "Bruce felt it was very unfortunate, given the fact he was there 2=
0 years, working with them."

According to Weiner's lawsuit, he was a 5 percent owner of Turnberry Reside=
ntial. The suit says he and the Soffers took out loans from Turnberry Resid=
ential when it was financed in 2004 with a $200 million loan and credit lin=
e from Prudential Real Estate Investors.

Weiner's lawsuit says he repaid his loan of $4 million within the required =
two years. But, he alleges that Jeffrey Soffer took out $100 million and Ja=
cquelyn Soffer took out $40 million, and that the two combined failed to re=
pay a combined $40 million by the end of 2008.

According to Weiner's suit, the Soffers then caused the company to "reclass=
ify" the loans as distributions, without offering Weiner the same privilege=
. Weiner alleges he should have received 5 percent of that $40 million dist=
ribution.

Weiner also alleges he is still owed money from commissions on sales at Tur=
nberry's 1881 Rosslyn, a large luxury condominium in Arlington, Va., with v=
iews of the Washington Monument.

Olin scoffed at the notion that Turnberry owes any money to Weiner. "He's o=
ut to lunch," he said of Weiner's claims.

The Turnberry complaint alleges that Weiner and Vollrath were so wrapped up=
 in their Starwood plans that they allowed costly delays at the 1881 Rossly=
n project.

Despite the litigation, Turnberry's website still referred to Weiner as the=
 CEO of Turnberry Residential on Feb. 22. It calls Weiner "a driving force =
in the development and sales of more than 16,000 homes" and "a highly regar=
ded real estate development, sales and marketing executive."

Turnberry's media office said in an e-mail that it does not comment on liti=
gation.

Angelo said Weiner was not bound by any non-compete clause: "In fact, he ha=
d a contract as a partner that specifically allowed him to do business outs=
ide of Turnberry."

Weiner's counterclaim alleges that Jacquelyn Soffer twice ordered audits of=
 funds she and her brother received, and that the audits determined Weiner =
should have also received distributions. The suit does not elaborate on Jac=
quelyn Soffer's motive for the audits or the results of the audits.

Miami real estate consultant Lewis Goodkin said Turnberry has so far weathe=
red the economic downturn, but the end of the current real estate crisis is=
 proving a bitter chapter for many similar companies.

"Relationships like theirs usually don't go sour until the market goes sour=
," Goodkin said. "That's the kind of mess that we see people get into." [So=
uth Florida Business Journal; February 25, 2011]

*         BANKS TARGET SOFFERS' VEGAS CENTER: "The Soffer family is facing =
a legal fight to retain control over one of its Las Vegas projects.

Lenders are trying to foreclose on Town Square Las Vegas, the massive mixed=
-use retail and office project the Soffers opened in late 2007 just as the =
economy headed into a tailspin.

Bank of Nova Scotia this week asked a New York judge in the Lehman Brothers=
 Holdings bankruptcy case to allow it to foreclose on Town Square. The bank=
 heads a group of lenders that made a $449 million construction loan to an =
affiliate of the Aventura-based Turnberry Associates headed by siblings Jef=
f and Jackie Soffer.

Lehman is involved because it made a $72 million loan to Town Square and wa=
s supposed to provide permanent financing for the project.

Bank of Nova Scotia began foreclosure proceedings last summer in Las Vegas =
against the Turnberry affiliate that owns Town Square. But the bank claims =
discussions have ``now broken down,'' according to court documents. Discuss=
ions on loan restructuring with the Soffers dated back to March 2009, when =
the construction loan went into default.

Turnberry paints a different picture, saying talks about a voluntary forecl=
osure are ongoing and that it hopes to maintain an ownership stake in the p=
roperty at the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip.

``We're still in the negotiating process,'' Jackie Soffer said. ``We're sti=
ll overseeing the property. We're looking to have a positive outcome.''

This week the fight rolled over into the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy court c=
ase, as Bank of Nova Scotia argued that Lehman Brothers is not a party to t=
he Town Square mortgage. The bank wants a judge to find that Lehman has no =
``property interest'' in the mall.

``This filing is not a surprise,'' Mike Wethington, general manager of Town=
 Square Las Vegas, said in a statement. ``The Bank of Nova Scotia filed thi=
s action in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy case simply to protect its inter=
est in the mall.''

The Town Square project is the second Soffer project in Las Vegas to suffer=
 as part of the fallout from the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008.

Jeff Soffer's failed Fontainebleau Las Vegas casino was sold for pennies on=
 the dollar a year ago in bankruptcy court to corporate raider Carl Icahn."=

*         Developers head back to court in jet dispute: "Prominent Miami de=
velopers Craig Robins and Ugo Colombo are slated to head back to court Frid=
ay in their six-year-old legal fight over a private jet.

An attorney for Robins wants last month's $2 million judgment thrown out be=
cause of alleged juror misconduct, according to the Miami Herald. The attor=
ney, Dennis Richard, claims three of the six jurors who sided with Colombo =
did not disclose their criminal records and involvement in multiple lawsuit=
s. Colombo's attorney says the argument is meritless.

Nearly four years ago, Robins' Dacra Development filed a lawsuit against Co=
lombo's CMC Group that alleged Colombo agreed to buy half of a $22 million =
Bombardier Challenger - but failed to follow through on the agreement.

Colombo then filed a countersuit against Dacra alleging that Robins failed =
to pay for his share of the aircraft's maintenance and that he purposely de=
faulted on the loan. The jury ruled that Dacra did not uphold its agreement=
 to pay for maintenance, awarding Colombo and CMC $2 million in damages. Th=
e judge previously dismissed Dacra's original complaint." (>http://thereald=

*         Lawsuit Describes Art 'Blacklist' to Keep Some Collectors Away

=20

Imagine a market for highly sought-after items in which the makers and sell=
ers work hard to ensure that the items go only to certain buyers, even if o=
ther buyers might be willing to pay more. The favored buyers are then expec=
ted not to resell the items for many years, even if the values skyrocket. I=
deally, in fact, the buyers are expected to give these items away eventuall=
y, for the public good. And if the buyers don't abide by these expectations=
, they risk being cut off, cast out with the other unwashed wealthy who can=
 afford to buy but have no access.

=20

At least according to Craig Robins, a prominent Miami art collector and rea=
l estate developer who filed a federal lawsuit on March 29 in Manhattan, th=
is is a portrait of the workings of the primary market for contemporary art=
, which, despite the recession, remains immense and highly competitive.

=20

At its heart, the $8 million suit is a fairly ordinary contract dispute abo=
ut confidentiality agreements and sales promises. But the details of the di=
sagreement have provided a rare view into a normally very private world of =
high-end art selling in which membership rules, responsibilities, rewards a=
nd reprisals can be so complex and changeable that even art world veterans =
say they sometimes struggle to decode them.

=20

Mr. Robins asserts that he sold a painting of a dark figure by the highly p=
raised South African-born artist Marlene Dumas through the David Zwirner Ga=
llery in Chelsea in 2004 with an agreement that the sale remain confidentia=
l. But the gallery, which did not yet represent Ms. Dumas, told her about i=
t, Mr. Robins claims, causing her to become angry with him because, like ma=
ny artists, she prefers to see her paintings remain long term in prominent =
collections.

=20

Mr. Robins says that Ms. Dumas -- one of whose paintings sold for more than=
 $6 million at Sotheby's in 2008 -- maintains an active blacklist of those =
she views as speculating in her work, a blacklist that, he says, he is now =
on (and whose existence his lawyers, who were back in court on the case thi=
s week, say they plan to prove).

=20

The suit, which claims $3 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in=
 punitive damages from the gallery, also claims that Mr. Zwirner promised t=
o help get Mr. Robins off the blacklist and sell him choice paintings from =
''Against the Wall,'' the current show of Ms. Dumas's work at Zwirner (whic=
h is now her gallery), but that this did not happen.

=20

In its legal response, the gallery has called the suit baseless, saying it =
had never promised choice works or confidentiality after the sale.

=20

''By bringing suit,'' the gallery's lawyers argue, ''the wealthy Robins has=
 literally made a federal case of not being able to buy what he wants, when=
 he wants.''

=20

As for the supposed blacklist, the lawyers added, as if addressing a purely=
 philosophical problem, ''If such a list exists, and if Robins is on it, Zw=
irner did not put him there and cannot take him off.''

=20

But several dealers, art advisers and collectors specializing in contempora=
ry art said in recent interviews that with the explosion of the art market =
over the last several years and a sharp rise in the number of speculative b=
uyers entering the market, those who sell art have become much more wary of=
 collectors' motives -- and that they keep, in addition to secret waiting l=
ists for in-demand artists, another even more secret list of buyers suspect=
ed of wanting to flip art for a quick profit.

=20

[...] Even serious collectors who are generally regarded more as keepers th=
an as sellers complain that, in recent years, several dealers -- and highly=
 involved artists like Ms. Dumas -- have gone overboard in their protective=
ness and desire to control an artwork's destiny after it is sold.

=20

''I think sometimes there's a fair amount of hypocrisy from some of these d=
ealers,'' said Adam Lindemann, a longtime collector and author of a 2006 bo=
ok, ''Collecting Contemporary,'' that offers advice to aspiring collectors.

=20

''I'm not buying a can of sardines here,'' Mr. Lindemann said. ''I'm buying=
 something that I'm in love with. But times change, and sometimes you need =
to sell things.''

=20

Mr. Robins's suit -- and a similar one filed in 2004 against a New York dea=
ler by a prominent European collector, Jean-Pierre Lehmann, who also compla=
ined of an inability to buy choice works -- are seen as evidence by some wi=
thin the collecting world that the contemporary art market has become so co=
ntentious that even serious, long-term collectors are now being pushed into=
 fights. Mr. Robins, for example, owns 29 works by Ms. Dumas, and has calle=
d her ''one of the top three artists in my collection.''

=20

Mr. Zwirner and Ms. Dumas declined to comment about the lawsuit. Mr. Robins=
's lawyer, Aaron Richard Golub, also declined to comment, except to offer a=
 general observation about dealers: ''They might say they're motivated by t=
rying to place pieces in museums and the right collections and such, but at=
 the end of the day it's all about profit.'' [...]

*         High-flying partners dispute jet payments

=20

Dacra Development Corp., headed by businessman and arts patron Craig Robins=
, got hit with a breach-of-contract lawsuit for allegedly failing to pay fo=
r its use of a private jet. Turnberry Management III, whose VP is developer=
 Jeffrey Soffer, says Dacra owes $200,540.63, according to the Broward Circ=
uit Court complaint.

=20

The Challenger 604, worth around $20 million, has a corporate owner -- UC C=
hallenger, LLC. The partners are Robins, 45, and fellow developer Ugo Colom=
bo, 47, president of CMC Group. The Turnberry entity manages and maintains =
the jet at Opa-locka Executive Airport, where the company has a private han=
ger for its own planes and other aircraft. ''We have tenants,'' Soffer says=
.

=20

On Sept. 30, Turnberry Management billed Dacra for that month's use. ''Dacr=
a failed to pay its portion of the invoice . . .'' says the suit, filed by =
attorneys Alan Klugerand Steve Silverman. ``Dacra stated that it did not in=
tend to pay the amount invoiced, and further stated that it did not intend =
to pay, and would not pay, any other and further amounts that came due . . =
.''

=20

Turnberry Management sent Robins a notice of default. Robins shot a note ba=
ck, disputing the invoice. ''The bill itself is inaccurate,'' Robins says i=
n his letter to Turnberry Management's in-house lawyer Mario A. Romine. ``F=
urther, Ugo is in breach of his agreement with us. We plan to collect and m=
ake sure you are paid.''

=20

Robins' attorney, Dennis Richard, says the bill is inaccurate because some =
of CMC's expenses were charged to Dacra. Also, he says, Colombo had agreed =
to buy out Robins' interest in the jet.

=20

Colombo says there were talks, but no deal was struck. ''We were negotiatin=
g but we didn't come to an agreement,'' Colombo says. ``This was before the=
 summer. I even forgot about it. Now he claims there was a verbal agreement=
 for me to buy his part out. There was definitely no agreement.''

=20

Robins declined to discuss his travels, other than to say they were for bus=
iness. As for the dispute, he says: ``I'm sure we will work it out. It's si=
lly that they filed the lawsuit.''

=20

Robins ''has no problem paying for his use of the plane, subject to monies =
owed by Ugo,'' Richard adds. ``His objective is to enforce the agreement th=
at Ugo made with him.''

=20

Meanwhile, Turnberry Management says it has the right to ''ground the aircr=
aft until payment in full has been received,'' even if just one party is in=
 default.

=20

Says Colombo: ``It's a very odd situation. I got trapped in the middle of i=
t.''

=20

Soffer, 40, a licensed pilot, feels the same way. ''They have a dispute amo=
ngst themselves,'' he says. ``I got stuck in the middle. It's unfortunate t=
hat these two are going at it. I like both of them. I hope they settle it. =
I'm sure they will.''

=20

Circuit Judge Richard Eade has the case.
