Today in the fight for a full and functioning Supreme Court: People For the=
 American Way and the Constitutional Accountability Center release a new re=
port detailing the consequences of an eight-member Supreme Court, civics te=
achers give Senate Republicans a lesson on the Constitution, and we wrap up=
 comments from editorial boards and Democratic Senators who continue to pra=
ise Chief Judge Garland, a nominee with the most judicial experience of any=
one ever nominated, and call for an up-or-down vote on his nomination.

New Report Details Consequences of an Eight-Member Supreme Court.
Today, People For the American Way and the Constitutional Accountability Ce=
nter released a report, "Material Harm to Our System of Justice: The Conseq=
uences of an Eight-Member Supreme Court", analyzing the harm a short-handed=
 Supreme Court already has done and will continue to do to the American jud=
icial system. Read the full report HERE<http://www.pfaw.org/media-center/pu=
blications/material-harm-our-system-justice-consequences-eight-member-supre=
me-court-0>.

Elizabeth Wydra, Constitutional Accountability Center President: "The virus=
 of dysfunction afflicting the Senate is showing symptoms at the Court, and=
 the prospect of this blockade extending from the current Term into the nex=
t is outrageous. Former Justices have spoken on the need for a fully staffe=
d Court, including former Chief Justice Rehnquist and even Justice Scalia i=
n years past, as well as former Justices Stevens and O'Connor in recent wee=
ks. As today's report explains, an understaffed Court is hamstrung by its i=
nability to fully perform its essential role in resolving important constit=
utional and legal questions for the American people."

Elliot Mincberg, People For the American Way Foundation Senior Fellow: "The=
 current obstruction that President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Judge Gar=
land is facing is unprecedented, and there are real consequences for the Am=
erican people because of this obstruction. Current and former Supreme Court=
 justices - including Scalia, Roberts, and Rehnquist - have detailed the re=
asons why the Court needs nine members to properly execute its duties. From=
 4-4 splits that fail to set national precedent to potentially blocking the=
 Court's ability to protect voting rights, an eight-member Supreme Court si=
mply cannot function as it should."

History and social studies teachers come to Washington to give Senate Repub=
licans a civics lesson.
On Wednesday, a group of civics teachers traveled to Washington to tell the=
 Senate GOP to do its job and give Chief Judge Garland a hearing and an up-=
or-down vote.

Marisol Garc=EDa, middle school teacher, Phoenix, Arizona: "Students unders=
tand expectations, and they don't understand why senators aren't meeting th=
eirs."

Patrick Chambers, AP History teacher, Indianapolis, Indiana: "The people al=
ready decided when they elected the president. Our constitution is too sacr=
ed and too trusted to be dragged into partisan politics. It's a process tha=
t been used for years and years." [Education Votes, 5/19/16<http://educatio=
nvotes.nea.org/2016/05/19/civics-teachers-come-to-washington-tell-senate-do=
-your-job/>]

GOP senators should stop dithering on hearing for Merrick Garland as Suprem=
e Court justice
The editorial board of the Kansas City Star<http://www.kansascity.com/opini=
on/editorials/article78644512.html> writes:

"Their stark message: To hell with the Constitution, separation of powers a=
nd any semblance of cooperation. Properly undeterred, Obama nominated Merri=
ck Garland, a highly qualified, moderate judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals=
 for the District of Columbia and former prosecutor....Roberts, Moran and B=
lunt should step up, be leaders of their frazzled party and call for a vote=
. Instead they toe the misguided GOP line. Now is the time to show respect =
for the Constitution and the public by holding a hearing and a vote. We fin=
d it difficult to imagine how our states' Republican senators could honestl=
y object to Garland as not qualified to serve."

Senators continue to praise Chief Judge Garland and call for their GOP coll=
eagues to do their jobs and allow for a fair hearing and up-or-down vote.

Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI): [Chief Judge Garland] is supremely well-qualified...=
the American people deserve a fair, public hearing and a fully functioning =
government."[ABC 6, 5/17/16<http://www.abc6.com/story/31996187/reed-high-co=
urt-nominee-garland-supremely-well-qualified>]

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA): "The refusal to consider any Supreme Court nominee f=
orwarded by President Obama in his final year in office, when other Preside=
nts were granted consideration of their nominees, seems highly suspicious t=
o them. When that blockade is maintained even after the President forwards =
to the Senate a nominee of sterling credentials, the suspicion is heightene=
d."[Sen. Kaine press release, 5/17/16<http://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-rel=
eases/kaine-on-obstruction-of-president-obamas-supreme-court-nominee-we-can=
not-blind-ourselves-to-how-our-actions-are-perceived>]

Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR): "It is clear to me from my conversation with Chie=
f Judge Garland that he is a detail-oriented and highly-qualified jurist. H=
e would bring decades of legal experience and a great deal of thoughtfulnes=
s to his work as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. President Obama=
 has done his job in putting forward an extremely qualified nominee. Now it=
 is time for Senate Republicans to do theirs and to hold hearings and a vot=
e on his nomination, as the Constitution requires."[Sen. Merkley press rele=
ase, 5/19/16<https://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/photo/video=
-release-merkley-meets-with-supreme-court-nominee-merrick-garland>]

Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI): "Judge Garland's character and record of judicial=
 service are impressive, and Americans deserve to hear from him in a public=
 Judiciary Committee hearing...it's far past time for my Republican colleag=
ues to do their job by holding a hearing and vote on the nomination." [Hono=
lulu Civil Beat, 5/18/16<http://www.civilbeat.com/2016/05/judge-garland-imp=
ressive-says-hirono/>]

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH): "There's no excuse for the Senate not doing its =
job. I don't think senators should leave town. I don't even think senators =
should be paid if they're not doing their job...senators are working fewer =
hours and still getting paid." [WKSU, 5/18/16<http://wksu.org/post/brown-wa=
nts-cancel-senates-summer-recess-unless-garland-gets-hearing#stream/0>]

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT): "Never before in the history of the United States=
 has a Congress shown this level of disrespect to a president of to a nomin=
ee. I think this has really dangerous precedential effects for the future."=
 [Hartford Courant, 5/18/16<http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-garl=
and-confirmation-pressure-20160518-story.html>]

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT): "I have known Merrick Garland for many year=
s, and I deeply admire him as an incredibly scholarly and smart jurist, a d=
edicated and effective prosecutor, and a decent and good man. I hope the Am=
erican people have an opportunity to see and hear Judge Garland as I did to=
day, because there will be no question that he deserves a hearing and vote.=
" [Hartford Courant, 5/18/16<http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-gar=
land-confirmation-pressure-20160518-story.html>]
