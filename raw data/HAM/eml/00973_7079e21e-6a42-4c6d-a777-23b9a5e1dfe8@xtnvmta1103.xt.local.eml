Good Wednesday morning. It's 68 days to Cleveland, 75 days to Philly, 181 days to election.

 

6 KEY POINTS from AP interview with Trump at his office in New York yesterday -- Julie Pace and Jill Colvin, with Julie Bykowicz:

1) "does not plan to invest heavily in a data-driven effort to target voters in the fall campaign ... spurning the kind of sophisticated data operation that was a centerpiece of Barack Obama's winning White House runs. 'I've always felt it was overrated,' Trump said. 'Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine. And I think the same is true with me.'"

2) "doesn't plan to announce his running mate until the Republican National Convention in July ... [which] he's planning to remake with a showman's touch. 'The concept of some entertainment from a great singer, a great group I think would be something maybe to break things up.'"

3) "emphasis will continue to be on raucous rallies to put him in front of thousands of voters and generate free media coverage. 'My best investment is my rallies ... The people go home, they tell their friends they loved it. It's been good.'"

4) "does not expect to release his tax returns before the November election. 'There's nothing to learn from them' ... He's cited an ongoing audit of his finances as the main reason for withholding the information, and also has said he doesn't believe voters are interested."

5) Has "narrowed his list of potential running mates to 'five or six' people" ... Didn't rule out Christie. ... "Corey Lewandowski ... is running the vice presidential vetting effort 'with a group' ... that includes ... Ben Carson" and Trump.

6) "ruled out for the first time the option of taking public financing." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f40c4bc3b6652917c048c722ecde3fe09f8e7ed8219380f02e5

TOP TALKER - USA Today 1A, above fold, "D.C. Metro warned it could be shut down: 'Scary' foul-ups cited at second-largest subway system in U.S.," by Bart Jansen: "Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx threatened Tuesday to suspend the D.C. subway if the system fails to make immediate changes to fix dangerous safety lapses. Foxx said he 'would have no hesitation to shut down the system' ... Metro employees denied federal inspectors access to a metro tunnel on Thursday following an explosion of a third-rail insulator." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f407f8a9659c3dea205497d67b607d164c165047a1f29d9dd61

SENATE SWEAT - WashPost A1, below fold, "GOP senators wriggling in once-safe seats," by Mike DeBonis in Bridgeton, Mo. (online: "Roy Blunt faces tough post-Trump reality: No seat is safe"): "Because of Trump's candidacy, ... Democrats believe they can expand their Senate map beyond the battleground states like Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio and New Hampshire to win the five seats they need. Key forecasters now think Republican incumbents in states like Arizona, North Carolina and Missouri, considered safe a year ago, are now vulnerable. ...

"It remains unclear whether Trump could lose Missouri, a state that .... Romney [won] by 10 points. But Democrats believe Blunt is vulnerable ... and have recruited a particularly potent challenger in Jason Kander, the 35-year-old Missouri secretary of state, a former Army intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan and is now waging an aggressive campaign targeting Blunt's longstanding ties to corporate interests and his party's Washington leadership.

"'If you were going to go into a lab and build out of spare politician parts what people are angry about in Washington, you would build Roy Blunt," he said." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f40e7917df9082930e912dd68bc34e154d3396c5c901486fbda

RYAN'S PLAN for Trump summit tomorrow - "Paul Ryan is stuck in a Trump trap," by Jake Sherman and Rachael Bade: "[H]e wants Trump to understand where he is coming from. Ryan wants to try to steer the party's national political dialogue ... in a better direction. He wants an open line of communication between his operation and Trump's. He isn't going to try to extract policy concessions from Trump - he understands they are unlikely to ever agree on trade or immigration - but he wants some recognition that Ryan has 247 members of the House that need to be re-elected, and they can't do so while wincing through the general election." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f401d9c2d281887fbcca63feab0b7984ca37867756bdd3f5d3a

--"Ryan sets schedule for Thursday Trump meetings," by Rachael Bade: "Trump will meet face-to-face with Speaker Paul Ryan at 9 a.m. [tomorrow] at the RNC ... Chairman Reince Priebus will sit in the meeting ... A second meeting including Ryan, Trump and a larger roster of GOP leadership will follow. Attendees will include Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), and Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.)." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f4008f7484149008e3255312951b915a8910a3e509b53a5a9e0 

CONVENTIONWATCH -- "Conservatives draw battle plans for convention fight," by Alex Isenstadt:"With some of the GOP's biggest donors financing a multimillion-dollar campaign to soften the party's stringent posture on social issues, and with Donald Trump deviating from conservatives, ... a group of Republican operatives and officials ... spearheaded by Arizona Republican National Committeeman Bruce Ash and prominent GOP attorney Jim Bopp [today will announce a project aimed at] ensuring that like-minded conservatives secure slots on the 112-member Platform Committee." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f402f33525bbebf1bcd467be8bf8661f394d23b5d6174099b15

2017 ... WashPost Style front, "'Hamilton' is coming [to Kennedy Center], but settle in for a wait," by Peter Marks: "The national touring version ... will be a part of the institution's 2017-2018 season, which begins a year from September ... [Y]ou won't be able to take the first step in guaranteeing eventual access ... until 10 a.m. May 18 [next Thu.] ... when subscriptions for the 2016-2017 Kennedy Center theater season go on sale." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f4005de23524d7c720d482aa9924ea8637ca598bd20ad639c04

SANDERS WINS WEST VIRGINIA primary last night, 51.4% to 36% ... "Clinton's primary quagmire:She's on a course to win the Democratic nomination, but still piling up losses," by Gabe Debenedetti, a birthday boy yesterday: "This wasn't the way the Democratic primary was supposed to end. Clinton may have turned her focus to presumptive ... Trump, but at the same time her campaign is forced to continue fighting a rear-guard action against Bernie Sanders, who shows no sign of surrender.

"After going dark on television for several weeks, [she] is suddenly investing in television advertisements in Kentucky [primary next Tue.] - a state that should have been in her wheelhouse.

"Deep into the primary schedule, Clinton is forced to reckon with almost weekly results highlighting her relative weaknesses with white men and young voters, and she's only gradually been able to increase her swing state travel. All the while, Trump sharpens his day-to-day critiques." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f40f0dfdc4a1aa3736fc067c3eba5c21eeba4acf70a1bd883cc

TOP TWEET: Politico's Dan Diamond (@ddiamond): "Hillary Clinton in West Virginia primary 2008: 67.0% of the vote 2016: 38.2%" Dan points out: "It's her single biggest drop in any state between 2008 and 2016 and a definite outlier - overall, she's capturing more votes in about 75% of states than she did last time."

FUN READ -- NYT A16, "Clinton Gives U.F.O. Buffs Hope She Will Open the X-Files," by Amy Chozick: "[H]er unusual knowledge about extraterrestrials that has struck a small but committed cohort of voters. Mrs. Clinton has vowed that barring any threats to national security, she would open up government files on the subject, a shift from President Obama, who typically dismisses the topic as a joke. Her position has elated U.F.O. enthusiasts, who have declared Mrs. Clinton the first 'E.T. candidate.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f4037439c649e7a45a5cbf0881dead3ddba68089b373e1a5478

 

PRESIDENT CLINTON II - N.Y. Times 1-col. lead, "CLINTON SUGGESTS GIVING MEDICARE A BUY-IN OPTION: STEPPING TO THE LEFT -- Change After Resisting a Sanders Proposal," by Alan Rappeport and Margot Sanger-Katz: "Clinton is moving to the left on health care and this week took a significant step in her opponent's direction, suggesting she would like to give people the option to buy into Medicare. ... Sanders calls his single-payer health care plan 'Medicare for all.'

"What Mrs. Clinton proposed was a sort of Medicare for more. The Medicare program covers Americans once they reach 65. Clinton's suggestion was that perhaps younger Americans, 'people 55 or 50 and up,' could voluntarily pay to join the program." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f40d3215a67c6b88e2356638b5c97a84c5a2bc11c639b37eafa

 

DEM STRATEGERY -- "Democratic focus groups reveal warning signs about Donald Trump," by WashPost's Greg Sargent: "Focus groups of swing voters have picked up some warning signs for Democrats about Donald Trump's general election candidacy: While those swing voters are willing to see Trump as a risky, divisive figure, they are not yet prepared to believe the Dem argument that Trump's policy proposals would benefit the rich ... [That] may help explain the brutal onslaught of attacks on Trump we're about to see from Democrats." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f40478f6ba89d03c29ded2510a751a0ce7e697b2628068dbf31 

 

TOP-ED - TIMOTHY O'BRIEN in Bloomberg View, "Will a President Trump Still Be the King of Debt?": "'I am allowed to change,' Donald Trump told ABC's George Stephanopoulos when queried about some of this flip-flopping. Give Trump his due, though. However inconsistent he has been on matters economic, he has been on message about his policy credentials, repeatedly telling interviewers that his financial expertise derives from a singular reality: He's the 'king of debt.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f40dabc7124b76eead6359e52363229be2a10c2575cd04ae6b7

 

SPEAKER RYAN's press secretary, AshLee Strong, emails "The Fourth Estate" with subject line "Ryan/Trump": "No, not really. You should know that Thursday's Ryan/Trump meeting is not the most important thing happening in DC this week. While it's a busy week on the political front, it also happens to be an important week on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. House Republicans this week will follow through on their promise to address the alarming opioid epidemic sweeping the nation.

"The House will vote on ... 18 bills (2 rule bills, 16 suspensions) that range from addressing opioid addiction amongst our veterans, to babies infected with this disease, to the current pain management best practices ... So while politics may have your attention right now, we hope you'll have time to review and write on this important and thoughtful action the House is about to take to tackle the disturbing opioid epidemic." Then she links to each of the 18 bills.

SHOT - Press release: "Senator John Thune, ... chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation ... asked Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to answer questions following reports that company employees actively suppressed news stories on topics of interest to politically conservative users." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f409df20df01ffc21c2b9d3f122de54f1102f0a3e2220e58170

CHASER - Adam Jentleson, deputy chief of staff to Senator Democratic Leader Harry Reid, emails reporters: "The Republican Senate refuses to hold hearings on Judge Garland, refuses to fund the President's request for Zika aid and takes the most days off of any Senate since 1956, but thinks Facebook hearings are a matter of urgent national interest. The taxpayers who pay Republican senators' salaries probably want their money back.'"

HAPPENING TODAY -- Tonight at Newseum Nights, BuzzFeed's White House correspondent Evan McMorris-Santoro interviews Sen. Al Franken for a live taping of the podcast "No One Knows Anything."6:30 to 9:30 p.m. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f409448837609bb921df5d2ea229f768e7ff952508f7d08383c

CHARLIE ROSE AWARD: "Quinnipiac University will honor Charlie Rose ... at its 23nd annual Fred Friendly First Amendment Award luncheon at 11:45 a.m. on Wednesday, June 15, at the Metropolitan Club ...

FIRST LOOK -- "The Constitutional Responsibility Project (IE) is out with a new ... ad urging Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley to fulfill his constitutional duty to hold a hearing and move forward with the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. The spot, 'Old Chuck,' begins by showing Senator Grassley in 2006 saying that 'A Supreme Court nomination isn't a forum to fight any election.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f402f041ecff67cbbb554f673baf0bac7ebdf776776ec5aef8a

VALLEY TALK -- "The Facebook Future," by The Atlantic's Derek Thompson: "Facebook so dominates the market for mobile attention that it is projected to command almost 30 percent of total display advertising revenue in the world this year. ... Facebook is a media company, but more than that, it is a utility, an integral piece of information infrastructure upon which hundreds of publishers and media companies rely to reach their audience. ... Facebook is not like a television channel. It is like something we've never really seen before: a super-powered cable operator for the mobile future." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f4022ee6c6002df71d036b12e371e3ff4199f1e37abc28f8bf7

FUTURE OF MEDIA -- "Independent Journal Review Wants to Be The YouTube For Journalists," by Washingtonian's Paul O'Donnell: "At the headquarters of his Media Group of America in Alexandria-two starkly chic brick-walled floors off King Street-[Alex] Skatell is the picture of a modern-day digital mogul, his notional beard, flapping shirttails, and courtly manner only momentarily concealing the vociferous internet idealist. ...

MEDIAWATCH -- "Pundits achieve cable-news stardom after converting into Donald Trump supporters," by WashPost's Callum Borchers: "[A] small handful of commentators - including Jeffrey Lord, Scottie Nell Hughes, Adriana Cohen and Carl Higbie ... have made defending the real estate mogul their niche and in the process made themselves hot commodities. For some of these surrogates, their previous statements don't always square with what they say on behalf of the candidate now, and it can be hard to avoid the perception that they saw an open market for Trump sympathizers and sold out. Not necessarily for money - they aren't paid by the campaign ... but for fame that could eventually lead to a
 payday." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f40aa60dfd8bd6e3f6c1eadd698419d5614880c1367fb184bca

--"Dana Milbank will fulfill a promise tomorrow and eat one of his Washington Post columns, after wrongly predicting that Trump would never win the GOP nomination.

DESSERT - "Malls get creative in their attempts to win back customers," by AP's Michael Casey in Concord, N.H.: There's "a nationwide trend by older malls to reinvent themselves - either by spending millions of dollars on extensive renovations or knocking down buildings and starting over. ... Scores of traditional malls have lost their anchor department stores ... Many have undergone multimillion-dollar facelifts that added libraries, condos and apartment units, health care facilities and, more than anything else, entertainment." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=efd11fd8adcc8f40d417616d83a897c3a6fa38b73a45f7b1ea664eb22f09e5ec

** A message from the Alzheimer's Association: Costing taxpayers $18.3 million every HOUR, Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's and more than 15 million unpaid caregivers are providing care for a loved one. Alzheimer's is a national issue, and now it's time we make it a national priority. Alzheimer's yearly cost of $236 billion will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation - an epidemic we cannot afford and shouldn't accept. While it is the only leading cause of death that can't be prevented, cured or even slowed, research and medical advancement can change that. That's why the Alzheimer's
 Association is fighting to eliminate the disease through the advancement of research and providing care and support for all affected. Learn more at www.alz.org/advocacy. **

<b>DESSERT - &quot;Malls get creative in their attempts to win back customers,&quot; by AP's Michael Casey in Concord, N.H.: </b>There's &quot;a nationwide trend by older malls to reinvent themselves - either by spending millions of dollars on extensive renovations or knocking down buildings and starting over. ...

</b> Costing taxpayers $18.3 million every HOUR, Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's and more than 15 million unpaid caregivers are providing care for a loved one. Alzheimer's is a national issue, and now it's time we make it a national priority. Alzheimer's yearly cost of $236 billion will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation - an epidemic we cannot afford and shouldn't accept. While it is the only leading cause of death that can't be prevented, cured or even slowed, research and medical advancement can change that. That's why the Alzheimer's Association is fighting to eliminate the
 disease through the advancement of research and providing care and support for all affected.
