Andrew --

In the past year, I've traveled across New Jersey, working to help =
organize Democrats and to figure out how we can undo the damage Governor =
Christie has done to our state.

Tens of thousands of people responded to our call for change. These =
conversations convinced me that if we're going to take on the political =
insiders, we're going to have to build a people-powered movement that =
energizes progressives to bring their ideas, their energy, and their =
passion for New Jersey to this campaign.

Andrew, I want to have an online discussion about how we make New Jersey =
better for all of us -- and all you need to do is go on my Facebook page =
and ask me your questions:

https://go.Murphy4NJ.com/Ask-Phil-on-Facebook

On Thursday at 2:00 p.m., I'll be live via video on Facebook to answer as =
many questions as I can about this campaign and topics such as:
=20
 -- growing the middle class with good jobs that support a family
 -- equal pay for equal work
 -- a higher minimum wage
 -- putting a college education back within the reach of anyone willing to =
work hard
 -- protecting women's health care
 -- and making every community safe from gun violence and lead poisoning

Having conversations with our fellow New Jerseyans and using new =
technologies to help empower people to get involved are going to be =
crucial to how we win this race. This campaign will never be politics as =
usual and this innovative outreach is just the start.

That's how Howard Dean and I worked together to rebuild the national =
Democratic Party from the grassroots up, and that's how President Barack =
Obama won his elections.

We're called the Garden State for a reason -- and it's about time the =
concerns and interests of the grassroots, the regular hardworking people =
of New Jersey, are put ahead of the insiders.

Go on Facebook, ask me your questions, and then remember to log back on =
Thursday at 2:00 p.m. for the live online discussion:

https://go.Murphy4NJ.com/Ask-Phil-on-Facebook

Thank you,

Phil Murphy
