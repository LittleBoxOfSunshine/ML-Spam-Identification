Good Sunday morning, and happy Mother's Day! Thank you to the priceless Moms in our life.

TRUMP to George Stephanopoulos on ABC's "This Week," re GOP: "Does it have to be unified? I'm very different than everybody else, perhaps, that's ever run for office. I actually don't think so ... I think it would be better if it were unified ... there would be something good about it. But I don't think it actually has to be unified in the traditional sense." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda140954c0b36143264ddd3f9f3640106978881ac98e8c6825348

TRUMP to Chuck Todd on "Meet the Press," re Romney: "I believe I won him, or helped him win, five states that he was going to lose in the primaries....He was ungrateful." ... On his tax plan: "Under my proposal, it's the biggest tax cut by far, of any candidate by far. But I'm not under the illusion that that's going to pass." ... On releasing his tax returns: "Remember this, I've already given my financials. And my financials show I'm worth more than $10 billion, by any stretch of the imagination. ... You don't learn much from tax returns."

SUNDAY BEST - SARAH PALIN interviewed by Jake Tapper on CNN's "State of the Union": "I think Paul Ryan is soon to be Cantored. As in Eric Cantor. His political career is over but for a miracle, because he has so disrespected the will of the people. As the leader of the GOP at the convention, certainly he is to remain neutral and for him to already come out and say who he will not support [yet] was not a wise decision of his." ...

TAPPER: "Paul Ryan is facing a challenge in the republican primary in Wisconsin. The primary is coming up August 9th. The candidate ... is Paul Nehlen. Are you planning on supporting his challenger?" PALIN: "I will do whatever I can for Paul Nehlen. This man is a hardworking guy, so in touch with the people." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda140a342a99ab2ec21de4c4b4fc6d9733a5dbf3ee1280392fd4a 

HILLARY interviewed Friday by John Dickerson in Oakland on CBS' "Face the Nation," re Trump: "Maybe he just doesn't understand that running our government is not the same as making real estate deals. ... I'm not going to run an ugly race. I am going to run a race based on issues. ... I don't really feel like I'm running against Donald Trump. I feel like I'm running for my vision of what our country can be." ... 

DICKERSON: "David Ignatius has a piece in The Washington Post ... where he suggests that Donald Trump is pulling away from U.S. commitments abroad. Is part of this campaign going to be you making the case for why the United States has to have a very active role overseas?" HILLARY: ... "I don't see Donald Trump having any kind of coherent foreign policy or theory of national security." Ignatius http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda14019d6400b56aa8c3bb1432e3c279fe57a27245624265972b9

ARTICLE OF THE DAY - "Trump consolidates control of state parties: After months of being routed by Ted Cruz, Trump is finally winning the backstage delegate game," by Kyle Cheney: "Trump vanquished his rivals at the ballot box and, for the first time, he pulled off the same feat in this weekend's delegate elections, punching tickets for dozens of allies from North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Minnesota. ... Trump's campaign also showcased a tighter relationship with party insiders, coordinated with state-party leaders to make sure pro-Trump paraphernalia littered the conventions halls, and banners reading 'Defeat Hillary! Vote Trump!' lined the rooms."

THE NARRATIVE - "A billionaire and millionaire in the year of populism," by AP's Bill Barrow in St. Clairsville, Ohio, and Catherine Lucey in Iowa: "Trump ... is worth about $4.5 billion according to Forbes, though he claims more. Forbes estimates Clinton to be worth about $45 million ... But the candidate who connects with the widest swath of 'average Americans' (median household income of about $54,000) will find the clearest path to the Oval Office." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda140c0e407fcb85895b9caf445e7f9fb1f8ee4c77303a93e0cf7

THE MAP -- L.A. Times 2-col. lead, "Can Trump turn any blue states red? To win in November, the Republican would have to redraw the electoral map," by Mark Z. Barabak in S.F. and David Lauter: "Trump says he can generate a significantly higher turnout of white blue-collar voters, boosting him in Democratic-leaning industrial states, but 'two can play that game,' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who worked for Rubio ... 'Given his incredibly derisive comments about Mexicans and other immigrants, it's reasonable to think that there would be an enormous turnout of Hispanics to stop Donald Trump,' Ayres said. If so, Nevada and Colorado - which were expected to be major battlegrounds -
 could move beyond Trump's reach. 

"So would Florida ... The 50-50 electorate [in 2000] reflected 'a Florida that's gone now,' said David Johnson, the former executive director of the state GOP. The percentage of whites in the state has declined steadily and huge immigration from economically strapped Puerto Rico has changed Florida's Latino population, once primarily Cuban, to a more Democratic-leaning electorate. In 2012, Johnson noted, ... Romney carried about 40% of the state's Latino voters and still lost to President Obama by a percentage point.

"The most likely route to a Trump victory runs through the nation's historical industrial belt, from Pennsylvania on to Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. He would probably need to win each of those states to prevail; all start in the Democratic column, save Ohio, ... perennial battleground. By emphasizing trade issues in a region that has suffered a steep decline in manufacturing jobs, Trump hopes to spur an enormous turnout of white working-class voters, attracting many who might have sat out previous elections, or voted Democratic. ...

"Trump may have to fight just to hang on in states that Republicans usually take for granted. Arizona and Georgia both have large and growing minority populations that could make them competitive ... Missouri, with one foot in the South and the other in the Midwest, is another state that Obama lost twice that Clinton might be able to put into play." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda140d306df8445f6ad3cba7352765f6d1eae8b28dab35de09277

MAUREEN DOWD on fire today -- channels next Thursday's Ryan-Trump summit -- "Who's King of the Hill, Donald Trump or Paul Ryan?": "RYAN and Donald Trump sit down ... to hash out a couple little things, like who is running the party and who is the actual Republican. 'Welcome to Washington, Donald,' Ryan says, shaking hands with the presumptuous nominee. 'Reince says you're far more gracious in private than in public [Playbook Breakfast!] and I sure hope that's true. ... [T]hanks for not calling me Lyin' Ryan.' 

"'I never use the same adjective twice,' Trump replies coolly. ... 'Pious Paul? Pompous Paul? Phony Paul? Back-Stabbing, Blindsiding Paul who hung me out to dry to protect his own presidential ambitions for 2020?'

"Ryan blanches, protesting: 'No, no, I just want us to come together with a positive vision.' 'I am positive,' Trump says, manspreading as party aides cower in the corners. ... Ryan puts on his best altar-boy demeanor, which annoys Trump. ... 'You just make our problem with Hispanics worse when you tweet a picture of yourself eating a taco bowl on Cinco de Mayo.' 'No way, Jos&eacute;,' Trump says. 'That got 80,000 retweets and 100,000 likes. Muy bueno. I have eight million Twitter followers. You have, like, one million and need two accounts to get there.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda140413147f8d8989ae115d2c311c66cc45059eddad8756bd0eb

MOOD MUSIC - Trump statement Friday: "I told Reince that I thought it was totally inappropriate what Paul Ryan said and thought it was good for me politically ... But Reince feels, and I'm okay with that, that we should meet before we go our separate ways. So I guess the meeting will take place and who knows what will happen." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda1408d98833b451a668edae7de79cdabac419758361257af6023 

RYAN'S DILEMMA -- WashPost 1-col. lead, "Right faces a 'crisis' in GOP: CONSERVATIVE CORE RESISTS TRUMP - Stalwarts look to defend values beyond election," by Bob Costa and Phil Rucker: "The moment potentially marks the closure of a historic half-century in Republican politics in which conservatives have accrued dominant influence - on Capitol Hill, in gubernatorial mansions, at think tanks, on talk radio and in the grass roots. ... Yet, by taking a stand they see as a stroke of moral clarity, conservative leaders are at risk of separating their coalition from a Republican Party in which voters coast to coast have effectively shifted the center of gravity by choosing Trump ... 

"Trump and Ryan are miles apart. Ryan is the architect of sweeping proposed changes to Medicare and Social Security; Trump has pledged not to touch either. Ryan supports a muscular foreign policy; Trump is proudly non-interventionist. Ryan champions free trade; Trump is an avowed opponent. Ryan defends religious freedom; Trump wants to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country. Ryan advocates bipartisan immigration reform and opposes mass deportation; Trump wants to build a wall at the Mexican border and deport the roughly 11 million immigrants who are living in the United States illegally. 

"Ryan and his conservative allies in elected offices nationwide still have a firm grip on the party's governing playbook and institutions. But Trump has forced a heated debate over Republican identity and whether it is synonymous with conservatism - a threat to the authority of movement conservatives." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda1405816b18a3fc4934698a55cda7031d51c4da300c5cb928027

'A combo of social media (big following), brand (celebrity figure), creativity (pithy tweets), speed/timeliness (dominating news cycles).' ... 

"For 12 consecutive years, polls have indicated that Americans believe the country is on the wrong track, and Republicans have been especially vulnerable to a political campaign like Mr. Trump's that seeks to channel voter anger." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda1407f9b24955dfcd1f361d4971a41a1dc4fb426c2626d543fd3

GUNS ON TV - "Gun violence gets more nuanced, probing coverage," by AP Television Writer Lynn Elber: "[T]he headline-driven nature of the coverage is starting to shift, with documentary filmmakers, TV networks and others attempting to reach beyond the heat and anger of the moment in search of more nuanced - and sometimes more pointed - scrutiny of a crucial American issue. With 'Armed in America,' PBS is giving over much of its prime-time schedule Monday and Tuesday to a pair of documentaries and town-hall discussions. 

"Epix's 'Under the Gun,' debuting [next Sunday] from executive producer Katie Couric and director Stephanie Soechtig, examines why those on opposite sides of stricter gun laws can't find common ground. These follow a number of other in-depth projects, including a CNN town hall debate in January in which President Barack Obama discussed his gun control measures and proposals, and HBO's 2015 'Requiem for the Dead: American Spring 2014,' which told the stories of some shooting victims from that period." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda140652a9bead8a2cf723259a45358248b57bcccb31b68e2fb6e ...

HOW WE LIVE: 'a stunning reversal of our perceptions of our region several decades ago' - WashPost Business cover, part of "The Divided American Dream" series about home ownership since the crash - "Far from the city, far from recovery: Loudoun County's distant suburbs were the D.C. area's hottest market - until nightmare commutes and a revitalized District flipped a housing switch," by Jonathan O'Connell and Kathy Orton: "From 2004 through the ... Great Recession, the values of single-family homes inside the Capital Beltway dramatically outperformed those outside it ... [W]hite-collar workers and empty-nesters are flocking to walkable and transit-accessible neighborhoods, driving up those
 home values. 

"Investing in the outer suburbs - with their abundance of spacious homes, good schools and shopping malls - was a rational bet at a time. ... The turnaround began in the District after the Metro transit system expanded and Abe Pollin built MCI Center (now Verizon Center) in Penn Quarter downtown. Mixed-use centers boomed at other Metro stations: A Target-anchored mall came to Columbia Heights, and the promise of a streetcar line drew shops and restaurants to H Street NE. Apartment and office buildings followed. ...

"In the District and its close-in environs, home values soared, with the 20002 Zip code in Northeast Washington rising 91 percent. ... The shift toward inner Washington neighborhoods mirrors those in Boston, Seattle, New York and elsewhere, which also have prospered since the recession. ... 'People pay a lot of attention these days to what their commute is going to be, where their job is located and how they are going to get to work,' said Sharon Bulova, Fairfax County Board chair since 2009." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda140584467502178f68c25469912eac5513ff22e2ea9cb69d4c6

But the candidate who connects with the widest swath of 'average Americans' (median household income of about $54,000) will find the clearest path to the Oval Office.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda140c0e407fcb85895b9caf445e7f9fb1f8ee4c77303a93e0cf7" target="_blank">http://apne.ws/274HtVT</a></p><p><b>THE MAP -- L.A. Times 2-col. lead, &quot;Can Trump turn any blue states red? 
</b>To win in November, the Republican would have to redraw the electoral map,&quot; by Mark Z. Barabak in S.F. and David Lauter: &quot;Trump says he can generate a significantly higher turnout of white blue-collar voters, boosting him in Democratic-leaning industrial states, but 'two can play that game,' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who worked for Rubio ... 'Given his incredibly derisive comments about Mexicans and other immigrants, it's reasonable to think that there would be an enormous turnout of Hispanics to stop Donald Trump,' Ayres said. If so, Nevada and Colorado - which were expected to be major battlegrounds - could move beyond Trump's reach. </p><p><b>&quot;So would Florida
</b> ... The 50-50 electorate [in 2000] reflected 'a Florida that's gone now,' said David Johnson, the former executive director of the state GOP. The percentage of whites in the state has declined steadily and huge immigration from economically strapped Puerto Rico has changed Florida's Latino population, once primarily Cuban, to a more Democratic-leaning electorate. In 2012, Johnson noted, ... Romney carried about 40% of the state's Latino voters and still lost to President Obama by a percentage point.</p><p><b>&quot;The most likely route to a Trump victory 
</b>runs through the nation's historical industrial belt, from Pennsylvania on to Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. He would probably need to win each of those states to prevail; all start in the Democratic column, save Ohio, ... perennial battleground. By emphasizing trade issues in a region that has suffered a steep decline in manufacturing jobs, Trump hopes to spur an enormous turnout of white working-class voters, attracting many who might have sat out previous elections, or voted Democratic. ...</p><p><b>&quot;Trump may have to fight 
</b>just to hang on in states that Republicans usually take for granted. Arizona and Georgia both have large and growing minority populations that could make them competitive ... Missouri, with one foot in the South and the other in the Midwest, is another state that Obama lost twice that Clinton might be able to put into play.&quot;  <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4a19791ee3dda140d306df8445f6ad3cba7352765f6d1eae8b28dab35de09277" target="_blank">http://lat.ms/1O82w3q</a><b> </b></p><p><b>--L.A.

</b>Ryan is the architect of sweeping proposed changes to Medicare and Social Security; Trump has pledged not to touch either. Ryan supports a muscular foreign policy; Trump is proudly non-interventionist. Ryan champions free trade; Trump is an avowed opponent.

<b>GUNS ON TV - &quot;Gun violence gets more nuanced, probing coverage,&quot; by AP Television Writer Lynn Elber:</b> &quot;[T]he headline-driven nature of the coverage is starting to shift, with documentary filmmakers, TV networks and others attempting to reach beyond the heat and anger of the moment in search of more nuanced - and sometimes more pointed - scrutiny of a crucial American issue. With 'Armed in America,' PBS is giving over much of its prime-time schedule Monday and Tuesday to a pair of documentaries and town-hall discussions. </p><p><b>&quot;Epix's 'Under the Gun,'
