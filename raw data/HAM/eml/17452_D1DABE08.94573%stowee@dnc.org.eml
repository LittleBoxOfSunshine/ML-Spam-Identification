Sorry for the late response and unfortunately this is an email full of
sorrys.  

Im not going to be able to make it to Vermont for your wedding next month.
I had ever intention on being there because I still consider you both really
good friends and I will never forget how much fun we had together during our
short stint at the DNC.  As you know I have been trying to transition out
for awhile and I will actually be in San Francisco the week of your wedding
for a job interview.  I just found out about the job interview yesterday and
I have figure out a way to make it work logisticallyI definitely have to
come visit you guys before I transition back to the west coast.

Congratulations again on the wedding and take lots of pictures!!
