The Democratic Party

Luis --
=20
Remember a couple months ago when we were welcoming in the
New Year? If your answer to that is "Sure, vaguely..." --
well, that makes two of us, Luis. We are 40 state primaries
and caucuses in to 2016, just 89 days away from our
convention in Philadelphia, and only a little over six
months away from the day we elect our next Democratic
President of the United States. But before then, we're
facing major deadlines, like the one coming up this
Saturday. Your donation of $3 or whatever you can today
helps prepare us for those rapidly approaching days ahead of
us:

https://my.democrats.org/April-Deadline

Those are some pretty big countdowns ahead of us, Luis.
Every last day leading up to these milestones matters
tremendously, and I'm hoping that you'll help us keep up the
momentum we need to win -- starting with our deadline this
Saturday:

https://my.democrats.org/April-Deadline

I know we ask a lot of you, Luis, and I want you to know how
much I appreciate your support. This year is moving fast,
and we can't let any opportunity to support Democrats pass us by.

All the best,
