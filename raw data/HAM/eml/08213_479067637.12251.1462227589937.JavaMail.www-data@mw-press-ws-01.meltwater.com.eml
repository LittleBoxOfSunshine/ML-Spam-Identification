<p>WASHINGTON DC =E2=80=93 With less than 24 hours until Republican voters =
go to the polls in Indiana, traders at the U.S.-based, real money political=
 prediction marketplace, PredictIt.org, <a href=3D"https://www.predictit.or=
g/Contract/1565/Will-Republicans-have-a-brokered-convention-in-2016#data">a=
re bullish</a> on not only Donald Trump winning the Hoosier State Tuesday b=
ut capturing the Republican nomination outright and avoiding a brokered Rep=
ublican National Convention.&nbsp;To date, roughly 40,000 Americans trade a=
nd invest on the PredictIt markets each week on questions ranging from the =
presidential race to key Senate races to key issues before Congress.&nbsp;<=
/p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, =E2=80=9Cyes=E2=80=9D shares in favor of a brokere=
d convention were trading at 79 cents but that number has since plummeted t=
o 11 cents while =E2=80=9Cno=E2=80=9D shares are now trading at 89 cents. S=
imilarly, traders are bullish on Trump <a href=3D"https://www.predictit.org=
/Market/1233/Who-will-win-the-2016-Republican-presidential-nomination">winn=
ing the Republican nomination</a> with Trump shares now trading at 90 cents=
 while Cruz shares are trading at just 5 cents.&nbsp;Not surprisingly, Pred=
ictIt traders are also very bullish on Trump <a href=3D"https://www.predict=
it.org/Market/2006/Who-will-win-the-Indiana-Republican-primary">delivering =
a sizeable win</a> in Indiana Tuesday night where Trump shares are trading =
at 95 cents while Cruz shares have dropped to 5 cents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>=E2=80=9CAlthough speculation over a brokered GOP convention reached a f=
ever pitch in recent weeks, it=E2=80=99s clear that PredictIt traders are b=
ullish on not only a big Trump win in Indiana Tuesday night but capturing t=
he nomination outright and avoiding a brokered convention,=E2=80=9D said Br=
andi Travis, Chief Marketing Officer at Aristotle Inc., which services <a h=
ref=3D"http://www.predictit.org/">PredictIt.org</a> in conjunction with Vic=
toria University of Wellington. =E2=80=9CThe intense trading and speculatio=
n we=E2=80=99ve seen from the thousands of Americans who invest in our mark=
etplace each week is an important reminder that Predictit offers critical r=
eal-time insight into future political events both at home and abroad.=E2=
=80=9D&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Democratic side, trader confidence in Hillary Clinton winning Ind=
iana <a href=3D"https://www.predictit.org/Market/2007/Who-will-win-the-Indi=
ana-Democratic-primary">has inched up</a> in recent days with Clinton share=
s trading at 77 cents while Sanders shares have dropped to 23 cents. &nbsp;=
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, it=E2=80=99s clear that trader confidence in Trump=E2=80=99s ab=
ility to win the Republican nomination does not translate to the general el=
ection where traders are siding with Clinton (<a href=3D"https://www.predic=
tit.org/Market/1234/Who-will-win-the-2016-US-presidential-election">62 cent=
s versus 38 cents</a>) to defeat Trump and win the presidency.&nbsp;</p>
