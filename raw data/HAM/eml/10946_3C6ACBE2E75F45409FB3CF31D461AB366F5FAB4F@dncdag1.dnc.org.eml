Stars with a prayer from a pastor who says that the US is a Christian nation.



Cruz:



-Jobs, freedom, security

-Quotes the movie Hoosiers about "two kinds of dumb"

-Eight years ago, Obama promised to bankrupt every coal-fired plant in America, and that might be just about the only campaign promise he's come close to meeting.

-Every time I visit with coal miners, the look in their eyes as the federal government is trying to destroy their lives, their livelihoods, the entire community. I give you my word, in 2017, the war on coal will end. America is the Saudi Arabia of coal and natural gas, and we're going  to get the federal government out of the way and develop our energy resources.

-We're going to stop amnesty and secure the borders and end sanctuary cities and welfare benefits for those here illegally.

-Trump has been supporting liberal Dem politicians for 40 years. I have no experience with that.

-Trump supported HRC and Obama in the position that grown men should be allowed to use the little girls' restroom. Have we gone stark raving mad? This is not a matter of left or right, Republican or Democrat. I'm the father of two young girls. This is a matter of basic commonsense. It's a bad, bad idea to allow adult grown men, strangers, to be alone in the bathroom with little girls. This is political correctness on steroids. Donald eager to join the PC police.

-The same PC police just fired Curt Schilling for exercising commonsense.

-If Donald Trump dresses up as Hillary Clinton, he still can't use the little girls' restroom. And I apologize for that image that is likely to haunt you tonight. Donald in a bright blue pantsuit, that's a bit terrifying.

-Trump would be neutral between Israel and Palestine. Anyone who can't tell the difference between Israel and Islamic terrorists who want to kill us, that raises questions about their fitness and judgment to be commander in chief.

-To ISIS: we're not coming to negotiate with you or read you your rights; we're coming to kill you.

-HRC will win by double digits if we nominate Trump. And if she wins, it means we lose the Senate, likely the House, lose the Supreme Court for a generation.

-Do we really want to turn on the television and watch two New York liberals debating the election?

-Can't wait to stand on the debate stage with HRC. Trump is utterly terrified to debate. It's been 45 days since we've had a GOP debate. The Dems have debated, they're willing to subject themselves to the people. How about we do a debate in the next ten days here in the state of Indiana? Indiana deserves a debate.

-Donald seems obsessed with demonstrating what big hands he has. Maybe he could demonstrate those hands by showing up and coming to a debate.

-The entire country is looking to Indiana.

-Of the 17 GOP candidates who started this race, 5 have endorsed this campaign.
