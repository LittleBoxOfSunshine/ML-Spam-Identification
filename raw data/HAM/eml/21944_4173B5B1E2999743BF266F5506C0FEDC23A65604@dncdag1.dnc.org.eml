Hi Lottie,

Nice to hear from you!  I'm not quite sure which information you're referring to because our finance convention packages do not yet have any information about hotels or suites (to my knowledge).  Our packages talk about "premiere hotels" and convention credentials but nothing about suites or specific hotels.  

I've added Rachel and Dan to this email as they are handling convention from the finance side in case you have more specific questions.
Claire

Hello Jordan and Claire,

I hope the weekend was all you wanted.

Will you send me information on Finance packages for the Convention. I may have the terminology wrong, however, I want information on Wells Fargo Suites, hotel rooms, etc.

Thanks,
Lottie
