House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster narrowly won his GOP primary in Pennsylvania Tuesday night, besting repeat primary challenger Art Halvorson after a campaign dominated by Shuster's relationship with an airline lobbyist.

Shuster had 52 percent of the vote to Halvorson's 48 percent when the Associated Press called the race, with 80 percent of the vote in. 

Shuster was widely expected to survive despite the controversy surrounding his romantic ties to a lobbyist representing an airline group with major interests before his committee. The eight-term incumbent took the threat seriously, though, vastly outspending Halvorson, a real estate executive who self-funded some of his campaign. But Halvorson still dragged him into a tight race, pulling Shuster near the majority line in a primary for the second consecutive election.
