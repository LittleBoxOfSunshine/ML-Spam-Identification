DNC Announces Media Partner for Flint, Michigan Debate on March 6th

WASHINGTON =96 The Democratic National Committee today announced that CNN h=
as been selected to host the first newly sanctioned Democratic presidential=
 candidates debate in Flint, Michigan. The March 6th debate will come just =
two days before the Wolverine State's March 8th primary and following news =
of the city's water crisis that has left residents exposed to toxic lead in=
 their water.

"Our Democratic candidates have run spirited campaigns focused on how to be=
st move our country forward, and our upcoming debate in Flint, Michigan is =
a critical setting to highlight what's at stake in these elections," said D=
NC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. "This debate is an opportunity to e=
levate the very serious issues facing the residents of Flint, and it's also=
 an opportunity to remind voters what Democratic leadership can do for the =
economy -- so that everyone in America has a fair shot. Viewers across the =
country deserve a thoughtful and serious debate, and that's what they'll ge=
t from our candidates, because they have the right priorities and understan=
d the struggles, hopes, and aspirations of the American people."

The DNC and CNN will announce local and social media partners in the coming=
 days to ensure that Michiganders are able to participate and engage with o=
ur candidates in this important debate. In addition to Flint, the DNC has a=
lso sanctioned and will be holding debates on March 9th in Miami, Florida w=
ith Univision and the Washington Post, and later in April and May with time=
s and locations to be determined.
