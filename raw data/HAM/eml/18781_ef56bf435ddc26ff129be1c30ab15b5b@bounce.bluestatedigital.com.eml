The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friend--

As of this week, Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee. The =
contrast between his values and the values our Democratic candidates =
defend every day could not be starker.  As Democrats, we have a lot on the =
line.  It is crucial that we push back on the backwards GOP rhetoric and =
make our voices heard this election cycle.

Please join me for a reception in Knoxville, Tennessee on Friday, June =
3rd. This is your chance to ask me questions about what the DNC is doing =
to fight back and to strategize together about how to win in November.

You can RSVP through the following link: =
https://finance.democrats.org/KnoxvilleReception

Thank you for all you do, and I look forward to seeing you in Knoxville!

Debbie
