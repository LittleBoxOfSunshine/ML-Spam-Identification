Thanks, Ruthzee. We will adjust the invite. Has WH Counsel cleared it otherwise?

Scott,

One additional edit. Let's remove the word round table on page 2 at the top ("$33,400 - Round table discussion guest").  As you know, WH policy restricts the use of language that gives the appearance that contributors can pay for policy access to the President.

Thanks,
Ruthzee
