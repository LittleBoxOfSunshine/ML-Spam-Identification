1) MAKING HER STORY: HILLARY CLINTON has no doubt. In her most plain language to date, Clinton said there is "no way" she will not be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. And she pressed her Democratic rival, BERNIE SANDERS, to unify behind her as Democrats' standard-bearer against DONALD TRUMP, POLITICO's Nick Gass reports. 

"I will be the nominee for my party, Chris," the former secretary of State told CNN's Chris Cuomo in an interview from Park Ridge, Ill. "That is already done, in effect. There's no way that I won't be." Her confidence was one thing. Equally stark, though, was her call to Sanders whom she said, "has to do his part to unify." Read more at: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=39b6624eda033ab1da72a07be6a69226bb4c32bf1b745e2ef16fb5b86b08c5e9 

TGIThursday. We don't do guarantees, we just do your 2016 Blast. Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through the day's campaign news, so send your tips, complaints and reaction to get Rick-Rolled to: hjackson@politico.com. 

2) EGYPT REACTION: The apparent act of terrorism that brought down Egyptian Air Flight 804 drew distinct reactions from the 2016 candidates. HILLARY CLINTON said it "shines a very bright light" on the threat of terror. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=ec8615196deb5cc3671e9b7d42db4830839648a9f5c74be78a8cdb3c96b711c1 DONALD TRUMP, who was notably quicker to declare the crash an act of terror, responded with indignation, via Twitter: "When will we get tough, smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness," Trump tweeted. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=ec8615196deb5cc32f28ca6718c30bda5defe0e34622fb71aff23696f75da1b1 

3) MANAFORT DESTINY: Another pair of data points as DONALD TRUMP seeks to simultaneously unify the Republican party and reorient it around him. First, Trump's newly installed top strategist, Paul Manafort, met with congressional chief of staffs, POLITICO's Burgess Everett reports. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=ec8615196deb5cc361a71d79a8c286831af4aca5a4569445aee56ac0e784ba6b And, what do you know, the list of prospective Supreme Court justices Trump released yesterday got an approving nod from current non-endorser PAUL RYAN. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=ec8615196deb5cc30fb945caa4366381ec0496c41960bba62d1c4544fa439c56 

BLAST NOTE: Be sure to check out this piece by POLITICO's Josh Gerstein on some surprising omissions from DONALD TRUMP's Supreme Court list. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=ec8615196deb5cc3e3a8a8882aa720903387737b58be947aed4799111d4b3dcb  

4) ESTABLISHMENT TRUMPED: Win or lose, many Republicans hope that DONALD TRUMP is a fleeting moment in the GOP's history. But there's already evidence that his impact will be both large and lasting, POLITICO's Kyle Cheney reports. Trump allies have drawn inspiration from his run, riding his coattails to positions of power within the Republican party, including seats on the Republican National Committee. Collectively, and they're already large enough in number to push for changes to the party. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=ec8615196deb5cc3b91bfd148d6d8560b512de9c8fcc28a68bc005b2ddfd89b1 

5) CONSOLATION PRIZE: BERNIE SANDERS could return to his old gig in the Senate with far more influence than he's ever had before, POLITICO's Burgess Everett reports. That possibility comes with a big "if," though, his colleagues say: if he lays down arms and begins the process of unifying the Democratic party. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=ec8615196deb5cc37939243332f5c83c0341d52827cb84e88c93aec05fd306b9 Everett talks to a host of senators that want him to tone down his rhetoric and are particularly frustrated by his apparent refusal to denounce rowdy supporters in Nevada. Meanwhile, Clinton allies like Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill have gone beyond subtleties into what the Blast will call an active nudging phase. They're pressing
 Sanders to get out of the race or be very clear about his intentions. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=ec8615196deb5cc3baa74f9d4528037f609b4f7095784d370e5283eded085d4c 

TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, is "Trumpism" the new conservatism? DONALD TRUMP has some interesting ideas for "The Apprentice." Elizabeth Warren's support comes at a cost. HILLARY CLINTON gets a Chicago welcome. Overzealous Trump supporters ruin a(nother) frontier of the Internet. 

WELD WIELDS: Twice elected GOP Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts is running as a Libertarian for president and has come out swinging at DONALD TRUMP. (The New York Times) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=ec8615196deb5cc38734508b2c111e0cd7f3b06764edaf42c4032e4aee1c8cf9 

UNIVERSE PROBLEM: A former Miss Universe says DONALD TRUMP called her "Miss Piggy" and ordered her to lose weight months after she won the pageant. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=83caeb1e81f70994068307162cd590d089aca1ce675dbd89abd17a5d5284ddae 

NEW ESTABLISHMENT: The Guardian looks at whether "Trumpism" is overtaking traditional conservatism in Washington. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=83caeb1e81f70994f363aaeb511aa112522d7a6e8a1bd5521bb70db2263a0eb4 

APPRENTICE STUFF: DONALD TRUMP once wanted a version of "The Apprentice" that pitted black contestants versus white contestants. NBC rejected this. (BuzzFeed) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=83caeb1e81f709943157fc09229d2cd275f666cf121e18c390bb5614031ef5c5 

BLAST NOTE: But, uh, CBS's "Survivor" totally did have a season constructed this way! http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=83caeb1e81f7099490110472a0cfae39d7e8930512a48c127a67cd2f8ac85570 

'NOT QUALIFIED': Besides expressing confidence in herself, HILLARY CLINTON gave a no confidence vote to DONALD TRUMP. She said he was "not qualified" to be President. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=83caeb1e81f70994ca51dc29e6135892039b510abfa86f0a6957181f97e828a7 

JUSTICE CRITIQUE: Deray McKesson, a leader in the Black Lives Matter movement, says HILLARY CLINTON's policies on justice do not go far enough. (BuzzFeed) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=83caeb1e81f70994b3bd7d330e70ae8a8f94213f57a15cd4774da4e3b3b42b32 

LIMITED WARREN-TY: Elizabeth Warren could help HILLARY CLINTON unite Democrats, but her politics might prove problematic for Clinton. (Los Angeles Times) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=83caeb1e81f709941db374a0dee081752e3e6c795e08a772e8734805ad1b25d8 

CHICAGO WELCOME: A mix of boos and cheers - supporters and protesters - greeted HILLARY CLINTON in Park Ridge, Ill. (Chicago Tribune) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=83caeb1e81f709947343babcee1f634385cbd9b24868266c19bf603984077a1e 

'WEINER' FOCUS: A new documentary on former congressman Anthony Weiner will be uncomfortable for his wife, top HILLARY CLINTON aide Huma Abedin. (Fortune) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=83caeb1e81f70994bb4b4395fa98543ef8a9a6b8fdfe8ea34fe1c356b35e5f9b 

AFTER BERN: An opinion piece in The Nation argues that BERNIE SANDERS is hurting himself by "playing the victim" amid DNC machinations and protests. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=83caeb1e81f709945f933012606b6f19604ca4b28edb9338d85daef3e9b9bf0f 

DEBBIE DOWNER: But most liberal pundits seem to blame DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz for the bad blood.

Swift. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5a4c1d1e231872d915294d3df19396351633ce3379ee76ad3c1602e68c73df57 And then watch an original Debbie Downer Saturday Night Live Skit. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5a4c1d1e231872d95880d18a9d54ec282f30400d519f7713e037e4ee260f1336 

GET A (SECOND) LIFE: Virtual DONALD TRUMP supporters, bearing Nazi flags no less, overran a BERNIE SANDERS stronghold on Second Life. No, seriously. (Boing Boing) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5a4c1d1e231872d9b0975aa88b401d041307e99feaba24c0d7d0070e7cdcb9bf 

WHAT'S NEXT: Candidates are focused on California. BERNIE SANDERS and Bill Clinton are both expected in San Diego this weekend. Bill Clinton also has a full day Friday: He'll be in both Dakotas and Montana. 

THEY SAID IT: "Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world." - DONALD TRUMP discussing a black vs. white concept for "The Apprentice" in 2005. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=83caeb1e81f709943157fc09229d2cd275f666cf121e18c390bb5614031ef5c5 

MAGIC NUMBER: $25 million. That's how much money the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised in the first part of 2016 - a record the committee's chairman attributes to DONALD TRUMP. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5a4c1d1e231872d9e6d4b21de0e69a635be3de2d296aa7a7ea7ddbe52bd79276
