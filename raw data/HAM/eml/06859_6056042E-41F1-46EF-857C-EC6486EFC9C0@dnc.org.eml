Hi Luis, Mark, and Walker,

Just writing to let you know that I'm not feeling too well this AM, so I'm going to see the doctor. Will make my way to the office afterwards.

In terms of what I have going today, the main thing is the Orange County release. Still waiting to get confirmation from reporter that it'll get written up, but it's looking good. Also, the press conference in Washington state last Friday went very well. Sent coverage around on Saturday.

-Walter
