Good Tuesday morning. DRIVING THE DAY -- "Trump closes out Indiana by looking past it ... pivots to Hillary," by Ben Schreckinger in South Bend: "Trump is over this primary. On the eve of [today's] Indiana's vote, with polls showing him well ahead of Ted Cruz, Trump spent his final day of campaigning here ... touting general election polling, lunching with [Ed Klein, the author of books that repeat salacious allegations against Bill and Hillary Clinton] ...

"[Trump said in South Bend:] 'Women are looking for security in our country and they know I'm going to do the best job ... When they called her on Benghazi she was sleeping, folks.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009ed8b34a090198b6efa9df94ada01dfe52f9d79cce886ef733

 

--"Letter from Indiana" for Politico Magazine, "How Ted Cruz Got Indiana Wrong: The only problem with Cruz's socially conservative message? The voters he has to win over ... don't like it," by Adam Wren, Indianapolis Monthly contributing editor: "[T]here are signs that Trump is taking his ground game ... more seriously ... After the New England primaries, the campaign shifted 20 additional paid staffers to the state, doubling its operation.

"Over the weekend, ... [Trump's] campaign was on track to knock on 70,000 doors. 'We have a ground game that is second to none,' Rick Wiley, Trump's national political director, told me." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009ee859cbe5dab8bd61173e4c6354ceb456c489a2c57ef50b41

 

THE FALL FORETOLD ... Trump yesterday at rally in Carmel, Ind.: "[H]onestly, if we win Indiana, it's over. It's over. (APPLAUSE) They're finished. They're gone. ... I will promise you one thing. We will be the smart country from now on, not the dummies, OK? Not the dummies, because this is a movement that's going on. (APPLAUSE) ... We have a movement going on the likes of which this country has never seen they say. Time Magazine -- many covers of what's going on with the movement. I'm the messenger. This is the movement, and it's a movement like we've never ... like they've never seen. ...

 

"[N]ow, I'm going to start focusing on Hillary. That's going to be so easy, it's going to be so great. It's going to be so great. (APPLAUSE) Bad judgment. Crooked Hillary, remember? Crooked Hillary. Bad judgment. I didn't say it ... [I]t was said by Bernie ... [C]an I take heat if Bernie said it? So here's the story. Bernie said bad judgment, and it's true.

"Look at the e-mail scandal. That's bad judgment. You'd almost say: What is the purpose of doing it? It's just her. It's bad, bad judgment. It's also criminal, by the way, and a lot of bad things should happen. But we'll find out. We'll find out. It's a very criminal act. A lot of people have suffered greatly for doing much less."

 

--WashPost 2-col. lead, "Trump bid raises prospect of nasty general election: MOGUL LIKELY TO REMAIN OUTSPOKEN - Democrats learn from GOP field's pulled punches," by Dan Balz: Dan "Pfeiffer said ... aspects of Trump's message ... could appeal beyond the Republican base. 'If you take out his positions on immigration and women, he has the most pure, economic-populist reform message. He's got the best Republican message we've seen in a long time. Anti-trade, anti-Wall Street, anti-big-money-in-politics is very powerful.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009e806ee46d87dd824f18343a0705ada5505d5e679369140245

 

YOU'RE INVITED! Playbook Breakfast with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus on FRIDAY. Doors at 7:30 a.m.; program at 8 at Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill, 400 New Jersey Ave. NW. RSVP http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009e95c8fc5dbd5930678b96fe29facd2916c5fb4be82867a3ab

 

INSIDE THE CAMPAIGNS -- "Trump far behind in preparing for general election," by AP's Steve Peoples and Jill Colvin: "Trump has so far ignored vital preparations ... has collected little information about tens of millions of voters he needs to turn out in the fall. He's sent few people to battleground states compared with ... Clinton, accumulated little if any research on her, and taken no steps to build a network capable of raising the roughly $1 billion needed to run a modern-day general election campaign. ...

"[T]he billionaire's aides [said] they'll tap into the resources of the party's establishment - the [RNC], above all ... That's even as he rails daily against his party's establishment as corrupt." With cameos from Ryan Williams, Corey, Sean Spicer http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009e40b08cc2268e73063696704137dd0eaed1abe87b5d0a3c67

TRUMP EXPANDS MAP - "Once a Clinton stronghold, Appalachia now Trump country," by AP's Lisa Lerer in Ashland Ky., with Catherine Lucey in Des Moines: "Her husband won the White House in 1992 by wooing Southern swing voters in places such as Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennessee ... Trump ... could pose a threat to Clinton not only in the coal mining communities of Appalachia ... but also in parts of the Rust Belt and upper Midwest hit hard by the decline of domestic manufacturing. ...

"Democrats have lost support in Appalachia as the region has shed jobs in industries such as coal mining and as union membership has declined ... The leftward shift of the Democratic Party during the Obama administration on social issues, including gay marriage and gun control, hasn't helped."

 

--BUT, BUT, BUT ... "Trump may afford [Clinton] new opportunities to expand what's known as the Obama coalition: her aides calculate the billionaire's penchant for controversy could lead her to enough support among minority and female voters to put traditionally Republican-leaning states such as Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona into play." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009e73bb7c00989d37c531fb8e404ce848f7bc3738019955f6aa

CANDIDATE LINGO - Ben Terris on WashPost Style front, "There ain't no cure for the wonky talk blues": "'Tonight,' Cruz intoned, ... 'this campaign moves back to more favorable terrain!' ... This is strategist-speak ... It used to be that only staffers spoke this way: jargon-filled playbookese, such as the non-basketball use of the word 'pivot' and non-transportation use of the word 'lane.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009e1d614fdd2bc6ad458df125de26a03d9fa9a5c7495e31ae37

 

DEM DRAMA -- Chris Krueger of Guggenheim Partners in his "D.C. Download": "Cancel my subscription to the resurrection - send my credentials to the House of Detention. We expect ... Trump winning all of Indiana's 57 delegates and becoming the defacto nominee ... increasing pressure on Bernie Sanders to drop out of the race given Hillary Clinton's insurmountable Super Delegate lead ... The GOP race should be pretty much over after Indiana, though the Democratic race will continue as Sanders is calling for a Contested Convention in Philadelphia over the Super Delegate issue/system.

"Barring a legal pitfall, Clinton is the nominee, though the Clinton campaign - and the Democratic Party - will need the support of the 74 year-old Socialist, his millennial hordes, and his internet fundraising money machine. So the GOP endgame is now set as the Democratic end game may have to wait for July 24 in Philadelphia."

 

RAW VOTES undercut Sanders claim - AP's Ken Thomas and Hope Yen: "Clinton ... has an edge of roughly 3 million raw votes. Clinton has received more than 12.2 million votes in primaries and caucuses to date, compared with 9.1 million for Sanders. Those numbers do not include Iowa, Nevada, Maine, Alaska, Washington and Wyoming - caucus states where the AP tabulated delegate equivalents, not raw votes. Sanders won four of those six states." "Q&A: Sanders' long-shot bid to clinch Democratic nomination" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009e344dde93a9640be6ec5348d4ab64a095bf11c96b7cd3d99b

 

PRESIDENT CLINTON II - WashPost A1, above fold, "Can Clinton make good on immigration, guns?Promises on trail will require difficult fights on two fronts if she wins," by Anne Gearan and Paul Kane: "Without a dramatic Democratic sweep of Congress, few ... believe that either of these giant promises has a chance in January. ... Clinton is campaigning as the candidate of continuity - preserving what Democrats generally see as President Obama's gains and making changes on his domestic agenda only at the margins. ...

"Clinton and her allies in and out of Congress are gradually building a legislative agenda that would focus on immigration issues in Congress while mostly relying on the executive power of the presidency to further gun restrictions." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009e0f1c7e2a67d7c02bb07e532c3e6b1858975e2f1cb96de497

--N.Y. Times 1-col. lead, "TRUMP IS FAVORED IN INDIANA VOTE; CRUZ DRIVES HARD: CLEARER PATH FORWARD -- Loss Today Could Break Resistance to G.O.P. Front-Runner," by Alex Burns: "Marist College for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal found Mr. Trump leading Mr. Cruz by 15 points there, and close to capturing an outright majority of the vote. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio was in a distant third place." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009e022165a41144bfcd8846e63bf733b9b869fcf3ef11c68ac4

 

TIMELINE FOR TONIGHT - AP's Nancy Benac: "Polls close at 6 p.m. EDT in 80 of Indiana's 92 counties, and at 7 p.m. EDT in the rest of the state. So the vote count will have been under way for an hour in most of the state by 7 p.m., the earliest that a winner can be declared in either primary. In 2012, half the vote had been reported by 8 p.m., and 95 percent by 10 p.m. Four years earlier, half the votes were counted before 9 p.m. but the state didn't get to 90 percent until nearly 1 a.m." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009ed611b17fa0b0af8577d0c1225f45e3d64fcb77de1080b709

MONEY HONEYS - L.A. Times A1, below fold, "Cruz's wealthy donors like to follow the money: The campaign learns the risks of relying on strong-willed tycoons," by Joseph Tanfani and Noah Bierman: "[M]agnates ... demanded an unprecedented level of control in how their money is spent. One of the three primary donors to Cruz's presidential efforts, a private equity manager who recruited the other two top donors, has refrained from spending the vast majority of his $10 million contribution to bolster the Cruz campaign. He is instead fighting openly with the top strategist for the super PACs ... set up to spend the money." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009e1114a709935efa872e6b5bf3c5e858e972f68071609db598

RE/CODE Decode podcast with Kara Swisher, whose interview with ex-Texas State Senator Wendy Davis included sexism in politics: "I certainly felt the sting of gender inequity, and yet when I was asked by the press, 'Do you feel like you're being treated differently because you're a women?' I answered, 'No.' And I answered 'no' because I was afraid of coming across as a victim. If I could go back and do it differently, I would." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=822c5b1f0b9c009e1ad2066848e718e786486ccf608ea936c2399cc6040d7d23
