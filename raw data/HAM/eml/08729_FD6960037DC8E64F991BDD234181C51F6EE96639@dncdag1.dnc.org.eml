Gov. Inslee tells Trump "Your hate is not welcome in our state"<http://www.king5.com/news/local/gov-inslee-tells-trump-your-hate-is-not-welcome-in-our-state/178456625>
Natalie Brand, KING 5 News

Governor Jay Inslee and other Washington Democratic leaders took aim at Donald Trump on the eve of his Washington visit.

"Your hate is not welcome in our state," said the Governor at a news conference Friday afternoon held at El Centro de la Raza.

"Donald Trump is running a dangerous campaign. He's putting forward dangerous policy proposals, and his dangerous rhetoric is actively harming families today in the state of Washington," he continued.

Governor Inslee was joined by Congressman Adam Smith (D-9th District), along with Hispanic and Muslim community leaders across Seattle.

"If he's coming to Washington State, we need to stand up and say we don't want him here, we don't want his hate speech anywhere in the United States of America," said Rep. Smith.

"Your hate speech is a crime against our children," said Estela Ortega, Executive Director of El Centro de la Raza.

"I think what you have to understand is the source. These are people who don't want a Republican for President," said State Senator Don Benton of Vancouver, Donald Trump's State Chair.

Washington State Republican Party Chairman Susan Hutchison accused Governor Inslee of "pandering to his base."

"He never has and never will support the citizens of this state who want to destroy ISIS and fix our economy," says Hutchison.

Chairman Hutchison plans to attend Trump's Spokane rally Saturday afternoon, and possibly the Lynden event as well.

So does Fernando Mejia, but to protest outside.

Mejia estimates dozens, if not hundreds, of people from King County plan to make the trip north for what they hope will be a peaceful demonstration.

"In some ways we want to engage with people who are planning on going to see Donald Trump and have a dialogue, why do they want to support Donald Trump when he's dividing the country," says Mejia.

"We want to keep it super peaceful. At the end of the day, we're a country of immigrants and refugees and that's the message I want to send," he said.

Demonstrators scheduled a "peacekeeping" training Friday evening to learn how to de-escalate tense situations.

Meanwhile, the campaign is working with secret service, local police and sheriff's agencies to keep the area around the fairgrounds safe.

"We're going to work with our local law enforcement to create a secure environment that will allow people who want to protest peacefully to have their say, but also make sure that we're taking care of the security of people who want to hear Donald Trump speak," said State Senator Doug Ericksen (R-Ferndale), working on behalf of the Trump campaign.

Gov. Inslee on Trump: 'Your hate is not welcome in our state'<http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/gov-inslee-community-leaders-talk-about-trump-campaign/265921543>
by: KIRO 7 Webstaff and The Associated Press

A day before presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump's scheduled campaign stops in Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee joined U.S. Rep Adam Smith and community leaders to denounce the candidate's rhetoric as dangerous for women and minorities.

During the news conference streamed live on kiro7.com, Inslee said, "So if you're watching this show right now, hear this: Your hate is not welcome in our state."

At the news conference, Inslee also said Trump does not share the values of Washington state, such as "compassion, empathy, inclusion and diversity," and his visit to Washington prompted him to speak out against the businessman.

"We are going to reject a candidate whose fundamental message is fear and hatred," he said.

Trump is scheduled to appear in Lynden Saturday at the Northwest Washington Fair. Click here to learn more and what to expect<http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/trump-in-washington-event-details-still-unclear/263535337>.

He is also scheduled to make a stop in Spokane.

Leaders from the Hispanic, Muslim and other communities stood alongside Inslee at the press conference in North Beacon Hill at El Centro de la Raza in the 2500 block of 16th Avenue South. Speakers highlighted how they believe Trump's rhetoric dangerously affects Washington state families.

"Throughout his campaign, [Trump] has made sexist, Islamophobic, and xenophobic statement that have caused undue hardship to those affected communities and has put forward discriminatory policies that are deeply inconsistent with Washington state's values," a Friday press release reads.

U.S Senator Patty Murray released a statement about Trump's visit to Washington on Thursday.

"With him, Trump will bring hatred," Murray writes. "He'll bring a violent rhetoric that stokes the fears of American families and seeks to divide us at every turn."

Voters in Eugene, Oregon are also staging a protest against Trump, The Oregonian says<http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/05/drumpf_in_eugene_counter-prote.html>.

The event, called "Drumpf in Eugene: Non-Violent Counter-Protest #DumpTrump", is scheduled for 5 p.m. Friday, according to a Facebook notice<https://www.facebook.com/events/256534374698291/257039801314415/>.



Governor, community groups denounce Trump ahead of his visit to state<http://q13fox.com/2016/05/06/governor-community-groups-denounce-donald-trump/>
by Andrew Padula<http://q13fox.com/author/apadula76/>, Q13 FOX

Gov. Jay Inslee, joined community leaders on Friday to denounce Donald Trump, saying he's a dangerous for women, minorities and families.

Inslee and several groups gathered at El Centro de la Raza, a community center that advocates for social justice. They voiced their concern about Trump's policies and what they call hateful rhetoric.

"Donald Trump, you will not be allowed to fan the flames of hatred and fear in our state," Inslee said at the media event Friday.

The governor joined members of the Hispanic and Muslim community, as well as other Democratic Party leaders, to denounce the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.

"We are a loving country. We can be and have been a united country but Donald Trump is a divider and he is someone who is running his entire campaign on division and hatred," said David Rolf, president of the Service Employees Interantional Union Local 775.

They said they believe Trump's views fuel fear in Americans and create more hate between people. If Trump becomes president, they say, he'll set America back decades.

"Washington moms are disgusted, dismayed and we know that Washingtonians would never, ever elect a president who divides us instead of bringing us together," said Kristin Rowe Finkbeiner with the group Mom's Rising.

"We know that unity is what will get us through. We know we'll vote for our families. We will vote for American values and we won't stand to see our communities torn apart. We are stronger when we stand together and we are standing against Donald Trump," said Yasmin Christopher with the organization One America Votes.

Many of the groups plan to protest Trump's visit to Lynden on Saturday. They said there are already about 50 to 100 people planning to make the 95-mile drive north to Lynden to protest Trump.



Plans for Trump rally in Western Washington get chilly reception<http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/plans-for-trump-rally-in-western-wash-get-chilly-reception/>
Jim Brunner<http://www.seattletimes.com/author/jim-brunner/>, Seattle Times

While thousands of supporters of Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump snatched up tickets<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/schedule/register/lynden-washington/> to a pair of planned rallies Saturday, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and other critics rolled out the unwelcome mat.

In his first campaign trip to Washington, Trump is scheduled to speak at noon in Spokane and at 3 p.m. in Lynden, Whatcom County - a town of about 13,000 near the Canadian border.

The arrival of the New York billionaire ahead of the May 24 presidential primary<http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/a-primer-on-the-primary-ballot/> had law enforcement scrambling to plan security. Protests at a Trump rally in California last week turned violent after some demonstrators reportedly threw rocks<http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-gays-for-trump-crowd-gathers-at-costa-mesa-rally-20160428-story.html> and stomped on cars outside the arena.
State Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, a state leader for the Trump campaign, said he hopes that won't be repeated here.

"I'm optimistic that the people of Washington state can show we're different. Trump supporters should have a right to hear Trump," he said.

But Inslee, a Democrat, joined other critics Friday at Seattle's El Centro de la Raza, a Beacon Hill community center, to denounce Trump's rhetoric as offensive and out of step with the values of Washington state.

During a news conference with groups representing women, immigrants, Muslims and others, Inslee called Trump dangerous and likened him to a schoolyard bully compensating for his own insecurities.

"I know that Mr. Trump is a millionaire with a million insecurities," Inslee said. "If you are watching this show right now, hear this: Your hate is not welcome in our state."

Attendees at the news conference accused Trump of emboldening racists with his rhetoric and proposals such as a temporary ban<http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/> on Muslims entering the country.

Varisha Kahn, a student at the University of Washington, said she is a proud Muslim American who has experienced threats herself, including a brick thrown through the window of a local mosque.

"Hate speech leads to hate crimes," she said.

Trump's Lynden rally is scheduled to be held outdoors at the Northwest Washington Fair and Event Center<http://nwwafair.com/>, with a capacity of about 5,000 people. While Lynden is relatively small, it is not far from the college town of Bellingham - and protesters from Seattle and elsewhere were making plans to head up Interstate 5.

Authorities in Whatcom County were advising anyone going to the event to heed security requirements.

No firearms, knives of any size, umbrellas, signs, banners or tripods will be allowed at the rally, the Whatcom County Sheriff's Office said in a news release.

The Sheriff's Office said attendees will be required to walk through a screening device similar to those for airport security. Large bags are prohibited and small bags could be searched.

"A good rule of thumb to follow: Do not bring any items to the event that would not be allowed through screening at an airport checkpoint," the Sheriff's Office said.
The Sheriff's Office said it is "not allowed" to release specific information about planned security, but said the Secret Service is assisting, as is Homeland Security, Lynden police and the Washington State Patrol.

"We hope those who attend or are in the area during rallies will do their part to ensure civility defines our actions," the Sheriff's Office said.

It also urged people to arrive early and to expect heavy traffic and trouble with parking.

Seattleites bound for the rally may have an especially difficult time getting through Marysville, where the Washington Department of Transportation says Interstate 5 will be limited to two lanes on Saturday for construction at the Ebey Slough Bridge<http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/projects/i5/unionsteamboatebeybridgerpr/>.

The fact that Trump skipped the Seattle area in favor of a more remote locale was greeted as a win by Nicole Grant, executive secretary-treasurer of the M.L. King County Labor Council, one of the groups that vowed major protests if Trump tried to speak in the area.

"We feel good. There is not going to be a Donald Trump rally in King County. He saw that the well was poisoned," Grant said.

Trump campaign officials say they were not intimidated at all and did try to organize an event in a hangar at Seattle's Boeing Field - but that the plan fell through.

Ericksen said "we had it all lined up" but could not get the required permit from King County, leaving him scrambling to nail down the alternate location.

County officials said there was no unfair treatment.

Frank Abe, a spokesman for the King County transportation department, said Ericksen had been talking with a private tenant at the airport about holding his rally in a hangar.

Abe said the tenant was reminded that a detailed security and parking plan was required for nonaviation uses of the airport. Such a plan was never submitted to airport officials, he said.

Airport Director Randall Berg said the county's actions were "absolutely not" politically motivated.

Berg said a planned rally of that size is unprecedented on the east side of the airfield and would have been a big logistical problem - even before considering possible protests outside. He said the tenant, whom he said did not want to be identified, ultimately agreed and did not formally seek a permit.

Ericksen said he also explored Paine Field in Everett but was unable to agree on terms there.

A contract to use the fairgrounds in Lynden was finalized Thursday night.

Ericksen shrugged off the challenges. "Lynden is nicer than Seattle," he said.



Gov. Inslee's plan to 'keep Trump out didn't work'<http://mynorthwest.com/285777/inslee-joins-anti-trump-conference-on-eve-of-washington-visit/>
By Dyer Oxley<http://mynorthwest.com/author/richard-d-oxley/>, MyNorthwest.com Writer

Washington state Governor Jay Inslee joined a press conference Friday afternoon - along with minority groups - in opposition of Donald Trump's visit to the state in order to "denounce" the presumptive Republican nominee for president.

"My plan to build a wall around Washington to keep Trump out didn't work. And I couldn't get Oregon to pay for it," Inslee said at the opening of the press conference.

Inslee was also joined by Congressman Adam Smith.

Trump will make two stops in Washington on Saturday, May 7 - one in Spokane and another in Lynden. Organizations representing Hispanic, Muslims and other communities will take part in the press conference to highlight "how dangerous Donald Trump's hateful rhetoric has been to families across Washington state," according to a press release.

Inslee joins Yasmin Christopher, a board member of One America Votes; Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, executive director of Moms Rising; Esela Ortega, executive director of El Centro de la Raza; David Rolf, president of SEIU 775; and Varisha Khan, a student at the University of Washington.

The press release for the press conference states:

Earlier this week, Donald Trump locked up the Republican Presidential nomination. Throughout his campaign, he has made sexist, Islamophobic, and xenophobic statements that have caused undue hardship to those affected communities and has put forward discriminatory policies that are deeply inconsistent with Washington state's values.

The press release was promoted through the Washington State Democrats communications department.

Inslee denounces Trump ahead of rallies in Washington
http://m.seattlepi.com/news/article/Inslee-denounces-Trump-ahead-of-rallies-in-7406497.php?cmpid=twittersocialflow

SEATTLE (AP) - A day before presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump<safari-reader://m.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&channel=news&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Donald+J.+Trump%22>'s scheduled campaign stops in Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee<safari-reader://m.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&channel=news&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Jay+Inslee%22> joined U.S. Rep. Adam Smith<safari-reader://m.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&channel=news&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Adam+Smith%22> and community leaders to denounce the candidate's rhetoric as dangerous for women and minorities.

At a Friday news conference in Seattle, Inslee said Trump does not share the values of Washington state, such as "compassion, empathy, inclusion and diversity," and his visit to Washington prompted him to speak out against the businessman.

"We are going to reject a candidate whose fundamental message is fear and hatred," he said.

Trump has two rallies planned in the state on Saturday, but neither will be near liberal Seattle. His first stop is in Spokane at 12 p.m., followed by a 3 p.m. event in Lynden, Whatcom County, just miles from Canadian border.

Inslee is a Democrat, but some Republicans in the state have also criticized Trump, including U.S. Senate<safari-reader://m.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&channel=news&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22U.S.+Senate%22>candidate Chris Vance<safari-reader://m.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&channel=news&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Chris+Vance%22>. Vance is running against incumbent U.S. Sen. Patty Murray<safari-reader://m.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&channel=news&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Patty+Murray%22>and said on Thursday he would vote for John Kasich<safari-reader://m.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&channel=news&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22John+Kasich%22> in Washington's presidential primary on May 24. Kasich dropped out of the presidential race Wednesday.

Estela Ortega<safari-reader://m.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&channel=news&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Estela+Ortega%22>, the executive director of El Centro de la Raza, a community center in the city's Beacon Hill neighborhood where the Friday news conference was held, said Trump's rhetoric is making Hispanic and Muslim children afraid to attend school for fear of backlash. The center advocates for Latinos and social justice.

"Donald Trump's shameful bigotry, stereotyping and scapegoating, his attack on the character of millions of people is not welcome in Washington State," she said, backed by supporters and signs that read "love trumps hate in Washington."

Trump has proposed a ban on all Muslims from entering the U.S. and says he hopes to build a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico if elected.

Republican state Sen. Doug Ericksen<safari-reader://m.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&channel=news&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Doug+Ericksen%22>, who is backing Trump, said Inslee calling Trump's rhetoric harmful for women and minorities is "a ridiculous statement," adding Inslee's economic policies are hurting people in Washington, not Trump's language on the campaign trail.

Ericksen is managing Trump's rally in Lynden and is from nearby Ferndale. He said Trump "respects all people," and is working to support blue collar Washingtonians in the manufacturing business, enforce the country's borders and more.

<div>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Governor Jay Inslee and other Washington Democratic leaders took aim at Donald Trump on the eve of his Washington visit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;Your hate is not welcome in our state,&#8221; said the Governor at a news conference Friday afternoon held at El Centro de la Raza.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;Donald Trump is running a dangerous campaign. He&#8217;s putting forward dangerous policy proposals, and his dangerous rhetoric is actively harming families today in the state of Washington,&#8221; he continued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Governor Inslee was joined by Congressman Adam Smith (D-9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;District), along with Hispanic and Muslim community leaders across Seattle.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;If he&#8217;s coming to Washington State, we need to stand up and say we don&#8217;t want him here, we don&#8217;t want his hate speech anywhere in the United States of America,&#8221; said Rep. Smith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;Your hate speech is a crime against our children,&#8221; said Estela Ortega, Executive Director of El Centro de la Raza.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;I think what you have to understand is the source. These are people who don't want a Republican for President,&#8221; said State Senator Don Benton of Vancouver, Donald Trump&#8217;s State Chair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Washington State Republican Party Chairman Susan Hutchison accused Governor&nbsp;Inslee of &#8220;pandering to his base.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;He never has and never will support the citizens of this state who want to destroy ISIS and fix our economy,&#8221; says Hutchison.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Chairman Hutchison plans to attend Trump&#8217;s Spokane rally Saturday afternoon, and possibly the Lynden event as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">So does Fernando Mejia, but to protest outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Mejia estimates dozens, if not hundreds, of people from King County plan to make the trip north for what they hope will be a peaceful demonstration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;In some ways we want to engage with people who are planning on going to see Donald Trump and have a dialogue, why do they want to support Donald Trump when he&#8217;s dividing the country,&#8221; says Mejia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;We want to keep it super peaceful. At the end of the day, we&#8217;re a country of immigrants and refugees and that&#8217;s the message I want to send,&#8221; he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Demonstrators scheduled a &#8220;peacekeeping&#8221; training Friday evening to learn how to de-escalate tense situations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Meanwhile, the campaign is working with secret service, local police and sheriff&#8217;s agencies to keep the area around the fairgrounds safe. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;We&#8217;re going to work with our local law enforcement to create a secure environment that will allow people who want to protest peacefully to have their say, but also make sure that we&#8217;re taking care of the security
 of people who want to hear Donald Trump speak,&#8221; said State Senator Doug Ericksen (R-Ferndale), working on behalf of the Trump campaign.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">A day before presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump's scheduled campaign stops in&nbsp;Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee joined U.S. Rep Adam Smith and community leaders to denounce the candidate's rhetoric
 as dangerous for women and minorities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">During the news conference&nbsp;streamed live on kiro7.com, Inslee said, &#8220;So if you&#8217;re watching this show right now, hear this: Your hate is not welcome in our state.&#8221;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">At the news conference, Inslee also said Trump does not share the values of&nbsp;Washington&nbsp;state, such as &quot;compassion, empathy, inclusion and diversity,&quot; and his visit to&nbsp;Washington&nbsp;prompted him to speak out against
 the businessman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&quot;We are going to reject a candidate whose fundamental message is fear and hatred,&quot; he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Trump is scheduled to appear in&nbsp;Lynden&nbsp;Saturday at the Northwest Washington Fair.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/trump-in-washington-event-details-still-unclear/263535337">Click here to learn more and

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Leaders from the Hispanic, Muslim and other communities stood alongside&nbsp;Inslee&nbsp;at the press conference in North Beacon Hill at El Centro de la&nbsp;Raza&nbsp;in the 2500 block of&nbsp;16<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Avenue South.&nbsp;Speakers highlighted
 how they believe Trump&#8217;s rhetoric dangerously affects Washington state families.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;Throughout his campaign, [Trump] has made sexist,&nbsp;Islamophobic, and xenophobic statement that have caused undue hardship to those affected communities and has put forward discriminatory policies that are deeply
 inconsistent with Washington state&#8217;s values,&#8221; a Friday press release reads.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">U.S Senator Patty Murray released a statement about Trump&#8217;s visit to Washington on Thursday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;With him, Trump will bring hatred,&#8221; Murray writes. &#8220;He&#8217;ll bring a violent rhetoric that stokes the fears of American families and seeks to divide us at every turn.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Voters in Eugene, Oregon are also staging a protest against Trump,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/05/drumpf_in_eugene_counter-prote.html" target="_blank">The&nbsp;Oregonian&nbsp;says</a>.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Inslee and several groups gathered at El Centro de la Raza, a community center that advocates for social justice. They voiced their concern about Trump&#8217;s policies and what they call hateful rhetoric.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;Donald Trump, you will not be allowed to fan the flames of hatred and fear in our state,&#8221; Inslee said at the media event Friday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">The governor joined members of the Hispanic and Muslim community, as well as other Democratic Party leaders, to denounce the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;We are a loving country. We can be and have been a united country but Donald Trump is a divider and he is someone who is running his entire campaign on division and hatred,&#8221; said David Rolf, president of the Service
 Employees Interantional Union Local 775.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">They said they believe Trump&#8217;s views fuel fear in Americans and create more hate between people. If Trump becomes president, they say, he&#8217;ll set America back decades.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;Washington moms are disgusted, dismayed and we know that Washingtonians would never, ever elect a president who divides us instead of bringing us together,&#8221; said Kristin Rowe Finkbeiner with the group Mom&#8217;s Rising.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;We know that unity is what will get us through. We know we&#8217;ll vote for our families. We will vote for American values and we won&#8217;t stand to see our communities torn apart. We are stronger when we stand together
 and we are standing against Donald Trump,&#8221; said Yasmin Christopher with the organization One America Votes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Many of the groups plan to protest Trump's visit to Lynden on Saturday. They said there are already about 50 to 100 people planning to make the 95-mile drive north to Lynden to protest Trump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tickets</a> to a pair of planned rallies Saturday, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and other critics rolled out the unwelcome mat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">In his first campaign trip to Washington, Trump is scheduled to speak at noon in Spokane and at 3 p.m. in Lynden, Whatcom County &#8212; a town of about 13,000 near the Canadian border.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">State Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, a state leader for the Trump campaign, said he hopes that won&#8217;t be repeated here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;I&#8217;m optimistic that the people of Washington state can show we&#8217;re different. Trump supporters should have a right to hear Trump,&#8221; he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">But Inslee, a Democrat, joined other critics Friday at Seattle&#8217;s El Centro de la Raza, a Beacon Hill community center, to denounce Trump&#8217;s rhetoric as offensive and out of step with the values of Washington state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">During a news conference with groups representing women, immigrants, Muslims and others, Inslee called Trump dangerous and likened him to a schoolyard bully compensating for his own insecurities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;I know that Mr. Trump is a millionaire with a million insecurities,&#8221; Inslee said. &#8220;If you are watching this show right now, hear this: Your hate is not welcome in our state.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Attendees at the news conference accused Trump of emboldening racists with his rhetoric and proposals such as a temporary
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/" target="_blank">
ban</a> on Muslims entering the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Varisha Kahn, a student at the University of Washington, said she is a proud Muslim American who has experienced threats herself, including a brick thrown through the window of a local mosque.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;Hate speech leads to hate crimes,&#8221; she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Trump&#8217;s Lynden rally is scheduled to be held outdoors at the
<a href="http://nwwafair.com/" target="_blank">Northwest Washington Fair and Event Center</a>, with a capacity of about 5,000 people. While Lynden is relatively small, it is not far from the college town of Bellingham &#8212; and protesters from Seattle and elsewhere

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Authorities in Whatcom County were advising anyone going to the event to heed security requirements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">No firearms, knives of any size, umbrellas, signs, banners or tripods will be allowed at the rally, the Whatcom County Sheriff&#8217;s Office said in a news release.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">The Sheriff&#8217;s Office said attendees will be required to walk through a screening device similar to those for airport security. Large bags are prohibited and small bags could be searched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;A good rule of thumb to follow: Do not bring any items to the event that would not be allowed through screening at an airport checkpoint,&#8221; the Sheriff&#8217;s Office said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">The Sheriff&#8217;s Office said it is &#8220;not allowed&#8221; to release specific information about planned security, but said the Secret Service is assisting, as is Homeland Security, Lynden police and the Washington
 State Patrol.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">It also urged people to arrive early and to expect heavy traffic and trouble with parking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Seattleites bound for the rally may have an especially difficult time getting through Marysville, where the Washington Department of Transportation says Interstate 5 will be limited to two lanes on Saturday for
<a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/projects/i5/unionsteamboatebeybridgerpr/" target="_blank">
construction at the Ebey Slough Bridge</a>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">The fact that Trump skipped the Seattle area in favor of a more remote locale was greeted as a win by Nicole Grant, executive secretary-treasurer of the M.L. King County Labor Council, one of the groups that vowed
 major protests if Trump tried to speak in the area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;We feel good. There is not going to be a Donald Trump rally in King County. He saw that the well was poisoned,&#8221; Grant said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Trump campaign officials say they were not intimidated at all and did try to organize an event in a hangar at Seattle&#8217;s Boeing Field &#8212; but that the plan fell through.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Ericksen said &#8220;we had it all lined up&#8221; but could not get the required permit from King County, leaving him scrambling to nail down the alternate location.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">County officials said there was no unfair treatment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Frank Abe, a spokesman for the King County transportation department, said Ericksen had been talking with a private tenant at the airport about holding his rally in a hangar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Abe said the tenant was reminded that a detailed security and parking plan was required for nonaviation uses of the airport. Such a plan was never submitted to airport officials, he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Airport Director Randall Berg said the county&#8217;s actions were &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; politically motivated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Berg said a planned rally of that size is unprecedented on the east side of the airfield and would have been a big logistical problem &#8212; even before considering possible protests outside. He said the tenant, whom
 he said did not want to be identified, ultimately agreed and did not formally seek a permit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Ericksen said he also explored Paine Field in Everett but was unable to agree on terms there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">A contract to use the fairgrounds in Lynden was finalized Thursday night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Ericksen shrugged off the challenges. &#8220;Lynden is nicer than Seattle,&#8221; he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Washington state Governor Jay Inslee joined a press conference Friday afternoon &#8211; along with minority groups &#8211; in opposition of Donald Trump&#8217;s visit to the state in order to &#8220;denounce&#8221; the presumptive Republican
 nominee for president.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">&#8220;My plan to build a wall around Washington to keep Trump out didn&#8217;t work. And I couldn&#8217;t get Oregon to pay for it,&#8221; Inslee said at the opening of the press conference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Inslee was also joined by Congressman Adam Smith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Trump will make two stops in Washington on Saturday, May 7 &#8212; one in Spokane and another in Lynden. Organizations representing Hispanic, Muslims and other communities will take part in the press conference to highlight
 &#8220;how dangerous Donald Trump&#8217;s hateful rhetoric has been to families across Washington state,&#8221; according to a press release.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Inslee joins Yasmin Christopher, a board member of One America Votes; Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, executive director of Moms Rising; Esela Ortega, executive director of El Centro de la Raza; David Rolf, president of
 SEIU 775; and Varisha Khan, a student at the University of Washington.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">The press release for the press conference states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt">
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">Earlier this week, Donald Trump locked up the Republican Presidential nomination. Throughout his campaign, he has made sexist, Islamophobic, and xenophobic statements that have caused undue hardship to those affected
 communities and has put forward discriminatory policies that are deeply inconsistent with Washington state&#8217;s values.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">The press release was promoted through the Washington State Democrats communications department.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
