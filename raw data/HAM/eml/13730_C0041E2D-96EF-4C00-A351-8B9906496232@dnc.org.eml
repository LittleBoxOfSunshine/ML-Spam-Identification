Smaller group

So.... I think that was the message until he won. HFA did the video of all =
the Rs criticizing trump. CTR and HFA were also pushing a contrary message =
on Ryan meeting last week. They were highlighting things that divided trump=
 / ryan while we were saying they were the same, as a way to hit down-ballo=
t Rs. As Rs begin to coalesce around him, I think we might want to talk to =
HFA about switching gears and highlighting divisions, but I think this is a=
 larger conversation.

Regardless, for right now, I think the benefits of pushing the story outwei=
gh the drawback of this graf. Maybe this gets Republicans to think twice.

By Robert Kagan<http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/robert-kagan> May 18 a=
t 7:09 PM

Robert Kagan is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a contribu=
ting columnist for The Post.

The Republican Party=92s attempt to treat Donald Trump as a normal politica=
l candidate would be laughable were it not so perilous to the republic. If =
only he would mouth the party=92s =93conservative=94 principles, all would =
be well.

But of course the entire Trump phenomenon has nothing to do with policy or =
ideology. It has nothing to do with the Republican Party, either, except in=
 its historic role as incubator of this singular threat to our democracy. T=
rump has transcended the party that produced him. His growing army of suppo=
rters no longer cares about the party. Because it did not immediately and f=
ully embrace Trump, because a dwindling number of its political and intelle=
ctual leaders still resist him, the party is regarded with suspicion and ev=
en hostility by his followers. Their allegiance is to him and him alone.

And the source of allegiance? We=92re supposed to believe that Trump=92s su=
pport stems from economic stagnation or dislocation. Maybe some of it does.=
 But what Trump offers his followers are not economic remedies =97 his prop=
osals change daily. What he offers is an attitude, an aura of crude strengt=
h and machismo, a boasting disrespect for the niceties of the democratic cu=
lture that he claims, and his followers believe, has produced national weak=
ness and incompetence. His incoherent and contradictory utterances have one=
 thing in common: They provoke and play on feelings of resentment and disda=
in, intermingled with bits of fear, hatred and anger. His public discourse =
consists of attacking or ridiculing a wide range of =93others=94 =97 Muslim=
s, Hispanics, women, Chinese, Mexicans, Europeans, Arabs, immigrants, refug=
ees =97 whom he depicts either as threats or as objects of derision. His pr=
ogram, such as it is, consists chiefly of promises to get tough with foreig=
ners and people of nonwhite complexion. He will deport them, bar them, get =
them to knuckle under, make them pay up or make them shut up.

That this tough-guy, get-mad-and-get-even approach has gained him an increa=
singly large and enthusiastic following has probably surprised Trump as muc=
h as it has everyone else. Trump himself is simply and quite literally an e=
gomaniac. But the phenomenon he has created and now leads has become someth=
ing larger than him, and something far more dangerous.

Republican politicians marvel at how he has =93tapped into=94 a hitherto un=
known swath of the voting public. But what he has tapped into is what the f=
ounders most feared when they established the democratic republic: the popu=
lar passions unleashed, the =93mobocracy.=94 Conservatives have been warnin=
g for decades about government suffocating liberty. But here is the other t=
hreat to liberty that Alexis de Tocqueville and the ancient philosophers wa=
rned about: that the people in a democracy, excited, angry and unconstraine=
d, might run roughshod over even the institutions created to preserve their=
 freedoms. As Alexander Hamilton watched the French Revolution unfold, he f=
eared in America what he saw play out in France =97 that the unleashing of =
popular passions would lead not to greater democracy but to the arrival of =
a tyrant, riding to power on the shoulders of the people.

This phenomenon has arisen in other democratic and quasi-democratic countri=
es over the past century, and it has generally been called =93fascism.=94 F=
ascist movements, too, had no coherent ideology, no clear set of prescripti=
ons for what ailed society. =93National socialism=94 was a bundle of contra=
dictions, united chiefly by what, and who, it opposed; fascism in Italy was=
 anti-liberal, anti-democratic, anti-Marxist, anti-capitalist and anti-cler=
ical. Successful fascism was not about policies but about the strongman, th=
e leader (Il Duce, Der Fuhrer), in whom could be entrusted the fate of the =
nation. Whatever the problem, he could fix it. Whatever the threat, interna=
l or external, he could vanquish it, and it was unnecessary for him to expl=
ain how. Today, there is Putinism, which also has nothing to do with belief=
 or policy but is about the tough man who singlehandedly defends his people=
 against all threats, foreign and domestic.

To understand how such movements take over a democracy, one only has to wat=
ch the Republican Party today. These movements play on all the fears, vanit=
ies, ambitions and insecurities that make up the human psyche. In democraci=
es, at least for politicians, the only thing that matters is what the voter=
s say they want =97 vox populi vox dei. A mass political movement is thus a=
 powerful and, to those who would oppose it, frightening weapon. When contr=
olled and directed by a single leader, it can be aimed at whomever the lead=
er chooses. If someone criticizes or opposes the leader, it doesn=92t matte=
r how popular or admired that person has been. He might be a famous war her=
o, but if the leader derides and ridicules his heroism, the followers laugh=
 and jeer. He might be the highest-ranking elected guardian of the party=92=
s most cherished principles. But if he hesitates to support the leader, he =
faces political death.

In such an environment, every political figure confronts a stark choice: Ge=
t right with the leader and his mass following or get run over. The human r=
ace in such circumstances breaks down into predictable categories =97 and d=
emocratic politicians are the most predictable. There are those whose ambit=
ion leads them to jump on the bandwagon. They praise the leader=92s incoher=
ent speeches as the beginning of wisdom, hoping he will reward them with a =
plum post in the new order. There are those who merely hope to survive. The=
ir consciences won=92t let them curry favor so shamelessly, so they mumble =
their pledges of support, like the victims in Stalin=92s show trials, perha=
ps not realizing that the leader and his followers will get them in the end=
 anyway.

A great number will simply kid themselves, refusing to admit that something=
 very different from the usual politics is afoot. Let the storm pass, they =
insist, and then we can pick up the pieces, rebuild and get back to normal.=
 Meanwhile, don=92t alienate the leader=92s mass following. After all, they=
 are voters and will need to brought back into the fold. As for Trump himse=
lf, let=92s shape him, advise him, steer him in the right direction and, no=
t incidentally, save our political skins.

What these people do not or will not see is that, once in power, Trump will=
 owe them and their party nothing. He will have ridden to power despite the=
 party, catapulted into the White House by a mass following devoted only to=
 him. By then that following will have grown dramatically. Today, less than=
 5 percent of eligible voters have voted for Trump. But if he wins the elec=
tion, his legions will comprise a majority of the nation. Imagine the power=
 he would wield then. In addition to all that comes from being the leader o=
f a mass following, he would also have the immense powers of the American p=
residency at his command: the Justice Department, the FBI, the intelligence=
 services, the military. Who would dare to oppose him then? Certainly not a=
 Republican Party that laid down before him even when he was comparatively =
weak. And is a man like Trump, with infinitely greater power in his hands, =
likely to become more humble, more judicious, more generous, less vengeful =
than he is today, than he has been his whole life? Does vast power un-corru=
pt?
