Hey Rob -

I am happy to help out however it might be productive.

Last year I hosted an event at my home and I am happy to do that again. We learned last year is that there is a very small list of people who might be interested in putting together a table for an event in NYC.  I do not have a new network of people that I could invite that would be receptive to such an idea and I don't think that it would be productive to ask my friends/acquaintances back one year later for the same pitch.  Given the dynamic of those who live in DC, I have a strong hunch that they would assume that such an event should be held in DC.  It's not the same as asking people from other cities.  DC by definition is a political town and people think of such events through that lens.

I go to the NYC event for very different reasons. I find the DC gay Democratic political crowd socially boring as hell (I'm being charitable here) and the NYC event is a chance for me to hang with my NYC friends and get them involved in politics, which is outside their wheelhouse.

The HRC National Dinner draws people from around the country and it is logical that such an event would be DC-based. They have a weekend of networking, constituent- based advocacy and lobbying on the Hill to get people feeling plugged into what they are financially supporting.  My sense is that similarly the logic is more for a national Democratic LGBT event/dinner to be in Washington as well, where ancillary events could get people to be more involved in what the DNC is doing outside its front door. It wouldn't make me more willing to go and support the work of the DNC, but I am an outlier. I think it such an event/weekend would have a stronger connection between what's being done and the money that is being solicited.  People want to feel good that their money is being put to good use and having such events in DC helps to make it tangible.

This is all a long way of saying that 1) I'm here to help, 2)I have supported and continue to support the NYC LGBT Dinner 3) there are some structural challenges that your event raises that make soliciting support from DC a problematic proposition.

I hope this input helps you in a positive way.

Cocktail reception. Maybe at your apt or the gym pool.
Get some people to attend and try to get them to buy or sponsor a table.
Ideally we'd get 5 tables from DC

David,

How care you?
We're gearing up a big election. Based on what's at stake this year, we're planning the biggest DNC LGBTQ event yet this year.

Would you be willing to host a table captain/awareness event in June?

Thank you!!!
Rob
