The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friend--

As of this week, Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee. The co=
ntrast between his values and the values our Democratic candidates defend e=
very day could not be starker.  As Democrats, we have a lot on the line.  I=
t is crucial that we push back on the backwards GOP rhetoric and make our v=
oices heard this election cycle.

Please join me for a reception in Knoxville, Tennessee on Friday, June 3rd.=
 This is your chance to ask me questions about what the DNC is doing to fig=
ht back and to strategize together about how to win in November.

You can RSVP through the following link: https://finance.democrats.org/Knox=
villeReception

Thank you for all you do, and I look forward to seeing you in Knoxville!

Debbie
