Donald Trump=92s Idea to Cut National Debt: Get Creditors to Accept Less<ht=

eople/a/binyamin_appelbaum/index.html> MAY 6, 2016



One day after assuring Americans he is not running for president =93to make=
 things unstable for the country<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/us/polit=
ics/donald-trump-president.html>,=94 the presumptive Republican nominee, Do=
nald J. Trump<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/donald-t=
rump-on-the-issues.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>, said in a television interview T=
hursday that he might seek to reduce the national debt by persuading credit=
ors to accept something less than full payment.

Asked whether the United States needed to pay its debts in full, or whether=
 he could negotiate a partial repayment, Mr. Trump told the cable network C=
NBC, =93I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make=
 a deal.=94

He added, =93And if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you c=
an=92t lose.=94

Such remarks by a major presidential candidate have no modern precedent. Th=
e United States government is able to borrow money at very low interest rat=
es because Treasury securities<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/time=
stopics/organizations/t/treasury_department/treasury_securities/index.html?=
inline=3Dnyt-classifier> are regarded as a safe investment, and any cracks =
in investor confidence have a long history of costing American taxpayers a =
lot of money.

Experts also described Mr. Trump=92s vaguely sketched proposal as fanciful,=
 saying there was no reason to think America=92s creditors would accept any=
thing less than 100 cents on the dollar, regardless of Mr. Trump=92s deal-m=
aking prowess.

=93No one on the other side would pick up the phone if the secretary of the=
 U.S. Treasury tried to make that call,=94 said Lou Crandall, chief economi=
st at Wrightson ICAP. =93Why should they? They have a contract=94 requiring=
 payment in full.

Mr. Trump told CNBC that he was concerned about the impact of higher intere=
st rates on the cost of servicing the federal debt. =93We=92re paying a ver=
y low interest rate,=94 he said. =93What happens if that interest rate goes=
 two, three, four points up? We don=92t have a country. I mean, if you look=
 at the numbers, they=92re staggering.=94

Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office projects<https://www.cbo.gov/sites/=
default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/51129-2016_Outlook_Summary.p=
df> that interest payments on the federal debt will climb to $500 billion i=
n 2020 from roughly $250 billion this year. That is based on a projection t=
hat rates on the benchmark 10-year Treasury will reach 4.1 percent in late =
2019, still a low level by historical standards. If rates were to climb mor=
e quickly, or reach higher levels, debt payments would be higher.

Pressed to elaborate on his remarks, Mr. Trump did appear to step back. He =
said that he was not suggesting a default, but instead that the government =
could seek to repurchase debt for less than the face value of the securitie=
s. The government, in other words, would seek to repay less money than it b=
orrowed.

Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budge=
t, said that she shared Mr. Trump=92s concern about the size of the federal=
 debt, but that the issue needed to be addressed through changes in fiscal =
policy =97 some combination of less spending and more revenue.

=93It=92s a policy problem, not a debt-management problem,=94 she said. =93=
When it comes to fiscal responsibility, people are always looking for the e=
asiest of answers. If there were low-hanging fruit here, the Treasury Depar=
tment would already be on it.=94

Repurchasing debt is a fairly common tactic in the corporate world, but it =
only works if the debt is trading at a discount. If creditors think they ar=
e going to get 80 cents for every dollar they are owed, they may be overjoy=
ed to get 90 cents. Mr. Trump=92s companies had sometimes been able to reti=
re debt at a discount because creditors feared they might default.

But Mr. Trump=92s statement might show the limits of translating his busine=
ss acumen into the world of government finance. The United States simply ca=
nnot pursue a similar strategy. The government runs an annual deficit, so i=
t must borrow to retire existing debt. Any measures that would reduce the v=
alue of the existing debt, making it cheaper to repurchase, would increase =
the cost of issuing new debt. Such a threat also could undermine the stabil=
ity of global financial markets.

In 1979, for example, what the government described as =93bookkeeping probl=
ems=94 temporarily delayed $120 million in interest payments. In the afterm=
ath of the delay, investors pushed up interest rates on Treasuries by about=
 0.6 percentage point, according to a 1989 study by Terry L. Zivney of the =
University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and Richard D. Marcus of the Univer=
sity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. That cost taxpayers roughly $12 billion.

In 2011, federal borrowing costs climbed as congressional Republicans refus=
ed for a time to increase the federal government=92s statutory borrowing li=
mit, raising doubts about the government=92s ability to repay its debts. Th=
e Bipartisan Policy Center calculated that the higher rates will cost taxpa=
yers about $19 billion.

There is a limited opportunity for Mr. Trump to pursue bond buybacks withou=
t disrupting markets. He could seek to take advantage of the market=92s pre=
ference for brand-new Treasuries. In a longstanding quirk, older vintages o=
f Treasuries trade at slightly lower prices than the latest issuance. Treas=
ury officials have discussed issuing new debt to fund purchases of older de=
bt, but they would do so because newer securities are easier for investors =
to buy and sell. That might improve the workings of financial markets. Any =
savings, however, would be small change.

=93It would not move the needle at all on the overall debt,=94 Mr. Crandall=
, the economist, said.
