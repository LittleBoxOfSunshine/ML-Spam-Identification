Sadly for tonight we don't have time hours of back and forth on our end tha=
t leads to nothing. We did that last week and had to pull out of 6 pitched =
interviews. To avoid burning everyone again, we need her avail window befor=
e we pitch. Since we don't have that for tonight, I'll book other spoxes av=
ailable for tonight's segments.=20

For tomorrow, need to confirm her avail from 4 to 5pm asap to lock-in CNN (=
Tapper) and MSNBC (Kate Snow).=20

For next Tues & Weds, lets get her avails so we know what we're pitching.=20

Thanks!
