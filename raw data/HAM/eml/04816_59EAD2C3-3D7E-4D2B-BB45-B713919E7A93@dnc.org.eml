Approved by DWS for background distribution by Luis and April =85 let me kn=
ow if you have question.


The rules governing our process for appointments to convention standing com=
mittees were established in 2014 long before any candidates declared and fo=
llow the same process that have governed these appointments for many cycles=
.  The co-chairs of all of the committees and the At-Large members were ele=
cted by the DNC Executive Committee members in January 2016. That meeting w=
as open to the public and all of the campaigns were participants in that pr=
ocess.

The overwhelming remainder (87%) of the Standing Committee membership is el=
ected by each state=92s National Convention Delegates after being nominatin=
g by the presidential campaigns, proportional to each campaign=92s percenta=
ge of the state wide vote.

The Platform drafting committee is a subcommittee of the larger platform co=
mmittee. Those members have not yet been named but the appointments will be=
 made in consultation with both campaigns, as has been the case in past cyc=
les.  Both campaigns are fully aware of our process.
