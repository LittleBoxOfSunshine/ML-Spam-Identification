Is This the Worst Congress Ever?<http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archiv=

It can't pass a budget, can't confirm appointments, and now it can't even s=
crounge up funding to address public-health crises.

May 17, 2016

By: Norm Ornstein

Excerpts:

...it may be no exaggeration to call the current, 114th Congress the worst =
ever-at least edging out the infamous 112th. The truly cringeworthy failure=
s started when both the House and Senate refused to even acknowledge the pr=
esident's budget, an unprecedented step, and the House and Senate Budget Co=
mmittees followed by refusing to hold the usual annual hearing when the pre=
sident's top economic advisor comes to the Hill to discuss the budget and t=
he economy. It was a sign of disrespect that was simply shocking...

What about the congressional budget? Remember, back when Democrats controll=
ed the Senate, Republican congressional leaders used to laud passing a budg=
et as the single most significant action government could take? This time, =
the April 15 deadline passed without a murmur, much less an actual budget p=
lan, from either house.

...the dozen spending bills, which should be moving along with dispatch rig=
ht now to meet the deadline of October 1, when the new fiscal year begins, =
are hardly moving at all. In the House, the Boehner budget deal was designe=
d to "clean out the barn" for Ryan. Instead, the barn's been soiled by the =
pesky Freedom Caucus, the right-most wing of the right-wing majority party.=
 Despite Paul Ryan's many moves to accommodate Freedom Caucus members, brin=
ging them into the leadership fold and consulting with them regularly, they=
 have given him the middle finger on spending bills, holding firm against a=
ny change in the sequester numbers. And that, of course, puts Ryan right wh=
ere Boehner was for several agonizing years...

... Now add the embarrassment of the unprecedented failure of fundamental f=
iduciary responsibility by the Senate to even acknowledge the right of a pr=
esident to nominate an individual to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court wi=
th eleven months to go in his term, and then the obdurate refusal to hold a=
 hearing on a nominee many key Republicans, like Orrin Hatch, had praised t=
o the skies before his nomination, before turning him into a nonperson...

Delays in congressional action, failures on fiscal policy, foot-dragging on=
 confirmations-these are all, to one degree or another, well-worn paths of =
behavior in Congress. But there is more, much more, for the 114th Congress.

There are very legitimate arguments about the appropriate role and scope of=
 the federal government. But few except nihilists and the most extreme libe=
rtarians would argue that protecting public safety in the face of catastrop=
he or epidemic should be off the government's books or sharply constrained =
in scope. And right now, there are three such examples: the horrible Flint =
water debacle, a man-made (mostly state government-made) disaster; the Zika=
 crisis, a classic disease epidemic; and the opioid crisis. All are crying =
out for a sharp and focused response from the federal government. In Flint,=
 the excruciatingly slow response at all levels has left city residents sti=
ll without reliably safe water supplies, while children and others face hea=
lth horrors like enduring brain damage. With Zika, as Anthony Fauci of the =
National Institutes of Health testified, the potential for a major expansio=
n of the virus, leading to health problems and many children born with micr=
ocephaly, along with incidents of Guillaume-Barre disease and other terribl=
e maladies, is palpable. The opioid crisis has resulted in widespread debil=
itating addiction and many deaths from heroin and painkillers. Congress's r=
esponse last month? Go on recess without dealing with them.

Action on each of these epidemics requires money-and money spent now will m=
ake it much easier to avoid much bigger bills down the road, not to mention=
 that it would abate more human suffering and death. But all three have bee=
n blocked by the Republican majority's demand for offsets for spending to c=
ope with disasters. And, when offsets are offered, it has still refused to =
come up with adequate funding.

On Zika, where the flimsy excuse is that the administration has failed to p=
roduce a detailed plan to deal with the virus (the reality is that both NIH=
 and CDC have plans ready to roll,) the House Appropriations Committee has =
come up with a pathetic $600 million or so, far short of the $1.9 billion F=
auci and other experts say is necessary. The same small-minded failure to f=
ind enough dollars plagues the response to the opioid crisis. In Flint, the=
re has been next to nothing done. I expect that before the year is out, Con=
gress will slap together something on Zika and opioids, and declare victory=
. Most likely, it will be too little, too late, and taxpayers will foot lar=
ger bills in subsequent years, while too many people will suffer, and too m=
any will die.

 to produce a detailed plan to deal with the virus (the reality is that bot=

 the House Appropriations Committee has come up with a pathetic $600 millio=

 there has been next to nothing done. I expect that before the year is out,=
 Congress will slap together something on Zika and opioids, and declare vic=
