Huh -- nobody put me up to this -- I read that you were hired by Trimpa in
either Mother Jones or the Nation -- so no one ever paid you any money to
work on Cuba related matters? Why would your name come up at all in these
articles? I'm going to have to say that in the article I write -- that
you're disavowing any involvement on the Cuba issue unless you explain to
me exactly how you were involved -- unless of course the Nation or Mother
Jones article got it wrong. If so, they should run a correction and I will
talk to the pubs about that and then if they stand by their story, then
that becomes the story I write.

Susan, Off the record, your premise is wrong. For starters I was never

Probably for Monday -- not sure I am writing anything -- just want to see
why no one registered to lobby for the Cuba lobbying campaign that has been
extensively written about.
Also,  I'm not sure that you were easy to get a hold of at that time -- in
August of last year. I called and emailed repeatedly the logical place to
reach you, the employer that seemed to be taking credit for the lobbying
campaign for #CubaNow.
 They told me to call James Williams, the point man, I guess, and I tried
him every way I could but he never responded. Follow ups to Trimpa to reach
you or anyone else about it were not responded to.

Nice to hear from you. Last August before I went on maternity leave when I
did the story. Wasn't going to bring up your name today but Josh was trying
to get me to be more forthcoming about what I was getting at and I
understood why he was doing that and thought o would just be forthcoming.
 But I do have questions about your role in the Trimpa Group's lobbying on
the Cuba issue. I contacted the Trimpa Group several times to try to reach
you -- didn't know you had moved on to the DNC until yesterday.
