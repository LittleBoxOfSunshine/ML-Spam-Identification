Jordan,

Hope you're doing well.  Jennifer suggested I reach out to you.

I'm working with the White House and an organization called Civic Nation to=
 help put on the summit June 14th called The United State of Women.  We're =
also hosting a concert on June 13th to kick off the summit.

I'm trying to put together a group of sponsors for the concert and thought =
you might have some ideas on who to reach out to.  Do you have time for a c=
all either tomorrow around 3?

You can check out the summit at http://www.theunitedstateofwomen.org

We're working on a separate page for the concert and hope to have it up and=
 running soon. =20

Looking forward to talking. =20

Best,

Kathleen Biden
