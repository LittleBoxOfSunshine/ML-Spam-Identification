Cruz: Elections are about choices. Indiana and America I believe want to unite behind a positive, optimistic conservative campaign based on positive solutions.

The American people deserve a real choice in November. A meaningful distinction. Describes Hillary and Trump as two big government liberals, two Washington insiders that are enmeshed

When you run for president, one of the most solemn choices you make is the choice of selecting a vice president. This is a choice that you're telling the American people, this is an individual that I trust. You're telling the American people this is an individual I can trust no matter what happens.

Cruz: characteristics you look for in a VP is the same traits you look for a president. You look for knowledge. Cites jobs, national security experience and judgment to do the job.

If you see a leader who deliberately surrounds themselves with people with people who are not capable, it tells you that person is not secure with who they are.

You look for character. Are they honest? Do they have core principles that come from their gut? Do they have a foundation? How do they treat others - especially those they don't have to be nice to. Anyone can kiss up-but how do they treat the clerk at the convenient store.

Cruz: After great consideration, if I am nominated, I will run with my vice presidential running mate, Carly Fiorina.

Gives Carly bio and talks about how she has shattered glass ceilings.

Cruz: my opponent in this race, Donald Trump, looks to government, like HRC, as the solution to all of our problems.

touts Carly's time at HP.

Carly respects the constitution and the bill of rights. She is someone you can be confident in if the occasion arises to be commander-in-chief.

We need a candidate that will rip the Iranian nuclear deal to shreds.

Says when Carly endorsed, she wanted to be all in.

Talks about how Carly confronted Donald Trump when he said look at that face.

Notes how Fiorina battled and survived cancer. Talks about how he identifies with that because his mother battled cancer.

Cruz: Maybe that's why Carly isn't intimidated by bullies.

On why he's not waiting until the convention to announce, Cruz says where we are now, the mainstream media and the lobbyist---they're trying to tell the American people that the race is over. Reiterates that nobody is getting to 1237 delegates. Indiana will have a powerful voice in making that decision. Making this announcement now allows us to unite. Carly as a VP nominee is gifted and will help bring up together. I make this announcement today so the voters know what you will get. The voters deserve to know a candidate that does not change when the wind blows. This decision will give the American people a clear choice.
