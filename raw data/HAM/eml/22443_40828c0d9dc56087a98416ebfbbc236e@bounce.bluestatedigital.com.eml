Daniel --

If the past seven years have confirmed anything, it's that
real, lasting change doesn't happen as the result of one
person's actions -- it takes all of us working together and
speaking up. When communities unite -- when folks stand with
their neighbors and make their voices heard -- the results
are pretty incredible.

I'm thankful for all we've accomplished together -- for how
you've faced down the cynicism, and kept up the fight for
change. The progress we've made on everything from climate
change to job growth is worth celebrating. I hope you're
thankful too -- and I want to hear from you.

Add your name now and you'll be automatically entered to
meet me at OFA's event in Washington, D.C., this summer:

https://my.barackobama.com/I-Want-To-Meet-You

One of the best parts of my job is getting to talk with
people like you, folks who do the hard work of active
citizenship -- knocking on doors and having important
conversations with friends about the issues that matter to
all of us. Those actions add up, and taken together,
they're how we make change.

Reflecting on all we've achieved together is important.
Looking back in gratitude helps us move forward -- and
there's plenty of work ahead.

I hope we get the chance to meet this summer in Washington,
D.C.:

https://my.barackobama.com/I-Want-To-Meet-You

Thanks,

Barack Obama
