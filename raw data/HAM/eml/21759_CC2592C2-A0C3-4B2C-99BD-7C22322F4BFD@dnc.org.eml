So we have the Martin Berman meeting scheduled for 3/28 from 3:00-3:30 with=
 the chair. First of all, we want to make sure she hasn't cancelled it (we'=
re a little nervous).=20

But the main issue is that my doctor called and said he could do my broncho=
scopy that same day. I won't be able to do both so I asked if he was availa=
ble another day (haven't heard back yet, but his schedule is pretty full), =
but I'm thinking I should just do the procedure because I'm really struggli=
ng.

Do you know who is around or not around on Thursday to fill in for me? And =
do you think Jordan will blow up at me and/or Zach?
Thanks!=
