Democrats Get The Keys To Obama's Massive Campaign Email List<http://www.bu=

BUZZFEED // Evan McMorris-Santoro

MINNEAPOLIS - The most envied digital contact list in politics is now in th=
e hands of the Democratic Party.

Party officials and the remnants of President Obama's 2012 campaign team ha=
ve hashed out a deal that turns over control of the campaign's email list t=
o the DNC, a move that more than doubles the party's current email contact =
list and puts some of the most advanced digital contact infrastructure in t=
he complete control of the Democratic Party.

DNC officials declined to discuss the size of the list, but DNC digital dir=
ector Matt Compton's excitement at owning the list that helped Obama raise =
"more than $500 million" last cycle according to the Wall Street Journal<ht=
tp://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/11/14/obamas-email-list-costs-group-more-t=
han-1-6-million-a-year/> was palpable in an intervew at the DNC's Summer Me=
eting. DNC officials said the list was the "largest political email list in=
 the world."

"The email list will help the DNC expand its reach online, build support fo=
r a new generation of leadership, and test new tactics for activating Democ=
ratic voters in future elections," he said. "Email is critically important =
tool for fundraising, grassroots engagement in support of key issues, and s=
etting the record straight about the Republican candidates as well."

The DNC formally acquired the list earlier this month, and has already used=
 it to send out an email aimed at boosting support for Obama's clean power =
proposal. The DNC has used the list before, but only after messages were ap=
proved by the campaign organization that owned it. Now, the DNC is free to =
use it as they please.

What sets the list apart is its enhancements. More than just a huge file of=
 emails, the Obama 2012 list includes information about which specific type=
 of appeals a supporter responded to, how much they donated and when, how t=
hey prefer to be contacted, and other granular data that helped make Obama'=
s digital grassroots outreach the best over two separate campaign cycles.

DNC control means that eventually the party's presidential nominee will get=
 access to the email list Obama built. Every Democratic presidential campai=
gn would love access to the list, and there has been public grumbling<http:=
//thehill.com/homenews/campaign/230622-obama-clinton-tensions-build-over-em=
ail-lists> about whether or not Obama would give it up for months. There ar=
e no current plans for the competing Democratic primary candidates to get a=
ccess to the list, DNC officials said, but that could change in the future.

For now, Democratic Party officials are excited to have one of the most sou=
ght-after tools in politics. Compton said the list gives Democrats a huge l=
eg up over the GOP in digital outreach.

"The acquisition of this dataset is part of the DNC's broad efforts to buil=
d on its success in political technology and digital organizing, and to kee=
p us many steps ahead of our RNC rivals - and to widen that gap even furthe=
r," Compton said.
