Clean copy. Thanks everyone! These are going through our review process and=
 will go to the Chai.

NV Convention Talking Points

Violence is Unacceptable


  *   First, let me be clear, at the DNC we are neutral in this primary.
  *   That said, violence and intimidation are absolutely unacceptable in o=
ur Democracy and in our primary process, and it is incumbent upon all of us=
 in positions of leadership to speak out against it.
  *   This was a State Democratic Party event, not a DNC event, so I was no=
t present for what happened.
  *   But I was immediately concerned when I saw the videos and read the tr=
oubling details about the conduct on display by some participants in Nevada=
 on Saturday and over the weekend.
  *   We are reaching out to both campaigns and calling on every Democrat t=
o denounce threats of violence and intimidation, they don=92t serve any of =
our candidates well.

Roberta Lange and Private Property

  *   It=92s especially troubling that the threats went beyond the hall.
  *   Roberta Lang, the Nevada Democratic Chair, was simply performing her =
duty as Chair and has done nothing to deserve the disgusting attacks and de=
ath threats she has received over text, emails and over the phone.
  *   The individuals launching these attacks =96 as well as the vandalism =
that took place over the weekend -- should be ashamed.

We=92re Better Than Trump


  *   Energy and passion for a candidate are absolutely welcome as part of =
this process.
  *   The vast majority of Democrats who have already participated in our p=
rimary have done so appropriately -- with enthusiasm and civility.
  *   For those who let their passion turn to rage when things don=92t go t=
heir way, well that=92s better left to the ugliness we=92ve seen at Donald =
Trump=92s rallies, it doesn=92t belong on the Democratic side.

The Rules of This Process are Not New


  *   The rules governing the Democratic Party delegate selection process h=
ave been in place for decades and the specific procedures for this cycle we=
re agreed upon in 2014.
  *   The system for determining these rules has been fair and transparent.
  *   It is the same process that ultimately led to the nomination of Barac=
k Obama in 2008, for example.
  *   Shouting down any democratic process isn=92t just disruptive, it=92s =
unacceptable. We need to come together and be united.
  *   If there are legitimate concerns from the supporters of either Democr=
atic campaign, those concerns can, should and must be addressed in an order=
ly, civil and peaceful manner.

Alaska State Convention


  *   It is possible to show your passion and to disagree openly with our p=
arty leaders or the process in a meaningful and peaceful way.
  *   On Saturday, I was in Alaska for their state convention. This is a st=
ate that supported Senator Sanders in their primary by 82%.
  *   There was no shouting. No threats of violence.
  *   And I received a standing ovation because the people in that room kno=
w we can=92t afford what a Trump presidency would do to our country.
  *   That=92s the example we should be following. And as long as we do, I=
=92m convinced we will absolutely be a unified party at our National Conven=
tion.

If Asked About the 64 Delegates

  *   Look I wasn=92t there but my understanding is that there was a proces=
s in place to address these concerns and both campaigns were equally repres=
ented in the credentials committee who was charged with resolving these dis=
putes. But ultimately no matter what happened, there is no need to resort t=
o violence.
  *   The Democratic Party is a party of ideas and substance and the last t=
hing we would want is for these frustrations to overshadow the important an=
d substantive ideas our candidates have to offer.
  *   We need for both campaigns to understand that there is process in pla=
ce and that regardless of the outcome violence should not be condoned. Peri=
od.
