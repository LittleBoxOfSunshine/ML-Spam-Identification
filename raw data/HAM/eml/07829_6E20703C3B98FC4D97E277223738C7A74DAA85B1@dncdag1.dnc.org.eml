DNC Chair Statement Commemorating Cinco de Mayo

Washington, D.C - DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the following=
 statement commemorating Cinco de Mayo:

"Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Battle of Puebla in 1862, when a ragtag ban=
d of Mexican fighters and workers held back the French Army despite being b=
oth out-manned and out-gunned. More than 150 years later, the celebration o=
f Cinco de Mayo represents more than the spirit of resilience and determina=
tion that carried that day. Cinco de Mayo is a date that speaks to the intr=
insic and close ties between the United States and Mexico.

"Cinco de Mayo celebrations were made popular in California, a reflection o=
f the reality that Mexican-Americans have been a part of our history since =
before our nation's founding. From the Mexican-Americans who gave rise to g=
reat cities like Los Angeles and San Antonio, to those who enrich our count=
ry every single day in education, medicine, engineering, sports, agricultur=
e, and in our military, their role in the American landscape has made our c=
ountry stronger. What Republicans don't get, as they proved today by leavin=
g out mentions of being a welcoming country in their Cinco de Mayo statemen=
t, is that Mexican-Americans are not only immigrants but rather a far large=
r share are Americans - some with families going back generations -- centur=
ies -- within our borders.

"So as we celebrate a day that reminds us of our shared history, cultural a=
nd familial ties, the Democratic Party reaffirms our commitment to exemplif=
ying the values that made America great, and to continuing to fight every s=
ingle day to ensure our country remains inclusive, while expanding opportun=
ities for all. We celebrate our diversity, and we're proud that our Party a=
nd our convention will reflect that.

"That Donald Trump became his Party's presumptive nominee on the eve of Cin=
co de Mayo is fitting, a reminder of just how wrong his divisive and hatefu=
l rhetoric has been since the very first day of his campaign. Today is a re=
minder that Dangerous Donald would threaten America's relationships with ou=
r closest allies, and make our communities less safe. Like the brave souls =
that day in Puebla a century and a half ago, we must show the spirit and de=
termination every single day between now and November 8th to defeat Trump a=
nd his Republican Party in November, and ensure our country continues to li=
ve up to our history and our values."
