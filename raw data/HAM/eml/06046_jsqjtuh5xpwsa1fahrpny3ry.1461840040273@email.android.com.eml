Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign co-chairman in Virginia has traveled to Syria and =
promised support for the government of President Bashar Assad, who U.S. off=
icials have repeatedly said has lost the legitimacy to rule the war-torn co=
untry.

Virginia state Sen. Dick Black's trip to a Middle Eastern country in the mi=
dst of a civil war and his comments in the face of official U.S. foreign po=
licy are highly unusual for a state lawmaker.

Black, an outspoken Republican, is a part-time state senator who has no rol=
e in official U.S. foreign policy. Still, he has met with Assad government =
officials and said he would advocate for better relationships between Assad=
 and the U.S., according to the official Syrian news agency.

"I will be Syria's voice," Black said, according to the news agency.

Unlike his GOP rivals, Cruz has been less than eager to use military force =
to take out the Assad government.

"If we are to defeat our enemies we need to be clear-eyed that toppling a g=
overnment and allowing radical Islamic terrorists to take over a nation is =
not benefiting our national security interests," Cruz said at the Republica=
n Jewish Coalition forum in December, referring to President Barack Obama's=
 Syria policy goals. "Putting ISIS or Al Qaeda or the Muslim Brotherhood in=
 charge of yet another state in the Middle East is not benefiting our natio=
nal security."

The Cruz campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment about=
 Black's trip to Syria.

Black was also recently elected to be a Virginia delegate at the Republican=
 National Committee's convention this summer. He is one of the most vocal s=
ocial conservatives in Virginia's General Assembly, and has drawn national =
attention for his opposition to abortion and gay rights. The former Vietnam=
 War veteran and military lawyer dismayed Republican leaders in 2003 by sen=
ding fellow lawmakers small, plastic likenesses of a fetus to underscore hi=
s opposition toward abortion.

The state senator raised eyebrows in 2014 when he sent a letter to Assad pr=
aising him. It was posted on the Syrian president's Facebook page.

Black is expected to meet with Assad during his visit, the Syrian newspaper=
 Al-Watan reported.

Syria's conflict began with mostly peaceful protests in 2011, but a brutal =
government crackdown and the rise of an armed insurgency eventually plunged=
 the country into a full-blown civil war. The fighting has killed more than=
 250,000 people, according to the United Nations, which stopped tracking ca=
sualties several months ago.

Black has said Assad protected Christians and fought terrorist groups. On h=
is Twitter account, Black said he supported Assad because he is stemming th=
e growth of the Islamic State, sometimes called ISIS.

"If Assad falls, ISIS will secure Syria and march on Europe," the tweet sai=
d.

Last year, Black said the Virginia Capitol Police alerted him to a threat a=
gainst him by the Islamic State for his support of Assad. The state senator=
 was featured in a magazine published by the Islamic state.

Black posted a link on Twitter on Wednesday to article written by an Irania=
n state-run TV news agency, which quoted Black as saying the Syrian civil w=
ar would "come to an end if the U.S. stops training terrorist in Jordan, Sa=
udi Arabia" and other countries.

U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Black "is entitled to his v=
iews, but they do not reflect this administration's policy on Syria."

Black met with a Lebanese Christian politician allied with the Lebanese mil=
itant Hezbollah group, which is fighting alongside Assad's forces in Syria,=
 the TV news agency reported.

Both the Iranian state-run TV news agency and the official Syrian news agen=
cy erroneously referred to Black as a U.S. senator.

Word of Black's travels drew mockery from political opponents.

"Doesn't surprise me one bit," said Virginia Senate Minority Leader Dick Sa=
slaw. He added that Black shouldn't be trying to meddle in foreign affairs =
and said Republicans "would be raising holy hell if the situation was rever=
sed."
