HOW DO YOU REALLY FEEL: Hey, John Boehner, remember him? 

Well, TED CRUZ sure does. 

The former House Speaker left the political stage months ago but returned with force, delivering a borderline NSFW soundbite in which he called Cruz, "Lucifer in the flesh" and "the most miserable son of a bitch" he's ever worked with. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc7850284025422242beff15630beea267740832c840865dbcb16b 

The salty anti-endorsement, as first reported by the Stanford Daily, http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc7850286e9958529a5894d6c6d1d489b085dc962d2fd634abbf4a comes at an inopportune time for Cruz. He is, after all, the candidate seeking to consolidate establishment Republicans in an effort to stop DONALD TRUMP. Cruz's response was to, what else, compare Boehner to Trump.

Boehner "allowed his inner Trump to come out," Cruz said.

Same party name-calling is one thing. But Boehner's comments shifted the focus from Trump just as Cruz hopes to mount a last stand in Indiana. That job is harder now.

TGIT. Here's your 2016 Blast. Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through the day's campaign news, so send your tips, complaints and most scorching hot takes to hjackson@politico.com. 

WHAT MATTERS: Here are four more things we're watching today - and why they matter. 

2) ACCEPTANCE AND DENIAL: Another day with DONALD TRUMP steamrolling toward the Republican nomination meant another day of recognition - or denial. The real estate mogul picked up the endorsement of House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc7850cfcca11d24b565c084ab8e8cf45cd8a5db9fda5b6f47ad6e and a former top MITT ROMNEY aide, Ron Kaufman, said he was similar to Ronald Reagan. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc7850bcc54a4cbe47690eb166d15e3e5bda0aed420929aa695110 Meanwhile, Senate Republicans, as POLITICO's Burgess Everett reports, are trying to act like Trump is not even there. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc785065775b3997726c19f0c54446f6a44ad176f4743ce752e90f In the House, Republicans are grappling with how to co-exist, too, POLITICO's Rachael Bade and Jake
 Sherman report: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc785079d998c2d1949be1e1f7587b7750ea9b350f823eb543364b 

3) BERNING DOWN: HILLARY CLINTON's Democratic rival crept closer to his endgame today. As POLITICO's Gabriel Debenedetti reports what BERNIE SANDERS wants as he leaves the race - a mix of Democratic platform planks and, perhaps, reforms in the party's nominating process - show he's thinking about the end. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc785010694f962a5f3b22329c60cc0a6c812251e0750f64d02a87 He cut spending sharply in Indiana http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc785006ce27bf4ffc76ddaf4df4ce8aa623de125ad3fa47206a75 His wife, Jane Sanders, did not seem to be in retreat: She predicted an epic comeback: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc78506278a8684c62ff8362f9b318edd6567714c4d6ff818c790b 

4) SELF FUNDED*: DONALD TRUMP has made his wealth, his lack of beholdenness to other wealthy people and his promise to self-fund his campaign pillars of his message. But Trump seems to be having second thoughts about this. Paul Manafort, a top Trump aide, says in a radio interview with Laura Ingraham that Trump has actually not yet decided whether he will accept large contributions from outside donors for a general election. "Well the point is that Donald Trump has been making on the campaign trail is that he's financing his own campaign," Manafort told Ingraham. But he added: "When it comes to the general election, we are no longer running as an individual, we are running as the head of a
 ticket," he continued. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc7850fe97d7132b85103a3155df345fda4714da47f7196a2c8a97 You can listen to the whole show here: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc7850d9cb35915af2f8122d291e457754b9b82f205844418386c3 

5) ABOUT THAT ALLIANCE ... It has not even been a week since TED CRUZ and JOHN KASICH floated a strategic alliance where Cruz would compete hard in Indiana and Kasich would promote himself as the Trump alternative in western states. That was Sunday night. Today, Thursday, Cruz professed no "alliance" at all: "I recognize that the media is all eager to talk about an alliance," Cruz told reporters at a stop in Fort Wayne, Indiana. "There is no alliance. Kasich and I made a determination of where to focus our energies, where to focus our assets, where to focus our resources." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc78502b50c10c97602744ad0142e582a06c37c026c7b0ae3e8afe Around the same time this quote came out, a top Kasich aide, John
 Weaver, tweeted: "I can't stand liars." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc7850e148e6b57d8010d25a8fee8c68e7c1bd689bdac23e1bea7b Though he didn't elaborate, Weaver had recently retweeted a negative story about Cruz.

TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Bobby Knight has some things to say, TED CRUZ can't contain himself, CARLY FIORINA emerges, DONALD TRUMP will find protesters in California and Bill Richardson thinks BERNIE SANDERS should chill out. 

KNIGHT'S WATCH: Bobby Knight said DONALD TRUMP could have played for him, and also compared him to Harry Truman as they campaigned in Indiana. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc78509ab8f086244bb6829fd856307f4a0f4c83b46b40777b5060 

CALIFORNIA SCREAMING: There will be protests at DONALD TRUMP's event in southern California today. (Los Angeles Times) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc7850381d5ad01a4cc3e3e655d6c05cd08558709353fb2ed876ad 

MARXING IT UP: Someone asked TED CRUZ to sign the Communist manifesto while he campaigned in Indiana. This is what happened: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc7850f3bc547e890a68af3663837d95d7134e3f3c4076ad7d3ba7 

(H)iCARLY: TED CRUZ's running mate-in-waiting, CARLY FIORINA, defended his record, dismissed her past statements about him http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc78503112fac866ea4f5079dbf4abb5af0f9e74e649b7069f3a1f and ... attacked Barbara Boxer. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc78506431f553a6620db5c6df21dce6504bb49f206443d854fa19 

TROLLED: TED CRUZ's campaign couldn't secure CruzFiorina.com because someone else had snapped it up. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc78506ce922fe3c0fdaa85c39592c3de2020e593abf032efc71e9 

CORE STRENGTH: HILLARY CLINTON does particularly well with black female voters and tends to have them at most campaign events. (The Wall Street Journal) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc7850b30cdee0b44138de4ebd536f98da2be8506fd836b9f0d0bb 

CHILL BILL: Former New Mexico Gov. and one-time presidential hopeful Bill Richardson thinks BERNIE SANDERS should tone it down. (CNBC) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc785002dbe152da94354eb3882171b1e7cbaa2b188922a21ee4e5 

TABLE TALK: A Washington Post reporter explains what it was like to sit next to DONALD TRUMP at the 2011 White House Correspondents' dinner when he was mocked by President Obama. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc78504d477830e6ccf105bcb404defd742298bc24d6c287026805 

WHAT'S NEXT:

DONALD TRUMP makes a campaign visit to California tonight. HILLARY CLINTON and BERNIE SANDERS focus on Indiana. TED CRUZ has events there, too. 

THEY SAID IT: 

"I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life."

- John Boehner, on TED CRUZ. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc7850284025422242beff15630beea267740832c840865dbcb16b 

MAGIC NUMBER: 33. That's the percentage of Pew respondents approving of the GOP - the party's lowest since 1992. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=42023c8321cc78504c1e8258f7dde774005a2d6017c8eab43cdd743da0e74a9a 

THE MEDIA ISSUE- POLITICO MAGAZINE ONLINE TODAY: POLITICO Magazine's MEDIA ISSUE is out just in time for WHCD festivities! Don't miss this sweeping look at the press' role in the rise of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump-from NYC tabloid writers who made Trump a celebrity, to the complicity of cable news, to on-the-ground reporters riding the Trump rollercoaster. In this must-read issue featuring Jack Shafer, Campbell Brown, Michael Grunwald, Michael Crowley and Ben Schreckinger among many others, POLITICO Magazine asks, "Just what have we done?"
