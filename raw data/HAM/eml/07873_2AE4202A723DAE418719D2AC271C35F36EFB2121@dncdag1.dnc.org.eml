Hey guys - here they are. Sorry for delay - we had a lot going on at HQ thi=
s afternoon.
Really glad to see some events coming together for tomorrow. Let's make sur=
e the country understands how dangerous Trump would be as president.
Thanks all,
Eric

Dangerous Donald Trump Lacks the Judgment or Temperament to be President

Donald Trump's recklessness would hurt our economy, diminish our standing i=
n the world, and make our communities less safe. Trump is dangerous, and he=
 lacks the judgment or temperament to be president.

His impending nomination is a reminder that for years the Republican Party =
has elevated extreme voices, using divisive campaigns that sought to exploi=
t unfounded fears for political gain. And just like Republicans in Washingt=
on have done for years, Dangerous Donald is only looking out for himself. H=
is plans would benefit those at the very top and would drag our country bac=
k to where we were when the last Republican president left office losing 80=
0,000 jobs a month. The American people can't afford to let him bully his w=
ay into the Oval Office.



Dangerous Donald Trump has already damaged America's relationships across t=
he globe. His record of denigrating women has only gotten worse throughout =
this campaign, at the same time that his divisive rhetoric has made our com=
munities less safe. And his business record is riddled with embarrassing fa=
ilures that make it clear the American people can't afford to let him get a=
nywhere near the White House.


National Security: Even as a candidate, Dangerous Donald has damaged Americ=
a's relationships across the globe. In the White House, he would undeniably=
 make America less safe.


*         Donald Trump has no foreign policy experience and rather than see=
king the advice of well-respected experts, Trump relies on his own misinfor=
med ideas and in his own words, on his "good brain."

*         Trump has falsely claimed that he knows "more about ISIS than the=
 generals" and recommended that the U.S. military commit international war =
crimes.

*         Trump's threat to pull back from our most important military alli=
ances<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-and-the-end-of-n=
ato/2016/03/04/e8c4b9ca-e146-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html> like NATO, =
pull aid from our allies like Israel, and his gushing praise for dictators =
would put our country on a dangerous path.

*         Trump has refused to rule out using nuclear weapons on European t=
erritory, and wants to allow countries that don't currently have nuclear we=
apons to get them, reversing long-held goals of international nuclear disar=
mament.

Wrong on Women: Dangerous Donald has a decades-long record of denigrating w=
omen and promoting misogyny. His policies would make it harder for women to=
 make their own choices when it comes to their healthcare or their career.

*         Trump once said you had to  treat women "like s**t" and has spent=
 decades doing so himself by calling women names - "fat pig," "slob," or "b=
imbo" - and saying a man needs a woman to support him at home rather than a=
lways be "griping and bitching."

*         Trump would take away a woman's right to make her own healthcare =
choices and has said women who had abortions should be punished - but not t=
he doctors that performed them - and opposed exceptions for health of the m=
other because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to have an abo=
rtion.

*         Trump thinks ensuring equal pay for women should just be left up =
to "the marketplace" and once suggested family leave policies should actual=
ly be scaled back and noted pregnancy was "an inconvenience for a business.=
" Trump complained that when he employed mothers, they were not giving him =
"100 percent."

Divisive and Dangerous: Dangerous Donald exploited racial anxieties and cul=
tural fears in the pursuit of getting elected - to the point where his rall=
ies have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the medi=
a.

*         Trump spouts hateful and dangerous lies about Muslims and called =
to surveil mosques, to ban Muslims from entering the country and to create =
a database of all Muslims in America - including U.S. citizens - and could =
not answer when pressed on how this would be any different from Nazi German=
y.

*         Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" and criminals and said =
they brought disease into the country, said you needed to check if Native A=
mericans were "real Indians," and claimed that a "well-educated black has a=
 tremendous advantage" - but apparently not an advantage in finding housing=
 in Trump properties, because in the 1970s, the Trump Organization was sued=
 for discriminating against Blacks and Puerto Ricans.

*         Trump has been endorsed by former  KKK leader David Duke, and his=
 candidacy has been used as a recruiting tool for the white supremacist mov=
ement, which is no surprise since Trump refused to disavow David Duke and t=
he KKK four times in one interview.

*         Trump has fostered violence against protestors at his rallies, su=
ggesting that a Black Lives Matter protester maybe "should have been roughe=
d up," promising to pay the legal fees if someone would "knock the hell" ou=
t of a protester and reminiscing about the old days when a protester would =
be "carried off on a stretcher."

*         Trump repeatedly threatened the First Amendment by calling to "op=
en up" libel laws so he could sue reporters whenever they printed a story h=
e did not like, made it a practice of banning media outlets he did not like=
 from covering his rallies, and thought "closing" parts of the Internet was=
 a rational strategy to combat ISIS.

Bad at Business, Bad for the Economy: Though he plays the part of a wealthy=
 and successful businessman, Dangerous Donald's real life record is riddled=
 with embarrassing failures and cheap schemes designed to turn a quick buck=
 at the expense of everyday Americans.


*         Despite his tough talk on trade deals and the loss of American jo=
bs, Donald Trump manufactured his clothing line in countries he rails again=
st, like China and Mexico.

*         Dangerous Donald owes everything to the tens of millions of dolla=
rs in loans and bailouts he received from his family.

*         Dangerous Donald's businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt, leav=
ing investors, contractors and small businesses holding the bag for his dis=
astrous business decisions.

*         During one of his business bankruptcies, his personal finances we=
re at the mercy of banks who put him on an "allowance" of $400,000 per mont=
h.

*         His Trump "University" fleeced thousands of Americans simply look=
ing to get ahead.

*         Trump's unfounded predictions<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/03/trum=
p-predicts-very-massive-recession-in-us.html> of recession under President =
Obama and warnings against investing in the stock market are reckless.

*         Economists have actually predicted Trump's policies could start a=
n international trade war and even destabilize the global economy<http://ww=
w.cbsnews.com/media/is-donald-trump-a-menace-to-the-global-economy/>.

*         Trump's tax plan would overwhelmingly benefit the rich while cost=
ing the country $9.5 trillion to implement -- more than any other Republica=
n plan proposed. It also violates his pledge not to increase the national d=
ebt.

*         Trump actually said at one of the Republican Party's debates that=
 "wages are too high" and opposed raising the minimum wage

*         Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would jeopar=
dize health care for 20 million Americans who've been able to get coverage =
under Obamacare.

Republicans couldn't unite against him and failed to stand up to him during=
 their primary because they were playing to the same extreme base of their =
party. Democrats will be united and hold Donald Trump accountable every day=
 until November 8th.
