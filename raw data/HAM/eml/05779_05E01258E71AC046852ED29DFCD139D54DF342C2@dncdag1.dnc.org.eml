No idea. I thought that was the whole point of this, that we could lead wit=
h Cummings and show that for whatever Bernie wants to criticize there's a l=
egitimate process underway. I don't believe for a second that this is just =
too processy and in the weeds, and that we shouldn't elevate it. I think th=
is is entirely a key element of the Sanders narrative and they're going to =
elevate it and get to be first to define it...again.

But I've been asked to take a step back so I'll just have my team ready to =
amplify when we can.

Why is she so cautious. Cummings is our best shot to turn the page.

Sorry for the keyboard typos
