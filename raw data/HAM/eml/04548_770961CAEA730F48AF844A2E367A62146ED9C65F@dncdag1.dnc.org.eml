Donald Trump Has Another White Power-Loving Delegate<http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/trump-white-power-delegate-illinois-lori-gayne>
Mother Jones - Josh Harkinson

Donald Trump has another delegate with controversial views on matters of race. Meet Chicago mortgage banker Lori Gayne:

"With all the racism going on today, I'm very proud to be white. Just like black people are proud to be black and now, as white people, whenever we say something critical we're punished as if we're racists. I'm tired of it. I'm very proud," Gayne said.

"I'm so angry I don't even feel like I live in America. You can call me a racist. Black Lives Matter? Those people are out of control," she said.

Gayne's Twitter account, which is only accessible to her followers, is called "whitepride":


Gayne isn't the first Trump delegate to embrace white power. William Johnson, a Trump delegate in California, resigned last week after Mother Jones revealed that he was the leader of the white nationalist American Freedom Party. And the anti-Muslim pastor Guy St-Onge resigned as a Trump delegate after being questioned about his views by the Guardian. The AFP now claims that it has other members who are Trump delegates but has declined to release their names.
