For Immediate Release    April 27, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

AWARDING NAVAL ACADEMY THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF'S TROPHY



East Room



2:47 P.M. EDT





 THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody! Please have a seat. Welcome to the Whit=
e House. To Coach Ken and the Navy Midshipmen, I should say welcome back.=
 At this point, you should just add this date to your football schedule e=
very year. (Laughter.) Air Force game, Army game, bowl game, White House =
visit. (Laughter.)



We do have some special guests here today that I want to acknowledge. Sec=
retary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, is here. We've got Admiral John Richardson=
. We have Superintendent Ted Carter, Jr., and Athletic Director Chet Glad=
chuk.



Now, Navy Football has now won the service-academy rivalry 10 of the last=
 13 years. In that time, theyve won 24 of their last 27 games against Air=
 Force and Army. Maybe its a good thing this trophy just stays in one pla=
ce so often, because it's huge. (Laughter.)=20



But I know winning the Commander-in-Chief Trophy means a lot to this team=
, and it means a lot to me because it shares its name with the most impor=
tant responsibility that I have. No disrespect to Vince Lombardi or Lord =
Stanley, but this trophy means a little more to me personally.



I am the eighth President to award this trophy, and this is the eighth an=
d final time that I will do it -- and what better way than by honoring th=
is historic Naval Academy team? This squad wasnt just the best service ac=
ademy on the gridiron this year - it was one of the best teams in America=
.



The teams co-captains, Bernie Serra and Keenan Reynolds, had a couple of =
mottos that I really like. The first one was one-and-oh - a reminder to t=
ake each game one at a time. So they started the season 1-0 with a 38-poi=
nt blowout. They went 1-0 against Air Force in another rout. For the 14th=
 straight year, they went 1-0 against Army to reclaim this trophy, and th=
en Navy went 1-0 in the Military Bowl.=20



All those one-and-ohs added up to 11 wins, which is more than any Navy te=
am in history - and Navys been playing football a long time -- about as l=
ong as weve had the lightbulb. (Laughter.) In four years, these seniors h=
ave won more games than any Navy team since the Class of 1909. Theyve won=
 this trophy three times, won three bowl games, and has anybody here ever=
 lost to Army? (Laughter.) That's sort of a deafening silence there.



The teams second motto that I like is something Coach Ken would remind hi=
s players at halftime: You dont have to do anything special - just do you=
r job. Just do your job - I really like that slogan.



In doing their jobs, these players did something special. And thats espec=
ially true for the anchor of this Navy team, Keenan Reynolds, one of coll=
ege footballs all-time greats. The only quarterback in the 125-year histo=
ry of the Army-Navy rivalry to win the game four times. Holds 11 NCAA rec=
ords, including most rushing yards by a quarterback. With his 88 touchdow=
ns, no one in college football history has been in the end zone more time=
s than Navys number 19. And in honor of his leadership, both on and off t=
he field, no one will ever wear it again, which is not bad for a guy who =
started out as the third-string quarterback.



If you ask him which record hes most proud of, Keenan will tell you that =
its the team record for wins. Of course hed say that. But heres how I kno=
w he means it. When Navy played Memphis in Keenans home state of Tennesse=
e, hundreds of his friends and relatives came out. They wanted to see him=
 break the touchdown record. On Navys last drive, the Mids were on the 1-=
yard line. Keenan was one score away. Coach called in a QB sneak, but Kee=
nan called an audible and tossed a touchdown to running back Demond Brown=
. So you knew he meant it when he said that what he cared about was the t=
eam.



Navy also dominated this year thanks to Chris Swain - or the Swain Train"=
 -- (laughter) -- who racked up 1,000 yards. Austin Grebe, who kicked mor=
e extra points than any Midshipman in history. And the calm and quiet wre=
cking ball at defensive end, Will Anthony, who led the team in sacks.



So these players are just as impressive off the field. In February, Myer =
Krah went to Flint to hand out water bottles. Just last week, Myer and Tr=
oy Thompson visited with junior high students at Washington Jesuit Academ=
y, a first-rate middle school in a low-income community here in D.C.=20



E.K. Binns was a finalist for the Academic Heisman. Wideout Thomas Wilson=
 is a first-team Academic All-American. But most importantly, in a few mo=
nths, 17 of these seniors will be Ensigns and 15 will be commissioned sec=
ond lieutenants in the Marine Corps.



Theyll be joined in their service by another historic group of Midshipmen=
 who are here today, and I wanted to give them a little bit of credit bec=
ause we, on this day, celebrate football, but we've got a lot of extraord=
inary folks at the Naval Academy, and we are welcoming today the first st=
udents ever to graduate with a degree in cyber ops. And their expertise i=
s going to be more critical than ever to our national security, so we're =
very, very proud of them and we want to congratulate them.=20



Look, the rivalry between our service academies can get heated. But it is=
 healthy and rooted in respect. They learn early on what it takes to be t=
he best. And thats what matters when youre part of the finest fighting fo=
rce that the world has ever seen. As your Commander-in-Chief, and as one =
of the Americans you risk your lives to defend, I will continue to do my =
best to support all the men and women who have the distinction of wearing=
 this nations uniform.

**

For more than a century, Navys mascot has been a goat. After what this ye=
ars team accomplished, I think you could say that maybe that stands for G=
reatest of All Time. (Laughter.)**



So I want to congratulate Navy. Thank you for your service. Good luck get=
ting this thing back to Annapolis -- I don't know if you have, like, a bi=
g truck bed that you're going to be using. (Laughter.) But most important=
ly, to all of you, I could not be prouder of your commitment and your ded=
ication to this nation, to our security, and to our freedom.



God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Let's make sure th=
at we get a good picture here. (Laughter.)



Coach, anything you want to add here? Come on.



COACH NIUMATALOLO: Thank you. Mr. President, it's always an honor for us =
to come to the White House. We take great pride in the fact that we've be=
en here pretty much for your entire presidency. (Laughter.)=20



Thank you for your service to our country. But for me, the greatest legac=
y that you'll leave is that of being a father and a husband -- nobody cou=
ld ever question or argue that this President loves and honors his wife a=
nd children. And so we thank you for your service to our country.=20



I know there have been a lot of great sports programs that have come here=
 to the White House, but as you said, this team is different. We have 32 =
seniors behind us that have volunteered to serve you, to serve our countr=
y, and we're so grateful for that. But behind you is the greatest senior =
class in the history of Navy football, and they are ready and willing to =
serve and to follow you as our Commander-in-Chief and as our head coach.=20=




So thank you. "Fa'afetai tele lava and "mahala nui loa. (Applause.)

<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello,=
 everybody!&nbsp; Please have a seat.&nbsp; Welcome to the White House.&nbs=
p; To Coach Ken and the Navy Midshipmen, I should say welcome back.&nbsp; A=
t this point, you should just add this date to your football schedule every=
 year.&nbsp;
 (Laughter.)&nbsp; Air Force game, Army game, bowl game, White House visit.=
&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We do have some special g=
uests here today that I want to acknowledge.&nbsp; Secretary of the Navy, R=
ay Mabus, is here.&nbsp; We've got Admiral John Richardson.&nbsp; We have S=
uperintendent Ted Carter, Jr., and Athletic Director
 Chet Gladchuk.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, Navy Football has no=
w won the service-academy rivalry 10 of the last 13 years.&nbsp; In that ti=
me, they&#8217;ve won 24 of their last 27 games against Air Force and Army.=
&nbsp; Maybe it&#8217;s a good thing this trophy just stays
 in one place so often, because it's huge. &nbsp;(Laughter.)&nbsp; <o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But I know winning the Co=
mmander-in-Chief Trophy means a lot to this team, and it means a lot to me =
because it shares its name with the most important responsibility that I ha=
ve.&nbsp; No disrespect to Vince Lombardi
 or Lord Stanley, but this trophy means a little more to me personally.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I am the eighth President=
 to award this trophy, and this is the eighth and final time that I will do=
 it -- and what better way than by honoring this historic Naval Academy tea=
m?&nbsp; This squad wasn&#8217;t just the best
 service academy on the gridiron this year -&#8211; it was one of the best =
teams in America.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The team&#8217;s co-capta=
ins, Bernie Serra and Keenan Reynolds, had a couple of mottos that I really=
 like.&nbsp; The first one was &#8220;one-and-oh&#8221; &#8211;- a reminder=
 to take each game one at a time.&nbsp; So they started the season 1-0
 with a 38-point blowout.&nbsp; They went 1-0 against Air Force in another =
rout.&nbsp; For the 14th straight year, they went 1-0 against Army to recla=
im this trophy, and then Navy went 1-0 in the Military Bowl.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All those &#8220;one-and-=
ohs&#8221; added up to 11 wins, which is more than any Navy team in history=
 &#8211;- and Navy&#8217;s been playing football a long time -- about as lo=
ng as we&#8217;ve had the lightbulb.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; In four years,
 these seniors have won more games than any Navy team since the Class of 19=
09.&nbsp;&nbsp; They&#8217;ve won this trophy three times, won three bowl g=
ames, and has anybody here ever lost to Army?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; That'=
s sort of a deafening silence there.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The team&#8217;s second m=
otto that I like is something Coach Ken would remind his players at halftim=
e:&nbsp; &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do anything special -&#8211; just d=
o your job.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Just do your job&#8221; &#8211;- I really l=
ike that slogan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In doing their jobs, thes=
e players did something special.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s especially true for=
 the anchor of this Navy team, Keenan Reynolds, one of college football&#82=
17;s all-time greats.&nbsp; The only quarterback in the 125-year
 history of the Army-Navy rivalry to win the game four times.&nbsp; Holds 1=
1 NCAA records, including most rushing yards by a quarterback.&nbsp; With h=
is 88 touchdowns, no one in college football history has been in the end zo=
ne more times than Navy&#8217;s number 19.&nbsp; And
 in honor of his leadership, both on and off the field, no one will ever we=
ar it again, which is not bad for a guy who started out as the third-string=
 quarterback.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">If you ask him which reco=
rd he&#8217;s most proud of, Keenan will tell you that it&#8217;s the team =
record for wins.&nbsp; Of course he&#8217;d say that.&nbsp; But here&#8217;=
s how I know he means it.&nbsp; When Navy played Memphis in Keenan&#8217;s =
home state
 of Tennessee, hundreds of his friends and relatives came out.&nbsp; They w=
anted to see him break the touchdown record.&nbsp; On Navy&#8217;s last dri=
ve, the Mids were on the 1-yard line.&nbsp; Keenan was one score away.&nbsp=
; Coach called in a QB sneak, but Keenan called an audible
 and tossed a touchdown to running back Demond Brown.&nbsp; So you knew he =
meant it when he said that what he cared about was the team.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Navy also dominated this =
year thanks to Chris Swain &#8211;- or the &#8220;Swain Train&quot; -- (lau=
ghter) -- who racked up 1,000 yards.&nbsp; Austin Grebe, who kicked more ex=
tra points than any Midshipman in history.&nbsp; And the calm and
 quiet wrecking ball at defensive end, Will Anthony, who led the team in sa=
cks.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So these players are just=
 as impressive off the field.&nbsp; In February, Myer Krah went to Flint to=
 hand out water bottles.&nbsp; Just last week, Myer and Troy Thompson visit=
ed with junior high students at Washington Jesuit
 Academy, a first-rate middle school in a low-income community here in D.C.=
&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">E.K. Binns was a finalist=
 for the &#8220;Academic Heisman.&#8221;&nbsp; Wideout Thomas Wilson is a f=
irst-team Academic All-American.&nbsp; But most importantly, in a few month=
s, 17 of these seniors will be Ensigns and 15 will be commissioned
 second lieutenants in the Marine Corps.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">They&#8217;ll be joined i=
n their service by another historic group of Midshipmen who are here today,=
 and I wanted to give them a little bit of credit because we, on this day, =
celebrate football, but we've got a lot of
 extraordinary folks at the Naval Academy, and we are welcoming today the f=
irst students ever to graduate with a degree in cyber ops.&nbsp; And their =
expertise is going to be more critical than ever to our national security, =
so we're very, very proud of them and
 we want to congratulate them.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Look, the rivalry between=
 our service academies can get heated.&nbsp; But it is healthy and rooted i=
n respect.&nbsp; They learn early on what it takes to be the best.&nbsp; An=
d that&#8217;s what matters when you&#8217;re part of the finest
 fighting force that the world has ever seen.&nbsp; As your Commander-in-Ch=
ief, and as one of the Americans you risk your lives to defend, I will cont=
inue to do my best to support all the men and women who have the distinctio=
n of wearing this nation&#8217;s uniform.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">For more than a century, =
Navy&#8217;s mascot has been a goat.&nbsp; After what this year&#8217;s tea=
m accomplished, I think you could say that maybe that stands for &#8220;Gre=
atest of All Time.&#8221;&nbsp; (Laughter.)<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I want to congratulate=
 Navy.&nbsp; Thank you for your service.&nbsp; Good luck getting this thing=
 back to Annapolis -- I don't know if you have, like, a big truck bed that =
you're going to be using.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But most
 importantly, to all of you, I could not be prouder of your commitment and =
your dedication to this nation, to our security, and to our freedom.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">God bless you.&nbsp; God =
bless the United States of America.&nbsp; Let's make sure that we get a goo=
d picture here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Coach, anything you want =
to add here?&nbsp; Come on.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">COACH NIUMATALOLO:&nbsp; =
Thank you.&nbsp; Mr. President, it's always an honor for us to come to the =
White House.&nbsp; We take great pride in the fact that we've been here pre=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Thank you for your servic=

 wife and children.&nbsp; And so we thank you for your service to our count=
ry.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I know there have been a =
lot of great sports programs that have come here to the White House, but as=
 you said, this team is different.&nbsp; We have 32 seniors behind us that =
have volunteered to serve you, to serve our
 country, and we're so grateful for that.&nbsp; But behind you is the great=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
