*Another Day, Another Republican Rejects Trump=E2=80=99s Unpredictable, Ris=
ky and
Divisive Candidacy*


Day after day since Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee
for president, Republicans and conservative commentators continue to reject
his unpredictable, risky and divisive candidacy. Donald Trump has for years
proven himself to be a loose cannon whose hateful language and dangerous
policies will do serious harm to working families and put America=E2=80=99s
security at risk, and Republicans are continuing to acknowledge that a
President Trump would be too big a risk.
