Donald Trump - Bad For Education, Labor & Healthcare

Trump Supports An Anti-Worker Agenda


2015: TRUMP SAID IF GIVEN THE CHOICE, HE WOULD PREFER TO NOT HAVE UNIONS

2015: Trump On Unions: "If I Had My Choice, I Think I'd Take It Without." "Does he support unions? He has had 'great success' in New York building with unions and also in Florida without unions. 'If I had my choice,' he said, 'I think I'd take it without.'" [New York Times, 11/19/15<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/20/donald-trump-says-hed-absolutely-require-muslims-to-register/>]

TRUMP: LOW WAGES ARE AN "ADVANTAGE" OF RIGHT-TO-WORK STATES

Trump On South Carolina As A Right-To-Work State: "One Of The Advantages You Have Is You Have The Lower Wage." QUESTION: "What are your general views on NLRB and the unions?" TRUMP: "Well I watched Boeing and I thought was a disgrace what happened....I thought that was disgraceful. One of the advantages you have is you have the lower wage. Which means you might actually make more money because you don't have to pay all the dues that come with union representation." [Trump Rally, Aiken SC, 12/12/15]

Trump: "Got To Have Right-To-Work [Laws]." SCOTT:  Staying on the jobs front, one of the amazing blessings of being a South Carolinian, and specifically living in North Charleston, is the presence of Boeing in South Carolina.  My friend Jack Gaud has a question about the NLRB who -- who tried to destroy jobs. Talk to us about the right to work and the laws that we have." TRUMP: "Got to have right to work, got to have right to work. What they put you through was incredible actually.  To -- to think that Boeing almost could have said, 'Hey, we're not coming.'" [Tim Scott Town Hall, Columbia SC, 9/23/15]

TRUMP SUPPORTED SCOTT WALKER'S ANTI-LABOR EFFORTS IN WISCONSIN

Trump On Scott Walker's Fight With Unions: "I Think What He's Doing Is Right For His State." LAUER: "You're a good businessman, all right, but how--do--are you willing to take a stand on some key issues? Like in Wisconsin, the governor there talking about limited collective bargaining rights for state employees... Do you--are you in favor of that? Is it something you're for?" TRUMP: "I think each state is different. I think he's a tough guy. He wants to get a balanced budget and he wants to get it quickly. And I can understand exactly what he's doing. I think New York would be an entirely different situation, which is very, very heavily unionized. But I think what he's doing is right for his state." [Today, NBC, 3/2/11]

Trump Stands Against Expanding Educational Opportunities For All

TRUMP ADVOCATED CUTTING OR ELIMINATING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

Donald Trump Called For The Complete Elimination Of The Department Of Education, Or "If We Don't Eliminate It Completely, We Certainly Need To Cut Its Power And Reach." "A lot of people believe the Department of Education should just be eliminated. Get rid of it. If we don't eliminate it completely, we certainly need to cut its power and reach. Education has to be run locally. Common Core, No Child Left Behind, and Race to the Top are all programs that take decisions away from parents and local school boards. These programs allow the progressives in the Department of Education to indoctrinate, not educate, our kids. What they are doing does not fit the American model of governance. I am totally against these programs and the Department of Education. It's a disaster. We cannot continue to fail our children-the very future of this nation." [Trump, Crippled America, 11/3/15]

Trump: "The Department Of Education, You Just Can't Have It." SCOTT: "There are so many departments that need to be scrutinized; FDA, EPA, IRS, one of the questions he has here is where would you start scrutinizing the agency, and can you name a couple?" TRUMP: "Well, EPA is one that's -- you saw a couple of weeks ago, where they opened the door and the river's destroyed, you know, I mean, it wasn't even the people that did it...  And it was the EPA that actually did it, the EPA would be one that you would certainly, at a minimum, cut way, way back and maybe get rid of entirely.  You look at the Department of Education... All over the place, and everybody agrees with me on this and yet you have this massive behemoth, the Department of Education, you just can't have it; it's just ridiculous, I mean, you have local education where the parents can work with the teachers and the principals, that's what it is all about...   So we have all of these problems and yet you're -- you're double in terms - of course we spend the most per-student by far, not even close, and yet we're number 25 and number 28 in the various rating polls; it's crazy, so Department of Education will be another one." [Tim Scott Town Hall, Columbia SC, 9/23/15]

Trump: "We're Going To Cut Spending Big League... We're Going To Cut Department Of Education." TRUMP: "I'm going to cut spending. We're going to cut spending big league. I mean, you look at some... So many -- Department of Education. We're going to cut Department of Education. We spend more money per pupil than any country in the world by far, and we're ranked number 30 in the world." [Morning Joe Town Hall, MSNBC, Charleston SC, 2/17/16]


TRUMP SAID TEACHERS' UNIONS HAD TOO MUCH POWER AND HE WASN'T A FAN OF THEM

Donald Trump: "To Be Upfront, I'm Not A Fan Of The Teacher Unions, But I Have Great Admiration And Respect For Teachers." "To be upfront, I'm not a fan of the teacher unions, but I have great admiration and respect for teachers. Most of us can name a teacher or two who had a profound influence on our lives. But we've made teaching a tough profession. Good teachers love to teach. They respect and honor their profession. In too many classrooms, though, we've taken away their right to discipline disruptive kids, turning the teachers into babysitters as much as educators." [Donald Trump, Crippled America, 56, 11/3/15]

Trump: Teachers' Unions Have Too Much Power And Parents Have Too Little Power. "What stands in the way of the reform we all know is needed? It's the balance of power: Teachers' unions with too much power; parents with too little-less and less power, the lower down the economic income ladder you go." [Donald Trump, The America We Deserve, 1/15/00]

Trump Said He Would Reduce The Power Of Teachers Union. "He would reduce the power of teachers unions, which Trump says stand in the way of school reform ... 'The Brotherhood of Blackboard Workers wants to keep the door closed to competition,' Trump writes. 'That way they can run things as they chose, without review.'" [USA Today, 12/27/99]

TRUMP SAID TEACHERS UNIONS KNEW THEY COULD COUNT ON DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS TO TAKE A STRONG STAND AGAINST SCHOOL CHOICE

Donald Trump: "Our Public Schools Have Grown Up In A Competition-Free Zone, Surrounded By A Very High Union Wall." [Donald Trump, The America We Deserve, 1/15/00]

Trump: Teachers Know They Can Count On Democratic Politicians To Take A Strong Stand Against School Choice. "Our public schools have grown up in a competition-free zone, surrounded by a very high union wall. Why aren't we shocked at the results? After all, teachers' unions are motivated by the same desires that move the rest of us. And they know how to play the political game. With more than 85 percent of their soft-money donations going to Democrats-and with one out of eight delegates at the 1996 Democratic National Convention a member of the NEA or AFT-teachers' unions know they can count on the politicians they back to take a strong stand against school choice. If not, they'll find candidates who will." [Donald Trump, The America We Deserve, 1/15/00]

Donald Trump Appeared To Suggest Charter Schools Would Reduce Class Sizes And Foster More Individualized Instruction Along With Less Standardized Testing, All Of Which He Said Teachers Unions Opposed. "Look, I know that people both for and against school choice can roll out endless arguments and statistics showing charter schools are either very successful or make no difference at all. This is a legitimate debate. But anyone except a politician running for office and looking for support from the teacher unions has to realize that smaller class sizes, more individualized instruction, and stricter discipline all make a huge positive difference. Making teachers accountable is important, but we should stop measuring their performance with mindless standardized tests. We should be embracing the success stories and using them as a model for improving the others." [Donald Trump, Crippled America, 55, 11/3/15]

TRUMP TOUTED IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY THAT HE PUNCHED HIS MUSIC TEACHER IN THE FACE IN SECOND GRADE

Trump Touted In His Autobiography "The Art Of The Deal" That In Second Grade He "Punched" His Music Teacher Because He "Didn't Think He Knew Anything About Music." "He reveled in the attention of thousands when he decked World Wrestling Entertainment chief executive Vince McMahon as he played his role in a mock 'Battle of the Billionaires.' In 'The Art of the Deal,' his 1987 autobiography, he wrote about an altercation in second grade. 'I actually gave a teacher a black eye,' he wrote. 'I punched my music teacher because I didn't think he knew anything about music and I almost got expelled.' Trump, while saying he wasn't proud of his action, excused it by saying it showed he has always been willing to 'stand up and make my opinions known in a very forceful way.'"

Trump Opposes Policies That Make Americans Healthier

TRUMP HAS VOWED TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WITHIN THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF HIS PRESIDENCY

Donald Trump Promised To Ask Congress For The Full Repeal Of The Affordable Care Act Regardless Of The Existence Of A Replacement. "As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. But none of these positive reforms can be accomplished without Obamacare repeal. On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare." [Healthcare Reform to Make America Great Again, Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., 3/2/16<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform>]

Trump Said In His First 100 Days He Would Work On Immediately Repealing And Replacing Obamacare. HANNITY: "Walk me through those 100 days, how fast you think you could act and get on that path, as you say, to make America great?" TRUMP: "Well, I'd do a lot of things very quickly... I would work immediately on 'Obama care' repeal and replace, and we would do something terrific there."  [Hannity, Fox News, 11/3/15]

TRUMP EVEN SUPPORTED TED CRUZ'S GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TO TRY TO DEFUND THE ACA



Trump Credited Ted Cruz's Efforts For Shutting Down The Government To Defund The ACA By Saying If Republicans "Had Stuck Together They Would Have Won That Battle." "On Monday evening, GOP front-runner Trump officially blessed a strategy that would include a rider that defunds Planned Parenthood in a government funding bill. But Democrats have said they would oppose any bill that includes such a defunding rider, which would imperil funding legislation that Congress must pass by Sept. 30. That same strategy was pushed by Cruz in 2013 in an effort to defund Obamacare, culminating in a 16-day government shutdown that did little stymie the president's signature healthcare law. Despite that history, Trump says the GOP should give the uncompromising maneuver another go. Asked directly by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt if it's worth shutting down the federal government to strip Planned Parenthood's $528 million in government funding, Trump replied: 'I would.' And Trump blamed Cruz's colleagues for abandoning him during the fight to defund Obamacare two years ago."

TRUMP'S HEALTH CARE PLAN LACKED DETAIL AND WOULD RESULT IN MORE UNINSURED PEOPLE AND A HIGHER DEFICIT

Huffington Post: Donald Trump's Health Care Plan Would Dramatically Increase The Number Of People Who Would Be Uninsured And Did Not Address Protections For People With Pre-Existing Conditions. "Let's start with what's not in Trumpcare, apart from estimates of how much it would cost and how it would affect the health care system. He seems to have no notion about covering the uninsured -- there are no tax credits or new government programs to help the millions who, without the substantial financial assistance that Obamacare offers, could never afford decent coverage on their own. As a result, Trump's plan would dramatically increase the number of people who would be uninsured by scrapping Obamacare and making cuts to Medicaid. That's despite Trump's repeated assurances that when he's president, nobody will 'die in the streets' due to lack of health care. There's nothing about guaranteeing coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, either, even though he has expressed vague support for these protections in the past." [Huffington Post, 3/3/16<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-obamacare-replacement_us_56d7b3fde4b0ffe6f8e834f1>]

Forbes' Roy: Trump's Health Care Plan "Has The Look And Feel Of Something That A 22-Year-Old Congressional Staffer Would Write For A Backbencher Based On A Cursory Review Of Wikipedia." "But the plan on Trump's campaign website-entitled 'Healthcare Reform to Make America Great Again'-contradicts in important ways what the Donald has claimed to be his health care principles. It has the look and feel of something that a 22-year-old congressional staffer would write for a backbencher based on a cursory review of Wikipedia."

Forbes' Roy: "Trump's Proposal Would Make Healthcare Even Less Affordable Than It Already Is, And Has The Potential To Significantly Increase The Deficit." "Trump's proposal to exclude all health insurance purchases from taxation is a terrible idea. The principal reason why healthcare is so expensive in America is that we heavily subsidize its consumption through the tax code and through entitlement spending, to the tune of $1.8 trillion a year. Trump's proposal would make healthcare even less affordable than it already is, and has the potential to significantly increase the deficit. Spending on Medicare would increase by at least $800 billion over the next decade. The tax changes could increase the deficit by another trillion or so. The end result of Trump's proposed changes would be far fewer people with health insurance, and far costlier healthcare: precisely the opposite of Trump's goal of 'covering everybody' and reducing costs." [Avik Roy, Forbes, 3/3/16<http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2016/03/03/the-most-important-thing-about-donald-trumps-health-reform-plan-is-that-donald-didnt-write-it/#2571ff7730a3>]

TRUMP'S HEALTHCARE PLAN TURNED MEDICAID INTO A BLOCK-GRANT

Trump's Health Care Plan Called For Block-Granting Medicaid To The States To Give The States Incentive "To Seek Out And Eliminate Fraud, Waste And Abuse." "Block-grant Medicaid to the states. Nearly every state already offers benefits beyond what is required in the current Medicaid structure. The state governments know their people best and can manage the administration of Medicaid far better without federal overhead. States will have the incentives to seek out and eliminate fraud, waste and abuse to preserve our precious resources." [Healthcare Reform to Make America Great Again, Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., 3/2/16<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform>]

TRUMP'S PLAN DID NOT ADDRESS PREEXISTING CONDITIONS

Trump's Health Care Plan Does Not Address Coverage For People With Pre-Existing Conditions. "The end result of Trump's proposed changes would be far fewer people with health insurance, and far costlier healthcare: precisely the opposite of Trump's goal of 'covering everybody' and reducing costs. Surprisingly, there's absolutely nothing in the plan about covering people with pre-existing conditions, something that Trump has claimed as one of his highest priorities."

TRUMP BELIEVES THAT VACCINES CAN CAUSE AUTISM IN CHILDREN

Trump: "Vaccines Can Be Very Dangerous... A Lot Of People Feel That The Vaccines Are What Causes Autism In Children." CAVUTO: "And the rap at the time, as you know, Donald, was that we overreacted, we got too hysterical, and we -- we pushed vaccines on people that killed a lot of people, paralyzed a lot of people. Do we risk doing the same now?" TRUMP: "I think you do. And I think the vaccines can be very dangerous. And, obviously, you know, a lot of people are talking about vaccines with children with respect to autism. And every report comes out, like, you know, that does not happen, but a lot of people feel that the vaccines are what causes autism in children." [Your World With Neil Cavuto, Fox News, 4/29/09]

TRUMP SAID IT WOULD BE "VERY TOUGH" FOR BEN CARSON TO HANDLE THE JOB AS PRESIDENT WITH JUST A MEDICAL BACKGROUND

Trump Questioned Whether Ben Carson Could Be President By Just Having Experience As A Doctor. "But despite the rising threat of Carson in Iowa, Trump has not yet attacked the world-renowned neurosurgeon. Asked by TheDC whether being a doctor provides the necessary experience to be president, Trump said while Carson is  'a wonderful guy,' he thinks it would be 'very tough' for someone who spent his life as a surgeon to handle the job. 'I think it's a very difficult situation that he'd be placed in,' Trump elaborated. 'He's really a friend of mine, I just think it's a very difficult situation that he puts himself into, to have a doctor who wasn't creating jobs and would have a nurse or maybe two nurses. It's such a different world. I've created tens of thousands of jobs over the years.'" [Daily Caller, 9/2/15<http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/02/donald-trump-on-ben-carson-doctors-dont-create-jobs/>]

Hi John, Amy forwarded me your email. Here's our basic primer on Trump:


Dangerous Donald Trump Lacks the Judgment or Temperament to be President

Donald Trump's recklessness would hurt our economy, diminish our standing in the world, and make our communities less safe. Trump is dangerous, and he lacks the judgment or temperament to be president.

His impending nomination is a reminder that for years the Republican Party has elevated extreme voices, using divisive campaigns that sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain. And just like Republicans in Washington have done for years, Dangerous Donald is only looking out for himself. His plans would benefit those at the very top and would drag our country back to where we were when the last Republican president left office losing 800,000 jobs a month. The American people can't afford to let him bully his way into the Oval Office.



Dangerous Donald Trump has already damaged America's relationships across the globe. His record of denigrating women has only gotten worse throughout this campaign, at the same time that his divisive rhetoric has made our communities less safe. And his business record is riddled with embarrassing failures that make it clear the American people can't afford to let him get anywhere near the White House.


National Security: Even as a candidate, Dangerous Donald has damaged America's relationships across the globe. In the White House, he would undeniably make America less safe.


*         Donald Trump has no foreign policy experience and rather than seeking the advice of well-respected experts, Trump relies on his own misinformed ideas and in his own words, on his "good brain."

*         Trump has falsely claimed that he knows "more about ISIS than the generals" and recommended that the U.S. military commit international war crimes.

*         Trump's threat to pull back from our most important military alliances<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-and-the-end-of-nato/2016/03/04/e8c4b9ca-e146-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html> like NATO, pull aid from our allies like Israel, and his gushing praise for dictators would put our country on a dangerous path.

*         Trump has refused to rule out using nuclear weapons on European territory, and wants to allow countries that don't currently have nuclear weapons to get them, reversing long-held goals of international nuclear disarmament.

Wrong on Women: Dangerous Donald has a decades-long record of denigrating women and promoting misogyny. His policies would make it harder for women to make their own choices when it comes to their healthcare or their career.

*         Trump once said you had to  treat women "like s**t" and has spent decades doing so himself by calling women names - "fat pig," "slob," or "bimbo" - and saying a man needs a woman to support him at home rather than always be "griping and bitching."

*         Trump would take away a woman's right to make her own healthcare choices and has said women who had abortions should be punished - but not the doctors that performed them - and opposed exceptions for health of the mother because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to have an abortion.

*         Trump thinks ensuring equal pay for women should just be left up to "the marketplace" and once suggested family leave policies should actually be scaled back and noted pregnancy was "an inconvenience for a business." Trump complained that when he employed mothers, they were not giving him "100 percent."

Divisive and Dangerous: Dangerous Donald exploited racial anxieties and cultural fears in the pursuit of getting elected - to the point where his rallies have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the media.

*         Trump spouts hateful and dangerous lies about Muslims and called to surveil mosques, to ban Muslims from entering the country and to create a database of all Muslims in America - including U.S. citizens - and could not answer when pressed on how this would be any different from Nazi Germany.

*         Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" and criminals and said they brought disease into the country, said you needed to check if Native Americans were "real Indians," and claimed that a "well-educated black has a tremendous advantage" - but apparently not an advantage in finding housing in Trump properties, because in the 1970s, the Trump Organization was sued for discriminating against Blacks and Puerto Ricans.

*         Trump has been endorsed by former  KKK leader David Duke, and his candidacy has been used as a recruiting tool for the white supremacist movement, which is no surprise since Trump refused to disavow David Duke and the KKK four times in one interview.

*         Trump has fostered violence against protestors at his rallies, suggesting that a Black Lives Matter protester maybe "should have been roughed up," promising to pay the legal fees if someone would "knock the hell" out of a protester and reminiscing about the old days when a protester would be "carried off on a stretcher."

*         Trump repeatedly threatened the First Amendment by calling to "open up" libel laws so he could sue reporters whenever they printed a story he did not like, made it a practice of banning media outlets he did not like from covering his rallies, and thought "closing" parts of the Internet was a rational strategy to combat ISIS.

Bad at Business, Bad for the Economy: Though he plays the part of a wealthy and successful businessman, Dangerous Donald's real life record is riddled with embarrassing failures and cheap schemes designed to turn a quick buck at the expense of everyday Americans.


*         Despite his tough talk on trade deals and the loss of American jobs, Donald Trump manufactured his clothing line in countries he rails against, like China and Mexico.

*         Dangerous Donald owes everything to the tens of millions of dollars in loans and bailouts he received from his family.

*         Dangerous Donald's businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt, leaving investors, contractors and small businesses holding the bag for his disastrous business decisions.

*         During one of his business bankruptcies, his personal finances were at the mercy of banks who put him on an "allowance" of $400,000 per month.

*         His Trump "University" fleeced thousands of Americans simply looking to get ahead.

*         Trump's unfounded predictions<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/03/trump-predicts-very-massive-recession-in-us.html> of recession under President Obama and warnings against investing in the stock market are reckless.

*         Economists have actually predicted Trump's policies could start an international trade war and even destabilize the global economy<http://www.cbsnews.com/media/is-donald-trump-a-menace-to-the-global-economy/>.

*         Trump's tax plan would overwhelmingly benefit the rich while costing the country $9.5 trillion to implement -- more than any other Republican plan proposed. It also violates his pledge not to increase the national debt.

*         Trump actually said at one of the Republican Party's debates that "wages are too high" and opposed raising the minimum wage

*         Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would jeopardize health care for 20 million Americans who've been able to get coverage under Obamacare.

Republicans couldn't unite against him and failed to stand up to him during their primary because they were playing to the same extreme base of their party. Democrats will be united and hold Donald Trump accountable every day until November 8th.

 teach. They respect and honor their profession. In too many classrooms, though, we&#8217;ve taken away their right to discipline disruptive kids, turning the teachers into babysitters as much as educators.&#8221; [Donald Trump, Crippled America, 56, 11/3/15]<o:p></o:p></p>

 Sept. 30. That same strategy was pushed by Cruz in 2013 in an effort to defund Obamacare, culminating in a 16-day government shutdown that did little stymie the president&#8217;s signature healthcare law. Despite that history, Trump says the GOP should give the
 uncompromising maneuver another go. Asked directly by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt if it&#8217;s worth shutting down the federal government to strip Planned Parenthood&#8217;s $528 million in government funding, Trump replied: &#8216;I would.&#8217; And Trump blamed Cruz&#8217;s

 the substantial financial assistance that Obamacare offers, could never afford decent coverage on their own. As a result, Trump's plan would dramatically increase the number of people who would be uninsured by scrapping Obamacare and making cuts to Medicaid.
