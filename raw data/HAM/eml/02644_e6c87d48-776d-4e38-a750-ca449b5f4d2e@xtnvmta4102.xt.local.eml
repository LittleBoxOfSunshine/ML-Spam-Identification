A former student of House Speaker Dennis Hastert filed a lawsuit Monday demanding that the ex-speaker pay more than $1.8 million to fulfill an agreement he allegedly made to pay $3.5 million to compensate for sexual abuse committed against the man three decades ago.

The lawsuit refers to the man suing Hastert simply as "James Doe," but the events outlined in the suit make clear he is the "Individual A" referred to in a federal indictment of Hastert last year for illegally structuring bank withdrawals and lying to the FBI. Hastert pleaded guilty to the structuring charge and is set to be sentenced on that charge Wednesday.

In the new lawsuit, the alleged victim says Hastert sexually abused him at a motel on a wrestling trip he organized as a coach, leading to a lifetime of problems. "For many years to follow, Plaintiff suffered severe panic attacks which lead [sic] to periods of unemployment, career changes, bouts of depression, hospitalization, and long-term psychiatric treatment," the suit says.

Federal officials say Hastert paid out $1.7 million before he was confronted by the FBI in 2014 over the unusual cash withdrawals. A court filing earlier this month related to Hastert's sentencing revealed that the alleged victim was still pressing for the remainder of the alleged settlement.

The suit was filed Monday in county court in Yorkville, Ill., the same town where Hastert taught and coached from 1965 to 1981. The complaint describes Doe as an Illinois resident and calls Hastert a "trusted friend of Doe's family."

A lawyer for Hastert did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on the newly-filed suit.
