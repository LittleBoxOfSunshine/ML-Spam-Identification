A few recent quotes by the ADL and others on Trump:



THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE CRITICIZED TRUMP FOR BEING SLOW TO DENOUNCE WHITE SUPREMACISTS



Anti-Defamation League's Jonathan Greenblatt: "The Onus Is Now On Donald Trump To Make Unequivocally Clear He Rejects Those Sentiments And That There Is No Room For Duke And Anti-Semitism In His Campaign And In Society. Mr. Trump Can And Should Speak Up Now. If Not, His Silence Will Speak Volumes." [New York Times, 5/5/16<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/05/donald-trump-is-pressured-to-reject-david-dukes-remarks-on-jewish-extremists/>]


At The Prompting Of The Anti-Defamation League, Trump Denounced David Duke's Anti-Semetic Remarks: "Antisemitism Has No Place Our Society, Which Needs To Be United, Not Divided." "Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement that 'David Duke's latest remarks - smearing Jews and Jewish Republicans specifically - are as unsurprising as they are hateful.' 'The onus is now on Donald Trump to make unequivocally clear he rejects those sentiments and that there is no room for Duke and anti-Semitism in his campaign and in society,' he said. 'Mr. Trump can and should speak up now. If not, his silence will speak volumes.' Later Thursday, Mr. Trump said in a statement that he 'totally disavows' Mr. Duke's remarks. 'Antisemitism has no place our society, which needs to be united, not divided,' said Mr. Trump, who has been accused of using overtly racial appeals to motivate his largely white, working-class political base. The Anti-Defamation League has criticized Mr. Trump before, and has redirected his previous donations to the group because of his remarks about Muslims and others. Mr. Trump has often cited his ties to the Jewish community, noting, for instance, that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is an Orthodox Jew, and that his daughter, Ivanka, converted to Judaism."

JULIA IOFFE RECEIVED ANTI-SEMITIC ABUSE FROM TRUMP SUPPORTERS AFTER DONALD TRUMP CRITICIZED HER GQ PROFILE OF HIS WIFE, MELANIA


HEADLINE: "Journalist Who Profiled Melania Trump Hit With Barrage Of Antisemitic Abuse." [The Guardian, 4/28/16<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/28/julia-ioffe-journalist-melania-trump-antisemitic-abuse?CMP=share_btn_fb>]



Journalist Julia Ioffe Received Antisemetic And Threatening Messages From Trump Supporters After GQ Published Ioffe's Profile Of Melania Trump. "Journalist Julia Ioffe has experienced this kind of harassment before: in Vladimir Putin's Russia. In the 24 hours since her profile of Donald Trump's wife, Melania, appeared in GQ magazine, the Russian-American journalist has received a torrent of antisemitic, vitriolic and threatening messages from supporters of the Republican frontrunner."

Twitter Users Superimposed Julia Ioffe's Face On A Mug Shot From Auschwitz. "On Thursday, Ioffe answered a phone call from an anonymous caller who played a Hitler speech. She received another call from 'Overnight Caskets'. On Twitter, users posted photos of her face superimposed on a mug shot from Auschwitz."

NEITHER DONALD NOR MELANIA TRUMP WOULD CONDEMN THEIR SUPPORTERS FOR ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACKS ON IOFFE


Donald Trump Refused To Condemn The Hateful Language Used By His Supporters. "No one interviewed by POLITICO accused Trump of anti-Semitism, but multiple people pointed to his most extreme supporters - and his unwillingness, at times, to condemn them - as sources of concern for Jewish voters across the political spectrum. Trump has also faced criticism for being slow to condemn the Ku Klux Klan. Asked whether all of that should give Jewish voters pause, Greenblatt replied, 'yeah,' noting the anti-Semitic online abuse from self-described Trump supporters that a journalist (who is also a POLITICO magazine writer) faced after writing a profile of Melania Trump that the candidate's wife criticized. Trump refused to condemn the vitriol from those supporters when asked about it directly on CNN. 'The kind of anti-Semitic invective they used was so frightening,' Greenblatt said." [Politico, 5/16/16<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-jewish-republicans-223196>]

Melania Trump On Anti-Semitic Threats Received By A GQ Reporter Who Wrote A Profile On Her: "She Provoked Them." "I can't help but wonder what kind of hate speech her supporters might unleash on me for asking a few pointed questions. A GQ reporter who dug into her family's past-turning up the existence of a secret 50-year-old half-brother in her native Slovenia whom her father has never acknowledged-was subjected to anti-Semitic threats online. Of the GQ article, Melania says: 'I have thick skin. It doesn't bother me if they write about me because I know who I am. But what right does the reporter have to go and dig in court in Slovenia in 1960 about my parents? They're private citizens. If they go after me, it's different. But to do that, it's a little bit nasty, it's a little bit mean.' So if people put a swastika on my face once this article comes out, will she denounce them? 'I don't control my fans,' Melania says, 'but I don't agree with what they're doing. I understand what you mean, but there are people out there who maybe went too far. She provoked them.'" [DuJour, 5/17/16<http://dujour.com/news/melania-trump-interview/>]


Anti-Defamation League's Jonathan Greenblatt Noted "The Anti-Semitic Invective" Used By Trump Supporter Against Journalists That Trump Criticized. "No one interviewed by POLITICO accused Trump of anti-Semitism, but multiple people pointed to his most extreme supporters - and his unwillingness, at times, to condemn them - as sources of concern for Jewish voters across the political spectrum. Trump has also faced criticism for being slow to condemn the Ku Klux Klan.

Trump refused to condemn the vitriol from those supporters when asked about it directly on CNN. 'The kind of anti-Semitic invective they used was so frightening,' Greenblatt said. 'To his credit, Mr. Trump, after we did a statement, ... he called out anti-Semitism, which was great. We'd like to see him speak out in loud and clear and unambiguous ways against all forms of prejudice with the same level of energy he brings to the campaign trail.' Michael Goldfarb, who co-founded the conservative Emergency Committee for Israel, said that while Trump's more moderate stances on some domestic issues might appeal to typically liberal Jewish voters, his reluctance to distance himself from his most bigoted supporters is disqualifying in many Jewish circles. 'He's a squish on the social issues and a squish on the fiscal issues, so he solves some of the problems the party has typically had bringing liberal Jews into the fold,' Goldfarb said. 'On the other hand, his most rabid supporters enjoy photoshopping Jewish reporters into concentration camp scenes and ranting about Jewish control of the media and the banks, so it probably ends up a wash. Trump's energized the anti-Semites and he shows no interest in disabusing them of the idea that he's their man. ... Until and unless he does, he probably underperforms with the Jews.'"

SEVERAL GROUPS NOTED THE ENERGIZING EFFECT TRUMP'S RHETORIC HAS HAD ON THE WHITE NATIONALIST MOVEMENT

ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt On "America First": "Choosing A Call To Action Historically Associated With Incivility And Intolerance Seems Ill-Advised." " "The Hill reported Thursday that the slogan was common among U.S. anti-Semites who wanted the nation to stay out of World War II prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941. 'For many Americans, the term 'America First' will always be associated with and tainted by this history. In a political season that already has prompted a national conversation about civility and tolerance, choosing a call to action historically associated with incivility and intolerance seems ill-advised,' said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt in a statement."

Southern Poverty Law Center's Potok: "Trump's Candidacy Has Absolutely Electrified The Radical Right." "Mr. Trump's rejections have failed to deter support from leaders of what civil-rights groups label "right-wing hate groups.'  These groups' websites, radio shows and podcasts are filled with praise for Mr. Trump's views on immigration, appeals to vote for him and calls to volunteer for his campaign. Some white nationalist leaders have boasted online about attending his rallies, either as supporters or as journalists, and say the traffic on their websites is increasing since the rise of Mr. Trump. 'Trump's candidacy has absolutely electrified the radical right,' said Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil-rights organization that tracks extremist groups."

American Way's Montgomery: "White Supremacists And White Nationalists Have Been Marginalized In Our Political Discourse, But Trump's Campaign Is Bringing Them Out Of The Woodwork And Making It Easier For Them Say Certain Things." "Mr. Trump's allies say he can't control who backs him, and he is wary of drawing more attention to their rhetoric, said the Rev. Darrell Scott, a black pastor in Cleveland and the chief executive of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, a multiracial, multiethnic group of supporters. 'I don't think he wants to make an issue of white supremacists,' Mr. Scott said. 'Any radical element of society that says they like Trump gets the opportunity for media coverage, and he doesn't want to magnify that.' Civil-rights groups say Mr. Trump, despite his disavowals, has sent signals to people who hold racist views. His posture toward immigrants also has been repudiated by many leaders in his own party.' 'White supremacists and white nationalists have been marginalized in our political discourse, but Trump's campaign is bringing them out of the woodwork and making it easier for them say certain things,' said Peter Montgomery, senior fellow at the People for the American Way, a liberal group."

Story in link has screenshots of the tweets. This is not the first reporter to get anti-Semitic threats after covering Trump. When asked about it previously Trump had "no message" for his supporters sending Ioffe death threats and Melania claimed the reporter "provoked" it



New York Times staffer tweets out op-ed critical of Trump, faces anti-Semitic avalanche<https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/05/19/new-york-times-staffer-tweets-out-op-ed-critical-of-trump-faces-anti-semitic-avalanche/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter>
Washington Post - Erik Wemple

Last night, Jonathan Weisman tweeted out an opinion piece from The Post by Robert Kagan: "This is how fascism comes to America." Via Trump, that is. "This is how fascism comes to America, not with jackboots and salutes (although there have been salutes, and a whiff of violence) but with a television huckster, a phony billionaire, a textbook egomaniac 'tapping into' popular resentments and insecurities, and with an entire national political party - out of ambition or blind party loyalty, or simply out of fear - falling into line behind him," writes Kagan.

A deputy Washington editor at the Times, Weisman included a portion of that sentence in his tweet - along with another tweet on a related topic - and let it fly. Hatred responded.


The Southern Poverty Law Center, among many other Twitter observers, took note of Weisman's efforts to highlight this scourge:

On Twitter and other social-media platforms, it can be difficult to determine who supports whom. Yes, several of the people making anti-Semitic statements had references to the presumptive GOP nominee in their Twitter IDs and photos, though those references could mean anything. What has been clear for some time is that criticizing Trump while being Jewish is a hazardous online activity. On Daily Wire, Ben Shapiro, a prominent conservative commentator, documented the anti-Semitic backlash that followed his own opinionating about Trump. And cited more from where that came:


It's not just me, of course. Jake Tapper of CNN now says he's received anti-Semitic tweets "all day." My friend Bethany Mandel, another orthodox Jew who opposes Trump, just bought herself a gun out of fear of unhinged Trump supporters. John Podhoretz of Commentary says he receives tweets consistently from "literally neo-Nazi White supremacists, all anonymous...I don't think I can attribute being a supporter of Trump to being a validator or an expresser of these opinions, but something was let loose by him." Noah Rothman of Commentary tweets, "It never ends. Blocking doesn't help either. They have lists, on which I seem to find myself."

Shapiro Wednesday offered a further exploration at National Review under the headline, "Trump's Anti-Semitic Supporters." He writes: "I've experienced more pure, unadulterated anti-Semitism since coming out against Trump's candidacy than at any other time in my political career. Trump supporters have threatened me and other Jews who hold my viewpoint. They've blown up my e-mail inbox with anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. They greeted the birth of my second child by calling for me, my wife, and two children to be thrown into a gas chamber."

As this blog reported, journalist Julia Ioffe filed a police report after receiving anti-Semitic threats stemming from the backlash against her story in GQ about Melania Trump. "The Trumps have a record of kind of whistling their followers into action," Ioffe said at the time.

 of a secret 50-year-old half-brother in her native Slovenia whom her father has never acknowledged&#8212;was subjected to anti-Semitic threats online. Of the GQ article, Melania says: &#8216;I have thick skin. It doesn&#8217;t bother me if they write about me because I know
 who I am. But what right does the reporter have to go and dig in court in Slovenia in 1960 about my parents? They&#8217;re private citizens. If they go after me, it&#8217;s different. But to do that, it&#8217;s a little bit nasty, it&#8217;s a little bit mean.&#8217; So if people put a
 swastika on my face once this article comes out, will she denounce them? &#8216;I don&#8217;t control my fans,&#8217; Melania says, &#8216;but I don&#8217;t agree with what they&#8217;re doing.

 ... he called out anti-Semitism, which was great. We&#8217;d like to see him speak out in loud and clear and unambiguous ways against all forms of prejudice with the same level of energy he brings to the campaign trail.&#8217; Michael Goldfarb, who co-founded the conservative
 Emergency Committee for Israel, said that while Trump&#8217;s more moderate stances on some domestic issues might appeal to typically liberal Jewish voters, his reluctance to distance himself from his most bigoted supporters is disqualifying in many Jewish circles.
 &#8216;He&#8217;s a squish on the social issues and a squish on the fiscal issues, so he solves some of the problems the party has typically had bringing liberal Jews into the fold,&#8217; Goldfarb said. &#8216;On the other hand, his most rabid supporters enjoy photoshopping Jewish
 reporters into concentration camp scenes and ranting about Jewish control of the media and the banks, so it probably ends up a wash. Trump&#8217;s energized the anti-Semites and he shows no interest in disabusing them of the idea that he&#8217;s their man. ... Until and
 unless he does, he probably underperforms with the Jews.&#8217;&#8221; [Politico, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-jewish-republicans-223196">

 the anti-Semitic backlash that followed his own opinionating about Trump. And cited more from where that came:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
