Even if he dresses like Hillary Clinton, Donald still can't use the bathroo=
m with little girls. <--- he's used this line a couple of times. It's coupl=
ed with his criticism of Trump's stance on the NC anti-LGBT bill
Donald Trump is not shy about telling people how big, strong and tough he i=
s. If he's so tough, he needs to stop hiding in Trump towers and answer the=
 questions that voters have.

--

This election will come down to jobs, freedom and security.
Cruz: lift the boot of the necks of small business.
Cruz: If I am elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. We=
 will pass health insurance that's personal, portable and affordable. We wi=
ll pass a simple flat tax so that every American can fill out our taxes on =
a postcard. After we do that, we should abolish the IRS.
Cruz: we're going to rein in the EPA, federal agencies that have descended =
like locusts killing jobs all across the country.
We're going stop amnesty, secure the border. We're going to end sanctuary c=
ities, welfare benefits for those here illegally. Goes on to say that will =
bring back manufacturing jobs from China and Mexico. We're going to see man=
ufacturing jobs coming back
Next important thing at stake is freedom. Says two branches hang in the bal=
ance in this election. Goes on to talk about different rights at stake if a=
nother liberal Supreme Court justice is appointed. Guns rights, religious l=
iberty and sovereignty.
Hits Trump for suggesting he would compromise religious liberty and second =
amendment rights to keep and bear arms. Adds that he's been supporting left=
 wing Democratic politicians for 40 years.
Cruz: I give you my solemn commitment that every justice I appoint will be =
a principled constitutionalist that will protect the Bill of Rights. I will=
 not compromise your religious liberty or right to keep and bear arms.
Cruz hits Trump for saying he would be neutral between Israel and the Pales=
tinians. Adds that he will stand unapologetically with Israel.
Talks about how readiness and morale in the military has plummeted. Goes on=
 to talk about how he will rebuild the military by repealing Obamacare, ado=
pting a flat tax and stopping amnesty.
Cruz: no longer will our military be governed by political correctness. Cri=
ticizes President Obama for not saying radical Islamic terrorism.
Cruz: We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. To the jihadist, your day o=
f reckoning is coming. To ISIS: we're not coming to negotiate with you or r=
ead you your rights; we're coming to kill you. Speaks out against the rules=
 of engagement that he says is tying the hands of our military men and wome=
n.
Cruz: If military force is needed we should use overwhelming force, kill th=
e enemy and get the heck out.
We started with 17 candidates, young dynamic candidates. Democratic field c=
onsist of a wild-eyed socialist with views that are dangerous for America a=
nd the world and Bernie Sanders.
Cruz: We're seeing Republicans coming together and uniting behind this camp=
aign. 60-75% of Republicans recognize that nominating Donald Trump would be=
 a train wreck.
Touts the fact that 5 of 17 presidential candidates have endorsed his campa=
ign.
Hits Trump for not wanting to debate.

Gaggle

Hits Trump for not wanting to debate and not having solutions to the issues=
.

Cruz: we're all in on Indiana. Indiana is a crossroad. It's big news that J=
ohn Kasich has decided to pull out of Indiana, giving us the opportunity to=
 go head-to-head with Trump.  We made the decision about allocating resourc=
es. We're at a fork in the road. If Trump is the nominee, Hillary wins by d=
ouble digits. We lose the Senate and the Supreme Court. Trump losing would =
also cost seats in the state of Indiana. If Donald Trump is the nominee, Hi=
llary wins and she will bankrupt the coal industry.

Cruz: we had both conversations and both campaigns agreed. We're focused on=
 Indiana and Kasich is focused elsewhere. On whether it's desperation, Cruz=
 says he doesn't doubt that Donald will scream, yell and curse. People got =
excited because Trump won his home state. Touts his victories in previous c=
ontests. On whether it's a hail mary, Cruz says it's abundantly clear that =
we're headed to a contested convention. Calls Trump a minority and fringe c=
andidate. Adds that Republicans are uniting behind his campaign.

Cruz: we need a president in the spirit of Mitch Daniels and Mike Pence.

Cruz: From day one, I've been an outsider. The voters can ask who has stood=
 up and led the fight against the Washington cartel. Hits Trump for funding=
 the gang of eight while he was fighting against it. On whether he's collud=
ing with Kasich, Cruz says Trump is a sore loser. Says his response is to a=
ttack the voters. Notes how Trump would rather hide in Trump towers and sta=
y in the NE states that tend to be more liberal.

The entire Trump campaign is run by the Washington lobbyist. Again hits Tru=
mp for not showing up to debate. "This is a fraud" Cruz says when he descri=
bes Trump openly stating that he's not going to do what he says he's going =
to do.

Notes how it would be a disaster to nominate Donald Trump. Highlights Trump=
's comment of wanting to punish women for having an abortion.
