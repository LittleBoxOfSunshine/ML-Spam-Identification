FIRST THOUGHTS.
*** Risky Business: Why calling Trump =93risky=94 won=92t work for Democrat=
s: Earlier this week while campaigning in Kentucky, Hillary Clinton slammed=
 Donald Trump for being =93a loose cannon=94 and for his =93risky=94 talk. =
She said<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/279975-clin=
ton-rails-against-trumps-reckless-risky-talk>, "I=92ve never heard such rec=
kless, risky talk from somebody about to be a nominee for president than I=
=92ve heard from Donald Trump when it comes to nuclear weapons.=94 But ther=
e=92s a downside for calling someone risky -- you=92re suggesting that he b=
rings some potential benefits, too. As Guy Cecil, who=92s heading the pro-C=
linton Super PAC Priorities USA, told Politico:<http://www.politico.com/sto=
ry/2016/05/donald-trump-clinton-super-pac-223245> =93I frankly don=92t thin=
k =91risky=92 captures it, because =91risk=92 implies potential upside.=94 =
Strikingly, Clinton yesterday dropped the risky/loose cannon rhetoric and b=
luntly said that Trump isn=92t qualified<http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-new=
s/video/clinton-trump-is-not-qualified-to-be-president-689204291753> in her=
 interview with CNN. =93I think in this past week -- whether it's attacking=
 Great Britain, praising the leader of North Korea, a despotic dictator who=
 has nuclear weapons, whether it is saying 'pull out of NATO,' 'let other c=
ountries have nuclear weapons' -- the kinds of positions he is stating and =
the consequences of those positions, and even the consequences of his state=
ments, are not just offensive to people. They are potentially dangerous,=94=
 she said.

*** Republicans are beginning to come home to Trump: Here=92s the bad news =
for Trump in the latest New York Times/CBS poll: He=92s trailing Hillary Cl=
inton nationally by six points, 47%-41%, though that=92s down from 50%-40% =
last month. But here=92s the good news: Republicans are starting to rally a=
round him since becoming the party=92s presumptive presidential nominee. In=
 the poll<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnyt-national-poll-hillary-clintons=
-lead-over-donald-trump-narrows/>, Republicans back him 85%-6% in the match=
up against Clinton, versus Democrats who are supporting Clinton by an 88%-5=
% clip; independents are split, 40%-40% between the two candidates. Also as=
 the New York Times highlights<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/us/politic=
s/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-poll.html?hp&action=3Dclick&pgtype=3DHomepag=
e&clickSource=3Dstory-heading&module=3Dfirst-column-region&region=3Dtop-new=
s&WT.nav=3Dtop-news>, =93Eight in 10 Republican voters say their leaders sh=
ould support Mr. Trump even if they disagree with him on important issues. =
And unfavorable views toward Mr. Trump among Republican voters have plummet=
ed 15 percentage points since last month; 21 percent now express an unfavor=
able view of him, down from 36 percent in April.=94 But there are still som=
e danger signs for the GOP: 84% of Republicans in the NYT/CBS poll say thei=
r party is divided, and 43% are mostly discouraged about the GOP=92s future=
. That=92s compared with 48% of Democrats who believe their party is divide=
d, and 17% discouraged about its future. So Republicans are consolidating a=
round Trump, but there are still significant wounds inside the party

*** Clinton: =93I will be the nominee for my party=94: Also in Clinton=92s =
interview with CNN yesterday, she was equally blunt in her talk about Berni=
e Sanders. When CNN=92s Chris Cuomo used the words =93if you=92re the nomin=
ee of your party,=94 Clinton interjected, =93I will be the nominee for my p=
arty=85 There is no way that I won=92t be.=94 And while she said she =93ver=
y disturbed=94 what by happened at the Nevada state Democratic convention b=
y Sanders supporters, per MSNBC=92s Alex Seitz-Wald, Clinton said she was c=
onfident the party would unite. But she added that Sanders must do his part=
 to unite the party -- just like she did in 2008. In response to Clinton=92=
s assertion that she will be the nominee, the Sanders campaign fired off th=
is rocket: =93In the past three weeks, voters in Indiana, West Virginia, an=
d Oregon respectfully disagreed with Secretary Clinton=85 [I]t is clear tha=
t millions of Americans have growing doubts about the Clinton campaign.=94 =
Here=92s the updated delegate math after awarding Sanders the final three p=
ledged delegates out of Oregon:

In pledged delegates, Clinton currently holds a lead of 274 delegates
Clinton 1,771 (54%)
Sanders 1,497 (46%)

Clinton must win 32% of remaining pledged delegates to get a majority in pl=
edged delegates
Sanders must win 68% of remaining pledged delegates to get a majority in pl=
edged delegates

In overall delegates (pledged + super), Clinton holds an overall lead of 76=
2 delegates
Clinton 2,298 (60%)
Sanders 1,536 (40%)

Clinton must win 9% of remaining delegates to reach 2,383 magic number
Sanders must win 91% of remaining delegates to reach 2,383 magic number

*** Trump addresses the NRA: NBC=92s Alex Jaffe previews<http://www.nbcnews=
.com/politics/2016-election/trump-aims-assure-wary-gun-rights-supporters-nr=
a-speech-n577296> Donald Trump=92s speech today to the National Rifle Assoc=
iation. =93Donald Trump will have another chance to reassure wary conservat=
ives still reluctant to back a candidate who once expressed support for an =
assault weapons ban and contributed to anti-gun Democrats when he speaks at=
 the National Rifle Association's national convention Friday. Since express=
ing support for the ban and a longer waiting period for gun purchases in 20=
00, Trump's done an about-face on the issue. He's since called gun bans =91=
a total failure,=92 opposed an expansion of background checks and called fo=
r concealed carry permits to be valid across all 50 states. He's also vowed=
 to eliminate gun-free zones in schools and on military bases on his first =
day in office, and never fails to emphasize the importance of the Second Am=
endment during a stump speech.

*** This doesn=92t inspire confidence in the Trump campaign: After earlier =
having a California delegate who was a white nationalist (and who now won=
=92t be attending the convention), the Trump campaign yesterday faced this =
news<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/md-trump-delegate-indict=
ed-child-pornography-weapons-charges-n577051>: =93A Maryland man selected t=
o be a delegate for Donald Trump has been indicted on charges of child porn=
ography as well as the illegal possession of a machine gun and the illegal =
transportation of explosives. The Department of Justice announced Thursday =
that Caleb Andrew Bailey of Waldorf, Maryland, had been indicted by a feder=
al grand jury. He is charged with using a minor to produce child pornograph=
y for a period of time from March 2015 to January 2016, as well as with pos=
sessing child pornography.=94 The Trump campaign released this statement, "=
We strongly condemn these allegations and leave it in the capable hands of =
law enforcement," spokesman Hope Hicks said Thursday. "He will be replaced =
immediately." The question is whether these kinds of stories are residual p=
roblems from the pre-Manafort days, or if they=92re still ongoing problems.

CLINTON: She said<http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/clinton-trump-i=

people familiar with the discussions. But growing mistrust between Sanders =
