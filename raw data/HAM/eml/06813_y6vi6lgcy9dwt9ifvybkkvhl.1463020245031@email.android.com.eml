Hi Erik, I=92m connecting you here with Bill Sammon who is the Vice Preside=
nt of News and Washington Managing Editor for Fox News Channel. As you know=
 Fox recently hosted Senators Clinton and Sanders for a Town Hall. Bill and=
 his team led that effort, and they are interested in being considered for =
the possible additional May debate. I had a good conversation with Bill yes=
terday and laid out the process, so I wanted to make sure he=92s in touch w=
ith you directly.



Thanks, - Luis.
