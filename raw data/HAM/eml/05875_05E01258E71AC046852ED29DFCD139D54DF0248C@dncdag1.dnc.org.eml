FYI - Weaver responded to the Chair's comments yesterday about Democrats picking the Party's nominee. He insists we should let independents vote: Watch here<https://toolbox.dnc.org/?tool_name=vantage%20uploader&path=vantageuploader.dnc.org/videos/shared_show?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE0NjIyOTIxMTQsImVtYWlsIjoiamFrdWJpZWNtQGRuYy5vcmciLCJpZCI6MzE0ODQ4LCJkb3dubG9hZGFibGUiOnRydWV9.uwrLGkJXT5VOkJyuzcX3q-KB6ZZ6fvQ2OocCWPM05jw>


>>> Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton locked in a tight race in Indiana. So how is Sanders feeling today about his chances? Let's find out. Campaign manager Jeff weaver is joining me right now. Jeff, thank you so much for coming in.

>> My pleasure, Kate. I'm going to have a hard time following up what was just on the air, but go ahead.

>> I've had a hard time following up on everything that's been on the air today. It's been quite a show. Let's talk about chances in Indiana. How's it looking for your guy?

>> Well, look. The senator has been there the last few days. He had a ton of rallies. Gigantic rallies. A lot of enthusiasm for him. I think he's going to do very well tonight.

>> Does well mean win?

>> Well, we certainly could win. People come out, we'll certainly win in Indiana, absolutely, but it depends on people coming out. People got to go to the polls.

>> What does a loss mean for you guys going forward? You saw on "The New York Times" in the editorial board basically writing an obituary for you guys this morning.

>> Well, what I took from that piece, Kate, was that Bernie Sanders is bringing in tremendous amounts of young people and new people in the democratic party. He's talking about the issues that the democratic party is going to have to adopt if it wants to be successful in the election. That there's a tremendous amount of disenfranchisement with players and if the democratic party wants to reach out and broaden its base and become a winning party on a consistent basis up and down the ballot, it's going to have to adopt a lot of the platform that Bernie Sanders was talking about in the campaign. That's what I took away from the article.

>> Let's talk about the DNC. You guys do tout your strength among independent voters. I've heard you say that many times. Chairwoman of the democratic party, Debbie wasserman-schultz said the party's nominee, in your view, should be chosen by members of the party.

[11:54:46 AM]

That does not include independents. What would you say?

>> There are an increasing number of independents including people who vote Democrat every time but self-identify as independents. They're disproportionally young people. And if you want to engage in a path that's going to disenfranchise the young people who affiliate with the democratic party, that's a recipe for disaster. We want young people to have an affinity in the party and participate. And also, it's a good test in the primary system for general election strength. As you know, you can't win a general election with just Democrats. You have to have independents.

>> You think the chairwoman is wrong?

>> She's definitely wrong, absolutely. It's a recipe for a small party, a more insular party, a party that's more out of touch with the broader base of the American people including the broad base of independent democratically leaning independents, who, as I said, vote democratic all the time. There's a lot of young people who fall into this category. Millions who vote democratic but self-identify as independents and to push those people away endangers the long-term health of the democratic party.

>> Jeff weaver. Bernie Sanders campaign manager.
