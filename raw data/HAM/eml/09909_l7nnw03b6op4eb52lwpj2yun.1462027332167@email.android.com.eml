Look good?


On-the-record: "The DNC offered to engage in the same joint fundraising eff=
orts with all the major presidential candidates early in the cycle and we w=
elcome the efforts of the candidates to help raise money for the DNC and st=
ate parties now to ensure we can build out the infrastructure to win in Nov=
ember."

Background: The funds raised help with critical investments in infrastructu=
re, maintaining the DNC=92s national voter file, and bolstering our researc=
h, communications and digital capabilities, all of which will help elect De=
mocrats up and down the ballot in November and strengthen state parties acr=
oss the country. You can find some of our efforts in the overview of our De=
mocratic Victory Task Force report that came out in November 2015.
