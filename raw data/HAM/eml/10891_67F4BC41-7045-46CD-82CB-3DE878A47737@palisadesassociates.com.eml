Subject: Platform Committee Inquiry


I received an email from a political reporter for Slate who wants to ask qu=
estions about the Platform Committee and how it is going to resolve dispute=
s between the Sanders and Clinton forces.

My instinct is to tell him that I have nothing to say on the subject at thi=
s time, given the primaries are still ongoing.

I could say something about how the party is pretty close on almost all iss=
ues, so I expect things to get resolved quickly and amicably and for there =
to be a platform all Democrats, regardless of preferred primary candidate, =
can get behind.

In the end, though, it is the DNC's show, so I thought I should ask your gu=
idance.

Thanks,

Greg
