Subject: Supplemental travel pool report - bilat with General Secretary o=
f Vietnamese Communist Party

Pool was rushed into the room in the Communist Party headquarters where P=
OTUS was meeting with the General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong of the Commu=
nist Party of Vietnam, his third of the day, after meeting with the presi=
dent and prime minister.

They sat in a wide room, with a red-and-yellow designed carpet, a very la=
rge gold bust of Ho Chi Minh behind them with a display of white and pink=
 flowers. More of those flowers were on the table behind them. They sat b=
etween what appeared to be two manicured trees on either side of them.

On the American side, the delegation included Secretary of State John Ker=
ry, national security adviser Susan Rice and US Trade Representative Mike=
 Froman.

Nguyen Phu Trong spoke first, in Vietnamese, through a translator. The tr=
anslator's voice was easier to hear, as she was on a microphone.

"Mr. President, it is a great honor and pleasure to me to meet you again =
and a pleasure for me to welcome you to the headquarters of the Communist=
 Party on the occasion of your first visit to Vietnam"

"once again I'd like to extend to you and the US government my thanks for=
 the warm reception that the US government and yourself gave to me person=
ally in my visit to the United States in July 2015.

"the visit has left me with deep impressions about the beautiful landscap=
e, the people and ... especially the successful outcomes of the meeting b=
etween you and me in the Oval Office in the White House

"We highly appreciate and welcome the visit of the president to Vietnam. =
This is your very first visit to our country, I believe it a very histori=
c visit which will open up a new chapter"

"Mr. President, I would like to know your impression, your first impressi=
on of our country

POTUS responded at some length, also pausing at points for his translator=
 to keep pace. Some quotes that could be heard:

"I want to thank you for the excellent hospitality you've provided to me =
and to our delegation. I have to say my impressions are excellent, the pe=
ople are warm and welcoming to us"

"underscores why I think it's so important for us to continue" developing=
 the relationship with Vietnam

"As you noted, we had a very instructive meeting in the Oval Office ... t=
hat served as additional impetus for what can be done," mentioning arms, =
people to people contact and more.

Nguyen Phu Trong then spoke briefly again, and the pool-along with many r=
owdy Vietnamese press still and video cameras-was ushered out.

While waiting in the hold, pool saw POTUS walk into the lobby after the b=
ilateral ended, continuing to speak with Vietnamese officials. He posed f=
or photos with many of the tea ladies and other staff from the headquarte=
rs, several of whom captured the moments themselves with selfies on their=
 phones.
