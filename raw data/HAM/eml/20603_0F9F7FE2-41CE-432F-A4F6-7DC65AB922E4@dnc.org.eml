We in no way shape or form meant to disrespect or undervalue the work you all have done and continue to do. Moving forward this won't happen again. I'd  like to comp you two free spaces  for you and a guest if you are free that day? If I come on the trip Id appreciate the chance to hear from you and meet you in person as well even if not at the event. Thank you much!
