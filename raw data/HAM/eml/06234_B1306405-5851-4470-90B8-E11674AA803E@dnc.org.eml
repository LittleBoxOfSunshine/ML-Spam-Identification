Rep Michael McCaul

Many signs point to terrorism

Concerned about security at ME airports like Cairo. Concerned about inside job.

Greatest hits against obama/Hillary on ISIS. JV team, Libya failed state, etc.

Sponsored SAFE Act. Need to look at getting from countries

Don't think you can ban an entire population from coming into United States.

Can't rule out terror. We are participating in search. Black box hasn't been found.

Shouted down at gtown commencement over deportations.

We live in a noisy democracy.
