Subject: Alexis Simendinger RCP on POTUS=20

Alexis at RCP is writing on what Earnest said, that POTUS will be more enga=
ged beginning in Summer. She wants to know if we can expect him to be more =
visible on campaign trail in June. Let me know what you want us to say. On =
background I made the usual points about him being a particularly powerful =
voice given strong record, 74 mos of job growth vs 800,000 jobs lost per mo=
nth, etc.. I also pointed out that his support since 2012 has been helping =
us build the national infrastructure, voter file, support for state parties=
, etc... so the usual.=20

Let us know if there's anything in particular you'd want us to highlight --=
- especially on the record.=20
