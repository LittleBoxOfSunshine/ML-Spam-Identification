FYI -- This afternoon, John Kasich will make an announcement that his JobsO=
hio agency has struck a deal with the CEO of a Thai chemical company. As yo=
u report that news, you should take a look at the bigger picture surroundin=
g JobsOhio, the quasi-public nonprofit corporation Kasich created - with th=
e first bill he signed as governor - to take over for the Ohio Department o=
f Development. JobsOhio has spent millions but has created more questions t=
han jobs.

JobsOhio has been largely ineffective at creating jobs but has awarded larg=
e raises to JobsOhio executives and spent exorbitant money on rent and trav=
el.

*        JobsOhio has trumpeted jobs created or saved in one particular loc=
ation, while the same company was laying off workers in the state.

*        One of the first companies to receive assistance through JobsOhio,=
 Rittal Corp., decided<http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/=
08/22/Tax-credit-JobsOhio-move.html> to shift and expand its headquarters f=
rom western Ohio to suburban Chicago two years later, according to the Colu=
mbus Dispatch.

*        The Youngstown Vindicator detailed<http://www.vindy.com/news/2013/=
sep/29/nonprofit-fails-to-save-jobs-in-the-vall/> how JobsOhio had recommen=
ded a $4.5 million job creation tax credit to Verizon to keep the company i=
n Ohio. However, the subsidy didn't stop Verizon from shutting down its Boa=
rdman call center and letting go 370 Mahoning Valley workers.

*        The Columbus Dispatch reported<http://www.dispatch.com/content/sto=
ries/local/2013/07/31/state-helps-company-leave-city.html> that TimberTech =
received an eight-year, 50 percent tax credit from the state and "an undisc=
losed grant from JobsOhio" to create jobs in Wilmington. Two months later, =
TimberTech shut down its factory in Columbus.

*        Kasich ally John Minor, the president of JobsOhio, saw his salary =
grow $82,000<http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/06/06/jobso=
hio-adds-payroll-in-its-office.html> in 2014 to more than $306,000. JobsOhi=
o's spending on salary and benefits increased<http://www.dispatch.com/conte=
nt/stories/local/2015/06/06/jobsohio-adds-payroll-in-its-office.html> 82 pe=
rcent from 2012-2013 to 2013-2014. In addition to Minor, JobsOhio employs t=
wo "senior managing directors" who each make more than $240,000.

Reporters have uncovered conflicts of interest at JobsOhio.

*        The Columbus Dispatch revealed<http://www.dispatch.com/content/sto=
ries/local/2015/06/06/jobsohio-adds-payroll-in-its-office.html> that JobsOh=
io "grew from 37 to 61 employees while adding senior, highly paid executive=
s and granting a hefty pay raise to its president and chief investment offi=
cer." This news prompted the Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board to call=
 the pay hikes "wretched excess<http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/=
2015/06/jobsohio_payroll_appears_exces.html>."

*        JobsOhio's board of directors is rife with potential conflicts of =
interest. According to a report<http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/=
state-regional-govt-politics/board-has-ties-to-firms-that-got-help/nY8QF/> =
by the Dayton Daily News, six of the board members "have direct financial t=
ies to companies that have received tax credits and other assistance from s=
tate government or JobsOhio since Gov. John Kasich took office in 2011."

*        Kasich personally received<http://www.cantonrep.com/article/201308=
15/News/308159793> compensation from a company that benefited from the larg=
esse of JobsOhio. In 2001, Kasich joined the board of Worthington Industrie=
s and received compensation from Worthington from 2007 through 2011. JobsOh=
io has helped Worthington receive tax breaks worth more than $619,000, acco=
rding to an AP report<http://www.cantonrep.com/article/20130815/News/308159=
793/?Start=3D1>. As the deals were being brokered, Worthington's CEO gave $=
100,000 to the Ohio Republican Party.

*        Kasich picked his friend (and donor) Mark Kvamme, a Silicon Valley=
 venture capitalist to lead JobsOhio. Kvamme left JobsOhio in 2012, but jus=
t before his resignation took effect, Kvamme lobbied<http://www.cleveland.c=
om/open/index.ssf/2013/11/gordon_gee_wanted_to_seek_dona.html> Ohio State U=
niversity to invest in a new venture capital firm he was creating. Despite =
concerns from their own investment advisers, OSU ponied up $50 million for =
Kvamme's firm.

*        Kvamme has provided a personal jet<http://www.dispatch.com/content=
/stories/local/2015/05/12/gov-john-kasich-fundraising-in-california.html> f=
or Kasich to crisscross the country for his presidential bid.

JobsOhio is not transparent, its implementation has been widely criticized =
by Ohio's press corps, and Kasich's administration has fought auditing effo=
rts.

*        The legislation creating JobsOhio made sure to keep the new entity=
 exempt from public records and open meetings laws<http://www.cleveland.com=
/open/index.ssf/2011/01/gov_kasichs_new_economic_devel.html>. The state aud=
itor, a fellow Republican, had to issue a subpoena in an attempt to get rec=
ords from JobsOhio. In response, Kasich had statehouse Republicans pass leg=
islation removing JobsOhio from the auditor's purview.<http://www.dispatch.=
com/content/stories/local/2013/06/05/bill-signed-to-close-jobsohios-books.h=
tml>

*        The Cincinnati Beat noted<http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-2=
8424-gov_kasich%E2%80%99s_bias_toward_secrecy.html> that "JobsOhio is so mi=
red in secrecy that it's extremely difficult to verify its deliberations. I=
t's practically impossible to get a clear picture of what's going on in the=
 agency."

*        The Toledo Blade's editorial board wrote<http://www.toledoblade.co=
m/frontpage/2011/02/01/More-light-on-JobsOhio.html>, "the secrecy with whic=
h the governor would enable the nonprofit corporation, JobsOhio, to adminis=
ter more than $1 billion for business incentives is too high a price to pay=
 for its asserted - not proven - efficiency."

*        Ohio's state auditor, a Republican, said<http://www.dispatch.com/c=
ontent/stories/local/2013/03/07/kasich-yost-in-showdown-over-jobsohio.html>=
 that JobsOhio leaders "are not cooperating with our attempts to audit them=
" and that Kasich's administration was trying to insert an amendment into a=
 budget bill to prevent him from conducting an audit. The auditor is now ba=
rred<http://www.toledoblade.com/Economy/2013/10/29/Many-jobs-state-says-it-=
creates-don-t-exist.html> from inspecting most of JobsOhio records because =
of legislation passed by the Republican-led General Assembly. Even Republic=
an state treasurer Josh Mandel agrees<http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.s=
sf/2015/01/treasurer_josh_mandel_says_job.html> that JobsOhio expenses shou=
ld be public.
