I want to make sure it is not too heavy handed:



Last night, Hillary Clinton won the state of Kentucky and Bernie Sanders wo=
n the state of Oregon. <http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/us/politics/berni=
e-sanders-oregon-results.html?_r=3D0>  They both are to be commended.  But =
what happened at the Nevada Democratic State Party Convention<http://www.ms=
nbc.com/msnbc/bernie-sanders-under-fire-after-nevada-convention-chaos> this=
 past weekend when party leaders and representatives of both campaigns gath=
ered to allocate delegates, with reports of chaos and violence, was a loss =
for Democrats everywhere.

What happened?

By all reports, it was a raucous event that descended into uncontrolled ang=
er on both sides and even death threats from Senator Sanders' supporters to=
wards the Nevada Democratic Party State Chair.  There were displays of ugly=
 disrespect towards revered Democratic Party leaders like California Senato=
r Barbara Boxer<https://www.google.com/url?sa=3Dt&rct=3Dj&q=3D&esrc=3Ds&sou=
rce=3Dweb&cd=3D1&cad=3Drja&uact=3D8&ved=3D0ahUKEwj3i_jpzuPMAhXFGT4KHVPgBfUQ=

QjCNGxOpC-V3HesvDpO8Fqrbo2-ANetA&bvm=3Dbv.122129774,d.cWw> when she showed =
up to give a speech on behalf of Secretary Clinton.

Apparently, Sanders supporters were none too happy with the outcome of the =
allocations of the delegates.  Even though Hillary Clinton won the state so=
me months ago during the Nevada caucuses, and should have been allotted mor=
e delegates, the Sanders campaign had planned to out-maneuver the Clinton c=
ampaign and emerge from the state convention with more delegates than the S=
ecretary.

In the end, the delegates were distributed according to the rules, which ha=
d been agreed upon by both campaigns and whose representatives were active =
in all phases of the convention process.  But not before vocal boos, shows =
of violence, obscenities screamed at the stage, and threats of bodily harm.=
  So much so that security had to shut down the convention because they cou=
ld no longer guarantee public safety.

While there is still no comparison in division, rancor, and acrimony betwee=
n what is happening on the Democratic side of the aisle and the Republican =
side, Democrats have become increasingly concerned that what happened in Ne=
vada is a precursor of what could happen at the Democratic National Convent=
ion in Philadelphia over the summer.

In fact, in a letter of complaint sent to the Democratic National Committee=
's Rules and By Laws Committee, the General Counsel of the Nevada Democrati=
c State Party outlined the events during the convention and strongly condem=
ned the actions of the Sanders campaign operatives as well as that of his s=
upporters.  The letter warned of similar unrest at the National convention.

This cannot and should not happen.

The Nevada debacle was the pinnacle of frustration and disillusionment on b=
ehalf of Sanders' supporters who have felt the party structure was stacked =
against their candidate from the beginning and wanted to give him an advant=
age in delegates even in the face of a win by Hillary Clinton.  While this =
goal is understandable, the tactics and methods reportedly used are inexcus=
able.

This unrest needs to be quelled by party leaders and representatives from b=
oth camps, including Senator Sanders himself. Supporters and activists from=
 both campaigns need to respect the rules and be respected for their hard w=
ork and commitment. Unfortunately, Senator Sanders' statement in the wake o=
f the Nevada fiasco<https://www.google.com/url?sa=3Dt&rct=3Dj&q=3D&esrc=3Ds=
&source=3Dweb&cd=3D1&cad=3Drja&uact=3D8&ved=3D0ahUKEwig47yPz-PMAhWHGz4KHUch=
AMsQqQIIGzAA&url=3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fberniesanders.com%2Fpress-release%2Fstatem=
ent-nevada%2F&usg=3DAFQjCNG3_RIUfjVoKHqVLOv2vErvKTyVZA&bvm=3Dbv.122129774,d=
.cWw> was inadequate at best, and at worst, could be seen as stoking the fi=
res of discontent among his supporters. While he said he does not condone a=
ny violence, he did little to quell the anger while seeming to throw gasoli=
ne on the fire by accusing Nevada party leaders of cheating.

While it was heartening to hear Sanders' campaign manager state unequivocal=
ly there would be no violence at the National Convention, it is time for Se=
nator Sanders to step up and disavow this behavior without qualification or=
 pause.

Throughout this campaign, Democrats have been able to hold our heads high a=
nd inflate our chests with pride at how we were conducting our primary proc=
ess.  It has been robust, passionate, and emotional.  But it had not gotten=
 ugly, personal and vile.  Those attributes had been reserved for our count=
erparts on the other side of the aisle thanks to their now nominee and stan=
dard bearer Donald Trump, who proudly feeds the flames of hate, division, a=
nd blame.

Let's keep it that way.  We cannot devolve down that rabbit hole of conflic=
t and disunity.  If we do, we might as well give Donald Trump the keys to t=
he White House right now.

I understand the frustration of Sanders' supporters.  As a Hillary Clinton =
supporter, I was there in 2008.  You put your heart and soul into the belie=
f that your candidate is the best equipped to win and then the effort comes=
 up short.  It is nothing less than a heart wrenching experience.

But real leaders take that raw disillusionment in their supporters and they=
 channel it towards the greater good for the country and for the agenda the=
y have been fighting so hard for up to now.

Senator Sanders has a choice to make.  He can guide his followers into more=
 productive means of expressing their frustrations and keep them from burni=
ng bridges that will help them achieve the progressive changes they had hop=
ed to with Sanders at the helm.

He can still lead his followers to the Promised Land, even if that does not=
 mean the White House.  He has put key issues front and center and he chang=
ed the debate so that it more strongly represents the progressive values he=
 has championed for so long and the new voters he brought in to the elector=
al process, all of which should be commended.  He has already won.

Or he can continue to let his supporters believe he can win the nomination.=
  But when he doesn't, it will be that much harder for them to unite with o=
ther Democrats against our real common foes:  the Republicans and Donald Tr=
ump.

I will bet on Bernie doing the right thing and helping to ensure real chang=
e happens in the country by not allowing Donald Trump to set foot in the Wh=
ite House come January 2017.  I hope he doesn't disappoint.

Senator Sanders' statement in the wake of the Nevada fiasco</a> was inadequ=
ate at best, and at worst, could be seen as stoking the fires of discontent=
 among his supporters. While he said he does not condone any violence, he d=
id little to quell the anger while
 seeming to throw gasoline on the fire by accusing Nevada party leaders of =
cheating.&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black">While it was heartening =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black">Throughout this campaign=
, Democrats have been able to hold our heads high and inflate our chests wi=
th pride at how we were conducting our primary process.&nbsp; It has been r=
obust, passionate, and emotional.&nbsp; But it
 had not gotten ugly, personal and vile.&nbsp; Those attributes had been re=
served for our counterparts on the other side of the aisle thanks to their =
now nominee and standard bearer Donald Trump, who proudly feeds the flames =
of hate, division, and blame.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black">I understand the frustra=

was there in 2008.&nbsp; You put your heart and soul into the belief that y=

 effort comes up short.&nbsp; It is nothing less than a heart wrenching exp=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black"><br>

Senator Sanders has a choice to make. &nbsp;He&nbsp;can guide his followers=

from burning bridges that will help them achieve the progressive changes th=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black">He can still lead his fo=
