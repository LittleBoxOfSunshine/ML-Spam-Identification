C. Biased observations
13. so fun, it's annoying. honestly stop.
14. passed the DP standard of excellence, which is a more impressive feat than you know (I can be brutally honest about this later)
15. You are a wonderful, exceptional human being. You've heard it from me too many times, but it does not devalue the truth inherent in such praise. I never say these things lightly. You're the best.



And don't worry about losing. If it is right, it happens - the main thing is not to hurry. Nothing good gets away.

a listicle by Daniel Parrish
(in reverse order for your convenience, just scroll up from here)

2. This duck who wants to say good morning
3. This news which I got excited about (though you probably already knew about Emma): http://www.buzzfeed.com/samstryker/try-the-gray-stuff-its-delicious
4. This baby who I happen to be related to saying hi
5. This koala who understands your struggle
6. This picture to remind you that DC misses you and will still be springy when you get back
7. This SURPRISE midweek recording for your commute: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-DvSifoYgTkNjA4M184b1BsZ28/view?usp=sharing
