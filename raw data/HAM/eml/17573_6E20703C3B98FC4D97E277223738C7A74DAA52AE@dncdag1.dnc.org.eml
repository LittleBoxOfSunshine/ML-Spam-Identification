DNC Chair Statement on  Cruz Suspending Campaign and Trump Becoming Republi=
can Presumptive Nominee

WASHINGTON - DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following s=
tatement on Ted Cruz dropping out of the Republican primary and Donald Trum=
p becoming the GOP's presumptive nominee:

"Tonight, Donald Trump is the Republican Party. Ted Cruz may have been the =
least-liked politician in Washington, but Trump is one of the least liked m=
en in America, and Democrats will hold him accountable for his offensive rh=
etoric, dangerous ideas, and lack of judgment every single day between toda=
y and November 8th.<x-apple-data-detectors://3>

"While Ted Cruz was known for obstruction, having forced a government shutd=
own that cost the U.S. economy $24 billion and even opposing emergency aid =
for a region hit by a devastating hurricane, he didn't stand up to Donald T=
rump until it was too late. None of the Republicans running for president d=
id, because after years of elevating extreme voices in their party, they di=
dn't want to alienate them.

"The decades-old Republican strategy of exploiting unfounded fear of immigr=
ants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all for political =
gain, have laid the groundwork for Donald Trump. The Republican Party sold =
hardworking Americans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while s=
trangling America's middle class with backwards economic policies that only=
 enrich those already at the top. Donald Trump's looming nomination will be=
 the ultimate, destructive culmination of the results of that strategy.

"Democrats won't hesitate to fight for the vast majority of the American pe=
ople, who share our values of inclusion, hard work, dignity and opportunity=
 for all, and we'll hold Republicans on the ballot at every level accountab=
le for their standard bearer. Voters will have a clear choice come November=
, and Americans of every stripe, including those disillusioned and disaffec=
ted by this year's unprecedentedly nasty Republican primary have a home in =
the Democratic Party. Our voters are energized, enthusiastic, and optimisti=
c because our candidates are committed to moving America forward. And that'=
s why we're going to win on Election Day in November."
