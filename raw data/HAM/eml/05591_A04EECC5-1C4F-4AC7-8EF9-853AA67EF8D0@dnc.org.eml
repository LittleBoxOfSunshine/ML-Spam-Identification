Hit time has been moved up 10 mins to 4:20PM (see below). Arrival time for makeup at 4PM EST.  Luis gets full segment. I guess we're not providing topics to Tapper. Bad move if we want to be taken seriously. Just a thought. Also, Rachel offered to staff Luis which might be fun. 

WHO: Luis & Jake Tapper
WHAT: 1-on-1 interview on state of the race, face to face in studio.
WHEN: 4:20-4:25
WHERE: CNN DC Bureau
