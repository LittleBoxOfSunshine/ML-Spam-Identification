By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)

Good Sunday morning. It's 85 days to Cleveland, 92 days to Philly, 198 days to election.

SUNDAY BEST - ABC's Jonathan Karl interviews Charles Koch, 80, in Wichita, Kansas, at the Koch Industries headquarters, for "This Week": JK: "When you look back over the years, over the last several cycles, hundreds of millions of dollars in electoral politics, what have you gotten for that? What's been the return on that investment? CK: "Well, I've gotten a lot of abuse out of it." ... 

JK: "Am I hearing you correctly, you think Bill Clinton was a better president than George W. Bush?" CK: "Well in some ways. In other ways, I mean he wasn't an exemplar. But as far as the growth of government, the increase in spending, it was much more under George Bush when the Republicans had it, on restrictive regulations. It was 2.5 times under Bush than it was under Clinton." ... 

JK: "You couldn't see yourself supporting Hillary Clinton, could you?" CK: "Well, ... we would have to believe her actions would be quite different than her rhetoric. Let me put it that way. But on some of the Republican candidates ... before we could support them, we'd have to believe their actions will be quite different than the rhetoric we've heard so far." Video  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=760c00499e0443a9b9297c6bf51b8eca07b23da097e4bc6e8d46ddb9bc779cdc

--The Koch interview will air in long form on Jon's podcast, available later this a.m. on iTunes: 26 minutes worth, including why Koch thinks the convention should not turn to Paul Ryan. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=760c00499e0443a95e45361b8e7119b0f1c59accdb77d2f41b6e35531d2ebb5a

DON TRUMP JR. to JAKE TAPPER for CNN's "State of the Union," taped in Clarks Summit, Pa.: "Ted Cruz has no chance of winning this without bribing the delegates. That's his game at this point. OK, he's mathematically eliminated, but that's been his game from day one because he's not an appealing candidate to the general election voter, so he'll try to get there, he'll do this, he'll lose more states than Mitt Romney, because I can't name a single state that Mitt lost that Ted can possibly win. 

"So, I think at this point the Republican establishment would much rather just hand the things over to Hillary, hand the reins over to her, let her run it, because guess what? There's no accountability in the party. ... Because everyone's in on the same thing, all their job is to do is to protect the little cliques that they've formed, to keep the big paychecks rolling from their special interests, and that's the same thing with the delegate process that we're seeing today." 

BERNIE SANDERS on "Meet the Press" - CHUCK TODD: "I have quite some interesting numbers here. So 17 of the 25 states with the highest levels of income inequality have held primaries. Sixteen of those 17 states have been won by Hillary Clinton, not by you. Why?" SANDERS: "Well, because poor people don't vote. I mean, that's just a fact."

TOP TALKER - N.Y. Times Sunday Review p. 5, HARRIS WOFFORD, former senator from Pennsylvania, special assistant for civil rights to President John F. Kennedy and adviser to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., "In Love Again, This Time With a Man: It was years before I got the nerve to tell my children about my new love": "All this is on my mind as Matthew and I prepare for our marriage ceremony. On April 30, at ages 90 and 40, we will join hands, vowing to be bound together: to have and to hold, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, until death do us part." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=760c00499e0443a972c5ad72b1dea6f812aca54f328cc20950d93e0b5dc7e9ed

MRS. OBAMA gave a fiery fascinating defense of her husband and his presidency yesterday in her commencement address at Jackson State University, a Historically Black University in Jackson, Miss.: "[W]hen I hear words like dignity and excellence, I think about my husband. (Applause.) See, I know I'm biased -- and I do think he's cute, too. (Applause.) But as I've walked this journey with Barack, I've gotten a pretty good look at what it means to rise above the fray, what it means to set your eyes on the horizon, to devote your life to making things better for those who will come after you. I have seen how, no matter what kind of ugliness is going on at any particular moment, Barack always
 stays the course. (Applause.) ... 

"And then there's the countless times when that language gets personal and is directed at my husband -- charges that he doesn't love our country. The time he was called a liar in front of a Joint Session of Congress. The nonstop questions about his birth certificate and his belief in God. ... [I]n light of today's 24-hour news cycle -- in this era where our Facebook feeds are limited to the voices of folks who think exactly like we do, and our TVs and radios are exclusively tuned in to those who tell us only what we want to hear -- it's not surprising that our disagreements have become more personal, more intense. ...

"I wish I could say otherwise, graduates, but the question isn't whether you're going to come face-to-face with these issues; the question is how you're going to respond when you do. ... [A]re you going to take a deep breath, straighten your shoulders, lift up your head, and do what Barack Obama has always done -- as he says, 'When they go low, I go high.' (Applause.) 

"That's the choice Barack and I have made. That's what has kept us sane over the years. We simply do not allow space in our hearts, minds, or souls for darkness. Instead, we choose faith -- faith in ourselves, in the power of hard work. Faith in our God, ... Our love for our country, which has given us so many blessings and advantages. ... 

"And we choose excellence. We choose to tune out all the noise and strive for excellence in everything we do. No cutting corners. No taking shortcuts. No whining. We give 120 percent every single time, because excellence -- excellence is the most powerful answer you can give to the doubters and the haters. (Applause.)"

TV TONIGHT: The fifth season of "Veep" premieres at 10:30 p.m. on HBO. Trailer http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=760c00499e0443a9de55d298ebb69c9319cf3072937287f87493189636e56c61 

DAVID MARANISS, filling two-thirds of WashPost A1 and two pages inside, "Obama's Legacy: THE CONTENT OF HIS PRESIDENCY - From health care to Cuba, Obama will leave behind a record of liberal achievement: "His decisions were ineffective in stemming the human wave of disaster in Syria, and he has thus far failed to close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay ... and to make anything more than marginal changes on two domestic issues of importance to him, immigration and gun control. 

"But from the Affordable Care Act to the legalization of same-sex marriage and the nuclear deal with Iran, from the stimulus package that started the slow recovery from the 2008 recession to the Detroit auto industry bailout, from global warming and renewable energy initiatives to the veto of the Keystone pipeline, from the withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq and Afghanistan and the killing of Osama bin Laden to the opening of relations with Cuba, the liberal achievements have added up, however one judges the policies. ... 

"To the extent that his campaign rhetoric raised expectations that he could bridge the nation's growing political divide, Obama owns responsibility for the way his presidency was perceived. ... [He] was comfortable coolly working in his own way at his own speed, waiting for events to turn his way. ... Rather than plow forward relentlessly, like Clinton, Obama slowed down." See "The First Black President," the first of "five multimedia rooms" in coming months as part of "Obama: A Virtual Museum of His Presidency" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=760c00499e0443a9b53782eddf58ddb8679ba55050a7262381eb0a62feb315b3

--"Overseas, Obama begins the long goodbye," by AP's Kathleen Hennessey in London: "As Obama wrapped up his valedictory trip to London on Saturday, he looked very much like a president on his way out the door, reflecting on his tenure and eager to shape how he is remembered. ... The president acknowledged his victory lap was premature, saying, 'I don't think that I'll have a good sense of my legacy until 10 years from now.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=760c00499e0443a9127a33e26475800ab24d98c7b70650fd6767520440c8ad81 

LATE-NIGHT BEST - AP: "'Saturday Night Live' devotes entire show to Prince tribute ... titled 'Goodnight Sweet Prince.' SNL alum Jimmy Fallon [hosted the] episode, which [featured] clips of Prince performing on the comedy show over the past four decades and skits with former cast member Fred Armisen portraying the artist. The show also includes an eight-minute medley Prince performed during a 2014 show and a ... a video of Prince's impromptu performance at an after-party following the show's 40th anniversary special last year, where Prince sang 'Let's Go Crazy' on a small stage alongside Fallon, fellow SNL vets Chris Rock, Maya Rudolph, Martin Short and other celebrities. ... The tribute
 show replaced a scheduled SNL rerun."

--YouTube, "Prince (Fred Armisen) and Beyonce (Maya Rudolph) welcome Tobey Maguire (Shia LaBeouf) and Nancy Grace (Amy Poehler) to the Prince Show." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=760c00499e0443a925337051f4b6b880e92896e63c10c116cbc111a5766f502f

MONEY HONEYS - L.A. Times 2-col. lead, "California's GOP donors disappointed: Having spent millions on losing presidential candidates, many are left reluctant to give," by Seema Mehta, Anthony Pesce and Kurtis Lee: "California's Republican donors have invested heavily in the 2016 presidential race, with little return. The vast majority of the $55 million they have spent boosted candidates who have dropped out ... Now, as the nominating contest hurtles toward the state's June 7 primary, most are no longer opening their checkbooks ... 

"23,000 Californians ... donated to Republican candidates or super PACs backing them in the 2016 cycle ... More than 15,000 donors saw a candidate they favored leave the race, and of those, only about 1,200 have given to [a remaining] candidate." Not online yet.

CRUZ STRATEGERY - WashPost p. A1, top of col. 1, "Cruz builds broad base by shifting his stances: To suit a fractured GOP, he has touted policy positions that don't always fit together," by David Fahrenthold and Katie Zezima: "Time and again he has shifted, shaded or obfuscated his policy positions - piling on new ideas, which sometimes didn't fit with the old. ... [W]hile Cruz's rightward shifts might have been politically smart during the primary season, they probably would create major challenges during the general." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=760c00499e0443a992452ccabb244a0557b738a1a14c740a48ad20781fe372f0

Times Quotation of the Day: Thomas Sander, director of a project on civic engagement at the Kennedy School at Harvard: "We are living much more cloistered lives in terms of class. We are doing a much worse job of living out the egalitarian dream that has been our hallmark."

--2-col. lead of the paper, "In New Age of Privilege, Not All Are in Same Boat: Marketing to Rich Customers, Companies Foster a Money-Based Caste System," by Nelson Schwartz in Miami: "Behind a locked door aboard Norwegian Cruise Line's newest ship ... [in] the Haven, as this ship within a ship is called, about 275 elite guests enjoy not only a concierge and 24-hour butler service, but also a private pool, sun deck and restaurant ... With a week in a top Royal Suite [on archrival Royal Caribbean] costing upward of $30,000, compared with $4,000 for an ordinary cabin, ... 'we have no trouble filling these rooms.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=760c00499e0443a9ff50a75473099263952545c550cd28496b55a34235b98656

** A message from PhRMA: A new report from IMS Health demonstrates how a competitive biopharmaceutical marketplace is working to control costs. The report found that net prices for brand medicines increased just 2.8 percent in 2015, down from 5.1 percent the prior year, as discounts and rebates negotiated by payers continue to rise sharply. The report also projects medicine spending growth will continue to moderate to 4 to 7 percent through 2020, in line with overall health care cost growth. Unfortunately, patients are not always benefiting from the discounts that insurance companies negotiate. A new report from Kaiser Family Foundation found that insurers are increasing patients'
 out-of-pocket costs, including coinsurance and deductibles, more than they are paying in medical benefits - underscoring the need for policy solutions that empower and engage patients. Read more here. **

Bush?&quot; <b>CK:</b> &quot;Well in some ways. In other ways, I mean he wasn't an exemplar. But as far as the growth of government, the increase in spending, it was much more under George Bush when the Republicans had it, on restrictive regulations.

But as I've walked this journey with Barack, I've gotten a pretty good look at what it means to rise above the fray, what it means to set your eyes on the horizon, to devote your life to making things better for those who will come after you. I have seen how, no matter what kind of ugliness is going on at any particular moment, Barack always stays the course. (Applause.) ... </p><p><b>&quot;And then there's the countless times
</b> when that language gets personal and is directed at my husband -- charges that he doesn't love our country. The time he was called a liar in front of a Joint Session of Congress. The nonstop questions about his birth certificate and his belief in God. ... [I]n light of today's 24-hour news cycle -- in this era where our Facebook feeds are limited to the voices of folks who think exactly like we do, and our TVs and radios are exclusively tuned in to those who tell us only what we want to hear -- it's not surprising that our disagreements have become more personal, more intense. ...</p><p><b>&quot;I wish I could say otherwise,

(Applause.) </p><p><b>&quot;That's the choice Barack and I have made.
</b> That's what has kept us sane over the years. We simply do not allow space in our hearts, minds, or souls for darkness. Instead, we choose faith -- faith in ourselves, in the power of hard work. Faith in our God, ... Our love for our country, which has given us so many blessings and advantages. ... </p><p><b>&quot;And we choose excellence.</b> We choose to tune out all the noise and strive for excellence in everything we do. No cutting corners. No taking shortcuts. No whining. We give 120 percent every single time, because excellence -- excellence is the most powerful answer you can give to the doubters and the haters.
