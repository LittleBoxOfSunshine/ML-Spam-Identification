Wanted to give you a heads up on this exchange from the briefing where your=
 name came up (toward the end).  We don't plan to engage further. =20


**Draft**

Susan, I'll give you the last one.

   Q    Thank you, Josh.  Two things.  While you were out here in the brief=
ing, it seems like CNN -- I'm looking on Twitter here so I can't be quite s=
ure -- is reporting that U.S. officials are saying that the early belief is=
 that a bomb brought the plane down -- the Egypt airplane down.  I'm wonder=
ing if you can confirm that they've found wreckage and whether that -- if y=
ou could confirm that U.S. officials are believing this is a bomb.

   MR. EARNEST:  Well, I saw some of that reporting before I walked out her=
e and I don't have an intelligence assessment to share at this point.

   Q    Okay.  The second question is a little more complicated.  I'm wonde=
ring if -- I know that at the beginning of the administration the President=
 really stressed the importance of not including lobbyists coming into the =
administration -- there were some exceptions.  But does he feel the same wa=
y about it when -- does he have the same concern when officials leave the a=
dministration?  That when they become lobbyists, do they need to sign up an=
d be transparent about that disclosure?

   MR. EARNEST:  Well, Susan, I don't have the details in front of me, but =
I know that some of the restrictions that the President put in place on his=
 first day in office didn't just apply to individuals who might be consider=
ing employment in the federal government during the Obama administration; t=
here were also commitments that incoming administration officials had to ma=
ke about limiting their lobbying activities after leaving government.  And =
so there are prohibitions, or at least limitations, that apply to former Ob=
ama administration officials.

Q    Does the White House advise people leaving, do they remind them of tha=
t and their requirements?  Is there a process --=20

MR. EARNEST:  Yes, there is -- as part of the out-boarding process, you're =
reminded of the commitments that you've made on the way in that would limit=
 your job prospects on the way out.  And look, many people have raised conc=
erns about how historically there's been a revolving door between the feder=
al government and K Street.  And the President's efforts, again, that he in=
itiated on his first day in office were to close that revolving door, both =
in terms of the impact it has on people seeking to enter the government, bu=
t also based on restrictions that individuals committed to on their way out=
.

Q    It's not just K Street that these individuals are going to.  I'm wonde=
ring if the -- anybody left the White House that went to go on and lobby on=
 behalf of engagement in Cuba, if -- and they're contacting administration =
officials, should they have registered to lobby?

MR. EARNEST:  Well, again, I assume -- it sounds now like you're asking abo=
ut a specific case, and why don't we just walk through the details and -- h=
elp you understand how the rules might apply in a particular case.

Q    Sure.  Luis Miranda left the White House.  He went to the ** Group.  H=
e did, from what I understand, engage in contacting the White House on that=
 issue repeatedly, and from what I understand there's no lobbying disclosur=
e records to show for that.  I have written about this, but we've talked ab=
out a lot -- there's been a lot of discussion about the Iran narrative this=
 week, but there hasn't been a lot of discussion about the -- and the timel=
ine -- and there hasn't been a lot of discussion about the Cuba timeline an=
d what -- the transparency on those negotiations.  That's why I'm asking.

MR. EARNEST:  Okay.  Well, look, we can take a look and see if we can provi=
de you some additional information.  It sounds like -- I'm not sure that an=
y of that disclosure would apply to the administration, but we can take a l=
ook.

Q    To Luis Miranda specifically?

MR. EARNEST:  Well, he doesn't work here anymore.

Q    Right, so that's why --=20

MR. EARNEST:  So maybe you should go ask him.

Q    Right, I've tried to contact him and -- ** I've tried to contact him. =
=20

MR. EARNEST:  Okay.

Q    Is it important for the White House to have some level of -- on the Cu=
ba issue to have had some level of surprise on that issue?  Or I mean, is i=
t the President's right and the White House's right to -- and the State Dep=
artment -- to engage in diplomacy behind the scenes before announcing a maj=
or initiative like trying to normalize relations with Cuba or another count=
ry?

MR. EARNEST:  Yes, I think that's entirely appropriate.  And that certainly=
 has applied to other diplomatic breakthroughs that have been -- that the U=
nited States has benefitted from in just the last couple of years.  And whe=
n we were negotiating to secure the release of Americans who were being unj=
ustly held in Iran, that was not something that we discussed extensively in=
 the past.  When the United States was working behind the scenes with China=
 to get them to make some significant commitments to fight carbon pollution=
 in their country, that I think -- the results of those negotiations I thin=
k were a surprise to many in the public, but the United States enjoyed sign=
ificant benefits as a result.

Those kinds of negotiations, that kind of diplomacy is often most effective=
 when it's done behind the scenes, as you described it. =20

Thanks, everybody.=
