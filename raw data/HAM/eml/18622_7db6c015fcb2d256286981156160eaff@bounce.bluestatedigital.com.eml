The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friend -
=20
Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee for President of the Uni=
ted States in 2016. As a lifelong advocate for women's rights, this stateme=
nt is frightening to me. Donald Trump has pledged to reverse the vast amoun=
ts of great progress we have made over the years. His demeaning treatment o=
f women and his stance on the Supreme Court and issues such as abortion wou=
ld reverse this progress.  This negatively impacts millions of Americans ac=
ross the country - and that is unacceptable.  Please help us support Democr=
ats up and down the ticket to stop the Republicans' advance.=20

The time to act is now. That is why I hope you will join me, Robbie Kaplan,=
 and special guest Tina Tchen for a Democratic National Committee dinner at=
 7 pm on May 31st at the home of Laetitia and Richard Garriott in New York.=
 We will come together and discuss the upcoming race, and why we as Democra=
ts must do everything we can to ensure a Democrat remains in the White Hous=
e for the next four years.
