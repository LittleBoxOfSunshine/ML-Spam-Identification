House v. Burwell
Topline Message

=B7                     While we are disappointed with the district court=
=92s ruling, the Department of Justice has stated that it will appeal this =
decision, and we are confident that, when all is said and done, we will pre=
vail in this litigation.  In the meantime, the court has stayed its decisio=
n, so there is no impact on customers.

=B7                     This is not the first time that we=92ve seen oppone=
nts of the ACA go through the motions to try to win this political fight in=
 the court system.

=B7                     But as we have said all along, this suit is unprece=
dented.  Never before in our nation=92s history has Congress been permitted=
 to sue the Executive Branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a s=
tatute.  The courts should not permit such a lawsuit here.

=B7                     Moreover, it is clear that Congress fully intended =
to fund the cost-sharing reductions that make health care more affordable f=
or consumers.  That is as true today as it was last week.

=B7                     It=92s unfortunate that Republicans have resorted t=
o a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to refight a political fight that they keep los=
ing.  They=92ve been losing this fight for six years, and we are confident =
they=92ll lose it again.
BACKGROUND: Key Quotes from DOJ Briefs
STANDING

=B7                     A House of Congress may not =97 as it seeks to do h=
ere =97 maintain an action against the Executive Branch concerning its impl=
ementation of a statute. This is =93obviously not the regime that has obtai=
ned under our Constitution to date.=94 DOJ Motion to Dismiss 1 (quoting Rai=
nes v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 828 (1997)).

=B7                     Contrary to the entire premise of the plaintiff=92s=
 suit here, the Supreme Court has made clear that federal courts do not sit=
 to referee this sort of an institutional dispute =93between one or both Ho=
uses of Congress and the Executive Branch =85 on the basis of claimed injur=
y to official authority or power.=94  DOJ Motion to Dismiss 1-2 (quotingRai=
nes v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 826 (1997)).

=B7                     The U.S. House of Representatives now asks this Cou=
rt to decide a generalized, institutional dispute between the Executive Bra=
nch and one chamber of the Legislative Branch concerning the proper interpr=
etation of federal law. This novel tactic is unprecedented, and for good re=
ason: the House has no standing to bring this suit. The House here asserts =
only that the Executive Branch is implementing statutory provisions, which =
were enacted by a previous Congress, in a manner different from what the cu=
rrent House would prefer. Because the House does not suffer any concrete an=
d particularized injury from the Executive Branch=92s implementation of fed=
eral law, this Court cannot decide the House=92s claim.  DOJ Motion to Dism=
iss 2.

=B7                     Federal courts sit only to decide actual cases and =
controversies, not abstract claims of legislative power. What is more, the =
House retains a variety of political and legislative tools to advance its p=
rerogatives in this inter-Branch dispute =97 including its =93power of the =
purse.=94 It need not conscript the Judiciary in its effort to superintend =
the Executive=92s implementation of the law.  DOJ Reply on Motion to Dismis=
s 2.

=B7                     Where, as is often the case, an appropriation is ti=
ed to a particular statute or program, any claim that an Executive Branch a=
gency has erroneously interpreted the governing substantive statute could e=
asily be recast as a violation of the Appropriations Clause, on the theory =
that the applicable appropriations law did not permit the expenditure of fu=
nds for an assertedly unlawful purpose.  DOJ Motion for Certification 14-15=
.
MERITS

=B7                     The text, structure, design, and history of the Aff=
ordable Care Act demonstrate that the Act permanently funded both interrela=
ted components of its insurance subsidy program=97premium tax credits and c=
ost-sharing reductions.  DOJ Merits Response 1.

=B7                     The ACA did not, for appropriations purposes, split=
 apart the two subsidies that it integrated, legally and economically, for =
purposes of eligibility and payment.  DOJ Merits Opening Brief 8.

=B7                     The House does not seriously dispute that its inter=
pretation of the Affordable Care Act=97under which premium tax credit payme=
nts are permanently funded but cost-sharing reduction payments are not=97wo=
uld have the perverse effect of vastly increasing federal spending from the=
 very appropriation the House purports to be protecting. Significantly, the=
 projections to that effect cited in the defendants=92 previous briefing ha=
ve been  confirmed by the Urban Institute, which recently determined that f=
ederal spending would rise by $47 billion over the next ten years under the=
 House=92s reading of the ACA.  DOJ Merits Reply 1.


Department of Education/DOJ Guidance

Bumper sticker statement:

All students=97including transgender students=97should be able to learn, gr=
ow, and thrive in a school environment that is safe and free from discrimin=
ation. That=92s why the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice are relea=
sing guidance to help ensure the civil rights of transgender students are p=
rotected from discrimination based on their sex or gender identity.



TPs:

=B7         As you know, we=92ve heard from a growing chorus of educators, =
parents, and students around the country about the need for guidance on how=
 schools can successfully support transgender students and non-transgender =
students in compliance with federal civil rights laws.

=B7         For that reason, DOJ and ED are releasing guidance to schools t=
oday explaining how federal law prohibiting sex discrimination affects scho=
ols=92 obligations toward transgender students.

=B7         The Department of Education is also releasing a compilation of =
examples of ways that schools across the country are already successfully s=
upporting transgender students.

=B7         Both documents show that protecting transgender students=92 rig=
ht to be who they are does not harm other students; instead, they show that=
 equality for transgender students is not only required by law but achievab=
le through common-sense approaches that foster safety and a positive learni=
ng environment for all students.

=B7         Taken together, we hope these new resources provide clarity for=
 everyone =96 from state and local leaders to educators to students and fam=
ilies =96 about how to create a safe, welcoming, and supportive learning en=
vironment for every student.
HHS Section 1557


=B7         Today, HHS finalized a rule to improve health equity thanks to =
the Affordable Care Act -- prohibiting discrimination based on race, color,=
 national origin, sex, gender identity, age or disability =96 and ensuring =
that individuals with limited English proficiency can access language assis=
tance.



=B7         The protections in the final rule and Section 1557 regarding in=
dividuals=92 rights and the responsibilities of many health insurers, hospi=
tals, and health plans administered by or receiving federal funds from HHS =
build on existing federal civil rights laws to advance protections for unde=
rserved, underinsured, and often excluded populations.



=B7         Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act isthe first federal civ=
il rights law to broadly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in fed=
erally funded health programs.



=B7         The final rule prohibits sex discrimination in health care incl=
uding by:

o   Requiring that women must be treated equally with men in the health car=
e they receive.



o   Prohibiting denial of health care or health coverage based on an indivi=
dual=92s sex, including discrimination based on pregnancy, gender identity,=
 and sex stereotyping.



=B7         It also includes important protections for individuals with dis=
abilities and enhances language assistance for people with limited English =
proficiency.
