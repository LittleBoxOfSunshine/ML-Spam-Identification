Daniel --

It's been 41 days since President Obama nominated Judge
Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court, fulfilling his
constitutional duty. Over the past several weeks, Judge Garland=20
has personally met with dozens of senators, and -- just as=20
they have since the day the vacancy opened -- Republican=20
senators are refusing to do their jobs and give the President's=20
nominee a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote.

Senators have a key constitutional role to play in the
nomination process, scrutinizing every nominee and
preserving the integrity of the court. But their role also
comes with the perfect forum to address whatever concerns
they might have about Judge Garland's qualifications: public
hearings. So if these senators have legitimate questions
about his fitness for the Supreme Court, why not hold
hearings and voice them?

Some of them have taken to arguing that "the people should
decide" -- but that's exactly what they did when they
elected President Obama. So why won't these senators hold a
vote?

Say that Senate leaders should stop hiding behind excuses
and give Judge Garland a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote:

https://my.barackobama.com/A-Fair-Hearing-For-Judge-Merrick-Garland

They're skipping out on their jobs for a reason. I think
Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley, and their allies are
afraid.

I think they're afraid the American people can see through
their partisan political games. They're afraid that the
American people will find out that Judge Garland is an
experienced and reasonable judge who will fairly interpret
the law. And they're afraid because they know that we don't
want our leaders to resort to this take-my-ball-and-go-home
brand of politics.

If they have a legitimate concern about this nomination,
they should hold a hearing and ask some questions on the
people's behalf. That's their job. And if they don't have
any legitimate concerns, they should hold a vote -- that's
their job too.

Raise your voice -- stand up for a fair hearing for Judge
Garland:
