I am a political reporter for the cable news channel One America News.  Am =

 he defending a Chinese Tire company that had stolen trade secrets from an =
America tire company.  As a result, the American tire company went out of b=
usiness.  The name of the CEO of the American company is Jordan Fischman, w=

The question the story raises is=85is this the sort of person you want as P=
resident=97someone who defended a Chinese company that had stolen trade sec=
rets against an American one that ended up out of business as a result.

Just need some kind of a comment from someone at the DNC raising the issue =
of the morals and ethics of someone who would do something like this.

The interview would be short three to five minutes, and it would need to be=
 on camera.

We are located at 101 Constitution NW, just off Capitol Hill, so we can tra=
vel quickly to any location convenient for you.

Thank you!

Very respectfully,
