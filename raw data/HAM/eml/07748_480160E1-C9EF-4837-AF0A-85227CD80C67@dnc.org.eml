Sanders Challenges Clinton, Trump to Back California Drug Price Proposition


May 14, 2016
Contact: Michael Briggs (802) 233-8653

ELIZABETHTOWN, Ky. =96 U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday called out phar=
maceutical companies for bankrolling a multi-million-dollar campaign to blo=
ck a California ballot initiative to rein in skyrocketing prescription drug=
 prices.

Sanders also challenged Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to join him in bac=
king a California proposition to save state taxpayers from being ripped off=
 by pharmaceutical companies.

=93The pharmaceutical industry charges the American people, by far, the hig=
hest prices in the world for prescription drugs and millions of people are =
unable to afford the medicine they need. Meanwhile, the top five major drug=
 companies last year made almost $50 billion in profits. Enough is enough,=
=94 Sanders said.

=93Further, the pharmaceutical industry has spent more than any other indus=
try to buy influence in Congress, curry favor with candidates and sway elec=
tions so they can continue to rip off consumers,=94 Sanders added.

Prices for prescription medicine in the United States soared last year more=
 than 10 percent =96 the third consecutive year of double digit price incre=
ases. One out of five adults between the ages of 18 and 64 =96 more than 35=
 million Americans =96 cannot afford the medications that their doctors pre=
scribe. =93In the richest country in the history of the world,=94 Sanders s=
aid, =93that is unacceptable.=94

The California Drug Price Relief Act would prohibit the state from paying m=
ore for a prescription drug than the lowest price paid for the same drug by=
 the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

An industry-funded campaign against the proposition already had received mo=
re than $68 million as of April =97 six months before the election. Experts=
 told the Los Angeles Times<http://sendy.berniesanders.com/l/DfrPBYJWWKIFXg=
Z763cGcMqQ/XBfoZE7igT47M7pAkCGPJA/9hhz77who1spvAMNWtjKpA> the industry is e=
xpected to spend at least $100 million to defeat the initiative.

Nationwide, the pharmaceutical industry since 1998 has spent $3.3 billion, =
more on lobbying than any other industry.

This year alone, the pharmaceutical industry has more than 1,000 registered=
 lobbyists. Drug companies have spent more than $66 million on lobbying and=
 over $28 million in campaign contributions.

Sanders comments on the California ballot proposition came while he was cam=
paigning this weekend in Kentucky. Democratic voters here and in Oregon vot=
e Tuesday on whether Sanders or Clinton should be the presidential nominee =
to take on Trump, the likely Republican nominee.
