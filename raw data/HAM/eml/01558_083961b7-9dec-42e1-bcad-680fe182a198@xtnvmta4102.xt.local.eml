By Natasha Korecki (nkorecki@politico.com; @natashakorecki) with Manuela Tobias (mtobias@politico.com; @manuelatobiasm)  

Good Friday morning, Illinois. On the same day U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan publicly declared he could not yet embrace presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, Gov. Bruce Rauner's team let out word that the governor would neither endorse Trump nor attend the GOP national convention. 

-- "Ryan's move came just hours after Trump tweeted 'I love Hispanics!' along with a picture of him eating a taco bowl, not exactly the kind of fence-mending with a growing voting bloc that GOP brass had in mind for Trump's general election pivot. But Ryan's decision to buck the nominee-in-waiting was borne out of opposition to Trump's principles, not any particular policy, according to a source familiar with his thinking." POLITICO http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487b03819ae40ca2ae3abb52800f3dea314459d9edb25656de8 

A top Rauner aide told POLITICO Thursday that Rauner wouldn't attend the convention, instead he would remain "focused on Illinois" and the ongoing "fiscal crisis" here. Rauner also won't endorse Trump for president. While the governor has in the past rejected rhetoric by Trump, he had said he would support the nominee while not specifically endorsing him. 

In the run-up to the Indiana primary, Rauner political allies had largely rallied around Ohio Gov. John Kasich. A top aide, Mike Schrimpf, left the Rauner administration earlier this spring to work on Kasich's campaign. Kasich failed to break through, and his best hope before dropping out of the running on Wednesday was succeeding in a contested convention. 

GOP leaders had previously said they expected Rauner to lead the Illinois delegation to Cleveland. But that was when a brokered convention was in the mix. For Rauner, it's a risky move either way. Embracing Trump now could be cataclysmic to Rauner's efforts to build numbers in the Illinois General Assembly in a blue state in a presidential year when Democrats turn out in larger numbers. 

AVERTING TRUMP LANDMINES -- "Gov. Bruce Rauner won't attend GOP convention or endorse Trump for president," by Chicago Tribune's Rick Pearson: "Rauner joins U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk in bypassing the July convention in Cleveland as Illinois' two highest-ranking Republicans seek to avoid the political minefield created by Trump ... Unlike Rauner, Kirk faces a high-stakes re-election contest in November against Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth. But Rauner does have some skin in the game on the fall ballot as he seeks to erode Democratic supermajorities in the legislature ... 

Trump-Rauner comparisons: "By skipping the national convention, Rauner also may be hoping to avoid any comparisons with Trump. Both are wealthy businessmen who campaigned as outsiders with no previous elected experience and an expressed desire to want to run government like a business. Rauner's move has some risks. Incurring Trump's wrath on Twitter or in a speech could set in motion a weekslong narrative in Illinois, with gleeful Democrats seeking to take advantage. In March, Rauner told students in Wilmette that he was 'horrified' by the rhetoric in the Republican presidential campaign, saying 'it's ugly and it's nasty and it's weird.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb7648705f6190aada489827a312a4db5c24e7c5f3c65ec33168163

RYAN NOT FEELING IT -- "Paul Ryan says he's not ready to support Trump," by POLITICO's Nolan D. McCaskill: "House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that he cannot currently support Donald Trump, complicating the presumptive nominee's efforts to unite the Republican Party around him. 'Well, to be perfectly candid with you, I'm just not ready to do that at this point,' Ryan told CNN's Jake Tapper. 'I'm not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to.' Ryan has pledged to support the nominee but said on Thursday that Trump needs to do more work to show that he is a true conservative who can unify the different wings of the Republican Party." 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487f3dce3214391f60168d9987b0bc43f37ad50fab4f0cb2953 

NOT SOUNDING THAT WAY -- "Will Republican candidates in Illinois embrace Trump?" by Mike Riopell: "With Donald Trump's two biggest rivals gone from the race for president, Illinois Republicans face running on the same ballot as the controversial candidate some of them have praised and some have denounced. Whether the candidates back presumptive nominee Trump, or how strongly, could affect their own prospects on the November ballot. Some seek to put distance between themselves and his controversial statements, while others say he's the choice of GOP voters and should be supported. U.S. Rep. Bob Dold months ago called Trump 'disqualified' for the presidency over comments Trump made about U.S.
 Sen. John McCain's time as a prisoner of war." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb764874d86a25d2841cb3df73fa70cd8c33d6a157b57c6a92acee1 

TRIB TRASHES TRUMP -- "Donald Trump is not qualified for the job," by Chicago Tribune's editorial board: "If you think of the presidential primaries as a hiring process for nominees, the Republican Party is about to offer the job to Donald Trump. As they say in the executive suite when a personnel crisis arises: Alert the folks in Human Resources. While there was plenty of interest in the presidential position, the interviewers - the voters - have settled on a candidate with neither appropriate experience nor a coherent governing philosophy. Instead, he brims with outrageous promises and makes statements that sound at times like he's ignorant of the law (killing the families of terrorists),
 disconnected from economic reality (demanding that American companies open factories at home) and callous to women and minorities (his sexist put-downs and proposed ban on allowing Muslims into the country)." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487a6deb026d0deaff9e0a465b920ab9f0bc567ad48d0b75c18

ALVAREZ RETREATS FROM LAQUAN MCDONALD CASE -- "Alvarez flip-flops, asks for special prosecutor in McDonald case," by Chicago Sun-Times' Rummana Hussain: "In a stunning reversal, Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez on Thursday recused herself from prosecuting Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke and asked a Cook County judge to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the high-profile murder of teenager Laquan McDonald. Alvarez held firm in her motion filed Thursday that her office did not have a conflict of interest in the case as critics have charged. But she noted that she would still recuse herself and ask for a special prosecutor 'to obtain justice for Laquan McDonald, and to
 ensure continuity in the handling of this important and complicated case' ... During the Democratic primary election, Alvarez repeatedly rejected calls for a special prosecutor in the Van Dyke case, a key issue during the campaign that ended in her getting trounced." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb764873fe621b9f48ca2fe3b6019369ad6cfc35fe2632daea18c4e

MAYOR TELLS TEACHERS TO PRESSURE SPRINGFIELD -- "Emanuel: Teachers union tax ideas not an answer for school funding," by Chicago Tribune's John Byrne: "Mayor Rahm Emanuel took a dim view Thursday of a package of tax increases the Chicago Teachers Union proposed to help cover a massive funding shortfall at the school district, instead calling on union leaders to join him in pressuring state lawmakers to change the way school districts are funded to bring more money to the city. The mayor was responding to a revenue package union officials released Wednesday they said could shore up the district's finances as a $675 million pension payment is due next month. Rather than raising taxes here,
 however, Emanuel said the onus should be on Springfield to change how school district pension costs are covered. 'Chicago taxpayers already pay twice for pensions,' Emanuel said when asked whether he backs any of the CTU ideas." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487575fec3fdfddbab49e59648a6ac86a395da358123e52616a 

CITY BILLING, GARBAGE -- "The City's New Garbage Fee Is Being Incorrectly Double- And Triple-Billed," by DNAinfo's Patty Wetli and Alisa Hauser: "Across Chicago, residents are reporting mistakes on their new bills. The most common error: Single-family homeowners charged for multiunit dwellings, resulting in bills two and three times higher than they should be. Depending on a property owner's billing cycle and given that the fee - $9.50 per month per unit - is being assessed retroactive to January, some folks are looking at errors that run into the triple digits." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb7648761377ed3ea428daf2a4525117fa2150d54c41073435bef25 

EMANUEL's 'FATAL FLAW' -- "The Lucas Museum Saga Is A Story With No Hero," by DNAinfo's Mark Konkol: "The mayor called the Lucas Museum an 'incredible gift' to Chicago, when in fact the city would be giving Lucas valuable public land for almost nothing - and not collecting a penny in property taxes, ever ... In post-Laquan McDonald Chicago, though, the mayor's critics see his stalwart support for the museum as a sweetheart deal that beautifies the rich part of town and benefits a billionaire who wants to put his mark on a prestigious part of Chicago ... or nowhere in the city at all ... Emanuel's willingness to ignore the potential pitfalls of having such rigid resistance to change his
 big-money, Downtown-focused development priorities in a city starkly divided by class and race threatens to be his fatal flaw." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487960235e703316a01136450dcd2e5347556f29dc3d131852a 

DANGEROUS CHASE, TWO CRASHES, NO SUSPECT -- "Mayor questions long police chase that caused two crashes," by Chicago Sun-Times' Luke Wilusz and Fran Spielman: "A suspect in a death investigation led police on a chase that started in west suburban Lombard and resulted in two crashes involving law enforcement vehicles in Chicago on Wednesday night before the suspect eluded authorities. On Thursday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel questioned whether the chase was worth the risk. 'There's a question there. At the end of the day, the [suspect in] the homicide in Lombard, driving through Chicago, I think, to the airport, still got away,' Emanuel said." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487901bd0d46e787140bdc42d0466c8d50774b5c13640e4518b 

CHICAGO STATE FUTURE -- "What's Next for CSU," by The Chicago Citizen's Chelsea Johnson: "The Citizen was able to sit down with Dr. Thomas J. Calhoun, president of CSU shortly after the graduation ceremonies to discuss what's next for the south side university. Citizen: With the information that you have now and understanding what you will need, will the school be able to operate for the upcoming fall session? Calhoun: Absolutely. We are in full mode to have summer session and to operate in the fall. We will absolutely be not just functioning, but fully functioning ... Now, the $20 million is a band-aid and everybody knows that; the legislature knows it and the governor knows it ... we
 anticipate a very healthy, financial position and a very robust beginning to our fall session." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487d61bc214d525a17c5bfe994e62e84c1bdf254320a9034301 

OLDEST SEARS STORE PULLS OUT -- "Sears to close historic Ravenswood store," by Crain's Brigid Sweeney: "Sears Holdings is closing its oldest store. The Sears at 1900 W. Lawrence Ave., which opened in 1925, will begin a liquidation sale May 19 and will shutter for good in early August, the company said. The 91-year-old store was not on a list of closures announced last month. Sears has spent much of the past five years selling off real estate and closing stores as it attempts to transform from a cash-hemorrhaging big-box chain into a nimble, profitable online-centric retailer." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487a62973557ce9a10e625237e03d2a6ac66e8aab040a9692a9 

 TRIB'S REAL VALUE? NOT AS MUCH AS IT THINKS -- "What makes Tribune think it's worth a trophy price?" by Crain's Brooke Sutherland: "Does Tribune Publishing's management really think the company is going to get $6 billion? The newspaper said late Wednesday that it rejected an $815 million takeover offer from Gannett, calling it an 'opportunistic proposal' that 'understates the company's true value.' Tribune (which reported first-quarter earnings at the same time) included some handy charts outlining how it came to the conclusion that a 63 percent premium wasn't a great idea for investors who had seen the stock drop by about that much in the previous year." 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb764877ffd9184c9d261f88372cf2701ce46bb2ef4ae8ac64c83f6 

SCHAUMBURG SNAGS MEGA TENANT -- "Paylocity plans big HQ in Schaumburg," by Crain's Ryan Ori: "In what could be one of the largest suburban Chicago office leases in years, software company Paylocity is near a deal to take a large portion of a 20-story tower in Schaumburg that Zurich North America is preparing to leave. Paylocity Holding, now based in Arlington Heights, is in advanced negotiations to lease more than 200,000 square feet, and possibly as much as 300,000 square feet, in one of the twin towers that insurer Zurich will leave for a new Schaumburg headquarters late this year, according to people familiar with the deal." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb7648710cc7f14b3b4addbb2529930871b4ef6d9abb5e193d7b189 

STATE  

MORE MONEY FOR HIGHER ED -- "Senate approves $454 million more for higher education," by Lee Enterprises' Dan Petrella: "Democrats and Republicans in the Illinois Senate believe they've found a successful formula for ending nearly yearlong partisan standoffs over state spending. For the second time in as many weeks, senators from both sides of the aisle came together Thursday to approve funding for public universities, community colleges and grants to low-income students, all of which had been deprived of state money since the fiscal year began July 1 without a budget in place. The winning formula: spending bills that aren't tied to items on Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's pro-business,
 union-weakening 'turnaround agenda' but are tied to specific revenue sources." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb764874215602c987bc898baa975588097436b0235054916c9e69f 

AUDITING THE AUDITOR -- "Illinois GOP lawmakers want campaign spending answers from Auditor General Frank Mautino," by The Associated Press' John O'Connor: "A group of Republican lawmakers attempted to turn up the election-year heat Thursday on the state's chief fiscal monitor, demanding that Auditor General Frank Mautino answer questions about his campaign spending as a legislator. First-term Rep. Grant Wehrli of Naperville, who faces a Democratic challenger in November, said at a Capitol news conference that he and 19 colleagues sought answers Thursday in their third recent letter to Mautino that read, 'The people of Illinois are tired of the many corruption scandals they've had to endure
 in recent years.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb7648789242e6a7dfba5706412dc7a3d91b97d4207f027ac7b7dab 

ANONYMOUS DONOR KEEPS PARKS OPEN -- "2 Illinois state parks reopen after donor pays electric bill," by 'The Associated Press: "The Illinois Department of Natural Resources says Ramsey Lake State Recreation Area and Horseshoe Lake State Park have reopened after a donor paid to turn the electricity back on. IDNR spokesman Chris Young says the parks reopened Wednesday after they were closed about two weeks ago due to the state budget impasse. Young says the electric company didn't name the donor. Southwestern Electric Cooperative officials didn't identify the donor citing privacy concerns. The parks were closed because electric and trash service were terminated. Young says Ramsey Lake owned
 $1,765 in electric bills and Horseshoe Lake owed $829." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487f1cf5c1035c34d8d1dc59b54138127bafdabd65485b8d749 

SACRIFICIAL LAMB? -- "Democrats select college professor to challenge Darin LaHood for U.S. House seat," by Peoria Journal Star's Chris Kaergard: "U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood will be challenged in November by a Eureka College history professor. Junius Rodriguez was chosen by a group of Democratic county party chairmen last weekend to run against the first-term Republican in the 18th Congressional District, which includes part of Springfield and all of Lincoln ... 'It's important to have a candidate in every spot that we can fill,' said Woodford County Democratic Party chairman Bradford Shepley." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487eac51e0d7389532f716bc5e1745443d3f8b1db5a8de3db05 

HOW OUR MANUFACTURING COMPARES TO INDIANA -- "There is a lot more to the Illinois manufacturing story than some say," by Frank Manzo for Reboot Illinois: "While Illinois has added fewer manufacturing jobs than Indiana over recent years, manufacturing earnings have grown at a much faster pace in Illinois. The chart below presents data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), sorted by largest-growing manufacturing sectors in Illinois. ... The first fact that initially jumps out is that, in the production sectors where Illinois is growing, Indiana is indeed adding even more jobs. Transportation equipment manufacturing, for example, added over 14,000 jobs in Illinois from January 2010 to
 September 2015. In Indiana, however, over 33,000 jobs were added in this sector." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487c5ccaabf9512055cc04b00450e4c179221c4dc1421475a88 

SO MUCH FOR PUTTING QUESTIONS TO VOTERS -- "Behind The Failure Of The Graduated Income Tax," by Illinois Public Radio's Amanda Vinicky: "Despite recent hype over the possibility of legislators putting questions on the November ballot to change the constitution, the Illinois House adjourned Wednesday without even voting on proposed amendments. Their lack of action means voters won't be asked whether they want to change how they're taxed. On Tuesday, all systems were 'go' for a plan to dramatically change how Illinois can tax its residents. The constitution now - literally - requires income be taxed at a 'non-graduated rate.' As in, the same flat rate, no matter how much money you make."

FIGHTING IRISH. FIGHTING ILLINI. FIGHTING ... ABE. SAY WHAT? -- "Inadvisable mascot search should end in Abe," by The Daily Illini Editorial Board: "The debate that many thought was done at the University has returned once again. Interim Chancellor Barbara Wilson announced Monday that the University will begin searching for a new mascot ... There's a very clear favorite here, folks: Abraham Lincoln, or maybe Fightin' Abe. There's a reason why our state is called the 'Land of Lincoln.' Abe is considered one of this nation's greatest presidents, and in a state whose politicians are best known for being corrupt, the least we can do is honor someone whose main quality is honesty ... Our Abe
 could even be similar to the large-headed Lincoln the Washington Nationals use for the team's presidents races. Think of how much fun kids (and drunk students) will have when they see a top-heavy Abe falling on his small feet - good luck not getting distracted by that, Michigan State." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb764871a3b6892c2577e17e2da83cc066a306e6fb4c946334d09d5 

JUST IN TIME FOR DERBY -- "Top trainers raring to go as racing returns to Arlington Park," by Daily Herald's John Leusch: "Due to a contract dispute between the Illinois Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association and Arlington International Racecourse, the gates were locked on the track's backstretch until this past Saturday. Thanks to a settlement, the longtime thoroughbred institution will unlock the grandstand doors in time for another summer of racing with a 74-day meet beginning Friday and running through Sept. 24. General admission is free on Friday, opening day. Racing will be conducted on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays in May and June." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487dab056f4041ef5fe3a2d4ff325c33dfb688c57e3918afa1f 

ALREADY TRUE FOR LAWMAKERS -- "Springfield, the staycation destination," by Illinois Times' DiAnne Crown: "May 1-7 is National Travel and Tourism Week, and Springfield Convention and Visitors Bureau Executive Director Gina Gemberling wants Springfield-area residents to join in the fun right here at home. 'We are so fortunate in Springfield to have Abraham Lincoln sites, a full calendar of events and festivals throughout the year, a fine culinary scene, and so many other sites and attractions, including the Thomas Rees Memorial Carillon, Dana-Thomas House, African-American History Museum, Illinois State Military Museum, Knight's Action Park, Hall's Harley Davidson, Scheels' and more, says
 Gemberling, whose SCVB also goes by the name Visit Springfield Illinois these days." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487484040596923f6391f23f05f3d9afeb12883194886d0d89b 

RAUNER DOESN'T LIKE LUCAS LONGSHOT -- "Rauner has misgivings on Lucas Museum at McCormick Place," by Chicago Tribune's Celeste Bott and John Byrne: "Gov. Bruce Rauner on Thursday said he supports Mayor Rahm Emanuel's original site for a George Lucas lakefront museum but has some misgivings about the latest plan to tear down McCormick Place Lakeside Center ... Asked about the "Star Wars" filmmaker's museum while at a business event in Decatur, Rauner said Lucas' planned donation of $743 million to build the museum is 'good for Illinois.' The governor noted that he signed a bill last year aimed at making it easier to build the museum." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487d152f0bc66c6ac0d1e210e2386234c99e89ef42f0149c961

ONLY KIRK'S 'CLOSEST ALLIES' BELIEVE HE CAN WIN -- "Ratings Change: Kirk Race Downgraded to Leans Democratic," by Roll Call's Nathan L. Gonzales: "Nearly a year ago, we moved Republican Mark S. Kirk from Tossup to Tilts Democratic. Over the past 12 months, there is little evidence that things have gotten any better for the senator and in fact the political climate may be getting much worse, prompting another ratings change ... Duckworth isn't the perfect candidate and Kirk might be able to outperform the top of the ticket, but not likely at the level necessary to win this year. And, quite frankly, no one outside of Kirk's closest allies believes he is going to win, including many
 Republicans. We're changing our rating from Tilts Democratic to Lean Democratic." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb7648749444dc64770f8d8eb80914ab384abc60afd1227ffb6a9de 

KIRK CAMP GOES AFTER STATE'S ATTY WHO SPOKE ILL OF SENATOR -- "Kirk campaign, Brendan Kelly spar over phone records, emails," by Belleville News-Democrat's Joseph Bustos: "After St. Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly, a Democrat, spoke critically of Republican U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk during a media teleconference in March, Republicans went looking for evidence. They wanted to know if there were any emails or phone records to show that Kelly used county resources or county time for political activity - and whether there was any connection to the campaign of Kirk's opponent, Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth. Kelly says the Kirk campaign won't find anything political in the fishing
 expedition. But now he's involved in a spat with Kirk's office over whether Kelly's staff has adequately complied with a records request." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb764878779d5cefa026252698418de4a9ab8321694b157c99657d4

WHERE TO EAT IN CHICAGO -- "The Hottest Restaurants in Chicago Right Now, May 2016," by Daniel Gerzina: "More often than not, tipsters, readers, friends and family of Eater have one question: Where should I eat right now? Restaurant obsessives want to know what's new, what's hot, which favorite chef just launched a sophomore effort. And while the Eater 38 is a crucial resource covering old standbys and neighborhood essentials across the city, it is not a chronicle of the 'it' places of the moment. Thus, we offer the Eater Heatmap, which will change on a regular basis to always highlight where the foodie crowds are flocking to at the moment." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb764870fc45895774af1b57315a03d5ee46267854e2517f27310ef

Bruce Rauner's team let out word that the governor would neither endorse Trump nor attend the GOP national convention.  </p><p>
<b>-- &quot;Ryan's move came just hours after Trump tweeted 'I love Hispanics!'</b> along with a picture of him eating a taco bowl, not exactly the kind of fence-mending with a growing voting bloc that GOP brass had in mind for Trump's general election pivot. But Ryan's decision to buck the nominee-in-waiting was borne out of opposition to Trump's principles, not any particular policy, according to a source familiar with his thinking.&quot; POLITICO <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487b03819ae40ca2ae3abb52800f3dea314459d9edb25656de8" target="_blank">http://politi.co/24wjNLa</a>  </p><p><b>A top Rauner aide told POLITICO Thursday 
</b>that Rauner wouldn't attend the convention, instead he would remain &quot;focused on Illinois&quot; and the ongoing &quot;fiscal crisis&quot; here. Rauner also won't endorse Trump for president. While the governor has in the past rejected rhetoric by Trump, he had said he would support the nominee while not specifically endorsing him.  </p><p><b>In the run-up to the Indiana primary,</b> Rauner political allies had largely rallied around Ohio Gov. John Kasich. A top aide, Mike Schrimpf, left the Rauner administration earlier this spring to work on Kasich's campaign. Kasich failed to break through, and his best hope before dropping out of the running on Wednesday was succeeding in a contested convention.  
</p><p><b>GOP leaders</b> <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487a1d0a77f5283a65af9d54e036a30e12d5326b9de3444aeb5" target="_blank">had previously said </a>they expected Rauner to lead the Illinois delegation to Cleveland. But that was when a brokered convention was in the mix. For Rauner, it's a risky move either way. Embracing Trump now could be cataclysmic to Rauner's efforts to build numbers in the Illinois General Assembly in a blue state in a presidential year when Democrats turn out in larger numbers.  </p><p><b>AVERTING TRUMP LANDMINES -- &quot;Gov. Bruce Rauner won't attend GOP convention or endorse Trump for president,&quot; by Chicago Tribune's Rick Pearson:
</b> &quot;Rauner joins U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk in bypassing the July convention in Cleveland as Illinois' two highest-ranking Republicans seek to avoid the political minefield created by Trump ... Unlike Rauner, Kirk faces a high-stakes re-election contest in November against Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth. But Rauner does have some skin in the game on the fall ballot as he seeks to erode Democratic supermajorities in the legislature ...  </p><p><b>Trump-Rauner comparisons:
</b> &quot;By skipping the national convention, Rauner also may be hoping to avoid any comparisons with Trump. Both are wealthy businessmen who campaigned as outsiders with no previous elected experience and an expressed desire to want to run government like a business. Rauner's move has some risks. Incurring Trump's wrath on Twitter or in a speech could set in motion a weekslong narrative in Illinois, with gleeful Democrats seeking to take advantage. In March, Rauner told students in Wilmette that he was 'horrified' by the rhetoric in the Republican presidential campaign, saying 'it's ugly and it's nasty and it's weird.'&quot;

'Well, to be perfectly candid with you, I'm just not ready to do that at this point,' Ryan told CNN's Jake Tapper. 'I'm not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to.' Ryan has pledged to support the nominee but said on Thursday that Trump needs to do more work to show that he is a true conservative who can unify the different wings of the Republican Party.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487f3dce3214391f60168d9987b0bc43f37ad50fab4f0cb2953" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1O0M9FP</a> </p><p>
<b>NOT SOUNDING THAT WAY -- &quot;Will Republican candidates in Illinois embrace Trump?&quot; by Mike Riopell:
</b> &quot;With Donald Trump's two biggest rivals gone from the race for president, Illinois Republicans face running on the same ballot as the controversial candidate some of them have praised and some have denounced. Whether the candidates back presumptive nominee Trump, or how strongly, could affect their own prospects on the November ballot. Some seek to put distance between themselves and his controversial statements, while others say he's the choice of GOP voters and should be supported. U.S. Rep. Bob Dold months ago called Trump 'disqualified' for the presidency over comments Trump made about U.S. Sen. John McCain's time as a prisoner of war.&quot;

</b>&quot;If you think of the presidential primaries as a hiring process for nominees, the Republican Party is about to offer the job to Donald Trump. As they say in the executive suite when a personnel crisis arises: Alert the folks in Human Resources. While there was plenty of interest in the presidential position, the interviewers - the voters - have settled on a candidate with neither appropriate experience nor a coherent governing philosophy. Instead, he brims with outrageous promises and makes statements that sound at times like he's ignorant of the law (killing the families of terrorists), disconnected from economic reality (demanding that American companies open factories at home)
 and callous to women and minorities (his sexist put-downs and proposed ban on allowing Muslims into the country).&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487a6deb026d0deaff9e0a465b920ab9f0bc567ad48d0b75c18" target="_blank">http://trib.in/1O0H0gR</a> </p><p><b>Welcome to the POLITICO Illinois Playbook.

<b>ALVAREZ RETREATS FROM LAQUAN MCDONALD CASE -- &quot;Alvarez flip-flops, asks for special prosecutor in McDonald case,&quot; by Chicago Sun-Times' Rummana Hussain:
</b> &quot;In a stunning reversal, Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez on Thursday recused herself from prosecuting Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke and asked a Cook County judge to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the high-profile murder of teenager Laquan McDonald. Alvarez held firm in her motion filed Thursday that her office did not have a conflict of interest in the case as critics have charged. But she noted that she would still recuse herself and ask for a special prosecutor 'to obtain justice for Laquan McDonald, and to ensure continuity in the handling of this important and complicated case' ... During the Democratic primary election, Alvarez repeatedly rejected calls
 for a special prosecutor in the Van Dyke case, a key issue during the campaign that ended in her getting trounced.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb764873fe621b9f48ca2fe3b6019369ad6cfc35fe2632daea18c4e" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1Og5H3C</a> </p><p>-- <b>&quot;Judge Lets Jason Van Dyke Quietly Leave Courthouse During A Recess,&quot; DNAinfo Chicago: </b><a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487139ca1daeb4715c44ce593d16a3f48728786bc36aa928056" target="_blank">http://dnain.fo/1TLT0lJ</a>  </p><p><b>-- Read the Alvarez recusal doc posted by DNA.info:</b> <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb764873547adf00a482aa5c2b296747e2b5f31a5235ef9a1978fcc" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1rwUBT6</a>  </p><p><b>MAYOR TELLS TEACHERS TO PRESSURE SPRINGFIELD --</b> &quot;
<b>Emanuel: Teachers union tax ideas not an answer for school funding,&quot; by Chicago Tribune's John Byrne: 
</b>&quot;Mayor Rahm Emanuel took a dim view Thursday of a package of tax increases the Chicago Teachers Union proposed to help cover a massive funding shortfall at the school district, instead calling on union leaders to join him in pressuring state lawmakers to change the way school districts are funded to bring more money to the city. The mayor was responding to a revenue package union officials released Wednesday they said could shore up the district's finances as a $675 million pension payment is due next month. Rather than raising taxes here, however, Emanuel said the onus should be on Springfield to change how school district pension costs are covered. 'Chicago taxpayers already pay twice
 for pensions,' Emanuel said when asked whether he backs any of the CTU ideas.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487575fec3fdfddbab49e59648a6ac86a395da358123e52616a" target="_blank">http://trib.in/1Og5IEZ</a> </p><p><b>CITY BILLING, GARBAGE -- &quot;The City's New Garbage Fee Is Being Incorrectly Double- And Triple-Billed,&quot; by DNAinfo's Patty Wetli and Alisa Hauser:

</b> &quot;The mayor called the Lucas Museum an 'incredible gift' to Chicago, when in fact the city would be giving Lucas valuable public land for almost nothing - and not collecting a penny in property taxes, ever ... In post-Laquan McDonald Chicago, though, the mayor's critics see his stalwart support for the museum as a sweetheart deal that beautifies the rich part of town and benefits a billionaire who wants to put his mark on a prestigious part of Chicago ... or nowhere in the city at all ... Emanuel's willingness to ignore the potential pitfalls of having such rigid resistance to change his big-money, Downtown-focused development priorities in a city starkly divided by class and race
 threatens to be his fatal flaw.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb76487960235e703316a01136450dcd2e5347556f29dc3d131852a" target="_blank">http://dnain.fo/1O0DXp2</a> </p><p><b>DANGEROUS CHASE, TWO CRASHES, NO SUSPECT -- &quot;Mayor questions long police chase that caused two crashes,&quot; by Chicago Sun-Times' Luke Wilusz and Fran Spielman:

<b>HOW OUR MANUFACTURING COMPARES TO INDIANA -- &quot;There is a lot more to the Illinois manufacturing story than some say,&quot; by Frank Manzo for Reboot Illinois: 
</b>&quot;While Illinois has added fewer manufacturing jobs than Indiana over recent years, manufacturing earnings have grown at a much faster pace in Illinois. The chart below presents data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), sorted by largest-growing manufacturing sectors in Illinois. ... The first fact that initially jumps out is that, in the production sectors where Illinois is growing, Indiana is indeed adding even more jobs. Transportation equipment manufacturing, for example, added over 14,000 jobs in Illinois from January 2010 to September 2015. In Indiana, however, over 33,000 jobs were added in this sector.&quot;

</b>&quot;Despite recent hype over the possibility of legislators putting questions on the November ballot to change the constitution, the Illinois House adjourned Wednesday without even voting on proposed amendments. Their lack of action means voters won't be asked whether they want to change how they're taxed. On Tuesday, all systems were 'go' for a plan to dramatically change how Illinois can tax its residents. The constitution now - literally - requires income be taxed at a 'non-graduated rate.' As in, the same flat rate, no matter how much money you make.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb7648797a6b029eb727af707aaea9a33fb3f045ebe9ec9016cceba" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1O0I1Wg</a> </p><p>
<b>FIGHTING IRISH. FIGHTING ILLINI. FIGHTING ... ABE. SAY WHAT? -- &quot;Inadvisable mascot search should end in Abe,&quot; by The Daily Illini Editorial Board: 
</b>&quot;The debate that many thought was done at the University has returned once again. Interim Chancellor Barbara Wilson announced Monday that the University will begin searching for a new mascot ... There's a very clear favorite here, folks: Abraham Lincoln, or maybe Fightin' Abe. There's a reason why our state is called the 'Land of Lincoln.' Abe is considered one of this nation's greatest presidents, and in a state whose politicians are best known for being corrupt, the least we can do is honor someone whose main quality is honesty ... Our Abe could even be similar to the large-headed Lincoln the Washington Nationals use for the team's presidents races. Think of how much fun kids (and
 drunk students) will have when they see a top-heavy Abe falling on his small feet - good luck not getting distracted by that, Michigan State.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9aba51e7bb764871a3b6892c2577e17e2da83cc066a306e6fb4c946334d09d5" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1O0IfNd</a> </p><p><b>JUST IN TIME FOR DERBY -- &quot;Top trainers raring to go as racing returns to Arlington Park,&quot; by Daily Herald's John Leusch:

<b>ALREADY TRUE FOR LAWMAKERS -- &quot;Springfield, the staycation destination,&quot; by Illinois Times' DiAnne Crown:
</b> &quot;May 1-7 is National Travel and Tourism Week, and Springfield Convention and Visitors Bureau Executive Director Gina Gemberling wants Springfield-area residents to join in the fun right here at home. 'We are so fortunate in Springfield to have Abraham Lincoln sites, a full calendar of events and festivals throughout the year, a fine culinary scene, and so many other sites and attractions, including the Thomas Rees Memorial Carillon, Dana-Thomas House, African-American History Museum, Illinois State Military Museum, Knight's Action Park, Hall's Harley Davidson, Scheels' and more, says Gemberling, whose SCVB also goes by the name Visit Springfield Illinois these days.&quot;

Asked about the &quot;Star Wars&quot; filmmaker's museum while at a business event in Decatur, Rauner said Lucas' planned donation of $743 million to build the museum is 'good for Illinois.'

<b>ONLY KIRK'S 'CLOSEST ALLIES' BELIEVE HE CAN WIN -- &quot;Ratings Change: Kirk Race Downgraded to Leans Democratic,&quot; by Roll Call's Nathan L. Gonzales: 
</b>&quot;Nearly a year ago, we moved Republican Mark S. Kirk from Tossup to Tilts Democratic. Over the past 12 months, there is little evidence that things have gotten any better for the senator and in fact the political climate may be getting much worse, prompting another ratings change ... Duckworth isn't the perfect candidate and Kirk might be able to outperform the top of the ticket, but not likely at the level necessary to win this year. And, quite frankly, no one outside of Kirk's closest allies believes he is going to win, including many Republicans. We're changing our rating from Tilts Democratic to Lean Democratic.&quot;

</b> &quot;After St. Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly, a Democrat, spoke critically of Republican U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk during a media teleconference in March, Republicans went looking for evidence. They wanted to know if there were any emails or phone records to show that Kelly used county resources or county time for political activity - and whether there was any connection to the campaign of Kirk's opponent, Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth. Kelly says the Kirk campaign won't find anything political in the fishing expedition. But now he's involved in a spat with Kirk's office over whether Kelly's staff has adequately complied with a records request.&quot;
