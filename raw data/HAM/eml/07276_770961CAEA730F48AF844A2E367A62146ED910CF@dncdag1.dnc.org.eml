Washington Post =96 Matea Gold

Leading Republicans are increasingly anxious that presumptive GOP president=
ial nominee Donald Trump is lagging far behind Democratic front-runner Hill=
ary Clinton when it comes to having an organized network of big-money allie=
s, triggering a chaotic scramble to set up a clear super PAC structure.

Because Trump condemned such entities throughout the primary contest, there=
 is no dominant group ready to channel the resources of the billionaires li=
ning up to back him, including casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who has sign=
aled plans to inject tens of millions into the race.

That leaves Trump advisers, GOP strategists and major donors puzzling over =
a key strategic question: Where should the six- and seven-figure contributi=
ons go?

Clinton=92s allies have built a deeply funded constellation of independent =
groups, and her main super PAC is readying a $136 million ad blitz that wil=
l kick off Wednesday. The fundraising imbalance is acute: The top three sup=
er PACs supporting Clinton had collected about $80 million through the end =
of March, compared with just $8 million by several potential Republican pre=
sidential players including American Crossroads, according to Federal Elect=
ion Commission filings.

The dynamic has triggered a rush to identify the right organization to harn=
ess Trump=92s rich allies and run a sophisticated independent campaign. Two=
 rival super PACs are in the mix, but both are newly formed and are viewed =
with skepticism by major donors and their advisers.

The free-for-all environment alarms veteran party strategists who have rece=
ntly signed on to try to help Trump win the White House.

=93If you have many elements trying to do their own thing, it can confuse t=
he message of the campaign,=94 said Ed Rollins, who was Ronald Reagan=92s c=
ampaign director in 1984 and is advising Great America PAC, one of the pro-=
Trump groups. =93We=92re all marching forward without clear direction at th=
is point.=94

Amid the jockeying, big donors who have expressed public support for the re=
al estate developer have yet to be contacted.

=93I haven=92t heard from anybody,=94 said Dallas investor Doug Deason, who=
se father, billionaire technology entrepreneur Darwin Deason, gave large su=
ms to super PACs allied with former Texas governor Rick Perry and Sen. Ted =
Cruz (Tex.). =93I think they=92re just really unorganized. They need to get=
 on it.=94


The lack of a major super PAC vehicle is a source of concern among top Trum=
p advisers, some of whom have reached out to experienced strategists in rec=
ent weeks to gauge their interest in launching a new entity, according to m=
ultiple people familiar with the conversations. Such outreach is potentiall=
y risky, since federal law prohibits a candidate=92s agent from establishin=
g a super PAC.

When asked if he was aware of such talks, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewa=
ndowski did not respond directly, writing in an email, =93Mr. Trump continu=
es to disavow all Super PAC=92s.=94

That unequivocal statement probably will further confuse major donors, who =
interpreted Trump=92s softening rhetoric on super PACs in recent media inte=
rviews as a sign that he was open to their support. (=93I know that people =
maybe like me and they form a super PAC, but I have nothing to do with it,=
=94 he told NBC last week.) On Saturday night, Trump retweeted a link to a =
New York Times report that Adelson is willing to spend as much as $100 mill=
ion to boost his bid.

Senior Republican strategists think that it would be extremely difficult fo=
r Trump to be competitive in the general election without the help of a wel=
l-financed outside operation. Trump is just now assembling a fundraising te=
am to try to raise $1 billion for his campaign and for the Republican Party=
 in five months, a steep goal.

Outside operatives said they plan to push forward with their efforts to try=
 to match the pro-Clinton operation.

=93From our perspective, we see it as necessary,=94 said Doug Watts, nation=
al executive director of the Committee for American Sovereignty, a new pro-=
Trump super PAC that launched last week.

Democrats have a significant head start. During the past year, a network of=
 super PACs and advocacy groups allied with Clinton have been aggressively =
fundraising and plotting a strategy to provide her with air cover and groun=
d support in the general election. The biggest super PAC, Priorities USA Ac=
tion, has reserved $130 million worth of television, radio and digital adve=
rtising that will begin in early June and extend almost continuously until =
election day in seven battleground states.


=93We want to do even more, and we will need to do more because we=92re run=
ning against a billionaire who will surely have help from Republican super =
PACs and special interests,=94 said Priorities spokesman Justin Barasky.

The group is working closely with major national advocacy groups such as Pl=
anned Parenthood, EMILY=92s List and the League of Conservation Voters, whi=
ch are running their own well-funded campaigns to promote Clinton. Labor un=
ions are also readying massive voter mobilization programs.

Meanwhile, the most influential outside groups on the right are still on th=
e sidelines of the presidential race. That includes the Koch political netw=
ork, which aims to spend $900 million in the run-up to the 2016 elections. =
Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch has been critical of Trump, and the =
network=92s resources are expected to boost conservative congressional cand=
idates rather than the Republican presidential nominee.

That dynamic reflects a widespread lack of consensus in the donor community=
 about how to engage: Some are appalled by Trump and have decided to focus =
only on Senate and House races, while others find him distasteful but do no=
t want to see Clinton elected.

The suite of Crossroads organizations, which together raised $300 million i=
n the 2012 elections, has yet to determine what role it will play in this y=
ear=92s White House contest. President Steven Law did not rule out getting =
involved in the race, but he said the group is still assessing donor intere=
st and conducting research about how it can be most effective. One possibil=
ity could be tying an anti-Clinton message to its campaigns supporting Repu=
blican senators.


=93Holding the Senate majority is going to be our North Star, so everything=
 we=92re currently planning to do relates to that fixed point on the compas=
s,=94 Law said.

Similarly, a new organization called Future45 that was formed last year to =
produce quick-strike ads against Clinton is in standby mode. Some of the gr=
oup=92s biggest backers, including the Ricketts family and hedge fund billi=
onaire Paul Singer, were major donors to an anti-Trump super PAC this year.

Adelson has been one of the most vocal Trump supporters within the billiona=
ire class, writing in a Washington Post op-ed last week that =93it=92s time=
 for all Republicans to mount up and back our nominee.=94 Other Trump backe=
rs who have the capacity to give enormous sums include Oklahoma oil baron H=
arold Hamm, Texas financier T. Boone Pickens, Home Depot co-founder Ken Lan=
gone and casino executive Phil Ruffin.

But donors are trying to assess whether there is a political operation that=
 they trust to use their funds effectively. Some of the biggest givers may =
set up their own operations, according to strategists familiar with the dis=
cussions.

Great America PAC, launched earlier this year by jewelry company chief exec=
utive William Doddridge, has had the largest presence among pro-Trump group=
s. But the organization has seen upheaval in its ranks, including the depar=
ture of tea party leader Amy Kremer and strategist Jesse Benton, who was co=
nvicted of conspiracy and campaign finance violations in a case stemming fr=
om the 2012 presidential campaign.

PAC officials said the group=92s leadership has stabilized with the arrival=
 of Rollins and other veteran political strategists, including Brent Lowder=
, a former executive director of the California Republican Party.

Pickens is set to host a briefing at his Texas ranch next month for prospec=
tive donors to the group, and some longtime GOP backers, such as Minnesota =
broadcasting executive Stanley Hubbard, have pledged to give money.

Great America says that it has amassed a database of 2 million Trump suppor=
ters and promises to invest heavily in TV ads and grass-roots activities.

=93The operation that people should be looking at is the one that has the i=
nfrastructure to ramp up in the swing states, and that=92s us,=94 said co-c=
hairman Eric Beach, who said he does not believe there is a need for two su=
per PACs.


But last week, the Committee for American Sovereignty launched with the aim=
 of raising $20 million by the July convention.

=93There might be some confusion and some donors may get multiple solicitat=
ions, but this is standard operating procedure,=94 said Watts, the group=92=
s national executive director. =93I expect two or three or maybe even four =
very legitimate super PACs that are in support of Trump.=94

The organization has its own issues: its chairman, former California state =
senator Tony Strickland, is facing a proposed $80,000 fine by the state Fai=
r Political Practices Commission for circumventing contribution limits in a=
 2010 campaign. In an interview, Strickland said that he is in negotiations=
 with the agency and the matter will be resolved this week.

Among those backing the new super PAC is Nicholas Ribis Sr., the former cha=
irman of Trump Hotel, Casino and Resorts, along with investor Nick Loeb and=
 California businessman Tim Yale. Watts said that he has fielded a surge of=
 interest from potential contributors in recent days.

=93There are plenty of donors out there who have been sitting on the sideli=
nes for months and months and months, wanting to get involved,=94 he said.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Adelson has been one of the most vocal Trump support=
ers within the billionaire class, writing in a Washington Post op-ed last w=

 to give enormous sums include Oklahoma oil baron Harold Hamm, Texas financ=
ier T. Boone Pickens, Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone and casino executiv=
e Phil Ruffin.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">But donors are trying to assess whether there is a p=
olitical operation that they trust to use their funds effectively. Some of =
the biggest givers may set up their own operations, according to strategist=
s familiar with the discussions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Great America PAC, launched earlier this year by jew=
elry company chief executive William Doddridge, has had the largest presenc=
e among pro-Trump groups. But the organization has seen upheaval in its ran=
ks, including the departure of tea
 party leader Amy Kremer and strategist Jesse Benton, who was convicted of =
conspiracy and campaign finance violations in a case stemming from the 2012=
 presidential campaign.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">PAC officials said the group=92s leadership has stab=

 including Brent Lowder, a former executive director of the California Repu=
blican Party.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Pickens is set to host a briefing at his Texas ranch=
 next month for prospective donors to the group, and some longtime GOP back=
ers, such as Minnesota broadcasting executive Stanley Hubbard, have pledged=
 to give money.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Great America says that it has amassed a database of=
 2 million Trump supporters and promises to invest heavily in TV ads and gr=
ass-roots activities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=93The operation that people should be looking at is=
 the one that has the infrastructure to ramp up in the swing states, and th=
at=92s us,=94 said co-chairman Eric Beach, who said he does not believe the=
re is a need for two super PACs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">But last week, the Committee for American Sovereignt=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=93There might be some confusion and some donors may=
 get multiple solicitations, but this is standard operating procedure,=94 s=

ree or maybe even four very legitimate super
 PACs that are in support of Trump.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The organization has its own issues: its chairman, f=
ormer California state senator Tony Strickland, is facing a proposed $80,00=
0 fine by the state Fair Political Practices Commission for circumventing c=
ontribution limits in a 2010 campaign.
 In an interview, Strickland said that he is in negotiations with the agenc=
y and the matter will be resolved this week.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Among those backing the new super PAC is Nicholas Ri=
bis Sr., the former chairman of Trump Hotel, Casino and Resorts, along with=
 investor Nick Loeb and California businessman Tim Yale. Watts said that he=
 has fielded a surge of interest from
 potential contributors in recent days.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=93There are plenty of donors out there who have bee=

 involved,=94 he said.<o:p></o:p></p>
