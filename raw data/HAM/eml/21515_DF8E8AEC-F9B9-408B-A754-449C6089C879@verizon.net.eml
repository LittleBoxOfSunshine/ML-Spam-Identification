Arthur, Giulio, Jody and Penny,

To =E2=80=9Cget registered=E2=80=9D so to speak, the best thing to do would=
 be to telephone Dan Parrish in order to give him the info=E2=80=99 that th=
e Secret Service needs.  The reason I=E2=80=99m suggesting email is that th=
ey need your Social Security # and that=E2=80=99s something that should not=
 be put into an email.  They also need your (legal) name (with middle initi=
al), home address, date of birth, occupation, and name of current employer.=
  (I believe that=E2=80=99s all they need.)

Meanwhile, in hooking us all up by email, I=E2=80=99m putting us in a posit=
ion to receive the address of the location of the dinner.  The invite is fr=
om =E2=80=9CThe Democratic National Committee and Ken Lerer & Katherine Sai=
ler" and I presume the dinner is at their apartment ("overlooking Central P=
ark" =E2=80=94 acc. to one article I=E2=80=99ve read).  We=E2=80=99ll learn=
 the address (I believe) only a few days before the dinner.

Finally, Dan Parish=E2=80=99s phone number is 202-479-5141.  Please telepho=
ne him today or tomorrow so that he=E2=80=99ll have what he needs from all =
six of us.

D

PS =E2=80=94 Giulio or Jody, it is not necessary for both of you to call =
=E2=80=94 either one of you can give the information for both.  (I just re-=
gave them the info=E2=80=99 for me and Ruth.)
