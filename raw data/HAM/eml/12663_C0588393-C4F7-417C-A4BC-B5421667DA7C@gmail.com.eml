Here they are:

First =E2=80=93 in stark contrast to Reince Preibus who (as John Kasich com=
plained just this week) declared Trump the winner of the primary while ther=
e were two other candidates still in the race =E2=80=93 DWS has been firmly=
 EVERY SINGLE time saying that Dems have two great candidates and when the =
primary is over one of them will be a great nominee.  When she is specifica=
lly asked if Bernie should get out, she says no and has repeatedly and did =
again last night.


Sanders/Jeff Weaver has 4 main complaints with DWS that I heard them repeat=
 last night and today:

1)      The debates =E2=80=93 a complaint  from long ago. That she put them=
 on weekends so people wouldn=E2=80=99t see them. Wrong. They worked with a=
ll the networks AND the campaigns on dates.  And the ratings showed they we=
re the highest watched debates in 3 election cycles =E2=80=93 Debates were =
a success!  And when he wanted more, she went to bat with the Clinton campa=
ign and got more debates

2)      That she cut off their access to DNC lists =E2=80=93 hello? Their s=
taffer went into the database unauthorized and reviewed Clinton targeting n=
ames.  And when the DNC discovered it and shut them down while they could r=
eport the extent of the damage, the Sanders campaign (brilliantly) played v=
ictim.  But they weren=E2=80=99t the victim they were the perpetrator

3)      The caucus rules and closed primaries =E2=80=93 Caucuses have alway=
s been rowdy but DWS made sure that the =E2=80=9CCredentials=E2=80=9D commi=
ttee governing each state party caucus was comprised of 50/50 Sanders/Clint=
on supporters.  In Nevada it was that committee that made the decision to d=
isqualify the delegates that Sanders campaign were complaining about. Becau=
se those were the rules.  So how about the rules? Closed primaries and cauc=
uses are decided state by state =E2=80=93 not so Bernie Sanders can=E2=80=
=99t win, but so Republicans can=E2=80=99t infiltrate a Democratic primary =
to manipulate outcomes.  Right or wrong =E2=80=93 and it is debatable =E2=
=80=93 those have been the rules for decades. Instead the Sanders campaign =
is acting like DWS made up those rules to keep him out.  He chose to run as=
 a Democrat because he wanted the advantage of the party.  Well with the ad=
vantages, come the disadvantages.  That was his choice, his responsibility,=
 not her fault.

4)      Nevada Her reaction to Nevada was a human reaction of this really n=
ice female state party chair who called upset because she and her family we=
re getting death threats.  She is a good progressive party loyalist and her=
 team in Nevada was being destroyed by threats and innuendo.  Debbie is loy=
al to people like that and so she reprimanded Bernie.  Because the fact is =
that when he says he is losing because the =E2=80=9CSystem is rigged=E2=80=
=9D instead of well - maybe he is just losing =E2=80=93 he encourages peopl=
e to lash out at the DNC and its leadership.
