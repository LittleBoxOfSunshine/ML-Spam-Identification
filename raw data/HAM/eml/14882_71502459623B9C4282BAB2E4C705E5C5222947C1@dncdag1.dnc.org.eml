Despite denials, Scott Walker was target of probe in 2011<http://www.jsonli=

MILWAUKEE JOURNAL SENTINEL // PATRICK MARLEY AND JASON STEIN


Madison- Gov. Scott Walker was under criminal investigation in 2011 for mis=
conduct in office - even as he insisted he wasn't - over a proposed real es=
tate deal when he was Milwaukee County executive, according to records file=
d Wednesday in federal court.



The Republican governor - who is running for president - was never charged =
with a crime and the investigation was closed two years ago.



Wednesday's filing shows the governor was at the center of the probe, contr=
adicting Walker's repeated claims at the time that he was not a target of t=
he investigation.



"I submit that there is probable cause to believe that Scott Walker, John H=
iller and Andrew Jensen, in concert together, committed a felony, i.e., Mis=
conduct in Public Office..." investigator Robert Stetler wrote in his 2011 =
request for a search warrant.



It was after getting the search warrant and the resulting evidence that pro=
secutors decided not to issue charges.



Hiller was Walker's campaign treasurer at the time. Jensen is a real estate=
 broker who worked on the deal.



Jensen was jailed for a night during the investigation. He ultimately coope=
rated with authorities<http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/report-scott-=
walker-probe-closed-with-no-new-charges-qh8vsfb-194194091.html> and Milwauk=
ee District Attorney John Chisholm's office released an unusual letter of e=
xoneration saying he was not a target of the probe.



Chisholm is a Democrat. Walker and other Republicans have contended he has =
been out to get conservatives - a charge Chisholm denies.



Stelter, who works in Chisholm's office, sought the search warrant for the =
home of Walker aide Cindy Archer on on Sept. 13, 2011. Reserve Judge Neal N=
ettesheim, who oversaw the investigation, granted it the same day.



The wide-ranging inquiry resulted in charges and convictions of six Walker =
aides and associates for matters that included campaigning using taxpayer r=
esources and stealing from a veterans fund. Prosecutors did not ultimately =
charge anyone over the real estate deal, and they shut down the probe<http:=
//www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/report-scott-walker-probe-closed-with-no-=
new-charges-qh8vsfb-194194091.html> in March 2013.

Before closing it, they opened a second investigation into whether Walker's=
 campaign had violated campaign finance laws by working closely with conser=
vative groups. The state Supreme Court ended that investigation last month,=
 concluding no laws had been broken.



Just before he faced a recall election in June 2012, Walker said the idea t=
hat he would become a subject of the probe was "just more of the liberal sc=
are tactics out there, desperately trying to get the campaign off target." =
Wednesday's filings show that nine months before then prosecutors had deter=
mined there was probably cause Walker had committed a crime.



Walker campaign spokeswoman AshLee Strong did not respond to a request for =
comment Wednesday. Over the weekend in response to questions about a differ=
ent court filing, she said by email that "prosecutors have said that Govern=
or Walker was not a target."



Hiller did not respond to requests for comment.



The 2011 document is surfacing now because Archer has sued Chisholm, arguin=
g her constitutional rights were violated when investigators searched her h=
ome. Prosecutors submitted the search warrant and affidavit Wednesday to bo=
lster their case they did their work by the book.



Wednesday's court filing concerns a part of the probe that looked into whet=
her bid-rigging occurred<http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/corrupt=
ion-investigation-looks-into-bids-to-house-county-workers-0s3t07c-138020933=
.html> as officials considered whether to move offices for the county's Dep=
artment of Aging.



Hiller and Jensen were involved in negotiations to extend the county's leas=
e at the privately owned Reuss Federal Plaza.



Walker told his chief of staff, Tom Nardelli, to seek a six-month extension=
 of the lease in June 2010, Stelter wrote in his affidavit. That was in the=
 county's interest because it would give the county more time to review its=
 options, according to Stelter.



Soon afterward, Walker told Hiller he needed Jensen's firm to deny the leas=
e extension - an action that was against the county's interest, Stelter wro=
te.
