cnn.com/2016/05/19/politics/donald-trump-2006-hopes-real-estate-market-cras=
hes/index.html>
By Jeremy Diamond, CNN

Two years before the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Ameri=
cans lost their homes, Donald Trump said he was hoping for a crash.

"I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and bu=
y," Trump said in a 2006 audiobook from Trump University, answering a quest=
ion about "gloomy predictions that the real estate market is heading for a =
spectacular crash."
The U.S. housing bubble burst two years later, triggering the stock market =
crash of 2008 that plunged the U.S. economy into a deep recession, leaving =
millions of Americans unemployed.

Trump was speaking with Jon Ward, a marketing consultant who "masterminded =
all the initial education programs for Trump University," according to his =
website<http://www.jonward.net/more-about-jon/>. The audiobook is available=
 on iTunes.

"If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you can make a lot o=
f money," Trump said in the 2006 audio book, "How to Build a Fortune." "If =
you're in a good cash position -- which I'm in a good cash position today -=
- then people like me would go in and buy like crazy."

The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

Few, including Trump, predicted the 2008 crash or the magnitude of the rece=
ssion that would ensue.

"I'm not a believer that the interest market -- that the real estate market=
 is going to take a big hit," Trump said in the same interview.

But Trump's comments in the audio book, a project of his Trump University -=
- which is currently facing three lawsuits representing thousands of former=
 students<http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/08/news/trump-university-controversy=
-donald-trump/> -- underscore the challenges the billionaire and presumptiv=
e Republican nominee will increasingly face in the general election as comm=
ents from his life before politics return to haunt him.

Trump has come under fire for a slew of remarks he made before entering the=
 presidential fray last year, from misogynistic comments about women to sta=
tements on certain issues that undercut his current policy positions.
But in beating back such criticism, Trump has sought to convince voters tha=
t, despite his multiple flirtations with running for president over the las=
t two decades, he never planned to run for president, "Don't forget, I was =
never going to run for office," he has said.

Trump, who has staked his candidacy on his wealth and business acumen, has =
also been unabashed about prioritizing his business interests above all els=
e -- even when it has involved helping politicians with policy positions an=
tithetical to his own.

He defended his hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to Democrats =
by saying that he "got along with everybody" in order to boost his business=
.

Trump has also defended the bankruptcies several of his businesses have und=
ergone, saying he has "taken advantage of the laws of this country," even a=
s thousands of his employees lost their jobs as a result.

And he has also defended manufacturing much of his merchandise abroad, incl=
uding in countries like China.
But as he launched his presidential bid last June, Trump flipped the script=
 and struck a decisively populist tone --pledging take on very same self-in=
terested maneuvers of businesses that he also employed -- and vowed to comp=
el U.S. businesses to manufacture in the U.S. and slammed the influence of =
special interests in Washington.

<span style=3D"background:yellow">Two years before the housing market colla=
psed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, Donald Trump said =
he was hoping for a crash.</span></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span style=3D"font-f=
amily:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
<span style=3D"background:yellow">&quot;I sort of hope that happens because=
 then people like me would go in and buy,&quot; Trump said in a 2006 audiob=
ook from Trump University, answering a question about &quot;gloomy predicti=
ons that the real estate market is heading for a
 spectacular crash.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The U.S. housing bubble burst two years later, trig=
gering the stock market crash of 2008 that plunged the U.S. economy into a =
deep recession, leaving millions of Americans unemployed.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
Trump was speaking with Jon Ward, a marketing consultant who &quot;mastermi=
nded all the initial education programs for Trump University,&quot;&nbsp;<a=
 href=3D"http://www.jonward.net/more-about-jon/" target=3D"_blank">accordin=
g to his website</a>. The audiobook is available on
 iTunes.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
<span style=3D"background:yellow">&quot;If there is a bubble burst, as they=
 call it, you know you can make a lot of money,&quot; Trump said in the 200=
6 audio book, &quot;How to Build a Fortune.&quot; &quot;If you're in a good=
 cash position -- which I'm in a good cash position today --
 then people like me would go in and buy like crazy.&quot;</span></span></p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=

The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
Few, including Trump, predicted the 2008 crash or the magnitude of the rece=
ssion that would ensue.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
&quot;I'm not a believer that the interest market -- that the real estate m=
arket is going to take a big hit,&quot; Trump said in the same interview.</=
span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
But Trump's comments in the audio book, a project of his Trump University -=
- which is currently facing&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/08=
/news/trump-university-controversy-donald-trump/">three lawsuits representi=
ng thousands of former students</a>&nbsp;--
 underscore the challenges the billionaire and presumptive Republican nomin=
ee will increasingly face in the general election as comments from his life=
 before politics return to haunt him.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
Trump has come under fire for a slew of remarks he made before entering the=
 presidential fray last year, from misogynistic comments about women to sta=
tements on certain issues that undercut his current policy positions.</span=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">But in beating back such criticism, Trump has sough=
t to convince voters that, despite his multiple flirtations with running fo=
r president over the last two decades, he never planned
 to run for president, &quot;Don't forget, I was never going to run for off=
ice,&quot; he has said.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
Trump, who has staked his candidacy on his wealth and business acumen, has =
also been unabashed about prioritizing his business interests above all els=
e -- even when it has involved helping politicians with policy positions an=
tithetical to his own.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
He defended his hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to Democrats =
by saying that he &quot;got along with everybody&quot; in order to boost hi=
s business.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
Trump has also defended the bankruptcies several of his businesses have und=
ergone, saying he has &quot;taken advantage of the laws of this country,&qu=
ot; even as thousands of his employees lost their jobs as a result.</span><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
And he has also defended manufacturing much of his merchandise abroad, incl=
uding in countries like China.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">But as he launched his presidential bid last June, =
Trump flipped the script and struck a decisively populist tone --pledging t=
ake on very same self-interested maneuvers of businesses
 that he also employed -- and vowed to compel U.S. businesses to manufactur=
e in the U.S. and slammed the influence of special interests in Washington.=
