Rubio's Boast Of Stopping Obamacare 'Bailout' Omits Some Crucial Facts<http=

290e521e056>

HUFFINGTON POST // JONATHAN COHN



Sen. Marco Rubio likes to brag that he is the mastermind<http://www.nytimes=
.com/2015/12/10/us/politics/marco-rubio-obamacare-affordable-care-act.html?=
_r=3D5&mtrref=3Dundefined> behind the Republicans' one successful attack on=
 the Affordable Care Act -- that he stopped a "bailout" of private insuranc=
e companies and, in the process, saved taxpayers $2.5 billion.



The boast has some truth. What the GOP presidential candidate doesn't menti=
on is that, because of his efforts, some people are likely to face higher p=
remiums for their health coverage and insurance markets on the whole are le=
ss stable.



Nor does Rubio mention that just last year he supported using taxpayer fund=
s to prop up another insurance program -- through an arrangement that more =
closely resembles a bailout than anything in the Affordable Care Act.



The object of Rubio's ire is the law's "risk corridor" program<http://healt=
haffairs.org/healthpolicybriefs/brief_pdfs/healthpolicybrief_134.pdf>. Its =
purpose is to smooth the transition<http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brie=
f/explaining-health-care-reform-risk-adjustment-reinsurance-and-risk-corrid=
ors/> from the old, unreformed insurance market to a world in which carrier=
s must provide insurance to anybody, regardless of pre-existing conditions,=
 and in which they cannot vary premiums based on likely medical risk.



The officials and lawmakers who actually wrote the Affordable Care Act unde=
rstood that, initially, insurers wouldn't know how to set their new premium=
s and design their new packages. The data collected before the health care =
law took effect simply couldn't provide enough information about who would =
actually sign up for coverage in the new market -- or what kind of policies=
 they'd want. Insurers might guess wrong, charge too much and make extra pr=
ofits. Or they might guess wrong, charge too little and incur extra losses.



The idea of risk corridors is to protect both the insurers and the taxpayer=
s. Insurers who made those extra profits would pay into the system, while i=
nsurers who saw unexpected losses would get money back.



The hope was that the program would turn out to be roughly revenue-neutral,=
 with the money coming in covering the money going out. It didn't work out =
that way.

On the whole, insurers expected a mix of customers with a relatively higher=
 proportion of healthier people than those who did sign up -- a legitimate =
problem, but one the risk corridors were designed to address. Following the=
 first year of coverage in 2014, insurers put in claims to the risk corrido=
r program worth a net $2.5 billion. (To be more precise, claims to obtain m=
oney from the program equaled $2.9 billion, while insurers' payments into t=
he system came to $362 million.)



By then, however, Rubio and other conservatives had already started attacki=
ng<http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/01/obamacare-bailout-the-new-d=
eath-panel.html> the program as a bailout -- not just of the health insuran=
ce industry, but of Obamacare itself. Administration officials tried to dod=
ge those attacks by stipulating that the program would be "budget neutral" =
without specifying how, precisely, the Department of Health and Human Servi=
ces would accomplish that.



Unsatisfied, Rubio called upon Congress to block HHS from shuffling funds w=
ithin the department budget. Late last year, he succeeded in passing such a=
n amendment to a big government spending bill. Under its terms, HHS in 2015=
 could make payments only with the money coming into the risk corridor prog=
ram from other insurers. The prohibition does not apply for 2016, which is =
why the issue is coming up now on Capitol Hill, with conservatives making t=
he same demands to block funding. Chances are good they will succeed.



Insurers understood the implications of Rubio's victory better, and earlier=
, than just about anybody else. They knew it would mean that the federal go=
vernment couldn't make the promised payments. Sure enough, the administrati=
on announced a few months ago that HHS would be paying just 13 percent of t=
he money that insurers had expected, because that's all the money it had at=
 its disposal.



Large insurers, like Blue Cross plans, have the customers and cash reserves=
 to absorb those losses pretty easily. It's a different story for smaller i=
nsurers who had counted on that money. The loss of risk corridor money is o=
ne reason, and maybe a big reason, that a dozen small cooperative insurers<=
http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/11/20/risk-corridor-payments-unitedhealt=
h-cooperatives-and-the-marketplaces/> have shut down in the last few months=
. Going forward, some insurers are bound to charge higher premiums, at leas=
t for the next year or two, because they can't count on risk corridor money=
 -- although we don't know how significant the premium increases will be or=
 how many people they will affect.



Rubio claims that his victory has weakened Obamacare and it has, albeit inc=
rementally. But the basic conceit of the Florida senator's claim -- that he=
's stopped a bailout, the kind most Americans associate with the Wall Stree=
t or auto industry rescues -- doesn't hold up to even casual scrutiny.



This wasn't a case of corporations acting irresponsibly and then, after inc=
urring hundreds of billions of dollars in losses, demanding that taxpayers =
rescue them. This was business and government agreeing in advance to share =
in either profits or losses, in order to help along a fledgling insurance m=
arket.



Politifact<http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/dec/07/marco-r=
ubio/rubio-says-he-prevented-25-billion-obamacare-bailo/> has rated Rubio's=

eiled-subsidy-of-them-why-the-distinction-matters/>. The numbers also put R=
ubio's boast into perspective, since $2.5 billion is tiny given the size of=

antly less than even its promoters expected.



Rubio and his allies might argue that they oppose risk corridors on sheer p=
rinciple, that government simply has no business insulating insurers from l=
osses (or sharing in their profits). But if that's the case, the Affordable=
 Care Act shouldn't be the only government insurance program on their targe=
t lists. Medicare Part D<http://ccf.georgetown.edu/all/how-the-three-rs-con=
tributed-to-the-success-of-medicare-part-d/> should be too.



Part D, which a Republican Congress designed and a Republican president sig=
ned into law in 2003<http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/12/08/elec04.medic=
are/>, provides prescription drug benefits to seniors and the disabled thro=
ugh private insurance companies. It has a risk corridor program that operat=
es almost exactly like the one in the Affordable Care Act. The only substan=
tive difference is that Part D's program is permanent. Yet neither Rubio no=
r any other conservative is yelling about that.



But, then, Rubio's definition of a "bailout" seems to change a great deal d=
epending upon the circumstances. Early in 2014, the federal flood insurance=
 program<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/01/10/flood-insur=
ance-florida-rate-hikes/4393799/> came up short on funds and needed an infu=
sion of dollars. Without the extra money, flood insurance premiums would ha=
ve risen sharply and real estate markets could have taken a hit. The proble=
ms would have been particularly severe in Florida, with its low-lying land =
and vulnerability to hurricanes. Rubio hemmed and hawed a bit, called for l=
ong-term changes to the program, but ultimately voted for the infusion of m=
oney because it would spare his constituents the financial burden.



That's a fair position for an elected official, even a conservative one, to=
 take. But Rubio seems to think the same calculus doesn't apply when there'=
s an opportunity to score political points against President Barack Obama a=
nd his health care law.

 a bailout than anything in the Affordable Care Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

law's&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://healthaffairs.org/healthpolicybriefs/brief_pdf=

 Its purpose is to smooth the&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://kff.org/health-reform/=
issue-brief/explaining-health-care-reform-risk-adjustment-reinsurance-and-r=
isk-corridors/" target=3D"_blank">transition</a>&nbsp;from the old, unrefor=

 must provide insurance to anybody, regardless of pre-existing conditions, =
and in which they cannot vary premiums based on likely medical risk.<o:p></=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The officials and lawmakers who a=
ctually wrote the Affordable Care Act understood that, initially, insurers =
wouldn't know how to set their new premiums and design their
 new packages. The data collected before the health care law took effect si=
mply couldn't provide enough information about who would actually sign up f=
or coverage in the new market -- or what kind of policies they'd want. Insu=
rers might guess wrong, charge too
 much and make extra profits. Or they might guess wrong, charge too little =
and incur extra losses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The idea of risk corridors is to =
protect both the insurers and the taxpayers. Insurers who made those extra =
profits would pay into the system, while insurers who saw
 unexpected losses would get money back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The hope was that the program wou=
ld turn out to be roughly revenue-neutral, with the money coming in coverin=
g the money going out. It didn't work out that way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">On the whole, insurers expected a=
 mix of customers with a relatively higher proportion of healthier people t=
han those who did sign up&nbsp;-- a legitimate problem, but one
 the risk corridors were designed to address. Following the first year of c=
overage in 2014, insurers put in claims to the risk corridor program worth =
a net $2.5 billion. (To be more precise, claims to obtain money from the pr=
ogram equaled $2.9 billion, while
 insurers' payments into the system came to $362 million.)<o:p></o:p></span=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">By then, however, Rubio and other=
 conservatives had&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/201=
4/01/obamacare-bailout-the-new-death-panel.html" target=3D"_blank">already
 started attacking</a>&nbsp;the program as a bailout -- not just of the hea=
lth insurance industry, but of Obamacare itself. Administration officials t=
ried to dodge those attacks by stipulating that the program would be &quot;=
budget neutral&quot; without specifying how, precisely,
 the Department of Health and Human Services would accomplish that.<o:p></o=
:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"color:#1F497D"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></=
span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Unsatisfied, Rubio called upon Co=
ngress to block HHS from shuffling funds within the department budget. Late=
 last year, he succeeded in passing such an amendment to
 a big government spending bill. Under its terms, HHS in 2015 could make pa=
yments only with the money coming into the risk corridor program from other=
 insurers. The prohibition does not apply for 2016, which is why the issue =
is coming up now on Capitol Hill,
 with conservatives making the same demands to block funding. Chances are g=
ood they will succeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Insurers understood the implicati=
ons of Rubio's victory better, and earlier, than just about anybody else. T=
hey knew it would mean that the federal government couldn't
 make the promised payments. Sure enough, the administration announced a fe=
w months ago that HHS would be paying just 13 percent of the money that ins=
urers had expected, because that's all the money it had at its disposal.<o:=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Large insurers, like Blue Cross p=
lans, have the customers and cash reserves to absorb those losses pretty ea=
sily. It's a different story for smaller insurers who had
 counted on that money. The loss of risk corridor money is one reason, and =
maybe a big reason, that a dozen small&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://healthaffairs=
.org/blog/2015/11/20/risk-corridor-payments-unitedhealth-cooperatives-and-t=
he-marketplaces/" target=3D"_blank">cooperative
 insurers</a>&nbsp;have shut down in the last few months. Going forward, so=
me insurers are bound to charge higher premiums, at least for the next year=
 or two, because they can't count on risk corridor money -- although we don=
't know how significant the premium increases
 will be or how many people they will affect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Rubio claims that his victory has=
 weakened Obamacare and it has, albeit incrementally. But the basic conceit=
 of the Florida senator's claim&nbsp;-- that he's stopped a bailout,
 the kind most Americans associate with the Wall Street or auto industry re=
scues -- doesn't hold up to even casual scrutiny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">This wasn't a case of corporation=
s acting irresponsibly and then, after incurring hundreds of billions of do=
llars in losses, demanding that taxpayers rescue them. This
 was business and government agreeing in advance to share in either profits=
 or losses, in order to help along a fledgling insurance market.<o:p></o:p>=

calling the risk corridors a bailout is wrong</a>. The numbers also put Rub=
io's boast into perspective, since $2.5 billion is tiny given the size of O=
bamacare&nbsp;-- and the health care law is, by all accounts, costing signi=
ficantly less than even its promoters
 expected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Rubio and his allies might argue =
that they oppose risk corridors on sheer principle, that government simply =
has no business insulating insurers from losses (or sharing
 in their profits). But if that's the case, the Affordable Care Act shouldn=
't be the only government insurance program on their target lists.&nbsp;<a =

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

ss designed and a&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/12/08=
/elec04.medicare/">Republican president signed into law in 2003</a>,
 provides prescription drug benefits to seniors and the disabled through pr=
ivate insurance companies. It has a risk corridor program that operates alm=
ost exactly like the one in the Affordable Care Act. The only substantive d=
ifference is that Part D's program
 is permanent. Yet neither Rubio nor any other conservative is yelling abou=
t that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">But, then, Rubio's definition of =
a &quot;bailout&quot; seems to change a great deal depending upon the circu=
mstances. Early in 2014, the&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://www.usatoday.com/story/=
news/politics/2014/01/10/flood-insurance-florida-rate-hikes/4393799/">feder=
al
 flood insurance program</a>&nbsp;came up short on funds and needed an infu=
sion of dollars.&nbsp;Without the extra money, flood insurance premiums wou=
ld have risen sharply and real estate markets could have taken a hit. The p=
roblems would have been particularly severe
 in Florida, with its low-lying land and vulnerability to hurricanes. Rubio=
 hemmed and hawed a bit, called for long-term changes to the program, but u=
ltimately voted for the infusion of money because it would spare his consti=
tuents the financial burden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">That's a fair position for an ele=
cted official, even a conservative one, to take. But Rubio seems to think t=
he same calculus doesn't apply when there's an opportunity
 to score political points against President Barack Obama and his health ca=
re law.<span style=3D"color:#1F497D"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
