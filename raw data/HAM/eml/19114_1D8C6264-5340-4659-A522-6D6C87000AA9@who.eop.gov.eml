Subject: ATTENTION--Nordic Arrival Ceremony Inclement Weather Cancellation

Good Evening,

Due to inclement weather, the outdoor portion of tomorrow's Nordic Arrival =
Ceremony has been cancelled and moved inside the White House. Unfortunately=
, the event is now closed to the public and any guest who arrives for the S=
tate Arrival ceremony will be turned away. Please advise your guests of thi=
s change and ensure they understand that it nullifies their invitation to t=
he event.

There are no opportunities for the public to attend the indoor ceremony; no=
 exceptions will be made. We encourage guests to view the ceremony live on =
Whitehouse.gov/live.

As always, feel free to direct your guests to the 24-hour hotline if they h=
ave any questions (202-456-7041). This number can also be found at the bott=
om of their State Arrival Boarding Pass.

Thank you,
The White House Visitors Office
