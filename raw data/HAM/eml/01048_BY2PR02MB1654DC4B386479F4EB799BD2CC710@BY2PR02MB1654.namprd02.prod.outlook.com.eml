Hi Christine -

David Simas, Sr Advisor to the President, will be in Chicago next Thursday =
and Friday for a series of meetings with people.  Does Michael  have any ti=
me/interest in seeing him?  He is basically an open book so let us know.

This is simply just a catch up and talk meeting.

Thanks - Jordan
