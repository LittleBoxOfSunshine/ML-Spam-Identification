White supremacist groups see Trump bump<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/=

POLITICO//BEN SCHRECKINGER

The Ku Klux Klan is using Donald Trump as a talking point in its outreach e=
fforts. Stormfront, the most prominent American white supremacist website, =
is upgrading its servers in part to cope with a Trump traffic spike. And fo=
rmer Louisiana Rep. David Duke reports that the businessman has given more =
Americans cover to speak out loud about white nationalism than at any time =
since his own political campaigns in the 1990s.

As hate group monitors at the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defa=
mation League warn that Trump's rhetoric is conducive to anti-Muslim violen=
ce, white nationalist leaders are capitalizing on his candidacy to invigora=
te and expand their movement.

"Demoralization has been the biggest enemy and Trump is changing all that,"=
 said Stormfront founder Don Black, who reports additional listeners and ca=
ll volume to his phone-in radio show, in addition to the site's traffic bum=
p. Black predicts that the white nationalist forces set in motion by Trump =
will be a legacy that outlives the businessman's political career. "He's ce=
rtainly creating a movement that will continue independently of him even if=
 he does fold at some point."

Trump does not belong to or endorse white supremacist groups. He has said t=
hat he does not need or want Duke's endorsement and his campaign has fired =
two staffers over racist posts on social media. A man displaying a Confeder=
ate flag was ejected from a Trump rally in Virginia earlier this month.

But its leaders consistently say that Trump's rhetoric about minority group=
s has successfully tapped into simmering racial resentments long ignored by=
 mainstream politicians and that he has brought more attention to their age=
nda than any American political figure in years. It is a development many o=
f them see as a golden opportunity.

Meanwhile, analysts from the two leading organizations that track violence =
against minority groups say Trump is energizing hate groups and creating an=
 atmosphere likely to lead to more violence against American Muslims.

According to experts at the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty=
 Law Center who monitor hate groups and anti-Muslim sentiment, Trump's call=
 on Monday to halt the entrance of Muslims to the United States is driving =
online chatter among white supremacists and is likely to inspire violence a=
gainst Muslims.

"When well-known public figures make these kind of statements in the public=
 square, they are taken as a permission-giving by criminal elements who go =
out and act on their words." said Mark Potok of the SPLC. "Is it energizing=
 the groups? Yeah. They're thrilled."

Marilyn Mayo, co-director of the ADL's Center on Extremism, said Trump's pr=
oposal this week to halt the entrance of Muslims into the United States is =
only the latest statement to inject vigor into the racist fringe of America=
n politics. "Since the beginning of Donald Trump's candidacy, we've definit=
ely seen that a segment of the white supremacist movement, from racist inte=
llectuals to neo-Nazis have been energized," she said.

A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not respond to requests for commen=
t.

His rhetoric on minority groups has been condemned as racist by political o=
bservers on both the left and right and by the protesters who regularly int=
errupt his rallies. In his announcement speech in June, Trump said of undoc=
umented Mexican immigrants, "They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime=
. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." After terror attac=
ks killed 130 in Paris last month, he entertained the creation of a nationa=
l database of all Muslims. On Monday, after Muslim extremists shot 14 dead =
in California earlier this month, Trump called for a halt on the entrance o=
f Muslims into the United States.

The white racist fringe of American politics is a fragmented one, where att=
itudes toward Trump range from full-fledged embrace to cautious optimism to=
 skepticism.

Black of Stormfront said Trump's rhetoric has been a boon to white national=
ists. "He has sparked an insurgency and I don't think it's going to go away=
," he told POLITICO of Trump.

Black, who said his site receives a million unique visitors a month, said T=
rump has helped drive a steady increase in traffic in recent months - inclu=
ding 30-40 percent spikes when the businessman makes news on immigration or=
 Muslims - that is compelling him to upgrade his servers.

Rachel Pendergraft, a spokeswoman for the Arkansas-based Knights Party, whi=
ch considers itself the national standard-bearer for the KKK, said the grou=
p encourages its members to engage with their communities through apolitica=
l volunteer work and, at the right moment, steer conversation toward race a=
nd "white genocide."

Trump, she said, has offered KKK members a prime opportunity to feel out po=
tential recruits on their racial attitudes. "Right now he is a major talkin=
g point. He is in the news a lot."

Duke, a former grand wizard of the KKK and perhaps the most notorious racis=
t intellectual in the United States, said Trump, a successful businessman a=
nd the subject of nonstop media coverage, has given Americans license to mo=
re openly voice their racial animus.

"He's made it ok to talk about these incredible concerns of European Americ=
ans today, because I think European Americans know they are the only group =
that can't defend their own essential interests and their point of view," D=
uke said. "He's meant a lot for the human rights of European Americans."

Even those white supremacists who remain unconvinced that Trump is one of t=
hem welcome his entrance to the political arena. "As long as he's causing c=
haos and havoc with the citizens, he's fine with me," said former KKK leade=
r Tom Metzger, founder of the racial separatist group White Aryan Resistanc=
e. "I love it."

But like other white nationalist leaders, Metzger - who served jail time fo=
r unlawful assembly for taking part in a cross burning in California - said=
 he was skeptical that Trump would actually follow through on many of the p=
roposals that appeal to them most. That includes the businessman's latest c=
all to halt the entrance of Muslims into the country. "It's going to get pe=
ople excited and it could get out of hand ... He'd have to employ the milit=
ary to do it, and I don't think they're going to do that."

Brad Griffin, publisher of the white nationalist blog Occidental Dissent, i=
s among Trump's skeptics. "Do we honestly believe that he's going to block =
all the Muslims and deport all the illegals?" he said. "I think he's doing =
a lot of this just to signal to people that he's on their side."

Griffin said that he was most enthusiastic about Trump's candidacy this sum=
mer, but that his fervor has cooled since seeing details of the businessman=
's tax and trade policies, which hew more closely to mainstream Republican =
positions than he had hoped.

Griffin said his white nationalist circles remain divided.

"There are people who are really excited about Trump and are true believers=
 and there are people who believe Trump is just a politician. He's brought =
attention to a lot of our issues, but those were our issues 20 years ago."

 about these incredible concerns of European Americans today, because I thi=
nk European Americans know they are the only group that can&#8217;t defend
 their own essential interests and their point of view,&#8221; Duke said. &=

main unconvinced that Trump is one of them welcome his entrance to the poli=
tical arena. &#8220;As long as he&#8217;s causing chaos and havoc with
 the citizens, he&#8217;s fine with me,&#8221; said former KKK leader Tom M=
etzger, founder of the racial separatist group White Aryan Resistance. &#82=
20;I love it.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ders, Metzger &#8211; who served jail time for unlawful assembly for taking=
 part in a cross burning in California &#8211; said he was skeptical
 that Trump would actually follow through on many of the proposals that app=
eal to them most. That includes the businessman&#8217;s latest call to halt=
 the entrance of Muslims into the country. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to get p=
eople excited and it could get out of hand &#8230; He&#8217;d
 have to employ the military to do it, and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;r=
e going to do that.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 nationalist blog Occidental Dissent, is among Trump&#8217;s skeptics. &#82=
20;Do we honestly believe that he&#8217;s going to block all the Muslims an=
d
 deport all the illegals?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s doing a=
 lot of this just to signal to people that he&#8217;s on their side.&#8221;=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Ti=

iastic about Trump&#8217;s candidacy this summer, but that his fervor has c=
ooled since seeing details of the businessman&#8217;s tax and trade
 policies, which hew more closely to mainstream Republican positions than h=

 of our issues, but those were our issues 20 years ago.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></=
