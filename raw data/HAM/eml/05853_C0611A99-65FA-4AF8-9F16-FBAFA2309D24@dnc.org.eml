Looping Su Yen, Luis and the talking points that DNC Comms developed.

------------
Talking Points on Party Unity: Democrats Overwhelmingly United

  *   Polls continue to show that Democrats are overwhelmingly united and e=
xcited about both of our candidates.
  *   By and large we've had a great primary, with substantive candidates w=
hose vision to move America forward lines up with the values of the America=
n people.
  *   And we're going to come out of our convention more unified and strong=
er than ever, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with thei=
r dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their par=
ty.
  *   Just look at the new poll today from CBS/New York Times:

 A new CBS/NYT poll<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/19/us/politi=
cs/poll-presidential-race.html?version=3Dmeter+at+0&contentId=3D&mediaId=3D=
&referrer=3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&priority=3Dtrue&action=3Dclick&=
contentCollection=3DPolitics&module=3DRelatedCoverage&region=3DEndOfArticle=
&pgtype=3Darticle> shows that Democrats are more united today than in May o=
f 2008, disproving the myth of Democratic disunity heading into the 2016 el=
ection.

The poll showed that 72 percent of Senator Sanders=92 supporters said they =
would vote for Secretary Clinton, and 78 percent of Senator Sanders=92 supp=
orters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton. In May of 2008, polling =
found only 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for then-S=
enator Obama, who was eventually elected to a landslide victory.

Furthermore, the poll shows that 80 percent of Democrats are =93mostly hope=
ful=94 about the future of the Democratic Party, as opposed to Republicans,=
 who are split 55%-43% between =93mostly hopeful=94 and =93mostly discourag=
ed=94 about the future of the Republican Party.

[cid:image001.png@01D1B292.E2719940]


This echoes what we=92ve seen in exit poll after exit poll after exit poll:

Indiana<http://fortune.com/2016/05/03/exit-polls-from-indiana-democrats-are=
-excited-republicans-are-divided/>:
Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they=92ve been energized by th=
e nomination contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and =
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But nearly 6 in 10 Republicans say they think =
their party has been divided by the battle being fought by billionaire Dona=
ld Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut<http://www.wsj.com/articles/voters-have=
-strong-views-on-gop-convention-1461716342>:
Democratic voters, unlike Republicans, said the primary season had energize=
d their party. Two-thirds or more of Democrats who cast ballots in Pennsylv=
ania, Maryland and Connecticut said their party was more energized, while l=
ess than one-third said it was divided, exit polls showed.
New York<http://elections.ap.org/content/ny-exit-poll-heated-primaries-ener=
gize-dems-divide-gop>:
Almost 6 in 10 New York Republican voters say their party has been divided =
by the nomination process, while only 3 in 10 Democratic voters say the sam=
e about their party's primaries. Less than 4 in 10 GOP voters say they've b=
een energized, exit polls show, compared with two-thirds of Democratic vote=
rs who say that about their side.
It=92s clear that heading into the 2016 elections, Democrats are united and=
 energized, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with their =
dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their party=
.
