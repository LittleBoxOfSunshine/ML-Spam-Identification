The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friends-

We are excited to announce that President Obama will be in Miami on Friday,=
 June 3rd for a dinner benefitting the Democratic National Committee! This =
is a great opportunity to support the DNC and ultimately stop Donald Trump =
from reaching the White House in 2016.

President Obama has built a tremendous legacy during his time in office and=
 it is extremely important that we keep the White House and elect a Democra=
t to further his legacy.  We need to build on President Obama's hard work a=
nd continue to make progressive change that will benefit generations to com=
e.=20

This may be the last time President Obama visits Miami as a sitting Preside=
nt, making it a truly special event.=20

We hope that we can count on your support for this special evening at one o=
f the following levels:

=E2=80=A2	Contribute $10,000 per person to attend as a dinner guest and rec=
eive a photo
=E2=80=A2	Contribute $33,400 per couple to attend as a co-host and receive =
a photo
