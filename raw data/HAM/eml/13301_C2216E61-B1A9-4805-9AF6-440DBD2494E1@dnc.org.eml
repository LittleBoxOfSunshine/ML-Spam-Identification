Hi both,

We're working on a story about the convention. The angle for now is that Sa=
nders will have limited leverage in Philadelphia because the committees wil=
l be made up of state delegates allocated based on each state's votes in th=
e primary.

Also, the platform committee chair=97appointed by DWS, according to the rul=
es=97appoints the platform drafters. So Sanders will have little direct inf=
luence over the platform.

Questions for you: Have all the committee chairs been approved?
Is the take=97that Sanders is already losing convention battle=97fair?
What preparations are taking place in the coming months?

Would be great to get ahead of this, and I'm sure much of it is going on no=
w. Would be great to get thoughts.

Also a beer or two.

Thanks both=97
