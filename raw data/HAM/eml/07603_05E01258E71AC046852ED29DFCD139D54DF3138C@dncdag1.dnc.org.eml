MSNBC: Democrats consider new rules to avoid convention chaos<http://www.ms=

PHILADELPHIA =96 Still reeling from the chaos surrounding last weekend=92s =
Nevada Democratic State Convention, party officials considered new guidelin=
es Friday that would bar interruptions of any kind at upcoming state conven=
tions.

Last week=92s unrest was on everyone=92s mind at a meeting here of State De=
mocratic Party chairmen, who rallied around Roberta Lange, the Nevada chair=
 who has received death threats from supporters of Bernie Sanders.

=93Any one of us could be Roberta one day,=94 Democratic National Committee=
 Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said. =93But none of us are going to s=
tand for it.=94

In a speech dedicated almost entirely to projecting confidence that the par=
ty will ultimately unify, Wasserman Schultz drew on her experience as a die=
-hard Hillary Clinton supporter in 2008.

=93To say that I was not very well-liked by then-Sen. Obama=92s supporters =
would be an understatement. Despised might be more accurate,=94 Wasserman S=
chultz said. =93I share that story with you because I want to remind everyo=
ne that we have been down this road before.=94

She mocked the =93media=92s love affair with notions of party discord=94 an=
d said she was =93confident that we will channel the passion and energy fro=
m our primary into unity behind a common purpose.=94

Last week=92s convention in Las Vegas devolved into chaos. Sanders supporte=
rs loudly objected to the procedure, claiming their supporters were being d=
isenfranchised. It stretched on for hours as officials lost control, before=
 security finally shut down the event. Unrest continued the next day when t=
he Democratic Party=92s headquarters were vandalized by graffiti and Lange =
received threats.

The incident has led Democrats to worry about unrest at the Democratic Nati=
onal Convention, which will take place here in July. Some Sanders supporter=
s have already promised protests.
Sanders supporters loudly objected to the procedure, claiming their support=
ers were being disenfranchised.

As state party chairs, they were also worried about the dozen or so state c=
onventions that will occur before the national event. Some expressed partic=
ular concern about Wyoming=92s convention, scheduled for next week.

=93The experience of the Nevada Convention demands that action be taken,=94=
 said Ray Buckley, the New Hampshire party chairman, who also serves as pre=
sident of the Association of State Democratic Party Chairs.

He said every state party was =93stunned and saddened=94 by what happened i=
n Nevada, but that state was not alone in seeing =93bad behavior=94 at part=
y events.

Buckley called on the Sanders campaign, along with the Clinton=92s campaign=
 and the DNC, to agree to eight new guidelines to ensure peace at upcoming =
state conventions.

The guidelines called for cost sharing for extra security, more meetings to=
 hammer out issues ahead of time and for senior officials with both campaig=
ns to be on the floor of the convention to help reign in supporters if need=
 be.

He also called on all parties to agree that conventions should proceed =93w=
ithout interruption or interference of any manner,=94 including =93auditory=
 or visual distractions.=94

Jaxon Ravens, the chairman of the Washington State Party, added that party =
officials should take extra safety and security precautions at state party =
offices.

Several party chairs stood to publicly thank Lange. =93It=92s not about Nev=
ada any more, it=92s about all of us,=94 she replied.

Lange told MSNBC that she is still receiving threats from Sanders supporter=
s and fears for her safety. She said she has yet to hear from the Sanders c=
ampaign.

Clinton campaign manage Robby Mook briefly addressed the group Friday and w=
ill speak again Saturday. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver was schedule=
d to appear, but canceled, several sources said. Sanders=92 political direc=
tor addressed the group Thursday.


After Nevada chaos, Dems propose new rules for state conventions<http://www=

PHILADELPHIA =97 Democratic Party leaders are proposing a set of new rules =
governing conduct at upcoming state party conventions to avoid a repeat of =
the chaos in Nevada that has sent worries about party unity up the spines o=
f Democrats nationwide.



Speaking to fellow party chairs at the spring meeting of the Association of=
 State Democratic Chairs in Philadelphia, the group=92s leader, New Hampshi=
re's Raymond Buckley, laid down a set of guidelines that would commit the D=
emocratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders cam=
paigns to maintaining an active presence at the remaining events. He said b=
oth campaigns have agreed to follow through.



=93Every state party was stunned and saddened by what was alleged to have o=
ccurred in Nevada. Unfortunately, while Nevada has gotten the most coverage=
, it=92s not the only example of bad behavior at a state party convention t=
his year, and that needs to be addressed,=94 Buckley said to a conference r=
oom of elected Democrats in the Sheraton Downtown hotel, referring to the d=
iscordant Saturday convention that had to be shut down by hotel security af=
ter Sanders supporters protested the proceedings, believing the rules were =
being changed unfairly and that their representatives were not being proper=
ly seated. In the days since the meeting, at which Sanders backers also sho=
uted down Clinton-backing California Sen. Barbara Boxer, Nevada Democratic =
Party Chairwoman Roberta Lange has received death threats and abuse from Sa=
nders supporters.



=93It is not acceptable for a state chair, or anyone participating within t=
he Democratic Party for that matter, to be the victim of death threats or h=
ave their families=92 safety or jobs threatened,=94 Buckley said.



The proposals =97 which drew no audible protests =97 include having the cam=
paigns and DNC commit to sending senior staff members to be on site for the=
 conventions, having the convention leaders provide their proposed rules to=
 both campaigns and the DNC at least 48 hours early, ensuring all speakers =
run without interruptions, and securing a commitment from both campaigns an=
d the national party to help with the cost of any needed law enforcement or=
 security.



The plan came at the top of the meeting=92s public afternoon session, short=
ly before party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz spoke. Most of the meet=
ing =97 which was attended by Sanders deputy campaign manager Rich Pelletie=
r and political outreach director Nick Carter, as well as Clinton campaign =
manager Robby Mook =97 was dedicated to logistical planning for July=92s na=
tional convention.



The other four legs of Buckley=92s proposal are to have the campaigns and D=
NC commit to meeting with the state party about their concerns the day befo=
re the convention, have the state parties work to ensure every delegate is =
properly registered and explained, make sure all delegates can participate =
safely, and have the campaigns and DNC be willing to assist in enforcing th=
ese rules.
