Subject: travel pool 1/obama civil society meeting

The president met at the Marriott with a group of six Vietnamese civil so=
ciety leaders, with Potus seated at the head of a U-shaped table. Two fem=
ale activists sat next two him. Sec. Kerry, Susan Rice, US Amb. Ted Osius=
 and Ben Rhodes also joined the meeting.
The pool was led into the conference room at about 11:45 and the presiden=
t spoke for about 5 minutes about ensuring that importance of free speech=
, press and the internet.
"Vietnam has made remarkable strides, the economy is growing quickly, the=
 internet is booming, and there's a growing confidence here. But as I ind=
icated yesterday there's still areas of significant concerns in terms of =
areas of free speech, freedom of assembly, accountability with respect to=
 government. I emphasized in my meetings yesterday.. that we respect the =
sovereignty and independence of Vietnam. Ultimately, it's up to the Vietn=
amese people to determine how their society functions and the nature of t=
heir government. But we do believe there are some fundamental human value=
s and it's up to us to speak out in behalf of those values wherever we go=
. And it's particularly important and useful for me to hear directly form=
 those who often under very difficult conditions are willing to make thei=
r voices heard on behalf of greater freedom and human rights. I should no=
te that there were several other activists who were invited that were pre=
vented from coming for various reasons, and it's an indication that there=
 has been some modest progress and it is our hope that through some legal=
 reforms that have been drafted and passed that there are some folks who =
find it very difficult to assemble and organize peacefully around issues =
that they care deeply about. It's my hope the government of Vietnam comes=
 to recognize what we recognize and so many countries around the world ha=
ve come to recognize: That it's very hard to prosper in this modern econo=
my when you haven't fully unleashed the potential of your people and your=
 people's potential in part derives from their ability to express themsel=
ves and express new ideas to try to right wrongs that are taking place in=
 the society. So it's my hope that increasingly the Vietnamese government=
, seeing the enormous strides that the country is making has more confide=
nce that its people want to work together but also want to be able to ass=
embly and participate in the society in way that will be good for everyon=
e in the long run."
Pool was quickly ushered out and into the vans for the 3-minute drive to =
the convention center. Obama's speech is open press.
