Several things in common if we want to do anything with.





TRUMP TOUTED AN ENDORSEMENT BY FORMER REP. LIGHTFOOT



Trump Touted An Endorsement By Former Rep. Lightfoot. "Today Donald J. Trump received the endorsement of respected former Congressman James Lightfoot of Iowa. Mr. Trump has been endorsed by dozens of elected officials, including Congressmen, Senators, State Representatives and other key members of the Republican Party. Mr. Trump stated, 'I am proud to receive the endorsement of former Congressman Lightfoot. I have tremendous respect for him and I greatly appreciate his support.'" [Press Release, Donald Trump for President, 5/16/16<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-endorsed-by-congressman-james-lightfoot>]



REP. LIGHTFOOT TRIED TO REPEAL THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE



Rep. Lightfoot Called To Eliminate The Federal Minimum Wage, Saying It Hurt Businesses. "Third District Congressman Jim Ross Lightfoot on Thursday proposed elimination of the federal minimum wage, saying it's a phony device that hurts businesses. Instead, Lightfoot said each state should be allowed to set its own minimum wage." [Daily Reporter, 5/11/96<https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1907&dat=19960511&id=Rd8xAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zWgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1565,682301&hl=en>]



Rep. Lightfoot Introduced Legislation To Repeal The Federal Minimum Wage. [HR 3481, 104th Congress, introduced 5/16/96<https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/house-bill/3481?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22hr3481%5C%22%22%5D%7D&resultIndex=1>]



TRUMP SAID U.S. WAGES WERE TOO AND THAT THERE DID NOT NEED TO BE A FEDERAL FLOOR FOR WAGES



Donald Trump Opposed Raising The Minimum Wage Because: "Wages Too High, We're Not Going To Be Able To Compete Against The World." TRUMP: "But, taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we cannot do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can't do it." CAVUTO: "So do not raise the minimum wage?" TRUMP: "I would not do it." [Republican Primary Debate, Milwaukee WI, 11/10/15]



Trump On Whether The Federal Government Should Set A Floor For Wages: "No." TRUMP: "I will -- I have seen what`s going on and I don`t know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude, but I`d rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide, because don`t forget, the states have to compete with each other."  TODD: "Right. You want the fed--" TRUMP: "So you may have--" TODD: "-- but should the federal government set a floor and then you let the state--" TRUMP: "No, I would--  No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck." TODD: "All right." TRUMP: "So I like the idea of let the states decide." [Meet The Press, NBC, 5/8/16]



REP. LIGHTFOOT OPPOSED THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT



Rep. Lightfoot Voted Against Passage Of The Family And Medical Leave Act. [H.R. 1, 103rd Congress, 2/3/93<http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll022.xml>]



TRUMP THINKS FAMILY LEAVE LAWS ARE TOO HARD ON BUSINESSES



Trump: Pregnancy Was "Certainly An Inconvenience For A Business." TRUMP: "Well, you know, pregnancy is never--it's a wonderful thing for the woman, it's a wonderful thing for the husband, it's certainly an inconvenience for a business. And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business." [Dateline, NBC News, 10/3/04]



Trump: Family Leave Laws Might Need "More Checks And Balances" To Benefit Employers. "For more than a decade, the Family and Medical Leave Act has allowed parents to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth of a child, to deal with serious illness, or to care for a relative - all while still keeping their jobs... But when employees start taking off every time they get a headache or catch a cold, then employers are faced with major productivity problems. Personally, I agree. It's great for employees to know they can take time off for a serious family crisis and still have their jobs, but I can see how this can be abused. Maybe the law needs to have more checks and balances so employers need to know their businesses won't suffer in the process." [Donald Trump, Trump University Blog, 4/22/07<https://web.archive.org/web/20071013004110/http:/www.trumpuniversity.com/blog/index.cfm?blogpost_id=991>]





REP. LIGHTFOOT VOTED AGAINST THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT



Rep. Lightfoot Voted Against The Conference Report To Pass The Americans With Disabilities Act. [S.933, 101st Congress, 7/12/90<http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1990/roll228.xml>]



TRUMP MOCKED A REPORTER WHO CRITICIZED HIS FALSE CLAIMS



Trump Denied That He Mocked The Physical Disability Of The Reporter Who Said Trump's Claims About The Article Were Untrue - Trump Told People Though They "Ought To See This Guy" And Then Jerked His Arms Around And Held One At A Right Angle. "Responding to criticism over remarks he made on Tuesday, Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate and real estate developer, denied on Thursday that he was mocking the appearance of a reporter for The New York Times with a physical disability... In South Carolina, Mr. Trump described Mr. Kovaleski as a 'nice reporter' before mocking his comments about the article in The Post. 'Now the poor guy, you ought to see this guy,' Mr. Trump said, before jerking his arms around and holding his right hand at an angle. ''Ah, I don't know what I said! I don't remember!'' Mr. Kovaleski, who covered Mr. Trump extensively while he was a reporter at The Daily News, has arthrogryposis, which limits the functioning of his joints." [New York Times, 11/26/15<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/us/politics/donald-trump-says-his-mocking-of-new-york-times-reporter-was-misread.html?_r=0>]



TRUMP HAS FACED A SERIES OF LAWSUITS FOR FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THE ADA



Trump's Properties Were Sued A Number Of Times For Violations Of The Americans With Disabilities Act. "Now, it is true that Trump has a pretty extensive track record with ADA. His properties have been sued a number of times for violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act, including one instance where a man claimed that the buses to his Atlantic City casino were virtually impossible to access in a wheelchair. James Conlon, the plaintiff in that 2003 case, alleged that he was told on two separate occasions that there were no 'buses available for use by persons who use wheelchairs who choose to leave from the Long Beach, New York departure site.' The case was later settled. In the most egregious case, the U.S. Department of Justice had to intervene because the Trump Taj Mahal was nearly inaccessible for people with disabilities. In 2011, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey conducted a compliance review of Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. They discovered an extensive list of problems." [Daily Beast, 12/2/15<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/02/donald-trump-s-war-on-people-with-disabilities.html>]



REP. LIGHTFOOT, WHO OPPOSED ABORTION IN CASES OF RAPE OR INCEST, SAID WOMEN SHOULD MAKE A CHOICE NOT TO GET PREGNANT RATHER THAN DESTROY THE "PRODUCT OF YOUR PASSION"



Rep. Lightfoot On Abortion: "I Believe In Choice, Too. You Make A Choice Not To Get Pregnant, Rather Than Go Ahead And Have Your Big Heyday And Then Take It Out By Destroying The Product Of Your Passion." "At a press conference, the activists cited comments Lightfoot made last weekend to a convention of anti-abortion activists. At that conference, Lightfoot said, 'I believe in choice, too. You make a choice not to get pregnant, rather than go ahead and have your big heyday and then take it out by destroying the product of your passion.'" [Associated Press, 9/13/96]



Rep. Lightfoot Opposed Abortion, Even In Cases Of Rape Or Incest. "But Vilsack said his position is in the political center, while Lightfoot takes the extremist view that all abortion should be illegal, even in cases of rape and incest." [Associated Press, 10/31/98]



TRUMP DEFENDED A CONVICTED RAPIST



HEADLINE: "Trump Touts Mike Tyson's Support In City Where He Committed Rape" [Indianapolis Star, 4/28/16<http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/behind-closed-doors/2016/04/28/donald-trump-mike-tyson-bob-knight-indianapolis/83644568/>]



Trump Said That He Had A "Real Problem" With The Mike Tyson Rape Case Because Tyson Spent Years In Jail While The Woman He "Perhaps" Raped Had Knocked On His Door Late At Night And Had A "Big Smile" On Her Face The Next Day. TRUMP: "I heard about a girl that late in the evening knocked on his door, was taken in, was raped perhaps, perhaps not. I don't know. Again, I think he was badly represented but I did see that Number 1, she knocks late in the night. Number 2, she's dancing in a beauty contest at 8:00AM. I saw the tapes. I see the big smile on her face. She's dancing happily at 8:00AM.Then Mike Tyson's in jail for 4, 5 or 6 years. I had a real problem with that case." [Charlie Rose, PBS, 11/6/92]



Trump Claimed "A Lot More Good Can Be Done By Having Mike Tyson Pay A Substantial Award" To The Victim And Others Who Were Abused Or Raped, Than If Tyson Went To Jail. TRUMP: "A lot more good can be done by having Mike Tyson pay a substantial award, both to the victim, subject to court approval, and creating an award for people that were abused or raped in the state of Indiana.  And we think that, hopefully, they will consider this in the state of Indiana; that they will consider this and allow Tyson to go on and, essentially, be working outside of jail." [CNN, 3/6/92]



HEADLINE: "Trump Denies Mike Tyson Is Rapist." [The Weekly Standard, 5/1/16<http://www.weeklystandard.com/trump-denies-mike-tyson-is-rapist/article/2002198?custom_click=rss?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=TWSAutoTweet>]

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><b>Trump: Family Leave Laws Might Need &#8220;More Checks And Balances&#8221; To Benefit Employers.
</b>&#8220;For more than a decade, the Family and Medical Leave Act has allowed parents to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth of a child, to deal with serious illness, or to care for a relative - all while still keeping their jobs&#8230; But when employees
 start taking off every time they get a headache or catch a cold, then employers are faced with major productivity problems. Personally, I agree. It&#8217;s great for employees to know they can take time off for a serious family crisis and still have their jobs,
 but I can see how this can be abused. Maybe the law needs to have more checks and balances so employers need to know their businesses won&#8217;t suffer in the process.&#8221; [Donald Trump, Trump University Blog,

 for violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act, including one instance where a man claimed that the buses to his Atlantic City casino were virtually impossible to access in a wheelchair. James Conlon, the plaintiff in that 2003 case, alleged that he
 was told on two separate occasions that there were no &#8216;buses available for use by persons who use wheelchairs who choose to leave from the Long Beach, New York departure site.&#8217; The case was later settled. In the most egregious case, the U.S. Department of
 Justice had to intervene because the Trump Taj Mahal was nearly inaccessible for people with disabilities. In 2011, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey conducted a compliance review of Trump&#8217;s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City.
 They discovered an extensive list of problems.&#8221; [Daily Beast, <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/02/donald-trump-s-war-on-people-with-disabilities.html">
