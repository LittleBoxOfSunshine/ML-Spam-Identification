Washington, D.C. =96 Today, voting rights activists are pursuing an appeal =
of a U.S. District Court=92s decision to uphold North Carolina=92s onerous =
election law H.B. 589, which ushered in a spate of restrictions designed to=
 make it harder to vote. The Democratic Party believes that voting is our m=
ost fundamental rights and is deeply committed to protecting the right to v=
ote.

DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement in l=
ight of the new developments in North Carolina:

=93While we are disappointed in the U.S. District Court for upholding North=
 Carolina=92s H.B. 589, the DNC is confident that the courts and the Americ=
an people will ultimately see these laws for what they are =96 a cynical po=
litical ploy to make it harder for women, people of color, students, the el=
derly and working families to cast a ballot. These groups of voters represe=
nt the Democratic core constituency =96 and also represent the majority of =
Americans.

=93North Carolina had one of the strongest rates of voter participation in =
the nation before H.B. 589 was signed into law. The law rolled back the ear=
ly voting period, eliminated same-day registration, and imposed restrictive=
 photo ID requirements.

=93Sadly, North Carolina is joined by several other states making it harder=
 to cast a vote. Make no mistake, this is part of a consistent and concerte=
d effort by Republicans to silence voters who do not agree with the Republi=
cans=92 extreme agenda.

=93As students at a Marquette University polling station faced two hour wai=
t times to vote earlier this month, a Wisconsin Congressman told reporters =
that the state=92s restrictive photo ID law would help the GOP defeat Democ=
rats in the fall. That may explain why Republican Senator Ted Cruz recently=
 filed an amicus brief supporting Texas=92 restrictive photo ID law.

=93This is nothing new from Republicans.  We all remember just four years a=
go when the Pennsylvania Republican House Leader announced that the state=
=92s restrictive photo ID law was =91gonna allow Governor Romney to win the=
 State of Pennsylvania.=92

=93There is ample evidence to suggest that these GOP-backed laws are meant =
to silence the voices of certain segments of our society that are inconveni=
ent to them on Election Day. While Democrats have gone to court in Arizona =
to reverse this culture of discrimination and disenfranchisement, Republica=
ns are going to court to defend laws designed to decrease voter turnout =96=
 because they believe that when fewer people vote, they have a better chanc=
e of winning.

=93We are fully confident that these laws, like the one passed in Pennsylva=
nia, will ultimately be declared unconstitutional.  But our work is never f=
inished. The DNC and Democrats across the nation will not waver in defendin=
g the right to vote =96 the most fundamental of all of our rights.=94
