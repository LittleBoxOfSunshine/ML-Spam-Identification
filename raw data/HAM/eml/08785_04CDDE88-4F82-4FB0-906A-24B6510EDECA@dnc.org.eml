Republican legislators in Virginia are threatening to sue Gov. Terry McAuli=
ffe to block his executive order restoring voting rights to more than 200,0=
00 residents who have completed their felony sentences. The lawmakers have =
no good legal case, and worse, such a suit would be affirming Virginia=92s =
racist history.

Virginia is one of just four states =97 along with Iowa, Florida and Kentuc=
ky =97 that continue to impose a lifetime voting ban on people convicted of=
 felonies. In recent years, both Democratic and Republican governors have w=
orked to lift this burden, either by streamlining the application process f=
or individuals or trying to restore rights to specific classes of people, l=
ike those convicted of nonviolent felonies.

Mr. McAuliffe took a bolder and more just step last month by restoring thos=
e rights to all people with felony convictions. Republican lawmakers say th=
is action =93overstepped the bounds of his authority and the constitutional=
 limits on executive powers.=94

They fail to point to any provision in the state=92s Constitution or laws t=
o support this claim, because there isn=92t one. Virginia=92s Constitution =
explicitly empowers the governor =93to remove political disabilities conseq=
uent upon conviction=94 for felonies. It places no qualifications or limita=
tions on that power.

The executive power of clemency is generally very broad, so state constitut=
ions are clear when they intend to restrict it =97 say, by requiring an ind=
ependent board to sign off on a governor=92s decision. Virginia=92s Constit=
ution places some limits on the exercise of other forms of clemency, such a=
s granting pardons or canceling fines, but none on restoring the right to v=
ote.

Mr. McAuliffe=92s order is also an important moral step, too long delayed. =
Virginia=92s voting ban, like most of the others that collectively disenfra=
nchise about six million Americans, is a 19th-century relic rooted in racis=
m =97 a direct reaction to the passage of the 15th Amendment, which guarant=
eed African-Americans the right to vote.

Politicians in Virginia were blunt about their motivation. In 1902, when Vi=
rginia=92s voting ban was expanded at the state=92s constitutional conventi=
on, Carter Glass, a state senator, said its purpose was to =93eliminate the=
 darkey as a political factor in this state in less than five years, so tha=
t in no single county of the Commonwealth will there be the least concern f=
elt for the complete supremacy of the white race in the affairs of governme=
nt.=94

Before Mr. McAuliffe=92s order, one in five black Virginians was permanentl=
y barred from voting because of a past felony conviction. Aside from its pr=
ofound racial disparity, the lifetime voting ban has served to marginalizep=
eople who have already paid their debt to society.

Virginia=92s ban is an embarrassment to the state and to the country. Rathe=
r than fighting to preserve it or grumbling about Mr. McAuliffe=92s alleged=
 political motivations, Republican lawmakers should be working to win the v=
otes of the hundreds of thousands of Virginians who have been unfairly barr=
ed from exercising democracy=92s most fundamental right.
