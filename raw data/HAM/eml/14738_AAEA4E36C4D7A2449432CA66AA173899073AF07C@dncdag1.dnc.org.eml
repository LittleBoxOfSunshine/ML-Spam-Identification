FACT CHECK: Jeb Bush's Florida Record Put Himself First and the Middle Clas=
s On The Back-Burner

In a new ad today released by Jeb Bush's Super PAC, viewers are presented w=
ith distorted facts from Bush's Florida record: one that was plagued by tax=
 cuts for the wealthy and corporations and cuts to programs that helped the=
 middle class, all in an effort to put those like Jeb Bush over everyday Fl=
oridians.

"Jeb Bush's economic policies are, and have always been, geared towards hel=
ping those at the very top. As governor of Florida, Jeb Bush slashed taxes =
by billions, largely benefitting the wealthy and corporations, and vetoed p=
rograms that would have helped the middle class get ahead. We know what to =
expect from a failed Bush administration - not only because we have seen it=
 twice already in the White House, but because we have experienced it in Ta=
llahassee as well." - DNC spokeswoman Christina Freundlich

 its language is so broad it likely means two larger voucher programs used =
by some 27,000 students -- McKay scholarships for disabled children and cor=
porate tax-credit vouchers -- also must be dismantled. We hope that's the c=
ase, as it's long been our view the voucher programs pushed by Gov. Jeb Bus=
h are both illegal and a wasteful experiment lacking in oversight or accoun=
tability." [Editorial, Florida Today, 1/7/06]

2006: Florida Legislative Auditors Reported That Two-Thirds Of School Distr=
ict Charter Contracts "Lacked Essential Information" To Hold Them Accountab=
le For Student Performance, With Over A Dozen Failing To Specify Any Academ=
ic Goals. "Carlo Rodriguez, head of Florida's school-choice program, said l=
ocal school districts -- which monitor goals that charters set as part of t=
heir agreements to operate -- are supposed to make sure the ungraded charte=
rs perform. 'The school grade does not define the school as a whole,' Rodri=
guez said. 'Parents are in that school because they actively want to be the=
re.' But auditors for the Legislature reported last year that two-thirds of=
 charter contracts with districts 'lacked essential information' needed to =
hold them accountable for student performance. More than a dozen charters f=
ailed to specify any academic goals for children, auditors noted." [Orlando=
 Sentinel, 3/25/07<http://www.orlandosentinel.com/orl-chday1main07mar25-sto=

*         2006: 43 Percent Of All Charter Schools Received No A-F Grades, C=
ompared To 20 Percent Of Conventional Public Schools. "But like the world o=
f conventional schools, the charter realm has its subculture of failure -- =
a small group of schools with low performance that persists year to year. N=
ine percent of charters received D's or F's last year, compared with 5 perc=
ent of regular public schools...But 43 percent of all charters received non=
e last year, making it harder for parents to make informed decisions about =
a school. Only 20 percent of conventional schools were not graded. Ungraded=
 charters generally trailed ungraded regular schools in both reading and ma=
th scores." [Orlando Sentinel, 3/25/07<http://www.orlandosentinel.com/orl-c=

 &#8220;In a major reversal of one of former Gov. Jeb Bush's most controver=
sial education policies, Florida legislative leaders agreed Wednesday to ch=
ange the way teachers are awarded bonuses. Under the new plan, which legisl=
ators say they hope to have to Gov. Charlie
 Crist for signing by next week, student scores on the Florida Comprehensiv=
e Test would no longer be the only factor determining whether teachers get =
a share of around $150 million a year in special bonuses. Recommendations f=
rom principals will count for 40
 percent, while FCAT results will carry 60 percent of the weight in decidin=
g one-time raises.&nbsp; Even more significantly, the new plan would allow =
all teachers to be eligible for the bonuses, not just those whose classes s=
core in the top 25 percent on the FCAT.&#8221;

children at failing Florida public schools to attend private schools with s=
