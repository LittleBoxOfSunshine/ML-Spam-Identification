Donald Trump says the American public doesn't have a right to see his tax r=

ything about Trump or how much he claims to be worth. His refusal to releas=

But it=92s not only that Donald Trump doesn=92t want to prove to us his wea=
lth or his tax rate; his PFDs yesterday show that Trump has been involved i=
n 100 lawsuits and he is profiting off of Chinese and Mexican companies =96=
 which begs the question, what else does Donald Trump have to hide?

The American people ought to know whether Trump has been paying his fair sh=

has nothing to hide, and if he claims to be as rich as he is, he will relea=

Details on Donald Trump=92s Finances Are Released, but Net Worth Is Unclear=
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/us/politics/donald-trump-money.html>
NEW YORK TIMES // STEVE EDER AND KITTY BENNETT
=85
The document offered new details on the enterprises and the financial pictu=
re of Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. The limitations of the=
 form, however, made it impossible to calculate his specific net worth or t=
o verify his claim that he is worth more than $10 billion.
=85

By contrast, Mr. Trump has been unwilling to publicize his recent tax retur=
ns, a traditional disclosure by major party candidates that is not required=
 by law. His tax returns could provide a more precise figure than the finan=
cial disclosures of how much he actually earns each year, as well as how mu=
ch he pays in taxes. Mr. Trump has cited Internal Revenue Service audits as=
 a reason for not releasing his returns, and has pointed to his personal fi=
nancial disclosures =97 which provide dollar figure ranges, but not actual =
amounts =97 as giving an alternate view of his wealth and income.

Donald Trump releases financial info, but still no tax returns<http://www.m=
snbc.com/msnbc/donald-trump-releases-financial-info-still-no-tax-returns>
MSNBC // BENJY SARLIN
Donald Trump released new information about his finances this week =97 but =
not the information his critics on the right and left are demanding.
=85
What the disclosure doesn=92t do, though, is shine the kind of light on his=
 finances that Trump=92s tax returns would provide. Trump has refused to re=
lease his most recent returns =97 which every major party nominee since 197=
6 has made public =97 citing an ongoing audit by the IRS. The IRS, for thei=
r part, confirmed months ago that there is nothing legally preventing Trump=
 from making them public in the interim.
=85
=93It has less to do with showing us the exact dollar amounts of your incom=
es and assets and a lot more with showing when you have different kind of p=
ublic policy decisions, how personally invested you are in the outcomes of =
those decisions,=94 Joseph Birkenstock, an attorney who specializes in camp=
aign finance law, told MSNBC.
=85
This question of Trump=92s income and taxes are also loaded politically, be=
cause Trump is running on an estimated $9.5 trillion tax cut that would dra=
matically reduce rates for ultra-wealthy filers. If he released his taxes, =
voters would not only know his tax rate =97 and how it compares to that of =
average Americans =97 but how much he would save under his proposed changes=
.
=85
But tax returns are another story. The motive is to show that one=92s incom=
e is as small as possible in order to pay the least amount to the governmen=
t. The more successful Trump is at arranging his finances to this effect =
=97 and he said he tries to =93fight like hell to pay as little as possible=
=94 =97 the less impressive his business prowess will look.


Trump's tax trouble: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes, tied to companies<ht=
tp://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/05/19/trumps-tax-troubles/84543538/>
USA TODAY // NICK PENZENSTADLER AND DAVID MCKAY WILSON
While Donald J. Trump refuses to release his federal tax returns, saying hi=
s tax rate is =93none of your business,=94 a USA TODAY analysis found Trump=
=92s businesses have been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and other dispu=
tes related to unpaid taxes or how much tax his businesses owe.
=85
As recently as last week, Trump said he was =93willing to pay more=94 taxes=
 personally and that =93taxes for the rich will go up somewhat=94 if he bec=
omes president. But the lawsuits and other tax-related disputes show a diff=
erent reality for his businesses. They illustrate a pattern of systematical=
ly disputing tax bills, arguing for lower property assessments, and in some=
 cases not paying taxes until the government takes additional action. At le=
ast three dozen times, Trump companies=92 unpaid tax bills have forced the =
New York State Department of Taxation and Finance to go to local courts to =
get liens against his properties to try to collect overdue bills. New Jerse=
y also had to go to court for a lien to collect a Trump company=92s unpaid =
tax bill. Eventually, those disputes were resolved, and his companies paid =
some amount of taxes.
=85
Trump has acknowledged that he tries to pay as little taxes as possible, an=
d the public records across the country shed light on how he does it. In do=
cuments rarely seen by the public, Trump's businesses regularly minimize th=
e value of his properties for tax purposes. Publicly, including in his pres=
idential financial disclosure report, Trump=92s team declares many of those=
 same properties are worth tens of millions of dollars more.

Trump=92s new line: Tax returns from thee, not from me<http://www.msnbc.com=
/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-new-line-tax-returns-thee-not-me>
MSNBC // STEVE BENEN
=85
When NBC=92s Katy Tur asked a Trump campaign source about the apparent hypo=
crisy, the source responded, =93Trump=92s not running for vice president.=
=94

That=92s cute, I suppose, but it only reinforces the absurdity of the candi=
date=92s posture. The idea that disclosure and transparency requirements sh=
ould be tougher for a vice presidential candidate than a presidential candi=
date is tough to defend.

Making matters worse, with each passing day, new questions arise about Trum=
p=92s finances. USA Today reported this morning that a fresh analysis found=
 Trump=92s businesses =93have been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and ot=
her disputes related to unpaid taxes or how much tax his businesses owe.=94

It makes it that much more difficult for the candidate and his team to sugg=
est his tax documents are a meaningless distraction.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN">While Donald J. Trump refuses to r=
elease his federal tax returns, saying his tax rate is =93none of your busi=
ness,=94 a USA TODAY analysis found Trump=92s businesses have been involved=
 in at least 100 lawsuits and other disputes

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">As recently as last week, Trump said he was =93willi=
ng to pay more=94 taxes personally and that =93taxes for the rich will go u=
p somewhat=94 if he becomes president. But the lawsuits and other tax-relat=
ed disputes show a different reality for his
 businesses. They illustrate a pattern of systematically disputing tax bill=
s, arguing for lower property assessments, and in some cases not paying tax=
es until the government takes additional action. At least three dozen times=
, Trump companies=92 unpaid tax bills
 have forced the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance to go to=
 local courts to get liens against his properties to try to collect overdue=
 bills. New Jersey also had to go to court for a lien to collect a Trump co=
mpany=92s unpaid tax bill. Eventually,
 those disputes were resolved, and his companies paid some amount of taxes.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=85<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Trump has acknowledged that he tries to pay as littl=
e taxes as possible, and the public records across the country shed light o=
n how he does it. In documents rarely seen by the public, Trump's businesse=
s regularly minimize the value of
 his properties for tax purposes. Publicly, including in his presidential f=
inancial disclosure report, Trump=92s team declares many of those same prop=
erties are worth tens of millions of dollars more.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">When NBC=92s Katy Tur asked a Trump campaign source =
about the apparent hypocrisy, the source responded, =93Trump=92s not runnin=
g for vice president.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">That=92s cute, I suppose, but it only reinforces the=
 absurdity of the candidate=92s posture. The idea that disclosure and trans=
parency requirements should be tougher for a vice presidential candidate th=
an a presidential candidate is tough to
 defend.<br>
<br>
Making matters worse, with each passing day, new questions arise about Trum=
p=92s finances. USA Today reported this morning that a fresh analysis found=
 Trump=92s businesses =93have been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and ot=
