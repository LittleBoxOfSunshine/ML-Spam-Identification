Today in the call for a full and functioning Supreme Court: A new CNN/ORC p=
oll finds that a majority of Americans want the Senate to hold a hearing an=
d confirm Chief Judge Merrick Garland, Republican and Democratic U.S. solic=
itors general find consensus that Chief Judge Garland is "superbly qualifie=
d" for the Supreme Court, Retired Justice John Paul Stevens publically stat=
es importance of a full, nine bench Supreme Court, and Sen. Grassley tries =
to defend his "made-up" 'Biden Rule' at an Iowa town hall.

A majority of Americans are united in wanting Senate Republicans to do thei=
r jobs.
According to a CNN/ORC<http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/05/06/rel6d=
.-.obama,.economy,.garland.pdf> poll:

*         67% of Americans think the Republican leadership in the Senate sh=
ould hold confirmation hearings, including 59% of Republicans and 68% of In=
dependents

*         52% of Americans would like to see the Senate vote in favor of Me=
rrick Garland, including 50% of Independents

Former Government Lawyers on Supreme Court Nominee Garland: 'Superbly Quali=
fied'
The Wall Street Journal<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/05/05/former-gov=
ernment-lawyers-on-supreme-court-nominee-garland-supremely-qualified/> repo=
rts:

"U.S. solicitors general who served under every president from George H.W. =
Bush to Barack Obama gave Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a bipartisa=
n boost this week in a letter to Senate leaders saying he is "superbly qual=
ified" to be a justice. "While we have served in different administrations,=
 we are unified in our belief that Judge Garland is superbly qualified to s=
erve on the Supreme Court if he were confirmed," the letter to Senate leade=
rs said. The U.S. solicitor general represents the federal government befor=
e the Supreme Court, and the former officials signing the letter have argue=
d hundreds of cases there."

Grassley Pressed On Made-Up 'Biden Rule': 'We Don't Have A Written Rule'
When asked when a president can no longer nominate a Supreme Court justice,=
 Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), admitted that the so-called 'Biden Rule' is le=
ss of a rule and more of an excuse.

Sen. Grassley: "I don't think that finite approach can be answered unless y=
ou actually want to write a rule or law that says that... I use the term Bi=
den rule, and people think we've got a written rule, we don't have a writte=
n rule, and maybe you can think of a better word than understanding. I thin=
k that if you are going to get that precise, it ought be something that's o=
n paper." [Talking Points Memo, 5/06/16<http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewi=
re/grassley-biden-rule>]

Retired Justice John Paul Stevens Tells Senate To Get Moving On That Suprem=
e Court Nominee
As reported in the Huffington Post<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john=
-paul-stevens-supreme-court-nominee_us_572b8118e4b0bc9cb045f4f3>:

Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens: "Go ahead and hold a heari=
ng" on Judge Merrick Garland, Stevens said Thursday... "I'm not aware of an=
y confirmation process that's been delayed to the extent that this one is,"=
 Stevens said. He added that it's "really unfortunate" that the court will =
likely be down one justice months into its next term, which begins in Octob=
er. Stevens said "there are certain cases you just can't decide" with eight=
 justices, since there is a "distinct possibility" that the court will dead=
lock 4-4 on the really difficult issues."

Which nominee would you support?
Today, Americans United for Change released a video comparing two very diff=
erent nominees-Supreme Court nominee Chief Judge Merrick Garland and presum=
ptive Republican nominee for president Donald Trump. You can watch the vide=
o HERE<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DH8IbQu_Co_Q&feature=3Dyoutu.be>.

Seth Waxman, former Solicitor General of the United States on Chief Judge G=
arland: "...exceptionally modest and careful in everything he does..."

Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-SC) on Donald Trump: "...a race-baiting, xenophobic,=
 religious bigot..."

Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law Releases New Report on Garlan=
d's Civil Rights Record & Statement in Support of Nomination
Yesterday, the Lawyers' Committee released a report<https://lawyerscommitte=
e.org/publication/report-nomination-judge-merrick-b-garland/> evaluating th=
e full civil rights record of Supreme Court nominee Chief Judge Merrick Gar=
land. The report provides an examination of his record on cases concerning =
voting rights, employment, housing, criminal justice, education and access =
to justice issues. The Lawyers' Committee also released a statement<https:/=
/lawyerscommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lawyers-Committee-Statemen=
t-re-Garland-Nomination-2.pdf> from more than 150 attorneys, urging the Sen=
ate to take action and allow for a fair hearing on Chief Judge Garland's no=
mination.

Kristen Clarke, Lawyers' Committee President and Executive Director: "The a=
bility of the Court to effectively resolve the complex cases that come befo=
re it is undermined when elected officials use politics as a reason to prol=
ong the vacancy created in the wake of Justice Scalia's death.  We believe =
that Judge Garland possesses the exceptional competence necessary to serve =
on the Court and urge the Senate to move forward with hearings to give the =
public an opportunity to learn more about his commitment to fair interpreta=
tion of civil rights laws."

Hispanic National Bar Association endorses Chief Judge Merrick Garland for =
Supreme Court.
The Latin Post<http://www.latinpost.com/articles/120196/20160505/supreme-co=
urt-nominee-merrick-garland-scores-hispanic-national-bar-association-endors=
ement.htm> reports:

Robert Maldonado, HNBA National President: "Based on our review, it is clea=
r that Chief Judge Garland is well qualified to serve on the United States =
Supreme Court. He possesses the experience, temperament, and high degree of=
 professionalism required to distinguish himself as a Justice on the Court.=
 His strong record as a prosecutor, judge and private sector lawyer demonst=
rates a high level of judgment, intellect and integrity."
