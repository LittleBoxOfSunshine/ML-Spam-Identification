SOA Watch Activists Sue Obama Administration Over Pentagon Secrecy=20
FOIA Denial About Graduates of U.S. Military Training School Challenged in =
Federal Court

San Francisco - On May 13, 2016, three judges of the 9th Circuit Court of A=
ppeals heard oral arguments in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsui=
t brought by School of the Americas Watch members, Theresa Cameranesi and J=
udith Liteky. As plaintiffs, they seek to compel the U.S. Department of Def=
ense to disclose the names and military units of foreign students and instr=
uctors attending the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation =
(WHINSEC), a U.S. military training school located at Fort Benning, Georgia=
 and funded by U.S. taxpayers.

"The case is important for SOA Watch because our roots are the matching of =
the names of the perpetrators of the UCA massacre of 16-year old Celina Ram=
os, her mother Elba Ramos and six Jesuit priests in El Salvador in 1989, wi=
th the names of SOA graduates." said SOA Watch activist and plaintiff Judy =
Liteky after the hearing. "Today's case is also important as a means of def=
ending citizen oversight of US government policy and action. A judgement fo=
r releasing the names of WHINSEC students will demonstrate that the Freedom=
 of Information Act is a tool to use in the struggle for government transpa=
rency."

In 2014, Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton, of the United States Northern District =
Court of California, ordered the Department of Defense to release the names=
 of the students and instructors at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Se=
curity Cooperation (formerly known as the School of the Americas, or SOA), =
a U.S. military training school for Latin American soldiers that for decade=
s has been connected to torturers, death squads and military dictators thro=
ughout the Americas. SOA Watch activists had taken the U.S. government to c=
ourt over its refusal to release the information, and won. *Read the court =
ruling here: http://SOAW.org/judgment*

The U.S. Department of Defense subsequently filed a notice to appeal the co=
urt ruling.=20

SOA Watch is an independent, grassroots movement that provides citizen over=
sight of U.S. military training given to Latin American military and police=
 personnel at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, fo=
rmerly known as the School of Americas. Through vigils and fasts, demonstra=
tions and nonviolent protest, as well as media, legal and legislative work,=
 the movement works in solidarity with the people of Latin America and the =
Caribbean for human rights, economic justice, and democracy.

The U.S. Department of Defense has denied Freedom of Information (FOIA) req=
uests by School of the Americas Watch for the names of WHINSEC students and=
 instructors for the years 2004-2010. For the years 1946-2003 the names had=
 always been released when requested. The names are the basis of the SOA Wa=
tch database and the means of citizen oversight of the record of SOA/WHINSE=
C graduates.

Plaintiff Theresa Cameranesi is a member of the School of the Americas Watc=
h Council. She is also a member of the SOA Watch Legislative Working Group =
and is active in advocating for Congressional investigation of the human ri=
ghts records of graduates of SOA and WHINSEC. As part of the SOA Watch San =
Francisco Research Group, she and plaintiff Judith Liteky identified studen=
ts and instructors at WHINSEC who were admitted for training even though th=
ey had been charged with human rights violations.

Plaintiff Judith Liteky has been active with School of the Americas Watch s=
ince its founding in 1990 in response to the massacre in San Salvador at th=
e University of Central America. On the night of November 16, 1989, a Salva=
doran Army patrol entered the University campus and massacred six Jesuit pr=
iests, their housekeeper and her daughter. Nineteen of the military officer=
s cited for this atrocity had received training at the US Army School of th=
e Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia. Judith was a co-founder of School of t=
he Americas Watch San Francisco.

Plaintiff's Cameranesi and Liteky received the 2014 James Madison Freedom o=
f Information Citizen Award for pressing a Freedom of Information Act lawsu=
it against the Department of Defense to win a precedent-setting ruling that=
 the government may not withhold on national security grounds the names and=
 military unit information of graduates and instructors at the former Schoo=
l of the Americas, now known as the Western Hemisphere Institute for Securi=
ty Cooperation.=20

The SOA Watch plaintiffs are being represented by attorneys Duffy Carolan a=
nd Kent Spriggs.

Duffy Carolan is a partner with the San Francisco firm Jassy Vick Carolan. =
Attorney Carolan has been honored by her peers as San Francisco's Lawyer of=
 the Year in Litigation - First Amendment cases. She has also received the =
James Madison Freedom of Information Award, a Bay Area honor given to indiv=
iduals and organizations who have made significant contributions to the adv=
ancement of freedom of expression, particularly freedom of information and =
open government.

Kent Spriggs is the principal in Spriggs Law Firm, Tallahassee, Florida. At=
torney Spriggs has represented individuals in civil rights actions, the maj=
ority in class actions. He also works in the field of international human r=
ights, including representing those illegally detained at Guant=C3=A1namo B=
ay, and assisted in the analysis of U.S. money used to destabilize sovereig=
n Latin American democracies. He has been a human rights observer in El Sal=
vador, Honduras, Colombia, and Chile as well as Palestine and Afghanistan.
