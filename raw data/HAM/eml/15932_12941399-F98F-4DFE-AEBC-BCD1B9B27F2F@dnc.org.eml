Dear Ambassador,

It was a pleasure speaking with you today.   Thanks very much for your commitment and for joining the event this Wednesday, May 18!

Once again, the event will be at the Jefferson Hotel on 16th St NW. The guest call time is 2:30 pm. We expect to wrap up shortly after 4:30 pm.

I can take by phone as well if that is easier.

 And if Donna would like to join as well, we just need her vitals by close of business today, which includes full name including middle name, social security #, date of birth and also occupation/employer.

Thank you again!
