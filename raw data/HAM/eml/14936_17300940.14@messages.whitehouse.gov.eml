Subject: In town pool report #2

Pool has gathered in the East Room, with a ceremony to come at 4:30pm in =
which POTUS (along with Secretary of Education John King) will honor the =
2016 National Teacher of the Year.

It's open press, and there's a strong contingent of cameras ready to cove=
r it.

A bar toward the back is serving wine and beer, water and soft drinks. Fo=
ur small tables, with six chairs at each, are set up but most people are =
standing as singer-songwriter Nate Ruess -- joined by band mates playing =
an acoustic guitar, and electric guitar, and a keyboard -- performs from =
the stage.

He just sang "We Are Young," which he said he played at the inauguration,=
 and now in the East Room -- and jokes that next up is the Oval Office

Background From the White House:

Today in the East Room, President Obama will honor the 2016 National Teac=
her of the Year, Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, and State Teachers of the Y=
ear, alongside hundreds of great educators from across the country -- fro=
m Head Start teachers to superintendents to college counselors. The Presi=
dent will lift up the role that these educators have played in improving =
our education system over the past seven years, and highlight the progres=
s we have made since he took office. As part of the celebration of teache=
rs, there will be a welcome by Christopher Steinhauser, superintendent of=
 the award-winning Long Beach Unified School District, and attendees will=
 enjoy a performance by musician Nate Ruess, who will honor the impact th=
at excellent educators have had on his life.
