From USA Today's Alan Gomez<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/=
05/06/voices-gomez-clinton-republicans-immigration/26641519/>:

Yet week by week, the GOP is straying further from a message that would act=
ually lure Hispanics.
During a speech last month before the National Hispanic Christian Leadershi=
p Conference, Bush boasted about his "bicultural and bilingual" children. B=
ut he stopped short of advocating a full pathway to citizenship. Instead, h=
e said undocumented immigrants should be able to receive an "earned legal s=
tatus," which Hispanics view as little more than second-class citizenship.
Rubio was briefly a champion of the Hispanic community when he co-sponsored=
 a Senate bill in 2013 that granted a pathway to citizenship. But faced wit=
h criticism from the more conservative GOP corners, Rubio ran from the bill=
 so quickly he skipped the celebratory press conference after the Senate pa=
ssed the measure.
Cruz has long been criticized by Hispanics for his harsh immigration polici=
es. He proposes tripling the Border Patrol, only wants to admit immigrants =
with specialized skills and decries "amnesty" for the nation's 11 million u=
ndocumented immigrants.
Then there's Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. During interviews on conservative=
 outlets last month, Walker said he wants to reduce the number of legal imm=
igrants who enter the country each year because they take jobs away from Am=
erican workers and depress their wages.
That claim is in dispute. Conservatives cite research defending the positio=
n, while immigration advocates point to other studies that show wages incre=
ase when entrepreneurial immigrants enter the country and create jobs.
What's more important is the political fallout of Republicans moving in thi=
s direction. The Hispanic electorate has as much varied opinion as any othe=
r voting bloc, but I can't picture too many of them embracing this idea.
Why would they? Walker is basically telling immigrants that fewer of their =
friends and colleagues back home should be able to enter the U.S. on a work=
 visa, and that fewer of their relatives should be able to enter on a famil=
y visa.
That strategy plays well when you're a Republican running for office in a c=
onservative state or congressional district, or trying to win the GOP presi=
dential nomination. And it will definitely please Americans who feel they c=
an't find a job or have been forced out of one by lower-paid immigrants.
But for a party that acknowledges it needs to improve on the 27% of the His=
panic vote Mitt Romney garnered in 2012 - and now faces Clinton's immigrant=
-friendly stance - I don't see how that strategy works in a general electio=
n
