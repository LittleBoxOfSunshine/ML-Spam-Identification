Sanders Statement on Nevada


May 17, 2016
Contact: Michael Briggs (802) 233-8653

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. =96 U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday issued the fo=
llowing statement:

=93It is imperative that the Democratic leadership, both nationally and in =
the states, understand that the political world is changing and that millio=
ns of Americans are outraged at establishment politics and establishment ec=
onomics. The people of this country want a government which represents all =
of us, not just the 1 percent, super PACs and wealthy campaign contributors=
.

=93The Democratic Party has a choice. It can open its doors and welcome int=
o the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social c=
hange =96 people who are willing to take on Wall Street, corporate greed an=
d a fossil fuel industry which is destroying this planet. Or the party can =
choose to maintain its status quo structure, remain dependent on big-money =
campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limite=
d energy.

=93Within the last few days there have been a number of criticisms made aga=
inst my campaign organization. Party leaders in Nevada, for example, claim =
that the Sanders campaign has a =91penchant for violence.=92 That is nonsen=
se. Our campaign has held giant rallies all across this country, including =
in high-crime areas, and there have been zero reports of violence. Our camp=
aign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying th=
at I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassme=
nt of individuals. But, when we speak of violence, I should add here that m=
onths ago, during the Nevada campaign, shots were fired into my campaign of=
fice in Nevada and apartment housing complex my campaign staff lived in was=
 broken into and ransacked.

=93If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperativ=
e that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and th=
e respect that they have earned. I am happy to say that has been the case a=
t state conventions in Maine, Alaska, Colorado and Hawaii where good discus=
sions were held and democratic decisions were reached. Unfortunately, that =
was not the case at the Nevada convention. At that convention the Democrati=
c leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from =
taking place. Among other things:

  *   The chair of the convention announced that the convention rules passe=
d on voice vote, when the vote was a clear no-vote. At the very least, the =
Chair should have allowed for a headcount.
  *   The chair allowed its Credentials Committee to en mass rule that 64 d=
elegates were ineligible without offering an opportunity for 58 of them to =
be heard. That decision enabled the Clinton campaign to end up with a 30-vo=
te majority.
  *   The chair refused to acknowledge any motions made from the floor or a=
llow votes on them.
  *   The chair refused to accept any petitions for amendments to the rules=
 that were properly submitted.

"These are on top of failures at the precinct and county conventions includ=
ing trying to depose and then threaten with arrest the Clark County convent=
ion credentials chair because she was operating too fairly."
