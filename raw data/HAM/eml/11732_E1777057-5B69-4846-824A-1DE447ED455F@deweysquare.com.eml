By Kenneth P. Vogel and Isaac Arnsdorf
05/02/16

In the days before Hillary Clinton launched an unprecedented big-money fund=
raising vehicle with state parties last summer, she vowed =93to rebuild our=
 party from the ground up,=94 proclaiming =93when our state parties are str=
ong, we win. That=92s what will happen."

But less than 1 percent of the $61 million raised by that effort has stayed=
 in the state parties=92 coffers, according to a POLITICO analysis of the l=
atest Federal Election Commission filings.

The venture, the Hillary Victory Fund, is a so-called joint fundraising com=
mittee comprised of Clinton=92s presidential campaign, the Democratic Natio=
nal Committee and 32 state party committees. The set-up allows Clinton to s=
olicit checks of $350,000 or more from her super-rich supporters at extrava=
gant fundraisers including a dinner at George Clooney=92s house and at a co=
ncert at Radio City Music Hall featuring Katy Perry and Elton John.

The victory fund has transferred $3.8 million to the state parties, but alm=
ost all of that cash ($3.3 million, or 88 percent) was quickly transferred =
to the DNC, usually within a day or two, by the Clinton staffer who control=
s the committee, POLITICO=92s analysis of the FEC records found.

By contrast, the victory fund has transferred $15.4 million to Clinton=92s =
campaign and $5.7 million to the DNC, which will work closely with Clinton=
=92s campaign if and when she becomes the party=92s nominee. And most of th=
e $23.3 million spent directly by the victory fund has gone towards expense=
s that appear to have directly benefited Clinton=92s campaign, including $2=
.8 million for =93salary and overhead=94 and $8.6 million for web advertisi=
ng that mostly looks indistinguishable from Clinton campaign ads and that h=
as helped Clinton build a network of small donors who will be critical in a=
 general election expected to cost each side well in excess of $1 billion.

The arrangement has sparked concerns among campaign finance watchdogs and a=
llies of Clinton=92s Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. They see it as a circ=
umvention of campaign contribution limits by a national party apparatus int=
ent on doing whatever it takes to help Clinton defeat Sanders during the pa=
rty=92s primary, and then win the White House.

But it is perhaps more notable that the arrangement has prompted concerns a=
mong some participating state party officials and their allies. They grumbl=
e privately that Clinton is merely using them to subsidize her own operatio=
n, while her allies overstate her support for their parties and knock Sande=
rs for not doing enough to help the party. =93It=92s a one-sided benefit,=
=94 said an official with one participating state party. The official, like=
 those with several other state parties, declined to talk about the arrange=
ment on the record for fear of drawing the ire of the DNC and the Clinton c=
ampaign.

In fact, the DNC, which has pushed back aggressively on charges that it is =
boosting Clinton at the expense of other Democrats, has advised state party=
 officials on how to answer media inquiries about the arrangement, multiple=
 sources familiar with the interactions told POLITICO.

=93The DNC has given us some guidance on what they=92re saying, but it=92s =
not clear what we should be saying,=94 said the official. =93I don=92t thin=
k anyone wants to get crosswise with the national party because we do need =
their resources. But everyone who entered into these agreements was doing i=
t because they were asked to, not because there are immediately clear benef=
its.=94

Some fundraisers who work for state parties predict that the arrangement co=
uld actually hurt participating state parties. They worry that participatin=
g states that aren=92t presidential battlegrounds and lack competitive Sena=
te races could see very little return investment from the DNC or Clinton=92=
s campaign, and are essentially acting as money laundering conduits for the=
m. And for party committees in contested states, there=92s another risk: th=
ey might find themselves unable to accept cash from rich donors whose check=
s to the victory fund counted towards their $10,000 donation limit to the s=
tate party in question =97 even if that party never got to spend the cash b=
ecause it was transferred to the DNC.

Sources working with the Hillary Victory Fund said the committee is sensiti=
ve to these concerns, and that state parties were asked to submit names of =
donors they wanted to save for themselves.

Clinton=92s campaign and the DNC argue that all Democratic politicians and =
state parties =97 even those that aren=92t enrolled in the victory fund =97=
 will benefit from its fundraising. That=92s because the cash will go towar=
ds enhancing national voter data, and research and communications efforts t=
hat all state parties are entitled to.

And Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Clinton=92s campaign, suggested that a h=
andful of key state parties last month received another $700,000 in transfe=
rs from the victory fund, and enjoyed other benefits from it that will be d=
etailed in subsequent FEC reports. (The latest reports only cover through t=
he end of March.)

=93About $4.5 million has already been transferred to state parties and the=
re is an additional $9 million on hand that will be distributed over the co=
ming months as state parties ramp up for the general election,=94 he said i=
n an email. He added that in April =93money raised through the HVF has star=
ted to be used to fund Democratic coordinated campaigns across the country,=
 which will help strengthen the party and elect Democrats up and down the b=
allot.=94

But Schwerin did not respond to follow-up questions about how much of the $=
700,000 in victory fund transfers to the state parties was subsequently tra=
nsferred to the DNC. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach pointed out that the na=
tional party committee =93offered to engage in the same joint fundraising e=
fforts with all the major presidential candidates early in the cycle and we=
 welcome the efforts of the candidates to help raise money for the DNC and =
state parties now to ensure we can build out the infrastructure to win in N=
ovember.=94

Sanders' campaign late last year signed a joint fundraising agreement with =
the DNC, but the committee has been largely inactive. Instead, after Sander=
s was chided by Clinton allies for not helping down-ballot Democrats, he se=
nt out appeals to his vaunted email list that helped raise hundreds of thou=
sands of dollars for a trio of progressive House candidates, who got to kee=
p all the cash.

The Hillary Victory Fund, by contrast, allows the Clinton campaign to maint=
ain tight control over the cash it raises and spends. The fund represents b=
y far the most ambitious use to date of a joint fundraising committee =97 a=
nd arguably one the most ambitious hard-dollar fundraising efforts in moder=
n presidential politics. Until 2014, the most an individual could have give=
n to such a committee was $123,200. But in April of that year, the Supreme =
Court, in a case called McCutcheon vs. FEC, struck down aggregate limits on=
 total giving to federal campaigns, allowing maximum donations to as many d=
ifferent committees as a donor wanted.

That paved the way for massive joint fundraising committees which could acc=
ept ever-larger checks based on how the number and type of committees that =
agreed to participate. In the case of the Hillary Victory Fund, the maximum=
 donation in 2016 is $356,100, based on maximum donations of $2,700 to Hill=
ary for America for the primary election, $33,400 to the DNC and $10,000 to=
 the federal accounts of each of the 32 state parties.

After POLITICO revealed that the victory fund was asking for couples to don=
ate or raise a whopping $353,400 in order to sit at a table with Clinton, G=
eorge Clooney and his wife, attorney Amal Clooney, at a fundraiser last mon=
th in San Francisco, Clooney admitted that was "an obscene amount of money.=
" But he justified it by saying "the overwhelming amount of the money that =
we're raising, is not going to Hillary to run for president, it's going to =
the down-ticket."

According to the agreements signed by the participating committees, which w=
ere obtained by POLITICO, the money is required to be distributed, at least=
 initially, based on a formula set forth in joint fundraising agreements si=
gned by the participants. The first $2,700 goes to Clinton campaign, the ne=
xt $33,400 goes to the DNC, and any remaining funds are to be distributed a=
mong the state parties.

But what happens to the cash after that initial distribution is left almost=
 entirely to the discretion of the Clinton campaign. Its chief operating of=
ficer Beth Jones is the treasurer of the victory fund. And FEC filings show=
 that within a day of most transfers from the victory fund to the state par=
ties, identical sums were transferred from the state party accounts to the =
DNC, which Sanders=92 supporters have accused of functioning as an adjunct =
of the Clinton campaign.

For example, the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party received $43,500 f=
rom the victory fund on Nov. 2, only to transfer the same amount to the DNC=
 that same day. The pattern repeated itself after the Minnesota party recei=
ved transfers from the victory fund of $20,600 on Dec. 1 (the party sent th=
e same amount to the DNC the next day) and $150,000 on Jan. 4 (it transferr=
ed the same amount to the DNC that day).

That means that Minnesota=92s net gain from its participation in the victor=
y fund was precisely $0 through the end of March. Meanwhile, the DNC pocket=
ed an extra $214,100 in cash routed through Minnesota =97 much of which the=
 DNC wouldn=92t have been able to accept directly, since it came from donor=
s who had mostly had already maxed out to the national party committee.

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton delivers the keynote to t=
he Eagle Academy Foundation annual fundraising breakfast in Gotham Hall on =
April 29.

A similar pattern transpired with most of the participating state parties. =
As of March 31, only eight state parties (most of which were in battlegroun=
d states such as Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire and Virginia) had=
 received more from the victory fund than was transferred from their accoun=
ts to the DNC.

But even if state parties aren=92t getting to keep the victory fund cash, t=
hey benefit from money spent to enhance the DNC=92s data, research and desi=
gn services, said Jeremy Kennedy, the executive director of the Maine Democ=
ratic State Committee, which is a victory fund participant.

=93In my opinion, strengthening the state parties strengthens the DNC and v=
ice versa,=94 Kennedy said. =93I=92d be the first one to tell you if I felt=
 differently.=94 His party received $59,800 from the victory fund, but tran=
sferred that exact amount to the DNC, though Kennedy said he hopes that mon=
ey will find its way back to benefit the party in Maine.

While state party officials were made aware that Clinton's campaign would c=
ontrol the movement of the funds between participating committees, one oper=
ative who has relationships with multiple state parties said that some of t=
heir officials have complained that they weren't notified of the transfers =
into and out of their accounts until after the fact. That's despite their s=
tipulations in the banking documents that their affirmative consent was req=
uired before such transfers could be made from their accounts. But the oper=
ative said that the state party officials are reluctant to complain to the =
DNC about the arrangement out of fear of financial retribution.

=93Particularly the parties in states that are not competitive, they worry =
that the DNC won=92t let them keep any of the money, but the historical rea=
lity is that they wouldn=92t have gotten the money anyway,=94 the operative=
 said.

Asked about whether the victory fund has taken steps to keep the state part=
ies apprised of the transfers, Schwerin said, =93We work closely with all p=
arties involved and all transfers occur in accordance with the joint fundra=
ising agreements.=94

Amalgamated Bank =97 the union-run bank that handles the accounts for the v=
ictory fund, as well as Clinton=92s campaign and the DNC =97 did not direct=
ly address the complaints about money being transferred without consent of =
the state party committees.

=93We do not comment on the account activity of any customers other than to=
 say that all clients enjoy the highest standards of security protocols and=
 safeguards to ensure only listed account owners or their designated agents=
 are able to execute transactions of any kind and, of course, always in ful=
l compliance of all banking laws,=94 said bank spokesman Loren Riegelhaupt.

Another area in which critics contend the Hillary Victory Fund appears to b=
e pushing the bounds of joint fundraising is in its online advertising camp=
aign, which has included many ads urging readers to =93Stop Trump=94 or to =
support Clinton.

While joint fundraising committees are allowed to pay for ads as part of th=
eir fundraising efforts, they are forbidden from funding campaign advertisi=
ng urging voters to vote for or against specific candidates. Those types of=
 ads qualify as electioneering expenses that are supposed to be paid for di=
rectly by the campaign or by party committees.

Schwerin said the =93Stop Trump=94 ads aren=92t urging readers to vote agai=
nst Trump. =93All of HVF's activities, including online ads, are for fundra=
ising purposes,=94 he said. Most of the victory funds ads were executed by =
the same firm that does advertising for Clinton=92s campaign, Bully Pulpit =
Interactive, which has been paid $8.6 million by the Hillary Victory Fund f=
or online advertising, and $9.2 million by Hillary for America for online a=
dvertising and media buys.

Those victory fund ads, as well as a direct mail campaign funded by the sam=
e committee, =93appear to benefit only [the Clinton campaign] by generating=
 low-dollar contributions that flow only to HFA, rather than to the DNC or =
any of the participating state party committees,=94 charged Sanders=92 camp=
aign lawyer in an open letter sent to the DNC in April. It alleged that the=
 victory fund was essentially a pass-through to allow Clinton to benefit fr=
om contributions that far exceed the amount that her campaign could legally=
 accept.

In a news release accompanying the letter, Sanders campaign manager Jeff We=
aver argued =93it is unprecedented for the DNC to allow a joint committee t=
o be exploited to the benefit of one candidate in the midst of a contested =
nominating contest.=94

Clinton=92s campaign manager Robby Mook called the letter a =93shameful=94 =
and =93irresponsible=94 fundraising ploy, and urged Sanders to =93think abo=
ut what he can do to help the party he is seeking to lead.=94

draising leaves little for state parties</a></strong><br>
By Kenneth P. Vogel and Isaac Arnsdorf<br>
05/02/16<br>
<br>
In the days before Hillary Clinton launched an unprecedented big-money fund=
raising vehicle with state parties last summer, she vowed =93to rebuild our=
 party from the ground up,=94 proclaiming =93when our state parties are str=
ong, we win. That=92s what will happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
But less than 1 percent of the $61 million raised by that effort has stayed=
 in the state parties=92 coffers, according to a POLITICO analysis of the l=
atest Federal Election Commission filings.<br>
<br>
The venture, the Hillary Victory Fund, is a so-called joint fundraising com=
mittee comprised of Clinton=92s presidential campaign, the Democratic Natio=
nal Committee and 32 state party committees. The set-up allows Clinton to s=
olicit checks of $350,000 or more
 from her super-rich supporters at extravagant fundraisers including a dinn=
er at George Clooney=92s house and at a concert at Radio City Music Hall fe=
aturing Katy Perry and Elton John.<br>
<br>
The victory fund has transferred $3.8 million to the state parties, but alm=
ost all of that cash ($3.3 million, or 88 percent) was quickly transferred =
to the DNC, usually within a day or two, by the Clinton staffer who control=
s the committee, POLITICO=92s analysis
 of the FEC records found.<br>
<br>
By contrast, the victory fund has transferred $15.4 million to Clinton=92s =
campaign and $5.7 million to the DNC, which will work closely with Clinton=
=92s campaign if and when she becomes the party=92s nominee. And most of th=
e $23.3 million spent directly by the victory
 fund has gone towards expenses that appear to have directly benefited Clin=
ton=92s campaign, including $2.8 million for =93salary and overhead=94 and =
$8.6 million for web advertising that mostly looks indistinguishable from C=
linton campaign ads and that has helped
 Clinton build a network of small donors who will be critical in a general =
election expected to cost each side well in excess of $1 billion.<br>
<br>
The arrangement has sparked concerns among campaign finance watchdogs and a=
llies of Clinton=92s Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. They see it as a circ=
umvention of campaign contribution limits by a national party apparatus int=
ent on doing whatever it takes to
 help Clinton defeat Sanders during the party=92s primary, and then win the=
 White House.<br>
<br>
But it is perhaps more notable that the arrangement has prompted concerns a=
mong some participating state party officials and their allies. They grumbl=
e privately that Clinton is merely using them to subsidize her own operatio=
n, while her allies overstate her
 support for their parties and knock Sanders for not doing enough to help t=
he party. =93It=92s a one-sided benefit,=94 said an official with one parti=
cipating state party. The official, like those with several other state par=
ties, declined to talk about the arrangement
 on the record for fear of drawing the ire of the DNC and the Clinton campa=
ign.<br>
<br>
In fact, the DNC, which has pushed back aggressively on charges that it is =
boosting Clinton at the expense of other Democrats, has advised state party=
 officials on how to answer media inquiries about the arrangement, multiple=
 sources familiar with the interactions
 told POLITICO.<br>
<br>
=93The DNC has given us some guidance on what they=92re saying, but it=92s =
not clear what we should be saying,=94 said the official. =93I don=92t thin=
k anyone wants to get crosswise with the national party because we do need =
their resources. But everyone who entered into
 these agreements was doing it because they were asked to, not because ther=
e are immediately clear benefits.=94<br>
<br>
Some fundraisers who work for state parties predict that the arrangement co=
uld actually hurt participating state parties. They worry that participatin=
g states that aren=92t presidential battlegrounds and lack competitive Sena=
te races could see very little return
 investment from the DNC or Clinton=92s campaign, and are essentially actin=
g as money laundering conduits for them. And for party committees in contes=
ted states, there=92s another risk: they might find themselves unable to ac=
cept cash from rich donors whose checks
 to the victory fund counted towards their $10,000 donation limit to the st=
ate party in question =97 even if that party never got to spend the cash be=
cause it was transferred to the DNC.<br>
<br>
Sources working with the Hillary Victory Fund said the committee is sensiti=
ve to these concerns, and that state parties were asked to submit names of =
donors they wanted to save for themselves.<br>
<br>
Clinton=92s campaign and the DNC argue that all Democratic politicians and =
state parties =97 even those that aren=92t enrolled in the victory fund =97=
 will benefit from its fundraising. That=92s because the cash will go towar=
ds enhancing national voter data, and research
 and communications efforts that all state parties are entitled to.<br>
<br>
And Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Clinton=92s campaign, suggested that a h=
andful of key state parties last month received another $700,000 in transfe=
rs from the victory fund, and enjoyed other benefits from it that will be d=
etailed in subsequent FEC reports.
 (The latest reports only cover through the end of March.)<br>
<br>
=93About $4.5 million has already been transferred to state parties and the=
re is an additional $9 million on hand that will be distributed over the co=
ming months as state parties ramp up for the general election,=94 he said i=
n an email. He added that in April =93money
 raised through the HVF has started to be used to fund Democratic coordinat=
ed campaigns across the country, which will help strengthen the party and e=
lect Democrats up and down the ballot.=94<br>
<br>
But Schwerin did not respond to follow-up questions about how much of the $=
700,000 in victory fund transfers to the state parties was subsequently tra=
nsferred to the DNC. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach pointed out that the na=
tional party committee =93offered
 to engage in the same joint fundraising efforts with all the major preside=
ntial candidates early in the cycle and we welcome the efforts of the candi=
dates to help raise money for the DNC and state parties now to ensure we ca=
n build out the infrastructure to
 win in November.=94<br>
<br>
Sanders' campaign late last year signed a joint fundraising agreement with =
the DNC, but the committee has been largely inactive. Instead, after Sander=
s was chided by Clinton allies for not helping down-ballot Democrats, he se=
nt out appeals to his vaunted email
 list that helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for a trio of prog=
ressive House candidates, who got to keep all the cash.<br>
<br>
The Hillary Victory Fund, by contrast, allows the Clinton campaign to maint=
ain tight control over the cash it raises and spends. The fund represents b=
y far the most ambitious use to date of a joint fundraising committee =97 a=
nd arguably one the most ambitious
 hard-dollar fundraising efforts in modern presidential politics. Until 201=
4, the most an individual could have given to such a committee was $123,200=
. But in April of that year, the Supreme Court, in a case called McCutcheon=
 vs. FEC, struck down aggregate
 limits on total giving to federal campaigns, allowing maximum donations to=
 as many different committees as a donor wanted.<br>
<br>
That paved the way for massive joint fundraising committees which could acc=
ept ever-larger checks based on how the number and type of committees that =
agreed to participate. In the case of the Hillary Victory Fund, the maximum=
 donation in 2016 is $356,100, based
 on maximum donations of $2,700 to Hillary for America for the primary elec=
tion, $33,400 to the DNC and $10,000 to the federal accounts of each of the=
 32 state parties.<br>
<br>
After POLITICO revealed that the victory fund was asking for couples to don=
ate or raise a whopping $353,400 in order to sit at a table with Clinton, G=
eorge Clooney and his wife, attorney Amal Clooney, at a fundraiser last mon=
th in San Francisco, Clooney admitted
 that was &quot;an obscene amount of money.&quot; But he justified it by sa=
ying &quot;the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising, is not =
going to Hillary to run for president, it's going to the down-ticket.&quot;=
<br>
<br>
According to the agreements signed by the participating committees, which w=
ere obtained by POLITICO, the money is required to be distributed, at least=
 initially, based on a formula set forth in joint fundraising agreements si=
gned by the participants. The first
 $2,700 goes to Clinton campaign, the next $33,400 goes to the DNC, and any=
 remaining funds are to be distributed among the state parties.<br>
<br>
But what happens to the cash after that initial distribution is left almost=
 entirely to the discretion of the Clinton campaign. Its chief operating of=
ficer Beth Jones is the treasurer of the victory fund. And FEC filings show=
 that within a day of most transfers
 from the victory fund to the state parties, identical sums were transferre=
d from the state party accounts to the DNC, which Sanders=92 supporters hav=
e accused of functioning as an adjunct of the Clinton campaign.<br>
<br>
For example, the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party received $43,500 f=
rom the victory fund on Nov. 2, only to transfer the same amount to the DNC=
 that same day. The pattern repeated itself after the Minnesota party recei=
ved transfers from the victory fund
 of $20,600 on Dec. 1 (the party sent the same amount to the DNC the next d=
ay) and $150,000 on Jan. 4 (it transferred the same amount to the DNC that =
day).<br>
<br>
That means that Minnesota=92s net gain from its participation in the victor=
y fund was precisely $0 through the end of March. Meanwhile, the DNC pocket=
ed an extra $214,100 in cash routed through Minnesota =97 much of which the=
 DNC wouldn=92t have been able to accept
 directly, since it came from donors who had mostly had already maxed out t=
o the national party committee.<br>
<br>
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton delivers the keynote to t=
he Eagle Academy Foundation annual fundraising breakfast in Gotham Hall on =
April 29.<br>
<br>
A similar pattern transpired with most of the participating state parties. =
As of March 31, only eight state parties (most of which were in battlegroun=
d states such as Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire and Virginia) had=
 received more from the victory
 fund than was transferred from their accounts to the DNC.<br>
<br>
But even if state parties aren=92t getting to keep the victory fund cash, t=
hey benefit from money spent to enhance the DNC=92s data, research and desi=
gn services, said Jeremy Kennedy, the executive director of the Maine Democ=
ratic State Committee, which is a victory
 fund participant.<br>
<br>
=93In my opinion, strengthening the state parties strengthens the DNC and v=
ice versa,=94 Kennedy said. =93I=92d be the first one to tell you if I felt=
 differently.=94 His party received $59,800 from the victory fund, but tran=
sferred that exact amount to the DNC, though
 Kennedy said he hopes that money will find its way back to benefit the par=
ty in Maine.<br>
<br>
While state party officials were made aware that Clinton's campaign would c=
ontrol the movement of the funds between participating committees, one oper=
ative who has relationships with multiple state parties said that some of t=
heir officials have complained that
 they weren't notified of the transfers into and out of their accounts unti=
l after the fact. That's despite their stipulations in the banking document=
s that their affirmative consent was required before such transfers could b=
e made from their accounts. But
 the operative said that the state party officials are reluctant to complai=
n to the DNC about the arrangement out of fear of financial retribution.<br=
>
<br>
=93Particularly the parties in states that are not competitive, they worry =
that the DNC won=92t let them keep any of the money, but the historical rea=
lity is that they wouldn=92t have gotten the money anyway,=94 the operative=
 said.<br>
<br>
Asked about whether the victory fund has taken steps to keep the state part=
ies apprised of the transfers, Schwerin said, =93We work closely with all p=
arties involved and all transfers occur in accordance with the joint fundra=
ising agreements.=94<br>
<br>
Amalgamated Bank =97 the union-run bank that handles the accounts for the v=
ictory fund, as well as Clinton=92s campaign and the DNC =97 did not direct=
ly address the complaints about money being transferred without consent of =
the state party committees.<br>
<br>
=93We do not comment on the account activity of any customers other than to=
 say that all clients enjoy the highest standards of security protocols and=
 safeguards to ensure only listed account owners or their designated agents=
 are able to execute transactions
 of any kind and, of course, always in full compliance of all banking laws,=
=94 said bank spokesman Loren Riegelhaupt.<br>
<br>
Another area in which critics contend the Hillary Victory Fund appears to b=
e pushing the bounds of joint fundraising is in its online advertising camp=
aign, which has included many ads urging readers to =93Stop Trump=94 or to =
support Clinton.<br>
<br>
While joint fundraising committees are allowed to pay for ads as part of th=
eir fundraising efforts, they are forbidden from funding campaign advertisi=
ng urging voters to vote for or against specific candidates. Those types of=
 ads qualify as electioneering expenses
 that are supposed to be paid for directly by the campaign or by party comm=
ittees.<br>
<br>
Schwerin said the =93Stop Trump=94 ads aren=92t urging readers to vote agai=
nst Trump. =93All of HVF's activities, including online ads, are for fundra=
ising purposes,=94 he said. Most of the victory funds ads were executed by =
the same firm that does advertising for Clinton=92s
 campaign, Bully Pulpit Interactive, which has been paid $8.6 million by th=
e Hillary Victory Fund for online advertising, and $9.2 million by Hillary =
for America for online advertising and media buys.<br>
<br>
Those victory fund ads, as well as a direct mail campaign funded by the sam=
e committee, =93appear to benefit only [the Clinton campaign] by generating=
 low-dollar contributions that flow only to HFA, rather than to the DNC or =
any of the participating state party
 committees,=94 charged Sanders=92 campaign lawyer in an open letter sent t=
o the DNC in April. It alleged that the victory fund was essentially a pass=
-through to allow Clinton to benefit from contributions that far exceed the=
 amount that her campaign could legally
 accept.<br>
<br>
In a news release accompanying the letter, Sanders campaign manager Jeff We=
aver argued =93it is unprecedented for the DNC to allow a joint committee t=
o be exploited to the benefit of one candidate in the midst of a contested =
nominating contest.=94<br>
<br>
Clinton=92s campaign manager Robby Mook called the letter a =93shameful=94 =
and =93irresponsible=94 fundraising ploy, and urged Sanders to =93think abo=
ut what he can do to help the party he is seeking to lead.=94</p>
