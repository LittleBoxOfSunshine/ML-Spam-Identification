By Ben Smith (ben@buzzfeed.com; @BuzzFeedBen) and Daniel Lippman (dlippman@politico.com; @dlippman)

Good Friday morning. It's 66 days to Cleveland, 73 days to Philly, 179 days to election. And mere minutes before my beloved former colleagues at POLITICO regret giving me the keys to Playbook!

Surrender or Rope-A-Dope? So was Paul Ryan's near-embrace of Trump a particularly humiliating sort of "kabuki as prelude to surrender," as my colleague John Stanton suggests? Or, as other observers think, a sort of rope-a-dope that will allow them to blame Trump for the inevitable meltdown? Nobody's made any money this cycle betting Washington Republicans are cleverer than they look, and Ryan sure was accomodating - even when, as Sherman and Bresnahan report, "the New York billionaire suddenly allowed a flock of his campaign advisers inside."  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5b3e678657e06aa3de801c296e2db1ecba30e9f87da492828e40957fe121fcd1

The Trump blacklist: Speaking of establishments deciding whether or not to cave to Trump... the media story remains central this cycle. From the deep tensions in TV newsrooms over giving the candidate unfiltered access to the airwaves to Facebook's rough initiation into the political media business, 2016 is feeding and feeding off the media transformation.

This morning some media figures are denouncing Trump's blacklist of an across-the-spectrum mix of outlets (present company included) from even making it into the restrictive press pens at his events. Mother Jones reported the list of outlets, ranging from National Review to The Daily Beast: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5b3e678657e06aa310f16313e827eb6b34fc0d8c551fd1b0b9c51aa99bda3229 

"Reports that Donald Trump's campaign has a 'blacklist' of news outlets barred from getting credentials offends the very idea of a free society and a free press," National Press Club President Thomas Burr told me. "You can call journalists 'disgusting,' or disparage our jobs - we're tough enough to take it - but singling out certain publications for banishment is un-American."

White House Correspondents Association President Carol Lee emails that "the WHCA strongly opposes any attempt by a campaign, government institution or elected official to deny access to specific news organizations or reporters because they don't like the tone or content of their reporting."

Shockingly, Trump aides Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort didn't reply to an email asking why they blacklist news outlets.

News from New York: It's not just you, D.C. Nobody at New York dinner parties can stop talking about the Ben Rhodes piece either.

--And Times Magazine editor Jake Silverstein (@jakesilverstein) defended the piece in a tweetstorm, saying the author "succeeded in inhabit[ing] his subject's world view."  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5b3e678657e06aa39a03fd05d4c01ce1941ffb690b071fe2e7c29fc97d494d8e

Mark Zuckerberg steps into the mess over Trending Topics, and denies the allegations they were politicized. He'll also be "inviting leading conservatives and people from across the political spectrum" - but once begun, it's hard to see how this conversation ends any time soon.  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5b3e678657e06aa309f7002e6e90594ac1be59ec88bbe8a4cd6d9f687940ec02

-- Facebook's Trending guidelines, via the The Guardian's Sam Thielman: "The guidelines show human intervention - and therefore editorial decisions - at almost every stage of Facebook's trending news operation, a team that at one time was as few as 12 people" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5b3e678657e06aa3d6ef180dbccc8d624fc03d3bfb6645e8cd81523a2553ad4f

--Trans style note from Dominic Holden: "A moment of silence for the well-meaning people who say 'transgendered.'"  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5b3e678657e06aa353137c00f79b1776123914884e60ca79a7d0eda8b781a37a

Two things I learned from my time at POLITICO: Reporting is the most important part; and shameless self-promotion doesn't hurt. So yes, here's some great journalism BuzzFeed News has done in just the last day.

--Sheera Frenkel tells the definitive story of how ISIS uses the Internet.  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5b3e678657e06aa3149f86f59fe05f8b737963014dc390ca7586405a6a3626a6

Near-final self-reference: There is a media rumor abroad in the land that I am going back to POLITICO. Weirdly, I heard it the other day from one ... Jim VandeHei(!). Nope. But it is nice to visit with you all!

ALSO: If this is typo-free, thank Daniel Lippman, who I first met when he was a quite strange high school kid emailing me about typos in my notoriously typo-prone POLITICO blog.

THE OTHER BLACKLIST -- "Trump campaign eyes #NeverTrump blacklist: Candidates' aides and allies want anti-Trump vendors barred from lucrative general-election contracts," by Ken Vogel and Ben Schreckinger: "The blacklist talk - which sources say mostly targets operatives who worked for Never Trump groups, but also some who worked for Trump's GOP presidential rivals or their supportive super PACs - strikes against a Republican consulting class that Trump has assailed as a pillar of a corrupt political establishment. It's a sweet bit of turnabout for Trump aides and consultants who in recent months were warned that their work for the anti-establishment billionaire real estate showman could
 diminish their own career prospects. ...

"If Trump's team makes good on the blacklist, it could elevate a whole new crop of vendors, while penalizing establishment operatives who attacked him, often in deeply personal terms. But it also could put Trump's campaign at a competitive disadvantage as it scrambles to quickly beef up capabilities in highly technical campaign tactics that it largely eschewed in the primary, including voter data, direct mail and phone banking. ... Some of the consultants and firms that worked against Trump are industry leaders in their respective fields, including strategist Katie Packer, pollster the Tarrance Group, online fundraiser Campaign Solutions and data vendors TargetPoint and Targeted Victory."

** A message from the Alzheimer's Association: Costing taxpayers $18.3 million every HOUR, Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's and more than 15 million unpaid caregivers are providing care for a loved one. Alzheimer's is a national issue, and now it's time we make it a national priority. Alzheimer's yearly cost of $236 billion will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation - an epidemic we cannot afford and shouldn't accept. While it is the only leading cause of death that can't be prevented, cured or even slowed, research and medical advancement can change that. That's why the Alzheimer's
 Association is fighting to eliminate the disease through the advancement of research and providing care and support for all affected. Learn more at www.alz.org/advocacy. **

<b>&quot;If Trump's team makes good on the blacklist,
</b> it could elevate a whole new crop of vendors, while penalizing establishment operatives who attacked him, often in deeply personal terms. But it also could put Trump's campaign at a competitive disadvantage as it scrambles to quickly beef up capabilities in highly technical campaign tactics that it largely eschewed in the primary, including voter data, direct mail and phone banking. ...

</b> Costing taxpayers $18.3 million every HOUR, Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's and more than 15 million unpaid caregivers are providing care for a loved one. Alzheimer's is a national issue, and now it's time we make it a national priority. Alzheimer's yearly cost of $236 billion will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation - an epidemic we cannot afford and shouldn't accept. While it is the only leading cause of death that can't be prevented, cured or even slowed, research and medical advancement can change that. That's why the Alzheimer's Association is fighting to eliminate the
 disease through the advancement of research and providing care and support for all affected.
