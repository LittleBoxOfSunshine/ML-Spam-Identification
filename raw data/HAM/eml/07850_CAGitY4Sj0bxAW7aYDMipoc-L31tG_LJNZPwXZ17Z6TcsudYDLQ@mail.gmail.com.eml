Do you know if it's atypical for a businessperson with his assets and
wealthy to undergo so many audits?

One line of argument I think we may want to push re Trump's tax returns is =
that if he's currently under audit, it's even more important that voters ha=
ve a chance to see his filings.<br>
<br>
The fact he is routinely audited is probably not due to persecution by the =
IRS, but instead because he is pushing the boundaries of what's acceptable.=
 Trump is likely exploiting loopholes and engaging in accounting tricks, th=
ings that hard-working families don't/can't do. The American people deserve=
 to see what the government finds concerning and, more generally, how far h=
e will go not to pay his fair share.<br>
