There is a lot of reporter interest and plenty of outlets are chasing the s=
tory after the Ann Gearan story claimed the DNC would be offering concessio=
ns, but so long as you haven't called the people you'll be appointing to co=
nfirm they will definitely be on, we can probably hold it. Then we could wo=
rk the story over Saturday and Sunday, and have our roll out on Monday morn=
ing. If the campaigns told these people they would definitely be on, then i=
t will be pieced together more quickly and we would have to execute on a fa=
ster timeline.

For a Monday roll out we would want a call with Cummings and a reporter tom=
orrow or early Sunday, with your calls to the members to confirm their appo=
intment on Sunday night.

The Tic Toc would be roughly:

Saturday May 21

Finalize Public Affairs Guidance

  *   Talking Points
  *   Q&A

Secure Validators

  *   Tee up Cummings and one other appointee to be on message, and to spea=
k with the reporter for the preview/launch story

Finalize Press Release

Lock In Preview/Launch Story Reporter

  *   Recommendation: Greg Sargent, Washington Post

Pitch New Day and Andrea Mitchell without details

Schedule Sunday notification calls

Sunday May 22

Hold calls with the reporter with

  *   DWS
  *   Cummings
  *   TBD appointee
  *   Convention team / Party Affairs for background

Lock in New Day and Andrea Mitchell

Notification calls start at 8pm ET

10:00 PM Embargo on Preview/Launch Story lifts for web (Preview story runs =
online)

Pitch Paul Kirk and Howard Dean on co-signing a Medium Post on what happens=
 at convention / praising platform drafting moving forward

Monday May 23

Preview / Launch story runs in print in Washington Post

6:40 AM - DWS on New Day

Begin Pitching Cummings to Cable Television

12:10 PM - DWS on MSNBC (Andrea Mitchell)

Lock in Dean / Kirk Medium Post (Send them draft)

9pm Medium Post online
* Send to morning TV producers
* Send to morning tipsheets (Playbook, etc)

Cummings interviews throughout afterrnoon and into Tuesday the 24th

Luis, I do want to go with the Monday morning WP/New Day/Andrea Mitchell pl=
an for the rollout. I asked Leah to hold and said I would be happy to talk =
to her. She is concerned it will leak before then but I think we can mostly=
 keep it contained.

Please let me know what you think.
