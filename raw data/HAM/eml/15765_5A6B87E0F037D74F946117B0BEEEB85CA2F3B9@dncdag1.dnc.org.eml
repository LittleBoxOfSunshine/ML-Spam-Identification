Scott Walker has a healthcare plan, if you want almost no insurance at all<=
http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-scott-walker-s-got-a-healt=
hcare-20150818-column.html>
LOS ANGELES TIMES // MICHAEL HILTZIK

When I first heard that a new repeal-and-replace-Obamacare plan was coming =
from Scott Walker, the Republican governor of Wisconsin currently posing as=
 a candidate for president, I set a challenge for myself.

I wrote down every provision I expected to find in the plan, sealed the lis=
t in an envelope and locked it in my safe so I could compare my predictions=
 with reality.

In truth, this wasn't as hard to do as it is to, say, pick six winners on a=
 Sunday football card. I merely thought of every healthcare shibboleth the =
GOP has promoted over the last five years and bunged them down.

Walker published his plan<https://www.scottwalker.com/obamacare-plan/files/=
Day-One-Patient-Freedom-Plan.pdf> Tuesday morning. I unsealed my envelope a=
nd...I won!

Sell health insurance policies across state lines? Check.

Tort reform? Check.

Provide limited block grants to the states to fund Medicaid? Check.

State-sponsored high-risk pools? Check.

Protect those with pre-existing conditions, but only if they maintain conti=
nuous coverage? Check.

Expand health savings accounts? Check.

In short, every nostrum promoted by the conservative and libertarian lobbie=
s (the Heritage Foundation is cited several times), none of which has been =
shown to make much of a dent in the nation's population of the medically un=
insured and a few of which would work against that goal, is in there.

To be fair, Walker threw in a couple of novel curves. Let's take them up fi=
rst. The most notable is a provision to convert the income-based premium su=
bsidies provided under the Affordable Care Act to a system based on age. Ac=
cording to Walker's breakdown, the subsidies would range from $900 a year f=
or those 0-17 years old, up to $3,000 for those 50-64. The payments are onl=
y for those without employer-sponsored insurance.

The loopy irrationality of this proposal can be seen if one contemplates th=
at a 30-year-old millionaire would receive the same grant ($1,200) as one e=
arning $20,000. Under the ACA, the latter would receive $1,939, on average.=
 (You can play with these numbers using the Kaiser Family Foundation's subs=
idy calculator<http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/#state=3D&zip=
=3D&income-type=3Ddollars&income=3D&employer-coverage=3D0&people=3D1&altern=
ate-plan-family=3Dindividual&adult-count=3D1&adults%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=3D21&ad=
ults%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=3D0&child-count=3D0&child-tobacco=3D0>.)

Walker doesn't explain why his formula makes sense in the context of the he=
alth insurance marketplace, though he bemoans the fact that under the ACA a=
 35-year-old woman earning $35,000 would get no subsidy, while she'd get $2=
,100 from him. Of course, so would a 35-year-old millionaire heiress, but n=
o matter.

Walker also puts in a plug for workplace wellness programs, which he says d=
eliver "incentives for people to adopt healthy behaviors." One doesn't comm=
only see these programs advocated in GOP healthcare plans, and perhaps that=
's a good thing. These programs have taken the employer healthcare market b=
y storm, but whether they work is questionable, as I reported here<http://w=
ww.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-how-wellness-programs-cost-employe=
rs-and-harm-employees-20141202-column.html>. They may actually cost employe=
rs money, net net. And the danger is that they'll be used by some employers=
 to harass and punish<http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-well=
ness-not-especially-20141104-column.html> unwell members of their workforce=
.

Of Walker's more conventional proposals, the big cheese is selling health p=
olicies across state lines. This is a hardy perennial for the GOP--it was p=
art of John McCain's presidential platform in 2009, but you have to search =
far and wide to find a single credible healthcare expert who thinks it's a =
good idea. Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation told Bloomberg News=
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-18/scott-walker-s-obama=
care-replacement-plan-is-popular-with-republicans-but-can-it-work->, "if yo=
u allow the sale of insurance across state lines with no minimum federal ru=
les, insurers would gravitate to states with little regulation."
We've explained the phenomenon many times, using the example of credit card=
 rate caps. After the Supreme Court allowed<http://bit.ly/1fDvn7L> credit c=
ard issuers to export the rate cap laws of their home states nationwide in =
1978, the states with high or nonexistent interest rate caps, such as Delaw=
are and South Dakota, became kings of the credit card industry, attracting =
the consumer credit subsidiaries of Citibank, Wells Fargo and other big ban=
ks. One issuer in South Dakota, which counts its credit card industry jobs =
by the thousands, even put out a card carrying an annual rate of 79.9%<http=
://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/first-premier-79-rate-fees-credit-c=
ard-1265.php>.

Eventually, Congress stepped in to impose some relatively modest consumer p=
rotection rules on the industry--in 2009. So it only took 31 years.

So if you want to buy health insurance with no standards whatsoever, Walker=
's your man.

"Tort reform"? Another GOP chestnut. Study after study<http://articles.lati=
mes.com/2009/oct/01/business/fi-hiltzik1> shows that malpractice litigation=
 and "defensive medicine" to avoid it add a couple of percentage points, po=
ssibly, to U.S. healthcare costs. The remedies, however, involve barring th=
e courthouse door to worthy litigants, at the expense especially of women a=
nd the parents of babies and young children. Who gains? Malpractice insuran=
ce companies. But this nostrum remains part of the GOP playlist because it'=
s aimed at personal injury lawyers, who tend to contribute to Democrats.

Walker does promise that he'll protect Americans with pre-existing conditio=
ns from losing their coverage of facing jacked-up premiums. His idea here, =
to protect those who maintain "continuous, creditable coverage" from being =
turned down or charged more, comes from an Obamacare replacement plan promo=
ted last year by GOP Sens. Tom Coburn (Okla.), Richard Burr (N.C.), and Orr=
in Hatch (Utah).

It's got a enormous flaw. As I observed then, the most important reason tha=
t people go uninsured is because they can't afford coverage. Those who lose=
 it, often because of a layoff, could be doomed to fall further behind the =
reach of coverage under the GOP plan because they would have to pay for the=
ir own medical expenses in the interim--and those can be ruinous. Let your =
coverage lapse, and you can be stranded without any reasonably priced cover=
age at all.

There's more in Walker's plan, but really less. The whole package, which is=
 billed as Walker's "Day One Patient Freedom Plan," is enveloped in a cloud=
 of chatter about how "Obamacare made an already broken system worse" and d=
eprived you, the American people, of "the full freedom to choose your own h=
ealth care."

This is an effort to place rhetoric ahead of reality. The reality is that t=
he Affordable Care Act has brought coverage to some 16.4 million previously=
 uninsured Americans<http://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/83966/ib_u=
ninsured_change.pdf>, and imposed valuable coverage standards on their poli=
cies and those of many millions more.

Walker plainly is trying to keep his flagging campaign alive not merely by =
reviving Obamacare as a Republican target after many of his fellow politici=
ans have let it go. But the Affordable Care Act is already deeply ingrained=
 in the U.S. healthcare system, to the great advantage of millions of his f=
ellow Americans. He needs to move on.
