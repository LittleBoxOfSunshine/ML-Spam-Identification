Wasserman Schultz Statement on Mother=92s Day

Washington, DC =96 U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-23) released the =
following statement today in celebration of Mother=92s Day:

=93On Mother=92s Day, we thank all the mothers who work every day and night=
 to create better lives for their children and families. We thank them for =
the sacrifices they make, and for the countless hours they spend lifting up=
 their families.

=93As a society, we must be committed to empowering moms and creating oppor=
tunities for them to succeed. From helping close our nation=92s embarrassin=
g gender wage gap, to providing pregnant mothers the resources they need to=
 have healthy pregnancies and combat the Zika virus; to ensuring women and =
mothers of every age have access to comprehensive family planning services =
and economic opportunities at home and abroad; I will continue to spend eve=
ry single day using my vote and my voice to make these priorities a reality=
. We need more working mothers and women in elected office around the natio=
n to join me in transforming those bills into laws.=94

=93As a mother of three children, I=92m proud to work on these issues and s=
tand up for moms facing difficult choices every day about what is best for =
their children. I=92m proud to be fighting in Congress for the moms who wor=
k outside the home but are paid less than their male counterparts, and I am=
 proud to represent mothers of every background and socioeconomic status wh=
o are still climbing the ladders of success in my Congressional district, F=
lorida's 23rd.

=93But there is no job or title of which I am more proud, than being a mom =
to my amazing son and two daughters.  From my family to yours, Happy Mother=
=92s Day!
