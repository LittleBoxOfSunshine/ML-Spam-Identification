Julie -

Hope you're well. Wanted to circle back as we almost sell out June 8th.
It's you and a guest, correct? Just need to make sure my numbers are right.
We're asking all guests to get their contributions in, in advance online at
https://finance.democrats.org/page/contribute/NYDinnerJun8 and to connect
with Dan, copied, for the security information needed.

Finally, wasn't sure you had any takers but in case you did - let me know
re: Miami!

See you the 8th, if not sooner!
