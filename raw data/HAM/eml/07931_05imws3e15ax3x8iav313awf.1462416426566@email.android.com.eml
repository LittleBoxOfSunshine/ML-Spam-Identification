Subject: Interview notes


LA Daily News interview with reporter Dave Montero: Covered the state of th=
e race; the GOP unification challenge; the Dem contest (how will we minimiz=
e the damage); and Calif being meaningful in primary contest. Also asked qu=
estions about hyper partisanship and redistricting. The chair handled all q=
uestions with ease. No flags.

Variety interview with reporter Ted Johnson: State of race questions. More =
focused on Trump than the Dem primary. Asked if Trump puts more states in p=
lay. Chair cautioned against complacency.

Univision interview: 6-8 minute piece focused on state of race/Trump. Chair=
 hit key relevant points re: Trump/Latinos. Handled questions about Dem rac=
e, Sanders popularity among younger voters. Got question about Sanchez v Ha=
rris in Calif Senate. She maintained neutrality but praised both candidates=
 as great leaders and said Calif would win with either one.
