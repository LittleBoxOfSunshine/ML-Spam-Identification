*Sanders: I've lost because 'poor people don't vote'*

Confronted with poor performance in states with higher populations of
low-income people, Bernie Sanders said his losses are due to those people
not voting.


"Well, because poor people don't vote. I mean, that's just a fact. That's a
sad reality of American society," Sanders said in an interview with MSNBC's
"Meet the Press" set to air in full on Sunday.

Host Chuck Todd had asked about rival Hillary Clinton's victory in 16 of 17
primary contests in states with the highest levels of income inequality.

=E2=80=9CIf we can significantly increase voter turnout so that low-income =
people
and working people and young people participated in the political process,
if we got a voter turnout of 75 percent, this country would be radically
transformed,=E2=80=9D Sanders said.

Sanders has often pinned his success rate to voter turnout. But he has lost
among Democratic voters with household incomes below $50,000, 55 percent to
44 percent, across primaries where network exit polls have been conducted,
according to the Washington Post.
