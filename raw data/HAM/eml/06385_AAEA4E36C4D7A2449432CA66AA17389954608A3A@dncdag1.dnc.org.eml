I think what HFA did is fine. They would have done a roundup if there were enough clips but they just sent out New Day + Military Times story

Is this something we want to move forward with? HFA did a roundup on this already.

Most of the clips were McCain focused - I am hesitant to raise up McCain since his race is shaping up to be competitive.

SL: Donald Trump doesn't understand the issues that affect our veterans, nor does he seem to care

TOPPER:

Recently in an interview on New Day, Donald Trump declined to support the G.I. Bill outright. His comments were so offensive that 50 veterans, including some Republican Senators, called for an apology.

[SCREENSHOT]

For someone who promised their administration would treat veterans "really, really well" by raising $6 Million in missing donations, it comes at no surprise that Donald Trump would oppose legislation that has helped millions of veterans obtain jobs, housing, education and economic security.

Donald Trump's platform on veterans is as much of a failure as his policies on foreign affairs, as he continues to ignores the needs of Americans who have risked their lives to defend our country. Foreign policy experts and U.S. military leaders alike are "terrified, shocked and appalled<http://factivists.democrats.org/report-u-s-military-leaders-terrified-shocked-appalled-by-idea-of-trump-as-president/>" by the idea of Trump as president.
But one thing is obvious: Donald Trump doesn't understand the issues that affect our veterans, nor does he seem to care. By putting his out-of-touch ideology ahead of the interests of veterans, once again, Trump has showed that he does not have the temperament or judgment to be president.

See what people are saying:


Donald Trump Doesn't Know What the GI Bill Is (or Anything Else)<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-soltz/donald-trump-doesnt-know_b_9872222.html>
HUFFINGTON POST // JON SOLTZ

...

Clearly, Donald Trump has no idea what the GI Bill is - landmark legislation (which was recently updated) that still provides education and job training opportunities to our veterans, so they can better compete with others in their generation who chose getting a degree, or an early start to their career, over military service. It's part of the compact we make with those who serve, and a promise on which we cannot afford to renege.

...

Maybe he cares so little about learning about what the GI Bill is, because he cares so little about veterans. Most of the money he raised "for veterans," when he bailed on a Republican debate, still hasn't been given to veterans' groups.

Regardless, like on pretty much every issue, Trump talks long and loud, to hide the fact that he is utterly and totally clueless. Whether it is his disastrously stupid idea to try to squirm our way out of repaying debt, or thinking you can cut the GI Bill because you're renegotiating trade deals, the amount of things that Trump doesn't know, and doesn't understand, could fill up the crumbling and decrepit Trump Taj Mahal.

Pathetic.

Trump faces mounting attacks on veterans issues<http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/election/2016/05/09/trump-faces-attacks-veterans-issues/84134896/>
MILITARY TIMES // LEO SHANE III
Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump took heavy criticism over his treatment of veterans this weekend from Democrats and his own party.
"What he said about me, that's fine," McCain said. "I don't require any repair of that. But when he said 'I don't like people who were captured,' then there's a great body of American heroes that would like to see him retract that statement. "In a Sunday interview on CNN, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., expressed serious concerns about Trump as the next commander in chief, particularly in light of comments he made last fall mocking McCain for being captured during the Vietnam War.

McCain's comments come amid a flurry of high-profile party leaders who say they won't endorse the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Last week, Air Force Reserve veteran Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he would not back his one-time campaign trail rival and even would skip the Republican convention this summer.

Trump has repeatedly denied that his comments were a slight to prisoners of war, and maintained that veterans know he has the utmost respect for those who served in the military. McCain disagreed.
