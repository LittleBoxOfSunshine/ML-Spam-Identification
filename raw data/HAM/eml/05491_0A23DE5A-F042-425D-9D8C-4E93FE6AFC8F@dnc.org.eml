Hello everyone and thank you for joining us. My name is Dejuana Thompson , =
the Deputy Director of Community Engagement at the DNC. Community Engagemen=
t works to promote advocacy among various progressive political leaders and=
 activists across the country. We work closely with key leadership of the D=
NC, state parties, external partners, and allies to ensure seamless integra=
tion into the larger DNC strategy and engage, inform, and mobilize specific=
 constituencies.

I am proud to welcome the DNC Chair Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz=
, the Chair of the DNC=92s Women=92s Caucus Lottie Shackleford, and Pratt W=
iley the National Director of Voter Expansion at the DNC, to this call.
I would like to remind everyone that this call is strictly off-the-record, =
and is closed to the press.

With that, it is my pleasure to turn this call over to the DNC Chair Congre=
sswoman Wasserman Schultz.

DNC Chair Representative Wasserman Schultz

Thank you Marilyn. I also want to thank everyone on this call for joining u=
s today.

The right to vote is our most fundamental right, and the right by which all=
 of our other rights are secured. No one should ever take for granted their=
 right to vote, nor should anyone seek to take that right away.

But the GOP seems to believe their path to victory lies in restricting acce=
ss to the ballot box, and Republican-led state legislatures are leading the=
 charge in key battleground states across the country.

We see that most clearly in North Carolina, where the so-called Voter Infor=
mation Verification Act, reversed a generation of electoral progress. Passe=
d in the wake a Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a key provision of th=
e Voting Rights Act, the bill eliminated same-day voter registration, rolle=
d back early voting by a full week, and imposed new photo ID requirements f=
or voters. This purely partisan law was passed without any support from Dem=
ocrats because its intent was clear from the very beginning =96 to systemat=
ically limit access to the polls in order to sway elections.

It is deeply disturbing that as our nation moves forward, one of the countr=
y=92s major political parties is attempting to drag us backward. We should =
not have to re-litigate yesterday=92s battles or continue a fight we have p=
reviously won.
Yet this is playing out all across the country.

From North Carolina to Wisconsin to Arizona, we=92ve seen a number of state=
s pass anti-voter laws designed to limit access to the polls. Whether it=92=
s implementing restrictive photo ID laws, rolling back early voting, elimin=
ating same-day registration, or changing polling locations without notifyin=
g voters, these types of tactics make it harder to vote.

When we limit the ways that people can vote, we are hurting the low-wage wo=
rkers with two jobs, the recently married woman who hasn=92t changed her na=
me on her driver=92s license, the single mother who goes to work early each=
 morning and picks up her children late at night, and the widower without a=
 car who relies on his grown children to get to the polls. And as you may h=
ave noticed, these types of laws disproportionately impact women, minoritie=
s, students, the elderly, and low-income people.

We=92re going to discuss how these laws hurt women voters in particular. An=
d by the way =96 we=92ve outnumbered male voters in every national election=
 since 1964. In 2012, approximately 10 million more women voted than men, c=
ontributing to the largest gender gap in history. President Barack Obama wo=
n 56 percent of the women=92s vote in the last election and women voters ma=
de the difference in several high-profile races, helping Democrats retain c=
ontrol of the Senate that year. So it=92s easy to see why the GOP is taking=
 aim at women voters =96 we=92re a key part of the Democratic constituency =
and we vote in large numbers.

Women face a number of =93silent=94 obstacles on Election Day that I allude=
d to earlier.

Rolling back or restricting early voting hurts makes voting more difficult =
for those with limited flexibility in their schedules. Women have comprised=
 60 percent of early voters in 2012.

Women are more likely than men to change their name due to marriage or divo=
rce. However, some voter ID laws require voters=92 government issued identi=
fication to exactly match their name at their local polling place. So if yo=
u haven=92t had time to go to the DMV for a new license, then you=92re pena=
lized at the polls.

And some states now require documented proof of citizenship, such as a birt=
h certificate or passport, just to register to vote. If citizens don=92t pr=
ovide sufficient evidence, then they are not allowed to vote in state and l=
ocal elections. It is estimated that 32 million eligible women voters may l=
ack proof of citizenship that matches their current legal name.
I cannot emphasize this enough =96 women are an important voting block that=
 the Republican Party has largely alienated. We cannot allow them to contin=
ue to silence our voices.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to my dear friend, the Chair =
of the DNC=92s Women=92s Caucus, Lottie Shackleford.



Women=92s Caucus Chair Lottie Shackelford
Thank you Debbie.

I started my career in politics back in 1978, and I have witnessed many =93=
firsts.=94 I was also the first women elected Mayor of Little Rock, Arkansa=
s, and I have tried to open the doors of opportunity for other women.

Women must =96 we can and we must =96 amplify our voices and values at the =
ballot box. To echo Debbie, women have outnumbered male voters in every nat=
ional election since 1964. Our voices are powerful when we go to the polls.
Let me take a moment to talk about this year=92s race. Donald Trump is dang=
erous, and he lacks the judgment and the temperament to be president.

I wouldn=92t want him to take a tour of the White House, let alone live the=
re. He has a long history of denigrating women, and the vile, sexist commen=
ts he=92s made on the campaign trail are beneath the dignity of the office =
he seeks.

Trump would take away a woman=92s right to make her own healthcare choices.=
 He has said that women who had abortions should be punished =96 but not th=
e doctors that performed them. He=92s even opposed exceptions for health of=
 the mother because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to have =
an abortion.

Trump said that ensuring equal pay for women should just be left up to =93t=
he marketplace,=94 and once suggested family leave policies should actually=
 be scaled back. He=92s also called pregnancy was =93an inconvenience for a=
 business.=94 Trump even complained that when he employed mothers, they wer=
e not giving him =93100 percent.=94


This is about our mothers, our sisters, our daughters, and ourselves. That=
=92s who he=92s referring to. He=92s talking about us. And we must hold him=
 accountable.
Our vote is our voice. Let=92s use it this fall. And let=92s register and e=
ncourage others to vote. Here=92s what I am asking you to do:

Know the Law. In order to successfully vote, you need to know the rules of =
the road. Make sure you check with your local board of elections.

Engage Your Community. Women are most likely to register to vote if someone=
 they know and trust asks them to vote and engages them in a discussion abo=
ut the issues. Keep in touch with the people you registered through email, =
events, town hall meetings, candidate forums, et cetera. Invite them to att=
end registration or other events that will engage them more deeply in the p=
olitical process.

Register to vote, plan to vote, and then vote. Ensure you ask the three mos=
t important questions: 1) Are they registered to vote 2) Have they voted? 3=
) What is their plan on or before Election Day to vote?
There=92s too much at stake this election. We can=92t look back, and ask ou=
rselves what more could we have done. We need to go out there and do it!

I would now like to turn this call over to Pratt Wiley, the DNC=92s Nationa=
l Director of Voter Expansion.

Pratt Wiley, National Director of Voter Expansion

Democrats believe that we solve our nation=92s problems with more democracy=
, not less. The Democratic National Committee=92s Voter Expansion Project r=
eflects our commitment to ensuring every eligible citizen is able to regist=
er, every registered voter is able to vote, and every vote is accurately co=
unted.

But the opposite seems to be true for the Republican Party. Republicans hav=
e been following the same playbook =96 in North Carolina, Arizona, Wisconsi=
n, Ohio, Florida and beyond =96 to tilt elections in their favor. Republica=
n-controlled state legislatures across the country are passing restrictive =
voting laws that make it harder for women, minorities, and students to vote=
. These groups are not only the Democrat=92s core constituency =96 they are=
 also the majority of Americans.

Voter impersonation =96 the type of conduct that photo IDs are supposed to =
eliminate =96 is virtually non-existent. A comprehensive study found only 3=
1 instances of voter impersonation in over 1 billion votes casts =96 that=
=92s twice as rare as a shark attack. These facts, however, are not stoppin=
g the GOP from seeking a solution to a problem that just doesn=92t exist.

Former Senator Jim DeMint, who now leads the ultra-conservative Heritage Fo=
undation, recently admitted that voter ID laws help elect =93more conservat=
ive candidates.=94

In April, students at the Marquette University polling station faced two ho=
ur wait times to vote. Many still stood in line well after the polls offici=
al closed and the race was called. At the same time, a Republican Wisconsin=
 Congressman bragged to reporters that the state=92s restrictive photo ID l=
aw would help the GOP defeat Democrats in the fall.

In Texas, Senator Ted Cruz filed an amicus brief in support of Texas=92 res=
trictive photo ID law. Cruz wears his opposition to voting rights as a badg=
e of honor. In 2012, he voiced his opposition to a key provision of the lan=
dmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. He also led the fight as Texas Solicitor G=
eneral to limit voter registration efforts in communities of color, vigorou=
sly defending a discriminatory law against a civil rights lawsuit.

And we all remember just four years ago when the Pennsylvania Republican Ho=
use Leader announced that the state=92s restrictive photo ID law was =91gon=
na allow Governor Romney to win the State of Pennsylvania.=92

It=92s not hard to see that this is a part of a cynical political ploy to b=
oast the Republican=92s electoral success this fall.
While Democrats have gone to court in Arizona to reverse the culture of dis=
crimination and disenfranchisement, Republicans are going to court to defen=
d laws designed to decrease voter turnout =96 because that is their only pa=
th to victory.

As mentioned by our distinguished speakers, the DNC and Democrats across th=
e nation will not waver in defending the right to vote =96 the most fundame=
ntal of all of our rights.

Again, I want to thank everyone for joining us and I would now like to open=
 the call to questions.
