(on Trump)  "There are six months until election day and I'm confident president will spend many of those days making a strong case about the progress the country has made in the past seven years. ... It is undeniable our country is stronger, our economy is stronger than it was eight year ago. The question voters will have to ask themselves is do we want to scrap the strategy that has worked so effectively or do we want to build on the progress that we made?"
Earnest called a contested Dem primary unlikely. He said Obama did not have a reaction to Cruz dropping out of the GOP race and said he was confident Obama did not watch the election results come in last night
