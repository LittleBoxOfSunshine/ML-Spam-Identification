Dear Luis,

It was a pleasure to meet you and Debbie at the Alaska Democratic =
Convention dinner last week. Did you get the DVD copy of =
=E2=80=9CStatehood!=E2=80=9D that I left for you at the Historic =
Anchorage Hotel?

In our brief conversation Debbie seemed fascinated to learn about the =
critical and decisive role played by then-Senate Majority Leader, Lyndon =
Baines Johnson and Speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn in securing passage =
of the Alaska Statehood Act. Their important role is little known today, =
even up here.

I=E2=80=99d be flattered if someday Debbie viewed the entire two-hour =
show. However, understanding that she=E2=80=99s going to have little =
time for non-critical tasks these days, may I suggest that she can use =
the Chapter Menu at the opening of the DVD program to jump right to =
sections that cover passage of the Bill and the Texans=E2=80=99 role in =
it.

First there is a brief discussion of the political backdrop created by =
the national Civil Rights movement and Dixiecrat opposition to Alaska =
statehood. Find this by selecting =E2=80=9CPart One Chapter Menu,=E2=80=9D=
 then Chapter 13: =E2=80=9CDixiecrats.=E2=80=9D The story quickly moves =
on to President Eisenhower=E2=80=99s ambivalence about statehood.

Passage of the Alaska Statehood Act and the role of Johnson and Rayburn =
spans three chapters, found in the =E2=80=9CPart Two Chapter Menu;=E2=80=9D=
 19, 20 and 21, which combined run about seven minutes.

If viewing these chapters only, you should know that Bob Bartlett, whom =
they reference several times, was the Territory=E2=80=99s (voteless) =
Democratic, Delegate to Congress, who was enormously popular and =
surprisingly effective in the House.

In telling the Alaska statehood story objectively there was no way to =
avoid the conclusion that Alaska Democrats started the push for =
statehood and led it all the way to victory. At the national level the =
same was true.

Best regards,

Larry Goldin
