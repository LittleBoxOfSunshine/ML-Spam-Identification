The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Ernest --

We're 62 days from the start of our convention in
Philadelphia, where we'll nominate the 45th President of the
United States -- and Democrats have every reason to feel
optimistic about the future of our party.

For starters, we have two outstanding candidates running for
president. And even as the Republicans' presumptive nominee
starts to gather support from GOP leaders like Mitch
McConnell and special interest groups like the NRA, the
truth is that Donald Trump is the most unqualified
presidential candidate in the history of modern American
politics. So I feel pretty darn good about either of our
candidates defeating Trump in November.

Secondly and most importantly, Ernest, we have you.

You're one of millions of Democrats from all corners of the
country who refuse to let Republicans take us backwards. So
much of the success that we've achieved happened because
grassroots supporters like you stepped up in moments like
this and did whatever it took so we could elect Democrats up
and down the ballot -- and with all the progress we've made
under President Obama at stake in this election, your
support has never been more important than it is right now.
That's why I'm asking for your help today:

https://my.democrats.org/May-2016-Deadline

I'm confident that by the time Election Day comes, we will
have gotten our message out so that every American
understands how important putting another Democrat in the
White House is to keeping our country moving forward. But we
can't take anything for granted, Ernest -- so before our
end-of-May deadline, pitch in $3 or more to help make sure
we beat Donald Trump and the Republicans supporting him in
November:

https://my.democrats.org/May-2016-Deadline

Thanks so much, Ernest.

All the best,
