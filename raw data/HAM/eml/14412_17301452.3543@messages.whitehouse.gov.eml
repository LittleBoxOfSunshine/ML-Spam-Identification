THE WHITE HOUSE



Office of the Press Secretary



________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release May 4, 2016





PRESS GAGGLE

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



Aboard Air Force One

En Route Flint, Michigan







11:13 A.M. EDT



MR. EARNEST: Why dont I just give you a little bit of a rundown on the da=
y, and then we can go into your questions.



The President is joined on the plane today by a couple of members of the =
Michigan congressional delegation. So Congressman Debbie Dingell and Cong=
ressman Dan Kildee are on board. There are also senior administration off=
icials who have been playing an important role in responding to the situa=
tion in Flint also on board. Those are Secretary of HHS Sylvia Burwell, t=
he Administrator of the EPA, Gina McCarthy, and Dr. Nicole Lurie, who is =
an assistant secretary at Health and Human Services. She has been the lea=
d federal official on the ground in Flint as weve coordinated a significa=
nt federal response to this situation.



When we arrive in Flint, we anticipate that Governor Snyder and Mayor Wea=
ver will both be on the ground to welcome the President to Michigan. The =
President will first head to a location -- this food bank in Flint that h=
as been a hub of activity in providing some needed relief and supplies to=
 citizens in Flint. While there, the President will meet with a wide rang=
e of federal officials who have been working on the ground to coordinate =
the federal response. The President will receive a briefing about that fe=
deral response. Both Mayor Weaver and Governor Snyder will participate in=
 that meeting, because the focus of our efforts has not just been to mobi=
lize federal resources, but to ensure that they have been effectively int=
egrated with the resources that have been mobilized by state and local of=
ficials, as well. Youll have an opportunity to hear from the President du=
ring that meeting, either before or after. Im not sure if that spray will=
 be at the top or the bottom.



From there, well travel to a local high school where the President will h=
ave an opportunity to sit down and visit with six or eight members of the=
 community to talk to a cross-section of the community about how theyve b=
een affected by the situation. And well do a brief pool spray there so yo=
u can at least get photographs of the President doing that meeting.



From there, the President will then deliver remarks to about 1,000 people=
 from the community that will be in attendance at his speech. And that wi=
ll be the end of the day, and then well head back.=20



So thats what were looking at. I think the message that you can anticipat=
e from the President is something that will be familiar to all of you. Th=
e President will make a strong case that he cares deeply about the challe=
nges facing the community of Flint. He will make clear that America is st=
rongest when were looking out for one another and that we have an obligat=
ion as a country to look out for everybody, including people in Flint who=
 are dealing with some pretty tough circumstances even before there was t=
hese significant problems exposed in their water system.



So the President will make clear once again that this administration will=
 continue to help mobilize resources necessary that will allow Flint to r=
ecover and come back stronger than ever. And hell be focused on that even=
 after broader national attention moves on to other things.



Q Can I ask you about -- you said 1,000 people. I mean, that seems more l=
ike a rally or some sort. I mean, who are the people, and how come so man=
y? What are you trying to do with that crowd?



MR. EARNEST: Well, the goal of the Presidents visit is for the President =
to deliver a message to the people in the community there. And we wanted =
to find a venue that would allow as many people as possible from the comm=
unity in Flint to hear from their President firsthand, and to hear from t=
heir President directly.=20



And so hell obviously have an opportunity to have a conversation with mem=
bers of the community in a smaller setting, but we also wanted to provide=
 a setting where the President could deliver a message in person to the p=
eople of Flint.



Q And do you know how the tickets were distributed or who got the tickets=
?



MR. EARNEST: I dont, but we can get you some more information about that.=




Q So there were a bunch of folks in a story that we posted on our website=
 earlier today from the community that one of my colleagues talked to -- =
very critical of the EPA and the federal government as much as they are o=
f the state government, as well. One woman was asked about President Obam=
a coming and she said, Great, that sounds wonderful, bring a check. And v=
ery frustrated that they dont have the resources to deal with the situati=
on. Whats his answer to that, and to that frustration generally?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think considering that many of the people in this co=
mmunity were serving poisoned water to their children for a year and a ha=
lf or two years, their frustration is entirely justified. And I think the=
 President is going to make clear that this isnt just an isolated inciden=
t of mismanagement. This also is reflective -- or this also reflects the =
dangers of government at all levels losing touch with the people that the=
y were elected to serve.



 And I think it is evident from the administrations response that the Pre=
sident is quite serious about making sure that the federal government is =
living up to its obligations to our citizens. We need Congress to take so=
me common-sense steps here to make sure that the people of Flint and the =
state of Michigan has the resources it needs to address this problem.=20



 Thus far we've seen Republicans in Congress not act as aggressively as t=
hey should to respond to this situation. There is more that Congress need=
s to do, and there is a role for Congress to play. And the commission tha=
t was established by the Governor to take a look at this situation ascrib=
ed almost all of the blame to failures by state regulators. And this is n=
ot an exercise in finger pointing, but an exercise in asserting the respo=
nsibility that everybody has to make sure that the people of Flint have a=
n opportunity to get back on their feet.



 Q Yesterday, Governor Snyder called on the President to drink the water =
while hes in Flint. If he does decide to do that, does it send the wrong =
message that things are kind of okay?



 MR. EARNEST: No, I don't think -- look, I don't think theres anybody tha=
t thinks that whats been happening in Flint is okay. I think what is true=
 is that there have been important steps that have been taken -- both by =
state and federal officials -- that have made the water safe to drink if =
its been properly filtered.



 And that's why you've had federal officials including from FEMA, but als=
o a number of state officials, including law enforcement passing out wate=
r filters to people in the community so they can get access to clean, dri=
nkable water. The President will follow the advice of our scientists and =
experts about whether or not the water is safe to drink. And the EPA and =
state regulators have both indicated that properly filtered water is safe=
 to drink.=20



 I don't know if the President is going to drink any filtered water in Fl=
int or not, but he wont be avoiding it because its not necessary for him =
to do so. The water is safe to drink if its been properly filtered.



 Q How does the President plan to keep the attention on Flint and the aid=
 flowing after the cameras leave?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, he certainly has given very clear instructions to his=
 team that follow-through here is going to be critical. And over the last=
 three months or so, I think we've seen quite effective follow-through on=
 the part of federal officials. Nine million liters of water has been dis=
tributed. Hundreds of thousands of filters and filter cartridges have bee=
n distributed through the community. Those are resources that were mobili=
zed largely by the federal government. You've seen steps taken by the Dep=
artment of Health and Human Services to expand access to Medicaid to ensu=
re that people can get access to health care up to the age of 21. They've=
 increased funding for community health centers to make sure that those n=
ew patients have doctors that they can see and facilities where those exa=
ms can be conducted.=20



 So an aggressive federal response on the part of this administration has=
 been mobilized. Its had an impact and an important impact, a positive on=
e. The President is proud of that. But this is a situation that shouldnt =
have existed in the first place. And the President wants to have a discus=
sion about what we can do to make sure that situations like Flint don't c=
rop up in other communities.



 I can tell you the President does not believe that eliminating the EPA, =
for example, is going to prevent this from happening in other places. We =
need an EPA that's properly funded and that's functioning effectively and=
 properly coordinating with state-level officials to protect our air and =
water. Eliminating that agency, as many Republicans advocate, is not goin=
g to contribute to that goal. I think we can all agree on that.



 Q So, Josh, in terms of new resources, the administration has done as mu=
ch as it can right now?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, as I pointed out, the administration has mobilized si=
gnificant resources. We've expedited infrastructure funding that could be=
 used by the state of Michigan to benefit people in Flint. Millions of do=
llars in emergency relief has been provided -- both in the form of person=
nel who were working on the ground, but also in the form of bottled water=
 and medical supplies, and water filters -- all of which reflects the res=
ources of the American people, making sure that an American community is =
not left behind.=20



 But there is more that needs to be done to address the root problem here=
. And the President is committed to following through in pressing for tho=
se solutions and pressing Congress to provide the necessary funding for t=
hose solutions. Thus far Republicans in Congress have blocked the kind of=
 robust response that is clearly necessary.=20



 Q Josh, Trump?



 MR. EARNEST: Ive heard of him.=20



 Q Any comment on last night? Hes the Republican nominee according to Rei=
nce Priebus. And this sort of frees the President up to start saying what=
 he wants to say about him, right?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, there is no denying that the President will have an a=
ctive role in the general election. There continues to be a -- there are =
additional contests ahead, particularly on the Democratic side. And there=
 are six months until Election Day. And Im confident that the President w=
ill spend many of those days between now and Election Day making a strong=
 case about the progress that our country has made over the last seven ye=
ars.=20



It was President Ronald Reagan who laid out the central question that vot=
ers should ask themselves when they walk into the polling place: Are you =
better off than you were four years ago?=20



I think it is undeniable that our country is stronger, our economy is str=
onger, is safer than it was eight years ago. And so the question that vot=
ers will have to ask themselves is, do we want to scrap the strategy that=
's worked so effectively, or do we want to build on the progress that we'=
ve made. And based on the amount of time and energy that President Obama =
has invested in avoiding a second Great Depression and rescuing the auto =
industry, growing our economy from the middle out, investing in job train=
ing, cutting taxes and making tax cuts permanent for middle-class familie=
s, and raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, mobilizing the internat=
ional community to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and to a=
ct to fight climate change -- I think the President's record is clear. An=
d the President is going to be eager not just to defend that record, but =
also to advocate that the American people elect a 45th President that's c=
ommitted to building on that progress.



 Q Is the White House concerned at all that the Democratic frontrunner, H=
illary Clinton, continues to lose states this late in the Democratic prim=
ary? I mean, is this a sign that there's any weaknesses going into obviou=
sly what's going to be a tough battle against probably Donald Trump?



 MR. EARNEST: Look, in each of these states, there are competitive contes=
ts. And that's been the case for a couple of months now. I think what is =
-- there are a number of conclusions that can be drawn about that process=
. I think an important one is that in every state that we have seen, exit=
 polls indicate that Democratic voters have been excited and motivated by=
 the choices that are on the ballot for them. The exit polls of Republica=
n voters tell a different story. And I think that's a consequence of the =
different kinds of campaigns that have been waged by candidates in the tw=
o parties.



 But look, ultimately the voters are going to have to draw their own conc=
lusions. But there's no denying that the competitive Democratic contest h=
as had a positive effect in engaging and motivating and exciting Democrat=
ic voters all across the country.



 Q Josh, even if it goes to a contested convention, would the President s=
upport something like a contested convention? Do you think that would be =
healthy for the party to keep the competition all the way to the finish?



 MR. EARNEST: Most of the analysis that I have seen has indicated that th=
at is not at all likely to happen.



 Q What was the President's reaction to Senator Cruz dropping out last ni=
ght?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont think that he had one.



 Q He didnt have one, or you dont know what it is?



 MR. EARNEST: I'd be surprised if he had one.



 Q Do you think he was watching the results come in, or watching sports?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm confident that he was not watching the results come in.=




 Q On Syria, does the President have any plans to call President Putin ab=
out maybe pushing al-Assad to go a little softer on the opposition?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any phone calls with President Putin=
 that are planned. If one does get scheduled, we'll let you know after it=
 has occurred. The President has had a number of occasions just over the =
last three or four months to strongly impress upon President Putin the ne=
ed to persuade the Assad regime to live up to the commitments that they m=
ade in the context of a cessation of hostilities and engage constructivel=
y in the political talks that are being led by the U.N.=20



 Fortunately, President Obama did succeed in persuading President Putin t=
o intervene, and that's why we saw for several weeks the successful imple=
mentation of a cessation of hostilities that many people were skeptical a=
bout. So President Putin did it once before. He should do it again.=20

=20

 Q Josh, when we get back from this trip, the President will be appearing=
 tonight at a gala for Asian Pacific Islanders. And it's a pretty large g=
roup, and I'm just wondering if the President has a specific message that=
 he wants to deliver tonight. And this is not a group that's often talked=
 about -- sort of as political prowess on national elections. I'm wonderi=
ng if he's going to deliver a message about getting involved in the elect=
ion cycle, really try to talk about the political season at all, or wheth=
er it's a different kind of message.



 MR. EARNEST: Look, I think the President will primarily focus on the imp=
ortant role that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make to our countr=
y. And this is primarily an opportunity to honor those public servants wh=
o have not just represented that community but served our country in an i=
mportant way. Look, what's also undeniable is that the fastest-growing vo=
ting bloc in America are actually Asian Americans.=20



 So I think you could anticipate that the President will also make a stro=
ng case that the values that he's been fighting for over the last seven y=
ears, and the progress that we've made over the last seven years has cert=
ainly benefitted Asian Americans all across the country. And that's a rec=
ord to be proud of. It's certainly a record that the President is proud o=
f, but it's also a record that Democrats in Congress can be proud of.



 Q Josh, Congressman Kildee is on the plane. He's been trying to facilita=
te a meeting between Amir Hekmati, whos from Flint -- one of the Iranian =
hostages that was released -- and the President. Do you know if they're g=
oing to encounter each other today at all?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of a plan for a meeting like that to occur. B=
ut I'll keep my eye out and see if I can give you a head's up if it does =
happen. Obviously, administration officials have been in frequent touch w=
ith the Hekmati family, both leading up to -- both in the years that he w=
as held in captivity, but also in the immediate aftermath of his release.=
 But I'm not aware of a plan for that kind of meeting to occur on this tr=
ip.



 Q What about Little Miss Flint? Is she going to be at the roundtable?



 MR. EARNEST: Little Miss Flint will be participating in today's events, =
and the President is looking forward to the opportunity to meet her and t=
o convey to her how inspired he was by her letter. This is a little girl =
who has taken action to defend her community. And I think that's an examp=
le I think that we all can at least take note of, if not follow.



 Thank you, guys.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">11:13 A.M. EDT<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Why do=
n&#8217;t I just give you a little bit of a rundown on the day, and then we=
 can go into your questions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The President is joined o=
n the plane today by a couple of members of the Michigan congressional dele=
gation.&nbsp; So Congressman Debbie Dingell and Congressman Dan Kildee are =
on board.&nbsp; There are also senior administration
 officials who have been playing an important role in responding to the sit=
uation in Flint also on board.&nbsp; Those are Secretary of HHS Sylvia Burw=
ell, the Administrator of the EPA, Gina McCarthy, and Dr. Nicole Lurie, who=
 is an assistant secretary at Health
 and Human Services.&nbsp; She has been the lead federal official on the gr=
ound in Flint as we&#8217;ve coordinated a significant federal response to =
this situation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">When we arrive in Flint, =
we anticipate that Governor Snyder and Mayor Weaver will both be on the gro=
und to welcome the President to Michigan.&nbsp; The President will first he=
ad to a location -- this food bank in Flint
 that has been a hub of activity in providing some needed relief and suppli=
es to citizens in Flint.&nbsp; While there, the President will meet with a =
wide range of federal officials who have been working on the ground to coor=
dinate the federal response.&nbsp; The President
 will receive a briefing about that federal response.&nbsp; Both Mayor Weav=
er and Governor Snyder will participate in that meeting, because the focus =
of our efforts has not just been to mobilize federal resources, but to ensu=
re that they have been effectively integrated
 with the resources that have been mobilized by state and local officials, =
as well.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll have an opportunity to hear from the President =
during that meeting, either before or after.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure if th=
at spray will be at the top or the bottom.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">From there, we&#8217;ll t=
ravel to a local high school where the President will have an opportunity t=
o sit down and visit with six or eight members of the community to talk to =
a cross-section of the community about how
 they&#8217;ve been affected by the situation.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll do a b=
rief pool spray there so you can at least get photographs of the President =
doing that meeting.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">From there, the President=
 will then deliver remarks to about 1,000 people from the community that wi=
ll be in attendance at his speech.&nbsp; And that will be the end of the da=
y, and then we&#8217;ll head back.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that&#8217;s what we&#=
8217;re looking at.&nbsp; I think the message that you can anticipate from =
the President is something that will be familiar to all of you.&nbsp; The P=
resident will make a strong case that he cares deeply about
 the challenges facing the community of Flint.&nbsp; He will make clear tha=
t America is strongest when we&#8217;re looking out for one another and tha=
t we have an obligation as a country to look out for everybody, including p=
eople in Flint who are dealing with some pretty
 tough circumstances even before there was these significant problems expos=
ed in their water system.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the President will mak=
e clear once again that this administration will continue to help mobilize =
resources necessary that will allow Flint to recover and come back stronger=
 than ever.&nbsp; And he&#8217;ll be focused on
 that even after broader national attention moves on to other things.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I=
 ask you about -- you said 1,000 people.&nbsp; I mean, that seems more like=
 a rally or some sort.&nbsp; I mean, who are the people, and how come so ma=
ny?&nbsp; What are you trying to do with that crowd?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
the goal of the President&#8217;s visit is for the President to deliver a m=
essage to the people in the community there.&nbsp; And we wanted to find a =
venue that would allow as many people as possible from
 the community in Flint to hear from their President firsthand, and to hear=
 from their President directly.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so he&#8217;ll obviou=
sly have an opportunity to have a conversation with members of the communit=
y in a smaller setting, but we also wanted to provide a setting where the P=
resident could deliver a message in person
 to the people of Flint.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And d=
o you know how the tickets were distributed or who got the tickets?<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&=
#8217;t, but we can get you some more information about that.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So th=
ere were a bunch of folks in a story that we posted on our website earlier =
today from the community that one of my colleagues talked to -- very critic=
al of the EPA and the federal government as much as
 they are of the state government, as well.&nbsp; One woman was asked about=
 President Obama coming and she said, &#8220;Great, that sounds wonderful, =
bring a check.&#8221;&nbsp; And very frustrated that they don&#8217;t have =
the resources to deal with the situation.&nbsp; What&#8217;s his answer
 to that, and to that frustration generally?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think considering that many of the people in this community were serving =
poisoned water to their children for a year and a half or two years, their =
frustration is entirely justified.&nbsp; And I
 think the President is going to make clear that this isn&#8217;t just an i=
solated incident of mismanagement.&nbsp; This also is reflective -- or this=
 also reflects the dangers of government at all levels
<a name=3D"_GoBack"></a>losing touch with the people that they were elected=
 to serve.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think it is evident f=
rom the administration&#8217;s response that the President is quite serious=
 about making sure that the federal government is living up to its obligati=
ons to our citizens.&nbsp; We need Congress to take some common-sense
 steps here to make sure that the people of Flint and the state of Michigan=
 has the resources it needs to address this problem.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far we've seen Republi=
cans in Congress not act as aggressively as they should to respond to this =
situation.&nbsp; There is more that Congress needs to do, and there is a ro=
le for Congress to play.&nbsp; And the commission that was established
 by the Governor to take a look at this situation ascribed almost all of th=
e blame to failures by state regulators.&nbsp; And this is not an exercise =
in finger pointing, but an exercise in asserting the responsibility that ev=
erybody has to make sure that the people
 of Flint have an opportunity to get back on their feet.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterd=
ay, Governor Snyder called on the President to drink the water while he&#82=
17;s in Flint.&nbsp; If he does decide to do that, does it send the wrong m=
essage that things are kind of okay?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, I do=
n't think -- look, I don't think there&#8217;s anybody that thinks that wha=
t&#8217;s been happening in Flint is okay.&nbsp; I think what is true is th=
at there have been important steps that have been taken -- both by state an=
d
 federal officials -- that have made the water safe to drink if it&#8217;s =
been properly filtered.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's why you've had f=
ederal officials including from FEMA, but also a number of state officials,=
 including law enforcement passing out water filters to people in the commu=
nity so they can get access to clean, drinkable water.&nbsp;
 The President will follow the advice of our scientists and experts about w=
hether or not the water is safe to drink.&nbsp; And the EPA and state regul=
ators have both indicated that properly filtered water is safe to drink.&nb=
sp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if the Preside=
nt is going to drink any filtered water in Flint or not, but he won&#8217;t=
 be avoiding it because it&#8217;s not necessary for him to do so.&nbsp; Th=
e water is safe to drink if it&#8217;s been properly filtered.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How doe=
s the President plan to keep the attention on Flint and the aid flowing aft=
er the cameras leave?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, he=
 certainly has given very clear instructions to his team that follow-throug=
h here is going to be critical.&nbsp; And over the last three months or so,=
 I think we've seen quite effective follow-through on the part of
 federal officials.&nbsp; Nine million liters of water has been distributed=
.&nbsp; Hundreds of thousands of filters and filter cartridges have been di=
stributed through the community.&nbsp; Those are resources that were mobili=
zed largely by the federal government.&nbsp; You've
 seen steps taken by the Department of Health and Human Services to expand =
access to Medicaid to ensure that people can get access to health care up t=
o the age of 21.&nbsp; They've increased funding for community health cente=
rs to make sure that those new patients
 have doctors that they can see and facilities where those exams can be con=
ducted.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So an aggressive federal re=
sponse on the part of this administration has been mobilized.&nbsp; It&#821=
7;s had an impact and an important impact, a positive one.&nbsp; The Presid=
ent is proud of that.&nbsp; But this is a situation that shouldn&#8217;t ha=
ve existed
 in the first place.&nbsp; And the President wants to have a discussion abo=
ut what we can do to make sure that situations like Flint don't crop up in =
other communities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can tell you the Presiden=
t does not believe that eliminating the EPA, for example, is going to preve=
nt this from happening in other places.&nbsp; We need an EPA that's properl=
y funded and that's functioning effectively and properly coordinating
 with state-level officials to protect our air and water.&nbsp; Eliminating=
 that agency, as many Republicans advocate, is not going to contribute to t=
hat goal.&nbsp; I think we can all agree on that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Jos=
h, in terms of new resources, the administration has done as much as it can=
 right now?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, as=
 I pointed out, the administration has mobilized significant resources.&nbs=
p; We've expedited infrastructure funding that could be used by the state o=
f Michigan to benefit people in Flint.&nbsp; Millions of dollars in emergen=
cy
 relief has been provided -- both in the form of personnel who were working=
 on the ground, but also in the form of bottled water and medical supplies,=
 and water filters -- all of which reflects the resources of the American p=
eople, making sure that an American
 community is not left behind.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is more that need=
s to be done to address the root problem here.&nbsp; And the President is c=
ommitted to following through in pressing for those solutions and pressing =
Congress to provide the necessary funding for those solutions.&nbsp;
 Thus far Republicans in Congress have blocked the kind of robust response =
that is clearly necessary.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, T=
rump?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#8217;=
ve heard of him.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any com=
ment on last night?&nbsp; He&#8217;s the Republican nominee according to Re=
ince Priebus.&nbsp; And this sort of frees the President up to start saying=
 what he wants to say about him, right?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
ere is no denying that the President will have an active role in the genera=
l election.&nbsp; There continues to be a -- there are additional contests =
ahead, particularly on the Democratic side.&nbsp; And there are six months
 until Election Day.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m confident that the President will =
spend many of those days between now and Election Day making a strong case =
about the progress that our country has made over the last seven years.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">It was President Ronald R=
eagan who laid out the central question that voters should ask themselves w=
hen they walk into the polling place:&nbsp; Are you better off than you wer=
e four years ago?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think it is undeniable =
that our country is stronger, our economy is stronger, is safer than it was=
 eight years ago.&nbsp; And so the question that voters will have to ask th=
emselves is, do we want to scrap the strategy
 that's worked so effectively, or do we want to build on the progress that =
we've made.&nbsp; And based on the amount of time and energy that President=
 Obama has invested in avoiding a second Great Depression and rescuing the =
auto industry, growing our economy from
 the middle out, investing in job training, cutting taxes and making tax cu=
ts permanent for middle-class families, and raising taxes on the wealthiest=
 Americans, mobilizing the international community to prevent Iran from obt=
aining a nuclear weapon, and to
 act to fight climate change -- I think the President's record is clear.&nb=
sp; And the President is going to be eager not just to defend that record, =
but also to advocate that the American people elect a 45th President that's=
 committed to building on that progress.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the =
White House concerned at all that the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clint=
on, continues to lose states this late in the Democratic primary?&nbsp; I m=
ean, is this a sign that there's any weaknesses going into obviously what's
 going to be a tough battle against probably Donald Trump?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Look, in=
 each of these states, there are competitive contests. &nbsp;And that's bee=
n the case for a couple of months now.&nbsp; I think what is -- there are a=
 number of conclusions that can be drawn about that process.&nbsp; I think
 an important one is that in every state that we have seen, exit polls indi=
cate that Democratic voters have been excited and motivated by the choices =
that are on the ballot for them.&nbsp; The exit polls of Republican voters =
tell a different story.&nbsp; And I think
 that's a consequence of the different kinds of campaigns that have been wa=
ged by candidates in the two parties.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But look, ultimately the vo=
ters are going to have to draw their own conclusions.&nbsp; But there's no =
denying that the competitive Democratic contest has had a positive effect i=
n engaging and motivating and exciting Democratic voters all

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, e=
ven if it goes to a contested convention, would the President support somet=
hing like a contested convention?&nbsp; Do you think that would be healthy =
for the party to keep the competition all the way to the finish?<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Most of =
the analysis that I have seen has indicated that that is not at all likely =
to happen.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What wa=
s the President's reaction to Senator Cruz dropping out last night?<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t think that he had one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn=
&#8217;t have one, or you don&#8217;t know what it is?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'd be s=
urprised if he had one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you =
think he was watching the results come in, or watching sports?<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm conf=
ident that he was not watching the results come in.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Syri=
a, does the President have any plans to call President Putin about maybe pu=
shing al-Assad to go a little softer on the opposition?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'=
m not aware of any phone calls with President Putin that are planned.&nbsp;=
 If one does get scheduled, we'll let you know after it has occurred.&nbsp;=
 The President has had a number of occasions just over the last three
 or four months to strongly impress upon President Putin the need to persua=
de the Assad regime to live up to the commitments that they made in the con=
text of a cessation of hostilities and engage constructively in the politic=
al talks that are being led by the
 U.N. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, President Obam=
a did succeed in persuading President Putin to intervene, and that's why we=
 saw for several weeks the successful implementation of a cessation of host=
ilities that many people were skeptical about.&nbsp; So President
 Putin did it once before.&nbsp; He should do it again.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, w=
hen we get back from this trip, the President will be appearing tonight at =
a gala for Asian Pacific Islanders.&nbsp; And it's a pretty large group, an=
d I'm just wondering if the President has a specific message that he wants
 to deliver tonight.&nbsp; And this is not a group that's often talked abou=
t -- sort of as political prowess on national elections.&nbsp; I'm wonderin=
g if he's going to deliver a message about getting involved in the election=
 cycle, really try to talk about the political
 season at all, or whether it's a different kind of message.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Look, I =
think the President will primarily focus on the important role that Asian A=
mericans and Pacific Islanders make to our country.&nbsp; And this is prima=
rily an opportunity to honor those public servants who have not
 just represented that community but served our country in an important way=
.&nbsp; Look, what's also undeniable is that the fastest-growing voting blo=
c in America are actually Asian Americans.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think you could antici=
pate that the President will also make a strong case that the values that h=
e's been fighting for over the last seven years, and the progress that we'v=
e made over the last seven years has certainly benefitted
 Asian Americans all across the country.&nbsp; And that's a record to be pr=
oud of.&nbsp; It's certainly a record that the President is proud of, but i=
t's also a record that Democrats in Congress can be proud of.<o:p></o:p></p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, C=
ongressman Kildee is on the plane.&nbsp; He's been trying to facilitate a m=
eeting between Amir Hekmati, who&#8217;s from Flint -- one of the Iranian h=
ostages that was released -- and the President.&nbsp; Do you know if they'r=
e going to
 encounter each other today at all?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
aware of a plan for a meeting like that to occur.&nbsp; But I'll keep my ey=
e out and see if I can give you a head's up if it does happen.&nbsp; Obviou=
sly, administration officials have been in frequent touch with the Hekmati
 family, both leading up to -- both in the years that he was held in captiv=
ity, but also in the immediate aftermath of his release.&nbsp; But I'm not =
aware of a plan for that kind of meeting to occur on this trip.<o:p></o:p><=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What ab=
out Little Miss Flint?&nbsp; Is she going to be at the roundtable?<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Little M=
iss Flint will be participating in today's events, and the President is loo=
king forward to the opportunity to meet her and to convey to her how inspir=
ed he was by her letter.&nbsp; This is a little girl who has taken
 action to defend her community.&nbsp; And I think that's an example I thin=
k that we all can at least take note of, if not follow.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, guys.<o:p></o:p>=
