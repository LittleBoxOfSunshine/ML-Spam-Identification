ge_id=3D12867893&user_id=3DDKMEDIA_5&jobid=3D33768812=0A=0DThe Nonprofit Bo=
ard of Directors Training Series=20

A comprehensive, self-paced training tool to provide your board of director=
s with the knowledge and skills they need to better handle their responsibi=
lities and work cooperatively towards your mission

A productive board of directors is key to achieving your nonprofit's missio=
n. In addition to their fiduciary responsibilities, board members are your =
representative to the community, attracting volunteers, publicity, and most=
 importantly fundraising dollars. Board members also serve administrative r=
oles such as strategic planning and budgeting and ensure that your operatio=
ns can be carried out smoothly. While your board members all have impressiv=
e backgrounds, they may not be familiar with the responsibilities of being =
a board member. Your task is to bring your board up to speed as quickly as =
possible and to make sure the entire board is aligned when it comes to the =
direction you want to head.

The Nonprofit Board of Directors Training Series, in five self-paced CDs, p=
rovides new and experienced board members with the training they need to un=
derstand their role and work cohesively to accomplish their goals.=20

Topics covered include:

Board member fundamentals: roles and responsibilities.
Financial fundamentals for board members.
Fundraising.
Fiduciary responsibilities of board members.
Ensuring sustainability through strategic planning and evaluations.
And much more!

Five Comprehensive Sessions!=20

Five CD presentations with accompanying slides.
Simple, clear, concise courses.

You can prioritize the order in which the topics are assigned.=20
Adaptable for training individuals or your board as a group.

le.

WHAT YOU'LL LEARN
	=09
The Nonprofit Board of Directors Training Series includes five separate CDs=
, each comprised of a full audio presentation and easy-to-follow presentati=
on slides. The CDs may be distributed to each of your board members for ind=
ependent use.=20

The following is a brief overview of the contents of each CD presentation:

1. Board Member Fundamentals: Roles and Responsibilities

Nonprofit organizations encompass a wide range of services, missions, value=
s, budgets, size and scope. While their purpose and how they accomplish the=
ir work varies, the roles and responsibilities of their board members share=
 many commonalities. This session focuses on the obligations board members =
have and the opportunities to use their time and talents to lead their nonp=
rofits to success.

10 basic roles and responsibilities of board members
Understanding the nonprofit governance process and structure
Key competencies for sharing your nonprofit's story
Board-chief executive relationships

2. Financial Fundamentals for Board Members

One of the most important roles nonprofit board members have is that of pro=
viding responsible financial oversight and ensuring adequate resources for =
their organization. This means that each board member must understand and k=
eep track of the budget, cash flow, reserves, and long and short range need=
s, and also ensure acceptable accounting practices are in place. This sessi=
on focuses on key aspects of safeguarding the economic engine including:

Board and staff responsibilities and roles
Defining accounting terms and processes
Understanding basic financial reports
Using financial knowledge for operational planning and budgeting
Recommendations for establishing budget guidelines, priorities and goals

3. Fundraising

A key responsibility of every board member is not only participation in the=
 organization's fundraising and related activities but also elevating such =
efforts in order to further the nonprofit's mission. This involves developi=
ng and implementing skills relating to:

Community involvement
Working with local businesses and individual donors
Identifying fundraising sources and creating donors
Event planning
Strategic fundraising methods

4. Fiduciary Responsibilities of Board Members

Board members have broad fiduciary responsibilities to the organization and=
 its beneficiaries. A comprehensive understanding of such duties is paramou=
nt to ensuring that sound practices are in place. Examples of the topics th=
at are covered include:

Duty of Care, Duty of Loyalty, and Duty of Obedience
Adherence to applicable laws
Director and officer liability insurance
Policy development
Implementing effective internal controls

5. Ensuring Sustainability through Strategic Planning and Evaluations

Nonprofit board members are responsible for setting the strategic direction=
 for their organization and ensuring that the activities carried out suppor=
t and advance the mission. Effective strategic planning requires timely and=
 accurate information as to what the organization is doing well - and what =
needs attention. Planning and evaluation is not an annual event for success=
ful nonprofits. Instead, it is woven into its ongoing governance activities=
. This session examines core competencies necessary to fulfill these respon=
sibilities including understanding:

The value of a strong mission and purpose
How to develop the organization's roadmap to success
What strategic planning is and why it is critical
The importance of evaluation as part of the strategic planning process
Strategies for choosing performance measures that provide you with the info=
rmation needed to make decisions
