A couple of flags on the Trump Jr. piece. The first one we could do a hit o=
n or tweet the snippet of video.

Asking it Trump saying he would build a wall and deport 11 million immigran=
ts, is that playing a part or to be taken literally. No, I think that's to =
be taken literally. Everyone jumps on the bandwagon after he says it. It's =
a winning idea.

Talking about the PA delegate process he goes on to say the system is archa=
ic and made sense 200 years ago when everyone lived on a farm in the middle=
 of nowhere.

>> Ted Cruz launched a web video this week attacking your father saying tra=
nsgender individuals should be able to use whatever restroom is appropriate=
. Take a look.
>> People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate.
>> Donald Trump won't take on the PC police, that ad said. He's one of them=
. What to you make of that? What do you think Ted Cruz means by "He's one o=
f them."
>> Honestly Jake, give me a break. This is how desperate Ted Cruz is. He do=
esn't have any support from anyone. My father's taken on the PC police from=
 day one. The issues Ted Cruz is trying to make his own, whether it be immi=
gration, whether it's all these things, they were all my father's issues. T=
hese are the things my father would take the heat, take the incoming fire f=
rom everyone else and Ted Cruz will run along say this is a great idea I ha=
ve. It's such a joke. If there's one person anyone who is an American if yo=
u asked who is the most un-pc candidate running for office its my father. H=
e wins by basically bribing delegates. It's laughable when I have seen it. =
I haven't seen it until you mentioned it to me. It's ridiculous in my mind.

More restrained Donald Trump, but can he resist temptation to revert back.

Q: can he be more restrained?
A: DJT takes issues to another level to encourage dialogue
Q: wall with Mexico
A: people jump on the bandwagon after trump talks about it and takes the he=
at for it
Q: will you woo delegates for your father?
A: not necessarily, people should know that their vote might not matter. Pe=
ople don't need this archaic system, delegates are party establishment and =
elites. Delegates are you being bought
Q: are you going to woo delegates?
A: We don't want to do that if we don't need to. (Seems to say that he and =
his siblings won't be in the delegate process; Ted Cruz is buying delegates=
; establishment would rather hand victory to HRC
Q: Question on Cruz ad hitting Trump on transgender bill
A: Ted Cruz is desperate; Trump has already taken on the PC police. Cruz go=
ing along with what Trump has already said
Q: Would Trump raise the min. wage?
A: States are different; you have to ask him; pivots to Trump wanting to br=
ing jobs back. When there are good jobs, you don't have to worry about the =
min wage
Q: Why hasn't your vetting process for Veep begun?
A: says that it could be someone who has run for president

Veepstakes beginning
HRC already compiling list, list flashes on the screen (15-20 names)

Sanders up now
Q: Should you and HRC be first on each other's VP list?
A: Sanders pivots to economic inequality -->that's what americans care abou=
t
Q: should you or E. Warren be on the veep list to highlight those issues?
A: economic inequality, higher education; veep needs to have those in mind =
too
Q: What is your response to David Plouffe telling you to call it quit?
A: He is working for HRC, we are giving everyone in the states a voice; deb=
ate helps turnout
Q: Do you have a path to the nom? What states can you win?
A: doesn't say speculate states, mentions CA. It's going to be hard
Q: ISIS question; is the U.S. at war again, should congress pass another re=
authorization?
A: we need another reauthorization, but cannot be a perpetual vote, hits HR=
C on her Iraq vote
Q: HRC carried low income household, even though you have an income inequal=
ity message; you say that poor people don't vote
A: Need to overturn Citizens United; people are disillusioned; campaign is =
 all about getting people in the process
Q: are you surprised that you lose low income voters to HRC?
A: I am surprised by how well we've done
Q: Is it appropriate that Rosario Dawson talked about Monica Lewinsky?
A: Rosario is great, pivots to large corporations paying their fair share
Q: presses on Lewinsky; should his surrogates be commenting on that.
A: says he had no idea what exactly Dawson said; we should worry about clim=
ate change instead

Donald Jr. on next
