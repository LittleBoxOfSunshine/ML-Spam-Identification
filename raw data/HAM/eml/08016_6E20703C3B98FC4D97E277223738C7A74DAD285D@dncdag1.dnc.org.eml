Excerpts from DNC Chair Rep. Wasserman Schultz at the ASDC Meeting in Phila=
delphia

PHILADELPHIA, PA -- Today, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz addresse=
d a meeting of the Association of State Democratic Chairs. Below you will f=
ind excerpts as prepared for delivery:



"I'm excited to join you all here in Philadelphia, the home of our upcoming=
 convention where we will show the world a Democratic Party ready for one o=
f the most important General Elections of our time. I'm proud of the work t=
hat each and every one of you is doing in your states, managing what is nev=
er an easy delegate selection process, but one that will bring the values a=
nd diversity of our party and our country to this city in just 66 days!

...

"When Democrats from all across this great country come to the City of Brot=
herly Love and Sisterly Affection, we will be energized, united and focused=
 on making sure that we continue to build upon the progress we've made unde=
r President Obama by electing a Democrat as the 45th President of the Unite=
d States of America.



"And that's really what this is all about. Making sure that together we lau=
nch our nominee into the White House with the support of a Democratic House=
 and Senate and State Houses across the country so that we can continue to:=
 Build a strong and safe future for our children and grandchildren, grow ou=
r economy and create good paying jobs; and move our country forward for all=
 Americans, not just the wealthy and well connected!

...

"In just the last week, the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump ha=
s backpedaled away from his own pledge to release his tax returns, vowed to=
 slash taxes for those at the top like himself, and seemingly lied about pr=
etending to be his own publicist. He refused to address his well-documented=
 history of misogyny and insulted one of our country's most important allie=
s, Great Britain. His campaign called their selection of a white supremacis=
t delegate a 'database error.'



"I don't know about you, but it didn't exactly put me at ease either, when =
Trump suggested we could always resolve debt by printing more money, and he=
 legitimized a despotic North Korean dictator. Every day there's a new exam=
ple of his knee-jerk recklessness, lack of judgment and unstable temperamen=
t.



"But we cannot gloss over the genuine concern that too many Americans are s=
till feeling about their own pocketbooks and our place in the world. Donald=
 Trump is promoting anxiety as a way to ease people's concern. We need to l=
isten to them because our candidates have the most thoughtful solutions. Th=
at's why your work is so crucial. That's why, at the DNC, we're doing every=
thing we can to support you and help you bring people into the general elec=
tion energized, understanding what's at stake, and championing the values a=
nd priorities that make our party and our country great.

...

"Nearly 23 million people have participated in our primaries and both campa=
igns have worked so hard to advance ideas that will improve the lives of Am=
ericans. Supporters of both Clinton and Sanders deserve respect for the wor=
k they have put into their campaigns. That is a stark contrast with the div=
isive policies that have come from the Republicans. I will always stand up =
for party activists because they bring us energy and ideas. I will always s=
tand up for the leaders of this party because they volunteer their precious=
 time to guide our progressive future. We are Democrats and we welcome ever=
yone in. More importantly, our agenda, unlike Republicans, is inclusive and=
 welcomes everyone!

...

"Because of Democratic leadership: 20 million Americans have health insuran=
ce who didn't before. We've seen 74 straight months of private sector job g=
rowth creating over 14 million new jobs and we all remember the Great Reces=
sion, when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month when George W Bush left offi=
ce. Well, we are not going back by allowing a Trump presidency.
...

"By working together as Democrats, we can accomplish great things for hones=
t, hard-working people from every walk of life. Our record shows we can set=
 and pass an agenda that promotes economic growth, fairness and opportunity=
. Yes, fellow Democrats: America's future is bright. When we stick together=
, anything is possible.  I'm excited for the future of our party, and I'm p=
roud of your work that I know will carry us forward into a brighter future.=
 On to victory!"
