Trump refuses to commit on appointing justices who will overturn Roe v. Wad=
e
TRUMP: "Well, they will be pro-life. We will see about overturning."

Trump on O'Reilly Factor

Paul Ryan?
- Very good man
- Would like him to remain as convention chair
- We will do better if we're unified

You need him for fundraising. You loaned yourself money?
- It was $45 million actually
- Not expecting to get paid back for loans
- Will raise whatever we need to. Maybe $1 billion

AP report on vice president?
- Have in mind 5 different people
- Won't announce until the convention
- Always envisioned announcing at the convention

Elizabeth Warren attacks on you?
- She has done nothing.
- Scott Brown told me bad things about her
- Attacking me because she sees polls that I will beat Hillary
- Amazing Twitter rant. I responded. Haven't heard from her since

Say you're pro-life. What is one specific thing to protect sanctity of life=
?
- I've become pro-life
- Previously was meek pro-choice
- Biggest thing you can do is Supreme Court

Get a justice that would overturn Roe v. Wade?
- One of the most important things is appointing
- "Well, they will be pro-life. We will see about overturning."

Taxes on rich?
- May have to raise taxes on wealthy above levels in plan
- Everybody is going to go down
- I wouldn't mind paying more, but the fact is, everybody will be paying le=
