Smaller Group - Do we have her avail that far in advance? Univision Seattle=
 wants to interview via Skype her then, as well. Happy to work with any sch=

Good Morning Everybody,

I am just checking in again about a confirmation for DNC Chair/ Congresswom=
an Debbie Wasserman-Schultz for May 12.

I'm sensitive to the fact that we are in the middle of a presidential elect=
ion and her time is limited.

But I would like to know fairly quickly because I need to get the promos in=
 place for all our affiliates all over the country.

We put a lot of effort into marketing our interviews.

I appreciate your time.

Thanks,

Good Morning Everybody,

I was just following up on the interview request from yesterday for Congres=
swoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz for May 12 for The Costa Report.

By the way, as an aside, I am interested in booking other national Democrat=

It is important to us to have an ideological balance on the show.

If you can help me on that front, I would be very grateful for that as well=
.

Thanks,

Hi Ryan,

Thanks for getting back to me. The original email to you is below.

Here are some facts you wanted:

The Costa Report is nationally syndicated so our audience is in all 50 stat=
es.

Here is a map of our coverage area:

http://www.rebeccacosta.com/syndicated-stations.htm

We have an audience of just over 2,000,000 listeners. So our audience is gr=
eater than MSNBC and CNN.

This is a talk radio audience so this is an audience that is older, politic=
ally engaged, and votes consistently.

We have a social media and newsletter audience of 250,000 subscribers.

In terms of guests we have had on:

Tom Daschle

Juan Williams

Ralph Nader

Michael Hayden

Mark Pryor

Dana Milbank

Tim Pawlenty

Jim Lehrer

We have had on most of the presidential candidates this election season.

The list of guests we had on is here if you need something more comprehensi=
ve:

http://www.rebeccacosta.com/the-costa-report.htm

I have May 12 open right now, which is right before the California primary.

There are a few options for a phone interview:

1. Live interview scheduled in between 2:00 - 3:00 pm (Pacific Time) with v=
arious breaks in between.

2. A recorded interview between 9:00 - 10:00 am (Pacific Time).

3. A recorded interview between 10:00 - 11:00 am (Pacific Time).

Thanks,

Dear Mr. Banfill,

My name is Brad Polisuk and I am a producer for the nationally syndicated T=
he Costa Report featuring Rebecca Costa, broadcast from KSCO studios in San=
ta Cruz, California, one of the last independently owned radio stations in =
the US.

The Costa Report is a post-partisan human affairs show with an audience of =
over 2 million people with over 250,000 followers on social media.

I am pitching this to you because Rebecca Costa is interested in doing an i=
nterview with Congresswoman Wasserman-Schultz that isn't particularly parti=
san or political in nature but to appeal to our higher angels as Americans =
in terms of our love for civic duty and commitment to public service.

I am sure the Congresswoman would like to do an interview where she is not =
either on the offensive or defensive as chair of the DNC or as a political =
candidate.

Put simply, it won't be a hostile interview but more of an interview that f=
ocuses on what can we do as a country together, regardless if Hillary Clint=
on or Donald Trump becomes president or if Congress stays the same or chang=
es hands.

Also, to be blunt, we would love to have more Democrats in Congress on the =
program.

You can hear recordings of past work here: http://www.rebeccacosta.com/the-=
costa-report.htm  You will see that we have had on major players on before.

I have May 12 open right now, which is right before the California primary.=
 It would be an opportune time for her to be on and reach out to a talk rad=
io audience that would open to another perspective on the Congresswoman's l=
ife and career.

There are a few options for a phone interview:

1. Live interview scheduled in between 2:00 - 3:00 pm (Pacific Time) with v=
arious breaks in between.

2. A recorded interview between 9:00 - 10:00 am (Pacific Time).

3. A recorded interview between 10:00 - 11:00 am (Pacific Time).

Also, I would like to develop a long-term relationship with her so we can f=
eature more Democrats on the program but more from a public servant perspec=
tive with an agenda to move forward and get things done.

If this interests you and Congresswoman Wasserman-Schultz, please let me kn=
ow as soon as you can.  Thanks for your time.


Sincerely,

Brad   ---

<p>I am just checking in again about a confirmation for DNC Chair/ Congress=

<p>I'm sensitive to the fact that we are in the middle of a presidential el=

Hi Ryan,<br>
<br>
Thanks for getting back to me. The original email to you is below.<br>
<br>
Here are some facts you wanted:<br>
<br>
The Costa Report is nationally syndicated so our audience is in all 50 stat=
es.<br>
<br>
Here is a map of our coverage area:<br>
<br>
<a href=3D"http://www.rebeccacosta.com/syndicated-stations.htm">http://www.=
rebeccacosta.com/syndicated-stations.htm</a><br>
<br>
We have an audience of just over 2,000,000 listeners. So our audience is gr=
eater than MSNBC and CNN.<br>
<br>
This is a talk radio audience so this is an audience that is older, politic=
ally engaged, and votes consistently.<br>
<br>
We have a social media and newsletter audience of 250,000 subscribers.<br>
<br>
In terms of guests we have had on:<br>
<br>
Tom Daschle<br>
<br>
Juan Williams<br>
<br>
Ralph Nader<br>
<br>
Michael Hayden<br>
<br>
Mark Pryor<br>
<br>
Dana Milbank<br>
<br>
Tim Pawlenty<br>
<br>
Jim Lehrer<br>
<br>
We have had on most of the presidential candidates this election season.<br=

<br>
The list of guests we had on is here if you need something more comprehensi=

I have May 12 open right now, which is right before the California primary.=
<br>
<br>
There are a few options for a phone interview:<br>
<br>
1. Live interview scheduled in between 2:00 - 3:00 pm (Pacific Time) with v=
arious breaks in between.<br>
<br>
2. A recorded interview between 9:00 - 10:00 am (Pacific Time).<br>

Dear Mr. Banfill,<br>
<br>
My name is Brad Polisuk and I am a producer for the nationally syndicated T=
he Costa Report featuring Rebecca Costa, broadcast from KSCO studios in San=
ta Cruz, California, one of the last independently owned radio stations in =
the US.<br>
<br>
The Costa Report is a post-partisan human affairs show with an audience of =
over 2 million people with over 250,000 followers on social media.<br>
<br>
I am pitching this to you because Rebecca Costa is interested in doing an i=
nterview with Congresswoman Wasserman-Schultz that isn't particularly parti=
san or political in nature but to appeal to our higher angels as Americans =
in terms of our love for civic duty
 and commitment to public service.<br>
<br>
I am sure the Congresswoman would like to do an interview where she is not =
either on the offensive or defensive as chair of the DNC or as a political =
candidate.<br>
<br>
Put simply, it won't be a hostile interview but more of an interview that f=
ocuses on what can we do as a country together, regardless if Hillary Clint=
on or Donald Trump becomes president or if Congress stays the same or chang=
es hands.<br>
<br>
Also, to be blunt, we would love to have more Democrats in Congress on the =
program.<br>
<br>
You can hear recordings of past work here: <a href=3D"http://www.rebeccacos=
ta.com/the-costa-report.htm">
http://www.rebeccacosta.com/the-costa-report.htm</a> &nbsp;You will see tha=
t we have had on major players on before.<br>
<br>
I have May 12 open right now, which is right before the California primary.=
 It would be an opportune time for her to be on and reach out to a talk rad=
io audience that would open to another perspective on the Congresswoman's l=
ife and career.<br>
<br>
There are a few options for a phone interview:<br>
<br>
1. Live interview scheduled in between 2:00 - 3:00 pm (Pacific Time) with v=
arious breaks in between.<br>
<br>
2. A recorded interview between 9:00 - 10:00 am (Pacific Time).<br>
<br>
3. A recorded interview between 10:00 - 11:00 am (Pacific Time).<br>
<br>
Also, I would like to develop a long-term relationship with her so we can f=
eature more Democrats on the program but more from a public servant perspec=
tive with an agenda to move forward and get things done.<br>
<br>
If this interests you and Congresswoman Wasserman-Schultz, please let me kn=
ow as soon as you can. &nbsp;Thanks for your time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Brad &nbsp;&nbsp;---<br>
