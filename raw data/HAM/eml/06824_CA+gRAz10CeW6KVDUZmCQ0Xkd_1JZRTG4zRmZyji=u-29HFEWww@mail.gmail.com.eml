<h1>Nevada Democrats: Sanders Campaign Has Violent Streak</h1>
<p>Nevada's <a href=3D"http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/democratic-part=
y.htm" target=3D"_blank">Democratic party</a> on Monday warned the
<a href=3D"http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/democratic-national-committ=
ee.htm" target=3D"_blank">
Democratic National Committee</a> that Sen. Bernie Sanders' supporters have=
 a penchant for violence and may seek to disrupt the party's national conve=
ntion in July, as they did during the Nevada convention Saturday.</p>
<p>The allegation is the latest fallout from a divisive Nevada Democratic c=
onvention that had to be shut down because security at the Paris Las Vegas =
hotel could no longer ensure order on Saturday night. The gathering closed =
with some Sanders supporters throwing
 chairs; later, some made death threats against state party chairwoman Robe=
rta Lange.</p>
<p>Sanders' backers had been protesting convention rules that ultimately le=
d to <a href=3D"http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/hillary-clinto=
n.htm" target=3D"_blank">
Hillary Clinton</a> winning more pledged delegates. Clinton won the state's=
 caucuses in February, 53-47, but Sanders backers hoped to pick up extra de=
legates by packing county and state party gatherings.</p>
<p>Sanders had released a statement Friday night asking supporters to work =
&quot;together respectfully and constructively&quot; at the convention. But=
 the state party alleged in its letter to the co-chairs of the DNC Rules an=
d By-laws committee, &quot;The explosive situation
 arose in large part because a portion of the community of Sanders delegate=
s arrived at the Nevada Democratic State Convention believing itself to be =
a vanguard intent upon sparking a street-fight rather than attending an ord=
erly political party process.&quot;</p>
<p>Michael Briggs, a Sanders campaign spokesman, said, &quot;We do not cond=
one violence or encourage violence or even threats of violence.&quot; He ad=
ded that the campaign &quot;had no role in encouraging the activity that th=
e party is complaining about. We have a First Amendment
 and respect the rights of the people to make their voices heard.&quot;</p>
<p>On Saturday, Sanders backers shouted down the keynote speaker, Sen. Barb=
ara Boxer, and others they thought were tilting the rules in Clinton's favo=
r. Protesters shouted obscenities and rushed the dais to protest rulings. T=
he letter by the state party's general
 counsel, Bradley S. Schrager, warns that similarly chaotic scenes could un=
fold in Philadelphia, site of the Democratic National Committee's July conv=
ention.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe, unfortunately, that the tactics and behavior on displa=
y here in Nevada are harbingers of things to come as Democrats gather in Ph=
iladelphia in July for our National Convention,&quot; Schrager wrote. &quot=
;We write to alert you to what we perceive as the
 Sanders campaign's penchant for extra-parliamentary behavior =E2=80=94 ind=
eed, actual violence =E2=80=94 in place of democratic conduct in a conventi=
on setting, and furthermore what we can only describe as their encouragemen=
t of, and complicity in, a very dangerous atmosphere
 that ended in chaos and physical threats to fellow Democrats.&quot;</p>
<p>Several Sanders backers have condemned some of the threats against Lange=
 and other actions Saturday. Former state assemblywoman Lucy Flores, a curr=
ent congressional candidate, said in a statement: &quot;There were actions =
over the weekend and at the Democratic
 convention that very clearly crossed the line. Progressives need to speak =
out against those: Making threats against someone's life, defacing private =
property, and hurling vulgar language at our female leaders.&quot;</p>
<p>State party offices remained closed Monday for security reasons after Sa=
nders supporters posted Lange's home and business addresses, email and cell=
 phone number online. Copies of angry and threatening texts to Lange were i=
ncluded with the letter.</p>
<p>Lange said she'd been receiving hundreds of profanity-laced calls and te=
xts from inside and outside of the U.S., threatening her life and her famil=
y. Lange said the restaurant where she works has received so many calls it =
had to unplug the phone.</p>
<p>&quot;It is endless, and the longer it goes the worse it gets,&quot; Lan=
ge said in an interview. &quot;I feel threatened everywhere I go.&quot;</p>
