Majorities of voters-across the partisan and ideological spectrum-want the U.S. Senate to hold hearings and an up-or-down confirmation vote for Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court. By a 69 percent to 27 percent margin, voters nationally overwhelmingly think the U.S. Senate should move forward with hearings and an up-or-down vote for Judge Garland. This includes 79 percent of self-identified Democrats; 67 percent of Independents; 59 percent of Republicans; and 55 percent of self-identified conservatives/libertarians.

Support for hearings and an up-or-down vote is strong across all 5 states as well. "As you may have heard, President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court. Do you think the U.S. Senate should hold hearings and then have an up-or-down confirmation vote on Judge Garland's nomination?" (Initial test) * Arizona 68 percent (yes); 27 percent (no) * Iowa 66 percent (yes); 29 percent (no) * Ohio 65 percent (yes); 30 percent (no) * Pennsylvania 66 percent (yes); 28 percent (no) * Wisconsin 64 percent (yes); 29 percent (no)

"Do you think Senate Republican leaders are refusing to hold hearings or a confirmation vote mostly for political reasons or mostly because they think it is the best thing for the country?" * Arizona 65 percent political reasons/30 percent best thing for country * Iowa 63 percent political reasons/31 percent best thing for country * Ohio 68 percent political reasons/28 percent best thing for country * Pennsylvania 64 percent political reasons/30 percent best thing for country * Wisconsin 64 percent political reasons/29 percent best thing for country
