PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20





12:42 P.M. EDT





MR. EARNEST: All right. Happy Friday, everybody. I don't have anything in=
 addition to that at the top. Im happy to take whatever questions remain =
-- hopefully there arent many.



 Q Circling back to the campaign, Bernie Sanders is threatening a floor f=
ight today at the Democratic Convention. He wants these committees that p=
ick the platform to be made out of proportional numbers based on the resu=
lts of these primaries. As the head of the Democratic Party, does the Pre=
sident have a view about whether thats a fair model that should be pursue=
d?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, there are rules and regulations that sort of go=
vern the conduct of the convention. And theres a whole apparatus at the D=
emocratic National Committee that can follow the guidelines and ensure th=
at our party hosts a convention thats consistent with the rules but also =
reflects the preferences of those who participated in primaries and caucu=
ses across the country. And the President has got a lot of confidence in =
his DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to navigate this process and ens=
ure that it concludes fairly and reflects the interests of Democrats acro=
ss the country.



 Q And on that strike that we talked about yesterday in Syria that killed=
 at least 28 people, both Russia and Syria are saying their aircraft were=
 not responsible for this. I know you said yesterday you werent aware of =
any U.S. or coalition aircraft in the area. Do you have any more recent i=
ntelligence about where that strike came from or who is responsible?



 MR. EARNEST: Josh, I can tell you that my colleagues both at the Departm=
ent of Defense and in the intelligence community are continuing to look a=
t this particular situation. As I noted yesterday, were not in a position=
 where we can draw clear conclusions about who exactly was responsible fo=
r this incident. What is true is that regardless of who was responsible, =
there is never any justification for carrying out a strike that targets i=
nnocent civilians, particularly innocent civilians that have already fled=
 their homes to escape violence. And, unfortunately, there is a long trac=
k record of the Assad regime doing precisely that.=20



 So were going to continue to take a look at this particular incident aro=
und Idlib, and its obviously an incident that we take quite seriously. Bu=
t we take quite seriously the other incidents that we know have been perp=
etrated by the Assad regime against innocent civilians. And the bloodshed=
 that we have seen inside Syria is astonishing and tragic. And too much o=
f that blood is the blood of innocent civilians, and its on the hands of =
Bashar al Assad and members of his government. And that is why we have ma=
de a strong case that Bashar al Assad needs to leave power and make room =
for the kind of political transition inside of Syria thats long overdue, =
so that a political leader inside of Syria can assume power and unify tha=
t country and bring an end to the chaos and the violence.



 Q On that transition, the administration has set this August deadline fo=
r a political transition in Syria. What exactly is the U.S. threatening t=
o do if that deadline is not met? And does the White House feel that the =
President has credibility behind any kind of threat, given his reluctance=
 to strike a few years ago?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, Im not aware of any threats that have been issu=
ed. I think what Secretary Kerry and others have laid out is a framework =
for carrying out painstaking political talks. And those political talks h=
ave been undermined by the propensity of the Assad regime to carry out at=
tacks against innocent civilians inside of Syria. Opposition leaders are =
understandably reluctant to come to the table with people who are, at the=
 very same time, authorizing military assaults against their constituents=
.



 So we havent seen as much progress in these political talks as we would =
like to see. But the fact that the U.N. is even able to identify parties =
to the talks and has over the last several months been able to organize p=
roximity talks is an indication that weve made more progress than we have=
 over the last five years. But were still a long way from the kind of pol=
itical agreement that we need to see.



 Q And President Erdogan is moving very quickly to try and consolidate po=
wer after the Prime Ministers resignation. I was curious in how the U.S. =
feels about -- whether you have any concerns about that much power amassi=
ng in the Turkish presidency in light of some of your concerns about pres=
s freedom and the Kurds and other issues.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, obviously, as I mentioned yesterday, the United=
 States and Turkey are NATO allies, and we have worked effectively with t=
he Turks to expedite some elements of our counter-ISIL campaign. For exam=
ple, Turkey has given the United States and other members of our coalitio=
n access to military facilities in Turkey that have made our military cam=
paign even more effective against ISIL. Weve also seen Turkey make some p=
rogress in securing their border with Syria that has blunted the flow of =
weapons and foreign fighters across the border into Syria. Both of those =
things have been beneficial in our efforts to degrade and ultimately dest=
roy ISIL.=20



That has not, however, prevented the United States or even the President =
of the United States from raising concerns about situations in which the =
Turkish government does not seem sufficiently committed to protecting the=
 basic universal human rights of their people -- that, by the way, are en=
shrined in the Turkish constitution. These are rights that the United Sta=
tes advocates for around the world, and we do not hesitate in raising con=
cerns even when those concerns involve the actions carried out by a gover=
nment with whom the United States has an important alliance.=20



And that will continue. Even as Turkey works through some of this -- thro=
ugh this political dispute and through this political turmoil, the United=
 States is going to continue to stand by our ally; were going to continue=
 to work effectively with them to carry out a military campaign against I=
SIL; and were not going to hesitate to publicly and privately encourage t=
hem to live up to the principles that are enshrined in the Turkish consti=
tution.



 Jeff.



 Q Josh, is the White House watching the congress in North Korea that Kim=
 Jong-un opened today in which he talked about nuclear successes but also=
 boosting economic development? Do you take that seriously? And whats you=
r reaction to that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the administration is obviously aware of developments=
 in North Korea and we watch them closely to the extent that those kinds =
of developments occur in public. That makes this situation a little unusu=
al.=20



 We obviously are aware of the risk that is posed by North Koreas effort =
to develop nuclear weapons and systems capable of delivering those nuclea=
r weapons. The United States has worked effectively with the internationa=
l community to counter those efforts, and as a result, North Korea has fa=
ced increasing isolation, which is saying something because they were pre=
tty isolated at the end of last year and that trajectory has only gotten =
worse for them. And we know that its had a negative impact on what is alr=
eady a rather weak economy.=20



Our efforts have targeted those elements of the North Korean economy that=
 we know benefit North Koreas weapons programs, and our concerns stem fro=
m the fact that those programs are inconsistent with their international =
obligations. And those arent just concerns that the United States has rai=
sed; those are concerns that have also been raised by countries like Chin=
a and Russia and South Korea and Japan. And the international community i=
s serious about holding North Korea to account for their destabilizing an=
d provocative behavior, and there is a path that North Korea can take to =
come out of the wilderness, to emerge from isolation, but it will require=
 them renouncing nuclear weapons and demonstrating a clear commitment to =
ending their provocative actions and denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.=




 Lets move around a little bit. April.



 Q Josh, I did ask the President about Howard and he chose not to answer.=
=20



 MR. EARNEST: I noticed. Hes going to talk about it tomorrow, though. (La=
ughter.) Thats the good news, I guess.



 Q But you said you were going to give us information today. Are you goin=
g to not talk because the President didnt answer?



 MR. EARNEST: No, I can try to give you a sense of what hes thinking. Ill=
 try. I do think -- I looked this up before I came out here. This is actu=
ally the third time that the President has delivered a commencement addre=
ss at an HBCU since entering the Oval Office. Back in 2010, the President=
 gave the commencement address at Hampton University. And in 2013, the Pr=
esident delivered the commencement address at Morehouse College in Atlant=
a. So the President, in delivering the commencement address at Howard, wi=
ll be delivering the commencement address at the third HBCU since taking =
office.



 The President will address a couple of themes. The first, the President =
will acknowledge the unique opportunity that these graduates have had to =
attend one of the finest HBCUs in the country. This means that theyve bee=
n exposed to passionate faculty members and a community of classmates tha=
t has nurtured their innate ability and empowered them with skills and ex=
periences that can benefit our country. So this means that Howard student=
s have been given a great gift, but they also are assuming an important r=
esponsibility. And I do expect that the President will touch on that.



 The President will also observe that Howard graduates will be entering a=
n economy and a society thats undergoing a series of profound changes. Th=
ese changes arent new in the sense that the changes didnt just start, but=
 this is actually -- the class of 2016 has had a view of these changes th=
roughout their lives. And how they use the skills that theyve gotten in t=
he course of this high-quality college education to confront the tremendo=
us demographic, economic and technological changes that our country is ex=
periencing right now is a question that each of those graduates will have=
 to answer for themselves. The President is hopeful that theyll answer th=
at question in a way thats good for the country and is consistent with th=
e significant responsibility that they now have.



 Finally, I think the last thing Id point out is, as somebody who has spe=
nt a decent portion of his professional career talking to young people an=
d college graduates, the President enjoys the opportunity to give these k=
inds of speeches, but also to consider these issues that are on the minds=
 of college graduates across the country. And obviously this speech that =
hes delivering tomorrow is an important one and an opportunity that hes l=
ooking forward to, but the President will have an opportunity to flesh ou=
t some of these themes in commencement addresses that hell also deliver a=
t Rutgers and the Air Force Academy later this year.=20



 Q So were you able to get the information that you were trying to find f=
rom yesterday, you said you would find for me when it comes to this admin=
istration and HBCUs funding and support, et cetera?



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, Ive got a factsheet here. Rather than just reading thr=
ough it, why dont I -- Ill have somebody email it to you when we get done=
.



 Q Can you just highlight the --



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the highlight is that the Presidents FY-2017 =
budget seeks to strengthen funding for HBCUs. Weve made a lot of progress=
 over the last seven or eight years in increasing the support that HBCUs =
receive, but the Presidents budget proposes $85 million in mandatory fund=
ing for HBCUs. The President also proposes an additional $244 million in =
discretionary funds for Title III.=20



 I think the other thing that I would acknowledge is the President has so=
ught to dramatically expand access to the Pell grant program for college =
students across the country. This, of course, does not apply just to Afri=
can American college students but it does tangibly enhance the ability of=
 middle-class families and those families that are trying to get into the=
 middle class to send their kids to college. And the Presidents funding p=
roposal for 2017 reflects continued commitment to that expansion of the P=
ell grant program that I think many HBCU students have actually used to a=
fford a high-quality education at Howard University.



 Q So lets go to 2016, the monies that are actually realized, the monies =
that actually passed. What was the number for 2016 for this fiscal year t=
hat were still in?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont have that in front of me, but I can pull it and we c=
an try to get you some additional data.



 Andrew.



 Q Josh, I dont know if you saw that Hillary Clinton has finally come out=
 against the possibility of TPP being passed during a lame duck session. =
I was wondering what you think of that, and whether it makes it look like=
 the Presidents trade agenda is at risk of unraveling.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Andrew, Im not particularly surprised by it. Her view=
s on this topic are well-known. But it doesnt really change our strategy.=
 The truth is Secretary Clinton and many other leading candidates for the=
 presidency last year expressed opposition to Trade Promotion Authority l=
egislation. This is ultimately legislation that paved the way for the com=
pletion of the TPP negotiations. And in spite of her opposition to that l=
egislation, the administration worked effectively with Democrats and Repu=
blicans in both the House and the Senate to pass that bill.=20



 The truth is passing TPA is a bigger challenge than getting Congress to =
ratify TPP for a couple of reasons. The first is a procedural one, which =
is that TPA had to overcome a filibuster effort in the United States Sena=
te. TPP only requires 50 votes in the Senate to be ratified by the United=
 States Senate. But the second thing -- and in some ways, this is more im=
portant -- TPA was rooted in a philosophical argument about giving the Pr=
esident of the United States the authority to negotiate a trade agreement=
 thats in the best interest of the U.S. economy. That required us essenti=
ally to make a strong case that the United States Congress should trust t=
he President to get this done and actually give him the authority necessa=
ry to complete the negotiations.



 Now that weve completed the negotiations, the American people and member=
s of the United States Congress can evaluate the terms of the agreement a=
nd judge for themselves about whether or not its good for the economy. If=
 theyre willing to do that, weve got a very strong argument to make. For =
example, the TPP trade agreement would result in cutting 18,000 taxes tha=
t other countries impose on American products. The TPP agreement includes=
 high and enforceable standards when it comes to protecting our environme=
nt, protecting human rights, and protecting labor rights. Those are the k=
inds of values-driven proposals that are included in the TPP agreement.=20=




But those dont just reflect our values; they also reflect a commitment on=
 the part of this President to leveling the playing field and giving Amer=
ican businesses and American workers an even better opportunity to compet=
e in a 21st century global economy.=20



And the President has made a strong case as recently as this week in The =
Washington Post -- he wrote an op-ed basically making clear that if the U=
nited States refuses to engage in Southeast Asia and produce a set of eco=
nomic standards, then China will. And when China comes in to write the ru=
les of the road instead of putting in place those standards, theyre not g=
oing to insist on high environmental standards. Theyre certainly not goin=
g to insist on lofty human rights or labor standards. And that will only =
further -- if they succeed in doing that, that will only further disadvan=
tage U.S. businesses and U.S. workers when theyre competing for business =
in Southeast Asia. This is significant because Southeast Asia is home to =
some of the most dynamic economies in the world.



So from an economic, strategic, and values perspective, we have a very st=
rong argument to make about the wisdom of Congress moving to approve the =
TPP agreement that the President negotiated.



Q Another question on trade. The Chinese believe that in 2001 they had an=
 agreement with the U.S. -- you and various other WTO partners to, from D=
ecember 11th, be treated as if it were a market economy for the purposes =
of antidumping duties. What would China have to do -- well, do you have t=
he same assessment that China, after the 11th of December, must be treate=
d as if it were a market economy? Are you ready to declare the market eco=
nomy?



MR. EARNEST: My understanding, Andrew, about this, is rudimentary, but my=
 understanding is that those kinds of assessments are actually reached by=
 the Commerce Department. So Id refer you to them for a sense of our curr=
ent assessment of Chinas economy. Id also refer you to them to answer the=
 question about whether or not theyre considering changing that assessmen=
t.



Q Okay. And sorry, just a final question -- just to clear up something yo=
u said in response to Josh. Secretary Kerry actually said there would be =
consequences if Russia didnt meet the August deadline, which is enshrined=
 in the Vienna process. But you seem to be saying that even if they keep =
on breaking the truce, even if theres no prospect of further talks, even =
if they keep bombing IDP camps, that there are still going to be more tal=
ks if thats the only way forward.



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what Secretary Kerry is pointing out is that R=
ussia and President Putin himself has publicly advocated for a political =
transition inside of Syria. President Putin himself has acknowledged that=
 this is an important priority. And failing to meet that deadline will ha=
ve negative consequences for everybody thats involved.=20



We know that Russia -- we know based on the degree to which Russia has in=
vested in Syria that they care deeply about the outcome. They have a lot =
riding on this. Russia maintains a military presence inside of Syria. Syr=
ia is the only country outside of the former Soviet bloc where Russia con=
tinues to have a military presence. So we know that theyre quite protecti=
ve of it, and concerned about whats happening in that country so that the=
y can protect the foothold they have in that country. Failing to succeed =
in negotiating a political transition is not going to be good for the Rus=
sians. It will have negative consequences for them.=20



Im not saying the United States benefits from that. It has negative conse=
quences for everybody thats involved there. It certainly has negative con=
sequences for everybody whos concerned about the widespread violence that=
 weve seen there. So I think the point is the international community is =
focused on meeting this goal, and that is a priority and its something th=
at President Putin has demonstrated hes deeply invested in.=20



Look, to a large extent, hes put his own credibility on the line here. He=
s made clear that hes prepared to use his influence with the Assad regime=
 to bring about this political transition that benefits Russia and that b=
enefits the Syrian people and that benefits everybody who is involved. So=
 it will be important for Russia to use their influence to try to advance=
 these talks and bring them to a constructive conclusion on a timeframe t=
hats been laid out.=20



The United States is certainly prepared to do our part, and it would be i=
mportant for Russia to make clear that they expect the Assad regime to do=
 their part as well.



Q Weve mostly focused on Russia on this. But at the end of the day, its t=
he Syrian regime. Would you not rule out -- would you rule out any measur=
es against the Syrian regime if they were to stop, if they were to breeze=
 through this August deadline?



MR. EARNEST: Well, let me say -- let me take on one part of the early par=
t of your question, which is that when the President was meeting with the=
 GCC countries, he certainly made clear to them that its helpful for them=
 to use their influence with the opposition groups and other relevant par=
ties to try to bring about this political transition. So its not just the=
 Russian government that we have been pressing, and weve been pressing al=
l of the parties. Weve been using our own influence with the opposition g=
roups, but we certainly have encouraged our partners, who also have influ=
ence with the opposition groups, to push in the same direction here.



What was the last part of your question, though? Sorry, I was distracted =
by the first part there.



Q Why not address the problem at its root? Why not take action directly a=
gainst the Syrian regime?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Andrew, because the President has made clear theres no=
t a military solution that can be imposed on the situation in Syria. I kn=
ow Ive said that a lot and other administration officials have, and it so=
unds a little clich at this point, but it is a core principle of our appr=
oach to this situation. This should be a lesson that we learned in 2003 -=
- that trying to overthrow a dictator in the Middle East has long-term an=
d mostly negative consequences for the United States and our national sec=
urity. To say nothing of the cost that would be incurred if we were to un=
dertake that kind of action. The President would have to deploy thousands=
, tens of thousands, if not more than 100,000 U.S. troops on the ground t=
hat would cost a lot of money. That would mean that the United States mil=
itary would sustain significant casualties. And all of that would be done=
 without a clear exit plan.



So we cant lose track of that recent historical context when evaluating o=
ur options. The President certainly hasnt, and thats why we have pressed =
so forcefully and with such tenacity on the successful completion of poli=
tical talks. And weve got a long way to go, but that continues to be our =
focus.



Jordan.



Q Thanks, Josh. The President needled Senator Paul a bit there over block=
ing these eight tax treaties.



MR. EARNEST: I think he was pretty gentle when you consider that these ar=
e tax treaties that have been waiting for congressional approval for -- I=
 wrote this down -- I think its since -- theres one treaty in particular,=
 I believe its with Switzerland, thats been pending ratification by the U=
nited States Senate I believe since 2011. So this tax treaty that we have=
 with Switzerland since January of 2011 has been awaiting congressional a=
pproval. We also have a critically important tax treaty with Luxembourg t=
hats been awaiting congressional approval since 2010. So were talking abo=
ut more than five years of delay here.=20



The benefit is simply we know that there are companies that use the Swiss=
 and whatever the adjective of Luxembourg is -- (laughter) -- their finan=
cial systems. We know that there are people who use the financial systems=
 in Switzerland and Luxembourg to evade taxation and, in some cases, to e=
ven hide their resources because they are the result of criminal actions.=




So I dont really know exactly what the justification -- what justificatio=
n Senator Paul would have for not moving forward with these agreements th=
at would allow our law enforcement officials to combat those efforts.



Q Right, but for the last couple years, actually, Senator Paul has had co=
ncerns that these treaties would infringe on Americans personal tax data =
and other personal financial information. So Im wondering what the White =
House or the administration has done to assuage those concerns that Senat=
or Paul has?



MR. EARNEST: Well, my guess is, hes not raising concerns on the part of t=
oo many middle-class families that are using the financial system in Luxe=
mbourg to hide their assets. So Im not really sure whose concerns Senator=
 Paul is speaking up for. Maybe he can elaborate on that a little bit. I =
suspect its not middle-class families in Kentucky that he has in mind.



Q And then finally, with this legislation on tax shelters, has anyone fro=
m the White House reached out to Congressman Brady on the Ways and Means =
Committee or Senator Hatch about letting this move forward this year?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there have been conversations with members=
 of Congress on a whole host of issues related to closing financial looph=
oles that entities use to get around our tax code or to evade sanctions o=
r to store the proceeds of illicit activity. So this is a priority that t=
he President has made here, and weve made a lot of important progress, an=
d you see the administration announcing a couple of actions today that wi=
ll be effective in bringing greater transparency to our financial system.=




Q (Inaudible.)



MR. EARNEST: Well, this is the point. Weve already taken some steps here =
administratively. Weve also made clear that there are some things that Co=
ngress can and should do. And we have been in touch with them about those=
 measures, and were going to continue to encourage them to pursue them. D=
oes that make sense?



Q Are you saying that additional things that havent been announced today =
are going to be announced today also?



MR. EARNEST: No, no, Im not suggesting theres more coming today. Im just =
suggesting there are some things that weve put forward that are both admi=
nistrative, but we also are in touch with Congress because there are some=
 things they should do as well.



Michelle.



Q -- to what extent did the Panama Papers release play into the timing of=
 this?



MR. EARNEST: Well, the rules that were announced today are actually rules=
 that have taken at least a couple of years to put together. Obviously th=
e nature of these rules is that they apply to extraordinarily complex fin=
ancial transactions. So our experts had to comb through the regulations a=
nd ensure that there were no unintended consequences from the rules that =
are being put in place. So they were quite conscientious about this.



But there is no denying that what they will do is bring much-needed trans=
parency to our financial system in a way that will allow -- or at least m=
ake it much harder for people to evade paying their fair share. But also =
make it harder for criminals and other people to evade U.S. sanctions.



Q The timing -- were you working on this anyway and did the Panama Papers=
 speed it up? Did some of this have to do specifically with the Panama Pa=
pers?



MR. EARNEST: Id refer you to Treasury in terms of what direct impact any =
of these rules would have on the Panama Papers -- or on the practices tha=
t were exposed by the Panama Papers. What I can tell you is this is somet=
hing that was in the works long before the Panama Papers was reported.



Q Okay. And were you saying that you are ruling out any action or any add=
itional military action against Syria or any other action against Russia =
if the deadline, the August deadline was not observed?



MR. EARNEST: I think the point that Im making here is that there are nega=
tive consequences for everybody if that deadline is not met. And put anot=
her way, everybody who is engaged here, with the possible exception of Ba=
shar al Assad himself, has a vested, personal interest in meeting the dea=
dline to bring about a political transition inside of Syria.=20



So this is not a situation where the United States needs to be walking ar=
ound threatening people. This is not a situation where we, frankly, need =
to be coercing people. We certainly will encourage them to use the influe=
nce that they have to bring about this outcome, but were not going to be =
doing that from the standpoint of asking people to do the United States a=
 favor -- everybody involved in this situation has their vested interest =
in seeing this deadline met. And were going to continue to press hard to =
see that that happens.



Q It is a deadline, though, and it kind of gets to the point of, well, wh=
ats the point of a deadline if it just kind of keeps going? So youre not =
ruling out --=20



MR. EARNEST: But its August, though, so if we dont meet it in August then=
 we can go down that line of questioning.



Q Okay, but youre not ruling anything out? Is that accurate?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly am ruling out the kind of military action =
that would lead one to conclude that there might be some kind of military=
 solution thats available to the United States for solving this problem. =
Theres not -- at least not one thats consistent with our national securit=
y interests. I guess there is one that would lead us to a years long comm=
itment to Syria that would put tens of thousands if not more than 100,000=
 U.S. servicemembers at risk and a whole array of consequences that has a=
 negative impact on our national security over the long term.



Q Okay. And in regard to what the President said today, weve heard him sa=
y some of this before -- that its not entertainment, its not a reality sh=
ow -- although, I mean, a huge number of Americans are very interested in=
 what Donald Trump has to say, whether they agree with him or not. And th=
e President also reiterated that he doesnt think that hell be President b=
ecause Americans have good judgment. But given the numbers and give that =
he is now the Republican nominee essentially, does that mean that way, wa=
y more Americans have bad judgment than the President originally anticipa=
ted?



MR. EARNEST: No. I think the President is merely asserting his confidence=
 that the process that we use to choose the President of the United State=
s is often a source of controversy, its often messy, its often frustratin=
g, but its a process that has served our country well. It doesnt mean the=
 President has agreed with the outcome of every election, but there is a =
rigorous process that gives the American people enormous influence in cho=
osing the future direction of our country. And thats what it means to be =
a democratic government. Its a process that the President is committed to=
. And the President has got confidence in the ability of American voters =
to take that process seriously, to educate themselves on the issues, to e=
ngage in the debate, and allow all of that to inform the choice that they=
 make at the ballot box.



Kenneth.



Q Josh, we could tell from the Presidents remarks that hes itching to get=
 out there on the campaign trail. So does the President believe that the =
House, and the Senate even are in play for the Democrats?



MR. EARNEST: Well, yeah, there obviously is an aggressive campaign that w=
ill be mounted by individual candidates all across the country, and those=
 will be important contests. And, yes, the President is optimistic about =
Democratic prospects up and down the ballot this year.=20



Q On Iran, did the administration have hand-picked beltway insiders to pu=
sh the message, to sell the message of the Iran deal to the public? And t=
he characterization thats out there, it has been reported that the admini=
stration misled the public in a manner as well. How does the administrati=
on respond to that characterization that the public was misled in the sel=
ling of the Iran deal?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I havent seen anybody produce any evidence to indicate=
 that thats the case. I recognize that there might be some people who are=
 disappointed that they did not succeed in killing the Iran deal, and may=
be these unfounded claims are the result of sour grapes.=20



The truth is, the administration, at the direction of the President, enga=
ged in an aggressive campaign to make a strong case to the American peopl=
e that the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nucle=
ar weapon strengthened the national security of the United States. We mad=
e a strong case that it strengthened the national security of our closest=
 ally in the Middle East, Israel. We made a strong case that killing the =
deal would actually make another war in the Middle East more likely.=20



So the President made clear -- he ran on this back in 2007 and 2008 -- th=
at the most effective way for the United States to prevent Iran from obta=
ining a nuclear weapon was strong, principled diplomacy. And he was right=
. And he succeeded in carrying that out, despite the entrenched oppositio=
n and skepticism that something like this was even possible. So the Presi=
dent is quite proud of our success in completing that agreement because o=
f the positive impact that that has had on U.S. national security in the =
short term, and the prospects that it enhances for an improved posture fo=
r the United States around the world over the long term.



Q But, Josh, the characterization Im speaking of came from a profile on y=
our Deputy National Security Advisor, Ben Rhodes. You read that article. =
Im sure youve had time to digest it. Do you disagree with some of the cha=
racterizations that were in that profile?



MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I dont know that he said misleading in there an=
ywhere. It was rather long, so maybe I missed it. But the administration =
is quite proud of the fact that we made a strong, principled, fact-based =
case to the American people that the international agreement, negotiated =
by the Presidents team, to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon w=
asnt just completed; it was effectively implemented in a way that has enh=
anced the national security of the United States. And thats going to be a=
n important part of this Presidents legacy and is a promise he made durin=
g the campaign, and its a promise that he kept as President.



Kevin.



Q Thanks, Josh. How concerned is the President that the much-talked-about=
 67 consecutive months of net-job gains might also end on his watch, give=
n the tepid growth in April?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, were up to 74 consecutive months --=20



Q Thats only private sector -- 67 overall, 74 is just private sector.



MR. EARNEST: I see. And 67 refers to?



Q Total.



MR. EARNEST: Total.



Q So when government loses jobs, its 67.



MR. EARNEST: I see. So youre putting the decline in government jobs on th=
e Presidents tab here?



Q No, no, Im just saying, given the 67 months -- or if you just want to u=
se the 74 figure, thats fine, thats private sector -- how concerned is he=
 --=20



MR. EARNEST: Well, we do know that the private sector was really importan=
t to leading our economic recovery, so thats the number that we focused o=
n.



Q How concerned is he given the relatively tepid growth in April that tha=
t might also end on his watch?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President feels pretty good about the stro=
ng economic growth that we showed in April. And it certainly is consisten=
t with the longer-term trend that weve seen. And so the President is plea=
sed about the direction of the U.S. economy. There is surely more that co=
uld be done, that would ensure that more families across the country are =
enjoying the benefits of that recovery, and our economy would be even str=
onger and even more durable than it already is if Congress werent blockin=
g some common-sense proposals that would strengthen our economy further.



The President talked a lot about how investing in our infrastructure woul=
d be good for our economy, both in the short term and the long term, in p=
art because it would create jobs and generate the kind of economic multip=
lier that would ripple across the economy in a positive way. But whats al=
so true is that there are some headwinds that emanate from overseas that =
the United States must be prepared to weather.=20



Right now, the U.S. economy is the envy of the world. This is the most du=
rable economy in the world. But theres more that we can do to make it eve=
n stronger, and thats why the President believes that Congress should vot=
e to raise the minimum wage.=20



Thats why the President believes that Congress should vote to make import=
ant investments in our infrastructure. Thats why the President believes t=
hat Congress should expand funding for job training and other education p=
rograms that would ensure the next generation of Americans has the skills=
 and training that they need to continue this economic strength that our =
country enjoys. We should not take it for granted. And failing to invest =
in the fundamentals is the surest way to break that streak. And the Presi=
dent is determined to not let that happen.



Q Just to follow then, you mentioned some of the worldwide or internation=
al headwinds. Domestically, our workforce participation rate now is at 62=
.8 percent -- the lowest in decades. What has the President done to stem =
that tide? We heard Jason previously suggest that because more Americans =
are retiring and because were graying, that number is going to shrink. Wh=
ats the President doing to combat that?



MR. EARNEST: Well, one thing we could do -- look, first of all, thats tru=
e. This is a direct function of the longer-term trends in our society, wh=
ich is that as the Baby Boomers age, theyre going to retire and that is g=
oing to put more strain on our workforce. Thats all the more reason that =
making sure we have an educated workforce that we are investing in resear=
ch and development that could boost the environment for businesses that a=
re looking to capitalize on technology and innovation to bring new ideas =
and new products to market.=20



The President also made a reference to reforming our legal immigration sy=
stem. We know that the brightest minds and many of the brightest minds th=
at other countries have to offer are interested in coming to the United S=
tates. Why wouldnt we create an opportunity for entrepreneurs and scienti=
sts and others who are looking to start a business or grow a business to =
come to the United States? That would certainly be good for our economy. =
It would create jobs in our economy, by definition, and would continue to=
 nurture the strong business climate that we have here in the United Stat=
es, where people are given an opportunity to pursue new ideas and get an =
education that will allow them to succeed.



So the President certainly believes that there are a number of things tha=
t we could do, and comprehensive immigration reform that enhances our nat=
ional security but streamlines our legal immigration system is certainly =
another option.



Q Lastly, to the best of your knowledge, has anyone on the current White =
House staff been interviewed in relation to the ongoing investigation int=
o Secretary Clintons email server?



MR. EARNEST: Kevin, as weve discussed before, Im not going to talk about =
ongoing investigations. Its apparent in the newspaper that some people ar=
e willing to do that. But the fact is the people who are leading the inve=
stigation are professionals. They're committed to getting this right. The=
yre committed to doing this by the book and making sure that theyre not i=
nfluenced by political considerations, even in the highly charged politic=
al environment in an election year.=20



So Im going to do my best to help them do what theyre trying to do by giv=
ing them the space that they need to conduct this investigation in the wa=
y that they see fit thats consistent with where the facts lead them. And =
then once they have results that theyre prepared to discuss, we can take =
a look at it.



Q Can you confirm that youve been interviewed?



MR. EARNEST: Im not going to talk about the investigation, but theres no =
reason to think that I have been.



Carol.



Q You seem to be downplaying the significance of the political shake-up i=
n Turkey, but its happening at the same time as the political crisis in I=
raq. And obviously both of these countries are critical to the Presidents=
 strategy against Islamic State. So how can you not think this is such a =
big deal or not have a significant impact on the Presidents strategy? And=
 what is he doing to try to mitigate that?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Carol, at this point, there has been no impact on our =
coordination and our ability to work with Turkey to advance our campaign =
against ISIL. Weve received extensive cooperation from them in the last s=
ix or nine months on a range of issues, and our campaign has benefitted f=
rom that.



Even as we have intensified our cooperation on a set of counter-ISIL issu=
es, weve not refrained from raising our concerns about Turkeys fidelity t=
o their constitution. And were going to continue to make those concerns k=
nown, both in public and in private, when appropriate.



Q Are there any specific logistical plans in place or discussions happeni=
ng on what to do if this worsens? Both in Iraq and Turkey?



MR. EARNEST: Yes, theyre quite different situations. I mean, there are al=
ways people in the United States government who are engaged in contingenc=
y planning, so Im confident thats taking place at some level. But look, w=
hen it comes to the situation in Iraq, we continue to support the efforts=
 of Prime Minister Abadi to try to unify that country. And we believe tha=
ts the most effective way for Iraq to confront the threat that they face =
from ISIL.=20



I think obviously the thing that both of these countries have in common i=
s that theyre sovereign countries with sovereign governments. And we resp=
ect the sovereignty of our partners in the same way that we expect our pa=
rtners to respect the sovereignty of the United States as well. But what =
we can do is we continue to -- we can support these countries as they con=
front the significant challenges that are having a destabilizing impact o=
n their politics in this region of the world.=20



Theres no denying that the instability in Syria, the widespread migration=
 crisis, the violence from ISIL -- all of that has had a negative impact =
on Syrias neighbors. And that certainly doesnt make an effective politica=
l resolution in Turkey and Iraq more likely. I would argue thats actually=
 yet another reason for the United States and the rest of the internation=
al community to continue to drive toward a political transition inside of=
 Syria; that resolving the political turmoil in Syria will have a dampeni=
ng effect on the destabilizing impact that Syria has had on its neighbors=
, including Iraq and Turkey.



Gregory.



Q Thank you, Josh. I dont want to belabor the point, but I want to give y=
ou a chance to go back to the question that you were asked yesterday abou=
t intelligence briefings for presidential candidates. You seemed to leave=
 us with the impression, intentionally or unintentionally, that you were =
not willing to give Mr. Trump the same benefit of the doubt as you would =
Secretary Clinton and his ability to handle classified information respon=
sibly. Was that the impression you meant to give? And also we heard from =
the President just this morning about his concern with some of Mr. Trumps=
 rhetoric, that it could threaten war or has the potential of offending o=
ur critical relationships with other countries. Given those concerns that=
 the President has expressed, should the American people have any concern=
 with this particular presidential candidate receiving our nations most c=
lassified information?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Gregory, the impression that I intended to leave yeste=
rday is that the decision about what material to present to the two presi=
dential candidates who are nominated by the two major political parties w=
ill be made by our professionals in the intelligence community.=20



I did offer an opinion about Secretary Clinton that was rooted in her ser=
vice as Secretary of State in the Obama administration. She is somebody w=
ho undeniably served closely with the President with distinction, and she=
 was critical to advancing a number of policy priorities, including the i=
nternational agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. A=
nd that required her to handle sensitive information and to use it in the=
 course of her job to advance our nations interests. And thats what she d=
id.



But, ultimately, the decision about how and when and where to give the ca=
ndidates these briefings will be made by professionals in the intelligenc=
e community without regard to partisan considerations. In terms of the Am=
erican people, theyll have to make up their own minds. I think that they =
can take -- that certainly is true when it comes to deciding who to vote =
for. But in terms of making decisions about providing sensitive informati=
on to individual candidates, I think the American people can have confide=
nce in our intelligence professionals to make that decision.



Q Its my understanding that, historically, these briefings have always be=
en done as a courtesy by the sitting President -- maybe more than a court=
esy, more of a matter of long-term preservation of our national security =
-- but they are authorized by the sitting President for the candidates fo=
r President. Theres no law requiring these, and the President could use h=
is discretion to give or not -- or to deny these briefings to any preside=
ntial candidate -- is that correct?



MR. EARNEST: Im not sure of the specifics of the law. What I can say is t=
hat the Director of National Intelligence has indicated that hes prepared=
 to move forward at an appropriate time, probably after the convention, w=
ith giving intelligence briefings to the two major party nominees. And Di=
rector Clapper has assigned that responsibility to one of the career inte=
lligence professionals in his office, and the President has confidence in=
 those professionals and their ability to determine how and when those br=
iefings should take place.



Ill give you the last one and then well do the week ahead.



Q Has the President invited the Indian Prime Minister to the White House =
next month? Do you have anything to say?



MR. EARNEST: I dont have an update for you. I know that theres been some =
discussion about the potential of Prime Minister Modi visiting Washington=
 and visiting the White House. I dont have an update for you on those dis=
cussions at this point.



Q And on the statement made by the President today on the shell companies=
 opened by foreigners in the U.S., its reported that quite a number of In=
dian politicians and businesses have opened shell companies here in the U=
.S. Is the U.S. willing to share that information with the Indian governm=
ent and help to get those money back to India?



MR. EARNEST: Well, let me say a couple things about this. The rule that w=
as announced today by the Treasury Department applied to a very specific =
group of LLCs, and it would have an impact on that specific group. I know=
 that it is not uncommon for the United States to reach transparency agre=
ements with other countries in terms of sharing this information -- those=
 are typically reciprocal agreements. I dont know what kind of agreement =
is in place to govern the conversations between the United States and Ind=
ia. Id encourage you to check with my colleagues at the Treasury Departme=
nt and they could provide some additional information about that.



Q -- and on the F-16s to Pakistan. Theres a hold in the Congress right no=
w, and the State Department has informed Pakistan that they should muster=
 their national resources if they want to buy the F-16s. Do you think thi=
s would have any impact on U.S. relations with Pakistan in any way?



MR. EARNEST: Well, what I will just say is something youve heard me say b=
efore, which is that the United States has an important counterterrorism =
and national security relationship with Pakistan. We value the kind of co=
operation that we get with Pakistan and we have found that cooperation be=
neficial to the national security of both of our countries. And President=
 Obama has obviously worked hard, even in some challenging circumstances,=
 to cultivate an effective working relationship with Pakistan. And we bel=
ieve that preserving that relationship and nurturing that relationship is=
 beneficial to the national security of the United States, but also the n=
ational security of Pakistan.



So with that, let me do a week ahead.



On Monday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.



On Tuesday, the President will welcome the NCAA Champion UConn Huskies Wo=
mens basketball team to the White House. He will host an event that will =
honor the team and their 2016 NCAA championship.



On Wednesday and Thursday, the President will attend meetings at the Whit=
e House.



On Friday, the President will host the President of Finland and the Prime=
 Ministers of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland at the White House for =
a U.S.-Nordic Leaders Summit. This event follows the convening of Nordic =
leaders during the Presidents trip to Sweden in September of 2013. This s=
ummit will deepen U.S.-Nordic cooperation while highlighting Americas con=
tinued commitment to European security, transatlantic trade, and the prom=
otion of common democratic values.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; All ri=
ght.&nbsp; Happy Friday, everybody.&nbsp; I don't have anything in addition=
 to that at the top.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to take whatever questions remai=
n -- hopefully there aren&#8217;t many.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circlin=
g back to the campaign, Bernie Sanders is threatening a floor fight today a=
t the Democratic Convention.&nbsp; He wants these committees that pick the =
platform to be made out of proportional numbers based on the results of the=
se
 primaries.&nbsp; As the head of the Democratic Party, does the President h=
ave a view about whether that&#8217;s a fair model that should be pursued?<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Jo=
sh, there are rules and regulations that sort of govern the conduct of the =
convention.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s a whole apparatus at the Democratic Nat=
ional Committee that can follow the guidelines and ensure that our party
 hosts a convention that&#8217;s consistent with the rules but also reflect=
s the preferences of those who participated in primaries and caucuses acros=
s the country.&nbsp; And the President has got a lot of confidence in his D=
NC Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to navigate
 this process and ensure that it concludes fairly and reflects the interest=
s of Democrats across the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on =
that strike that we talked about yesterday in Syria that killed at least 28=
 people, both Russia and Syria are saying their aircraft were not responsib=
le for this.&nbsp; I know you said yesterday you weren&#8217;t aware of any=
 U.S.
 or coalition aircraft in the area.&nbsp; Do you have any more recent intel=
ligence about where that strike came from or who is responsible?<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Josh, I =
can tell you that my colleagues both at the Department of Defense and in th=
e intelligence community are continuing to look at this particular situatio=
n.&nbsp; As I noted yesterday, we&#8217;re not in a position where we
 can draw clear conclusions about who exactly was responsible for this inci=
dent. What is true is that regardless of who was responsible, there is neve=
r any justification for carrying out a strike that targets innocent civilia=
ns, particularly innocent civilians
 that have already fled their homes to escape violence.&nbsp; And, unfortun=
ately, there is a long track record of the Assad regime doing precisely tha=
t.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&#8217;re going to con=
tinue to take a look at this particular incident around Idlib, and it&#8217=
;s obviously an incident that we take quite seriously.&nbsp; But we take qu=
ite seriously the other incidents that we know have been perpetrated by
 the Assad regime against innocent civilians.&nbsp; And the bloodshed that =
we have seen inside Syria is astonishing and tragic.&nbsp; And too much of =
that blood is the blood of innocent civilians, and it&#8217;s on the hands =
of Bashar al Assad and members of his government.&nbsp;
 And that is why we have made a strong case that Bashar al Assad needs to l=
eave power and make room for the kind of political transition inside of Syr=
ia that&#8217;s long overdue, so that a political leader inside of Syria ca=
n assume power and unify that country
 and bring an end to the chaos and the violence.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that=
 transition, the administration has set this August deadline for a politica=
l transition in Syria.&nbsp; What exactly is the U.S. threatening to do if =
that deadline is not met?&nbsp; And does the White House feel that the Pres=
ident
 has credibility behind any kind of threat, given his reluctance to strike =
a few years ago?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Jo=
sh, I&#8217;m not aware of any threats that have been issued.&nbsp; I think=
 what Secretary Kerry and others have laid out is a framework for carrying =
out painstaking political talks.&nbsp; And those political talks have been
 undermined by the propensity of the Assad regime to carry out attacks agai=
nst innocent civilians inside of Syria.&nbsp; Opposition leaders are unders=
tandably reluctant to come to the table with people who are, at the very sa=
me time, authorizing military assaults
 against their constituents.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we haven&#8217;t seen as=
 much progress in these political talks as we would like to see.&nbsp; But =
the fact that the U.N. is even able to identify parties to the talks and ha=
s over the last several months been able to organize proximity talks
 is an indication that we&#8217;ve made more progress than we have over the=
 last five years.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re still a long way from the kind of p=
olitical agreement that we need to see.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Pre=
sident Erdogan is moving very quickly to try and consolidate power after th=
e Prime Minister&#8217;s resignation.&nbsp; I was curious in how the U.S. f=
eels about -- whether you have any concerns about that much power amassing =
in the
 Turkish presidency in light of some of your concerns about press freedom a=
nd the Kurds and other issues.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Jo=
sh, obviously, as I mentioned yesterday, the United States and Turkey are N=
ATO allies, and we have worked effectively with the Turks to expedite some =
elements of our counter-ISIL campaign.&nbsp; For example, Turkey
 has given the United States and other members of our coalition access to m=
ilitary facilities in Turkey that have made our military campaign even more=
 effective against ISIL.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve also seen Turkey make some progr=
ess in securing their border with Syria that
 has blunted the flow of weapons and foreign fighters across the border int=
o Syria.&nbsp; Both of those things have been beneficial in our efforts to =
degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That has not, however, pr=
evented the United States or even the President of the United States from r=
aising concerns about situations in which the Turkish government does not s=
eem sufficiently committed to protecting
 the basic universal human rights of their people -- that, by the way, are =
enshrined in the Turkish constitution.&nbsp; These are rights that the Unit=
ed States advocates for around the world, and we do not hesitate in raising=
 concerns even when those concerns involve
 the actions carried out by a government with whom the United States has an=
 important alliance.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that will continue.&n=
bsp; Even as Turkey works through some of this -- through this political di=
spute and through this political turmoil, the United States is going to con=
tinue to stand by our ally; we&#8217;re going to
 continue to work effectively with them to carry out a military campaign ag=
ainst ISIL; and we&#8217;re not going to hesitate to publicly and privately=
 encourage them to live up to the principles that are enshrined in the Turk=
ish constitution.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeff.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, i=
s the White House watching the congress in North Korea that Kim Jong-un ope=
ned today in which he talked about nuclear successes but also boosting econ=
omic development?&nbsp; Do you take that seriously?&nbsp; And what&#8217;s =
your reaction
 to that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e administration is obviously aware of developments in North Korea and we w=
atch them closely to the extent that those kinds of developments occur in p=
ublic.&nbsp; That makes this situation a little unusual.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We obviously are aware of t=
he risk that is posed by North Korea&#8217;s effort to develop nuclear weap=
ons and systems capable of delivering those nuclear weapons.&nbsp; The Unit=
ed States has worked effectively with the international community
 to counter those efforts, and as a result, North Korea has faced increasin=
g isolation, which is saying something because they were pretty isolated at=
 the end of last year and that trajectory has only gotten worse for them.&n=
bsp; And we know that it&#8217;s had a negative
 impact on what is already a rather weak economy.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Our efforts have targeted=
 those elements of the North Korean economy that we know benefit North Kore=
a&#8217;s weapons programs, and our concerns stem from the fact that those =
programs are inconsistent with their international
 obligations.&nbsp; And those aren&#8217;t just concerns that the United St=
ates has raised; those are concerns that have also been raised by countries=
 like China and Russia and South Korea and Japan.&nbsp; And the internation=
al community is serious about holding North Korea
 to account for their destabilizing and provocative behavior, and there is =
a path that North Korea can take to come out of the wilderness, to emerge f=
rom isolation, but it will require them renouncing nuclear weapons and demo=
nstrating a clear commitment to
 ending their provocative actions and denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&#8217;s move around a l=
ittle bit.&nbsp; April.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, I=
 did ask the President about Howard and he chose not to answer.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I notice=
d.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to talk about it tomorrow, though.&nbsp; (Laughte=
r.)&nbsp; That&#8217;s the good news, I guess.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you=
 said you were going to give us information today.&nbsp; Are you going to n=
ot talk because the President didn&#8217;t answer?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, I ca=
n try to give you a sense of what he&#8217;s thinking.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll try=
.&nbsp; I do think -- I looked this up before I came out here.&nbsp; This i=
s actually the third time that the President has delivered a commencement a=
ddress at an
 HBCU since entering the Oval Office.&nbsp; Back in 2010, the President gav=
e the commencement address at Hampton University.&nbsp; And in 2013, the Pr=
esident delivered the commencement address at Morehouse College in Atlanta.=
&nbsp; So the President, in delivering the commencement
 address at Howard, will be delivering the commencement address at the thir=
d HBCU since taking office.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President will address =
a couple of themes.&nbsp; The first, the President will acknowledge the uni=
que opportunity that these graduates have had to attend one of the finest H=
BCUs in the country.&nbsp; This means that they&#8217;ve been exposed
 to passionate faculty members and a community of classmates that has nurtu=
red their innate ability and empowered them with skills and experiences tha=
t can benefit our country.&nbsp; So this means that Howard students have be=
en given a great gift, but they also
 are assuming an important responsibility.&nbsp; And I do expect that the P=
resident will touch on that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President will also obs=
erve that Howard graduates will be entering an economy and a society that&#=
8217;s undergoing a series of profound changes.&nbsp; These changes aren&#8=
217;t new in the sense that the changes didn&#8217;t just start, but this i=
s
 actually -- the class of 2016 has had a view of these changes throughout t=
heir lives.&nbsp; And how they use the skills that they&#8217;ve gotten in =
the course of this high-quality college education to confront the tremendou=
s demographic, economic and technological changes
 that our country is experiencing right now is a question that each of thos=
e graduates will have to answer for themselves.&nbsp; The President is hope=
ful that they&#8217;ll answer that question in a way that&#8217;s good for =
the country and is consistent with the significant
 responsibility that they now have.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I think the last t=
hing I&#8217;d point out is, as somebody who has spent a decent portion of =
his professional career talking to young people and college graduates, the =
President enjoys the opportunity to give these kinds of speeches,
 but also to consider these issues that are on the minds of college graduat=
es across the country.&nbsp; And obviously this speech that he&#8217;s deli=
vering tomorrow is an important one and an opportunity that he&#8217;s look=
ing forward to, but the President will have an opportunity
 to flesh out some of these themes in commencement addresses that he&#8217;=
ll also deliver at Rutgers and the Air Force Academy later this year.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So were=
 you able to get the information that you were trying to find from yesterda=
y, you said you would find for me when it comes to this administration and =
HBCU&#8217;s funding and support, et cetera?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, I&#=
8217;ve got a factsheet here.&nbsp; Rather than just reading through it, wh=
y don&#8217;t I -- I&#8217;ll have somebody email it to you when we get don=
e.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you=
 just highlight the --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the highlight is that the President&#8217;s FY-2017 budget seeks to s=
trengthen funding for HBCUs. We&#8217;ve made a lot of progress over the la=
st seven or eight years in increasing the support that HBCUs receive, but
 the President&#8217;s budget proposes $85 million in mandatory funding for=
 HBCUs.&nbsp; The President also proposes an additional $244 million in dis=
cretionary funds for Title III.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the other thing tha=
t I would acknowledge is the President has sought to dramatically expand ac=
cess to the Pell grant program for college students across the country.&nbs=
p; This, of course, does not apply just to African American
 college students but it does tangibly enhance the ability of middle-class =
families and those families that are trying to get into the middle class to=
 send their kids to college.&nbsp; And the President&#8217;s funding propos=
al for 2017 reflects continued commitment to
 that expansion of the Pell grant program that I think many HBCU students h=
ave actually used to afford a high-quality education at Howard University.<=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let&=
#8217;s go to 2016, the monies that are actually realized, the monies that =
actually passed. What was the number for 2016 for this fiscal year that we&=
#8217;re still in?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t have that in front of me, but I can pull it and we can try to get you=
 some additional data.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, I=
 don&#8217;t know if you saw that Hillary Clinton has finally come out agai=
nst the possibility of TPP being passed during a lame duck session.&nbsp; I=
 was wondering what you think of that, and whether it makes it look like th=
e President&#8217;s
 trade agenda is at risk of unraveling.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, An=
drew, I&#8217;m not particularly surprised by it.&nbsp; Her views on this t=
opic are well-known.&nbsp; But it doesn&#8217;t really change our strategy.=
&nbsp; The truth is Secretary Clinton and many other leading candidates for=
 the presidency
 last year expressed opposition to Trade Promotion Authority legislation.&n=
bsp; This is ultimately legislation that paved the way for the completion o=
f the TPP negotiations.&nbsp; And in spite of her opposition to that legisl=
ation, the administration worked effectively
 with Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the Senate to pass th=
at bill.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth is passing TPA is=
 a bigger challenge than getting Congress to ratify TPP for a couple of rea=
sons.&nbsp; The first is a procedural one, which is that TPA had to overcom=
e a filibuster effort in the United States Senate.&nbsp; TPP only
 requires 50 votes in the Senate to be ratified by the United States Senate=
.&nbsp; But the second thing -- and in some ways, this is more important --=
 TPA was rooted in a philosophical argument about giving the President of t=
he United States the authority to negotiate
 a trade agreement that&#8217;s in the best interest of the U.S. economy.&n=
bsp; That required us essentially to make a strong case that the United Sta=
tes Congress should trust the President to get this done and actually give =
him the authority necessary to complete the
 negotiations.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we&#8217;ve comple=
ted the negotiations, the American people and members of the United States =
Congress can evaluate the terms of the agreement and judge for themselves a=
bout whether or not it&#8217;s good for the economy.&nbsp; If they&#8217;re=
 willing
 to do that, we&#8217;ve got a very strong argument to make.&nbsp; For exam=
ple, the TPP trade agreement would result in cutting 18,000 taxes that othe=
r countries impose on American products.&nbsp; The TPP agreement includes h=
igh and enforceable standards when it comes to protecting
 our environment, protecting human rights, and protecting labor rights.&nbs=
p; Those are the kinds of values-driven proposals that are included in the =
TPP agreement.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But those don&#8217;t jus=
t reflect our values; they also reflect a commitment on the part of this Pr=
esident to leveling the playing field and giving American businesses and Am=
erican workers an even better opportunity
 to compete in a 21st century global economy.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the President has mad=
e a strong case as recently as this week in The Washington Post -- he wrote=
 an op-ed basically making clear that if the United States refuses to engag=
e in Southeast Asia and produce a set
 of economic standards, then China will.&nbsp; And when China comes in to w=
rite the rules of the road instead of putting in place those standards, the=
y&#8217;re not going to insist on high environmental standards.&nbsp; They&=
#8217;re certainly not going to insist on lofty human
 rights or labor standards.&nbsp; And that will only further -- if they suc=
ceed in doing that, that will only further disadvantage U.S. businesses and=
 U.S. workers when they&#8217;re competing for business in Southeast Asia.&=
nbsp; This is significant because Southeast Asia
 is home to some of the most dynamic economies in the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So from an economic, stra=
tegic, and values perspective, we have a very strong argument to make about=
 the wisdom of Congress moving to approve the TPP agreement that the Presid=
ent negotiated.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anoth=
er question on trade.&nbsp; The Chinese believe that in 2001 they had an ag=
reement with the U.S. -- you and various other WTO partners to, from Decemb=
er 11th, be treated as if it were a market economy for the
 purposes of antidumping duties.&nbsp; What would China have to do -- well,=
 do you have the same assessment that China, after the 11th of December, mu=
st be treated as if it were a market economy?&nbsp; Are you ready to declar=
e the market economy?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; My und=
erstanding, Andrew, about this, is rudimentary, but my understanding is tha=
t those kinds of assessments are actually reached by the Commerce Departmen=
t.&nbsp; So I&#8217;d refer you to them for a sense
 of our current assessment of China&#8217;s economy.&nbsp; I&#8217;d also r=
efer you to them to answer the question about whether or not they&#8217;re =
considering changing that assessment.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.=
&nbsp; And sorry, just a final question -- just to clear up something you s=
aid in response to Josh.&nbsp; Secretary Kerry actually said there would be=
 consequences if Russia didn&#8217;t meet the August deadline, which
 is enshrined in the Vienna process.&nbsp; But you seem to be saying that e=
ven if they keep on breaking the truce, even if there&#8217;s no prospect o=
f further talks, even if they keep bombing IDP camps, that there are still =
going to be more talks if that&#8217;s the only way
 forward.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think what Secretary Kerry is pointing out is that Russia and President P=
utin himself has publicly advocated for a political transition inside of Sy=
ria.&nbsp; President Putin himself has acknowledged
 that this is an important priority.&nbsp; And failing to meet that deadlin=
e will have negative consequences for everybody that&#8217;s involved.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We know that Russia -- we=
 know based on the degree to which Russia has invested in Syria that they c=
are deeply about the outcome.&nbsp; They have a lot riding on this.&nbsp; R=
ussia maintains a military presence inside of
 Syria.&nbsp; Syria is the only country outside of the former Soviet bloc w=
here Russia continues to have a military presence.&nbsp; So we know that th=
ey&#8217;re quite protective of it, and concerned about what&#8217;s happen=
ing in that country so that they can protect the foothold
 they have in that country.&nbsp; Failing to succeed in negotiating a polit=
ical transition is not going to be good for the Russians.&nbsp; It will hav=
e negative consequences for them.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I&#8217;m not saying the =
United States benefits from that.&nbsp; It has negative consequences for ev=
erybody that&#8217;s involved there.&nbsp; It certainly has negative conseq=
uences for everybody who&#8217;s concerned about the widespread
 violence that we&#8217;ve seen there.&nbsp; So I think the point is the in=
ternational community is focused on meeting this goal, and that is a priori=
ty and it&#8217;s something that President Putin has demonstrated he&#8217;=
s deeply invested in.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Look, to a large extent, =
he&#8217;s put his own credibility on the line here.&nbsp; He&#8217;s made =
clear that he&#8217;s prepared to use his influence with the Assad regime t=
o bring about this political transition that benefits Russia
 and that benefits the Syrian people and that benefits everybody who is inv=
olved.&nbsp; So it will be important for Russia to use their influence to t=
ry to advance these talks and bring them to a constructive conclusion on a =
timeframe that&#8217;s been laid out.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The United States is cert=

 clear that they expect the Assad regime to do their part as well.<o:p></o:=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8=
217;ve mostly focused on Russia on this.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, i=
t&#8217;s the Syrian regime.&nbsp; Would you not rule out -- would you rule=
 out any measures against the Syrian regime if they were to stop, if they
 were to breeze through this August deadline?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
let me say -- let me take on one part of the early part of your question, w=
hich is that when the President was meeting with the GCC countries, he cert=
ainly made clear to them that it&#8217;s helpful
 for them to use their influence with the opposition groups and other relev=
ant parties to try to bring about this political transition.&nbsp; So it&#8=
217;s not just the Russian government that we have been pressing, and we&#8=
217;ve been pressing all of the parties.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been
 using our own influence with the opposition groups, but we certainly have =
encouraged our partners, who also have influence with the opposition groups=
, to push in the same direction here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What was the last part of=

re.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why n=
ot address the problem at its root?&nbsp; Why not take action directly agai=
nst the Syrian regime?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Andrew, because the President has made clear there&#8217;s not a military s=
olution that can be imposed on the situation in Syria.&nbsp; I know I&#8217=
;ve said that a lot and other administration officials have,
 and it sounds a little clich=E9 at this point, but it is a core principle =
of our approach to this situation.&nbsp; This should be a lesson that we le=
arned in 2003 -- that trying to overthrow a dictator in the Middle East has=
 long-term and mostly negative consequences
 for the United States and our national security.&nbsp; To say nothing of t=
he cost that would be incurred if we were to undertake that kind of action.=
&nbsp; The President would have to deploy thousands, tens of thousands, if =
not more than 100,000 U.S. troops on the ground
 that would cost a lot of money.&nbsp; That would mean that the United Stat=
es military would sustain significant casualties.&nbsp; And all of that wou=
ld be done without a clear exit plan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we can&#8217;t lose tr=
ack of that recent historical context when evaluating our options.&nbsp; Th=
e President certainly hasn&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s why we have pressed so=
 forcefully and with such tenacity on the successful completion
 of political talks.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve got a long way to go, but that c=
ontinues to be our focus.<o:p></o:p></p>

 these eight tax treaties.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I thin=
k he was pretty gentle when you consider that these are tax treaties that h=
ave been waiting for congressional approval for -- I wrote this down -- I t=
hink it&#8217;s since -- there&#8217;s one treaty in
 particular, I believe it&#8217;s with Switzerland, that&#8217;s been pendi=
ng ratification by the United States Senate I believe since 2011.&nbsp; So =
this tax treaty that we have with Switzerland since January of 2011 has bee=
n awaiting congressional approval.&nbsp; We also have
 a critically important tax treaty with Luxembourg that&#8217;s been awaiti=
ng congressional approval since 2010.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re talking about mo=
re than five years of delay here.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The benefit is simply we =
know that there are companies that use the Swiss and whatever the adjective=
 of Luxembourg is -- (laughter) -- their financial systems.&nbsp; We know t=
hat there are people who use the financial
 systems in Switzerland and Luxembourg to evade taxation and, in some cases=
, to even hide their resources because they are the result of criminal acti=
ons.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I don&#8217;t really k=
now exactly what the justification -- what justification Senator Paul would=
 have for not moving forward with these agreements that would allow our law=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right=

at these treaties would infringe on Americans&#8217; personal tax data and =
other personal financial information.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m wondering what
 the White House or the administration has done to assuage those concerns t=
hat Senator Paul has?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
my guess is, he&#8217;s not raising concerns on the part of too many middle=

heir assets.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m not really sure whose concerns
 Senator Paul is speaking up for.&nbsp; Maybe he can elaborate on that a li=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I know that there have been conversations with members of Congress on a who=

that the President has made here, and we&#8217;ve made a lot of important p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
the rules that were announced today are actually rules that have taken at l=
east a couple of years to put together.&nbsp; Obviously the nature of these=
 rules is that they apply to extraordinarily complex
 financial transactions.&nbsp; So our experts had to comb through the regul=
ations and ensure that there were no unintended consequences from the rules=
 that are being put in place.&nbsp; So they were quite conscientious about =
this.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But there is no denying t=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I certainly am ruling out the kind of military action that would lead one t=

available to the United States for solving this
 problem.&nbsp; There&#8217;s not -- at least not one that&#8217;s consiste=

uld lead us to a years&#8217; long commitment to Syria that would put tens =
of thousands if not more than 100,000 U.S. servicemembers at
 risk and a whole array of consequences that has a negative impact on our n=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.=
&nbsp; And in regard to what the President said today, we&#8217;ve heard hi=
m say some of this before -- that it&#8217;s not entertainment, it&#8217;s =
not a reality show -- although, I mean, a huge number of Americans are very
 interested in what Donald Trump has to say, whether they agree with him or=
 not.&nbsp; And the President also reiterated that he doesn&#8217;t think t=
hat he&#8217;ll be President because Americans have good judgment.&nbsp; Bu=
t given the numbers and give that he is now the Republican
 nominee essentially, does that mean that way, way more Americans have bad =
judgment than the President originally anticipated?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nb=

ss that we use to choose the President of the United States is often a sour=
ce of controversy, it&#8217;s often messy, it&#8217;s often
 frustrating, but it&#8217;s a process that has served our country well.&nb=
sp; It doesn&#8217;t mean the President has agreed with the outcome of ever=
y election, but there is a rigorous process that gives the American people =
enormous influence in choosing the future direction
 of our country.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what it means to be a democratic go=
vernment.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a process that the President is committed to.&nb=
sp; And the President has got confidence in the ability of American voters =
to take that process seriously, to educate themselves on the
 issues, to engage in the debate, and allow all of that to inform the choic=
e that they make at the ballot box.<o:p></o:p></p>

 we could tell from the President&#8217;s remarks that he&#8217;s itching t=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
yeah, there obviously is an aggressive campaign that will be mounted by ind=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Ir=
an, did the administration have &#8220;hand-picked&#8221; beltway insiders =
to push the message, to sell the message of the Iran deal to the public?&nb=
sp; And the characterization that&#8217;s out there, it has been reported
 that the administration misled the public in a manner as well.&nbsp; How d=
oes the administration respond to that characterization that the public was=
 misled in the selling of the Iran deal?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I haven&#8217;t seen anybody produce any evidence to indicate that that&#82=
17;s the case.&nbsp; I recognize that there might be some people who are di=
sappointed that they did not succeed in killing the Iran deal,
 and maybe these unfounded claims are the result of sour grapes.&nbsp; <o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The truth is, the adminis=
tration, at the direction of the President, engaged in an aggressive campai=
gn to make a strong case to the American people that the international agre=
ement to prevent Iran from obtaining
 a nuclear weapon strengthened the national security of the United States.&=
nbsp; We made a strong case that it strengthened the national security of o=
ur closest ally in the Middle East, Israel.&nbsp; We made a strong case tha=
t killing the deal would actually make another
 war in the Middle East more likely.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the President made cle=
ar -- he ran on this back in 2007 and 2008 -- that the most effective way f=
or the United States to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was st=
rong, principled diplomacy.&nbsp; And he
 was right.&nbsp; And he succeeded in carrying that out, despite the entren=
ched opposition and skepticism that something like this was even possible.&=
nbsp; So the President is quite proud of our success in completing that agr=
eement because of the positive impact that
 that has had on U.S. national security in the short term, and the prospect=
s that it enhances for an improved posture for the United States around the=
 world over the long term.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, =
Josh, the characterization I&#8217;m speaking of came from a profile on you=

.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve had time to digest it.&nbsp; Do you dis=
agree with
 some of the characterizations that were in that profile?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
again, I don&#8217;t know that he said &#8220;misleading&#8221; in there an=
ywhere.&nbsp; It was rather long, so maybe I missed it.&nbsp; But the admin=
istration is quite proud of the fact that we made a strong, principled,
 fact-based case to the American people that the international agreement, n=
egotiated by the President&#8217;s team, to prevent Iran from obtaining a n=
uclear weapon wasn&#8217;t just completed; it was effectively implemented i=
n a way that has enhanced the national security
 of the United States. And that&#8217;s going to be an important part of th=
is President&#8217;s legacy and is a promise he made during the campaign, a=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
we do know that the private sector was really important to leading our econ=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think the President feels pretty good about the strong economic growth th=
at we showed in April.&nbsp; And it certainly is consistent with the longer=
-term trend that we&#8217;ve seen.&nbsp; And so the President
 is pleased about the direction of the U.S. economy.&nbsp; There is surely =
more that could be done, that would ensure that more families across the co=
untry are enjoying the benefits of that recovery, and our economy would be =
even stronger and even more durable than
 it already is if Congress weren&#8217;t blocking some common-sense proposa=
ls that would strengthen our economy further.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The President talked a lo=
t about how investing in our infrastructure would be good for our economy, =
both in the short term and the long term, in part because it would create j=
obs and generate the kind of economic
 multiplier that would ripple across the economy in a positive way.&nbsp; B=
ut what&#8217;s also true is that there are some headwinds that emanate fro=
m overseas that the United States must be prepared to weather.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Right now, the U.S. econo=
my is the envy of the world.&nbsp; This is the most durable economy in the =
world.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s more that we can do to make it even stronger=
, and that&#8217;s why the President believes that Congress
 should vote to raise the minimum wage.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That&#8217;s why the Pres=
ident believes that Congress should vote to make important investments in o=
ur infrastructure.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why the President believes that Congr=
ess should expand funding for job training and other
 education programs that would ensure the next generation of Americans has =
the skills and training that they need to continue this economic strength t=
hat our country enjoys.&nbsp; We should not take it for granted.&nbsp; And =
failing to invest in the fundamentals is the
 surest way to break that streak.&nbsp; And the President is determined to =
not let that happen.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just =
to follow then, you mentioned some of the worldwide or international headwi=
nds.&nbsp; Domestically, our workforce participation rate now is at 62.8 pe=
rcent -- the lowest in decades.&nbsp; What has the President
 done to stem that tide?&nbsp; We heard Jason previously suggest that becau=
se more Americans are retiring and because we&#8217;re graying, that number=
 is going to shrink.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the President doing to combat that?=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
one thing we could do -- look, first of all, that&#8217;s true.&nbsp; This =
is a direct function of the longer-term trends in our society, which is tha=
t as the Baby Boomers age, they&#8217;re going to retire and
 that is going to put more strain on our workforce.&nbsp; That&#8217;s all =
the more reason that making sure we have an educated workforce that we are =
investing in research and development that could boost the environment for =
businesses that are looking to capitalize on
 technology and innovation to bring new ideas and new products to market.&n=
bsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The President also made a=
 reference to reforming our legal immigration system.&nbsp; We know that th=
e brightest minds and many of the brightest minds that other countries have=
 to offer are interested in coming to the
 United States.&nbsp; Why wouldn&#8217;t we create an opportunity for entre=
preneurs and scientists and others who are looking to start a business or g=
row a business to come to the United States?&nbsp; That would certainly be =
good for our economy. It would create jobs in our
 economy, by definition, and would continue to nurture the strong business =
climate that we have here in the United States, where people are given an o=
pportunity to pursue new ideas and get an education that will allow them to=
 succeed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the President certainl=

nsive immigration reform that enhances our national security but streamline=

 another option.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastl=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Kevin,=
 as we&#8217;ve discussed before, I&#8217;m not going to talk about ongoing=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I&#8217;m going to do =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Carol, at this point, there has been no impact on our coordination and our =
ability to work with Turkey to advance our campaign against ISIL.&nbsp; We&=

 the last six or nine months on a range of issues, and our campaign has ben=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Even as we have intensifi=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are t=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, t=

, so I&#8217;m confident that&#8217;s taking place at some level.&nbsp;
 But look, when it comes to the situation in Iraq, we continue to support t=
he efforts of Prime Minister Abadi to try to unify that country.&nbsp; And =
we believe that&#8217;s the most effective way for Iraq to confront the thr=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think obviously the thi=

 our partners to respect the sovereignty of the United States as well.&nbsp=
; But what we can do is we continue to -- we can support these countries as=
 they confront the significant challenges that are having a destabilizing i=
mpact on their politics in this region
 of the world.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">There&#8217;s no denying =
that the instability in Syria, the widespread migration crisis, the violenc=
e from ISIL -- all of that has had a negative impact on Syria&#8217;s neigh=
bors.&nbsp; And that certainly doesn&#8217;t make an effective
 political resolution in Turkey and Iraq more likely.&nbsp; I would argue t=
hat&#8217;s actually yet another reason for the United States and the rest =
of the international community to continue to drive toward a political tran=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
 you, Josh.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to belabor the point, but I want to gi=
ve you a chance to go back to the question that you were asked yesterday ab=
out intelligence briefings for presidential candidates.&nbsp; You seemed
 to leave us with the impression, intentionally or unintentionally, that yo=
u were not willing to give Mr. Trump the same benefit of the doubt as you w=
ould Secretary Clinton and his ability to handle classified information res=
ponsibly.&nbsp; Was that the impression
 you meant to give?&nbsp; And also we heard from the President just this mo=
rning about his concern with some of Mr. Trump&#8217;s rhetoric, that it co=
uld threaten war or has the potential of offending our critical relationshi=
ps with other countries.&nbsp; Given those concerns
 that the President has expressed, should the American people have any conc=
ern with this particular presidential candidate receiving our nation&#8217;=
s most classified information?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Gregory, the impression that I intended to leave yesterday is that the deci=
sion about what material to present to the two presidential candidates who =
are nominated by the two major political
 parties will be made by our professionals in the intelligence community.&n=
bsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I did offer an opinion ab=
out Secretary Clinton that was rooted in her service as Secretary of State =
in the Obama administration.&nbsp; She is somebody who undeniably served cl=
osely with the President with distinction,
 and she was critical to advancing a number of policy priorities, including=
 the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapo=
n.&nbsp; And that required her to handle sensitive information and to use i=
t in the course of her job to advance
 our nation&#8217;s interests.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what she did.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But, ultimately, the deci=
sion about how and when and where to give the candidates these briefings wi=
ll be made by professionals in the intelligence community without regard to=
 partisan considerations.&nbsp; In terms
 of the American people, they&#8217;ll have to make up their own minds.&nbs=
p; I think that they can take -- that certainly is true when it comes to de=
ciding who to vote for.&nbsp; But in terms of making decisions about provid=
ing sensitive information to individual candidates,
 I think the American people can have confidence in our intelligence profes=
sionals to make that decision.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8=
217;s my understanding that, historically, these briefings have always been=
 done as a courtesy by the sitting President -- maybe more than a courtesy,=
 more of a matter of long-term preservation of our national
 security -- but they are authorized by the sitting President for the candi=
dates for President.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no law requiring these, and the Pr=
esident could use his discretion to give or not -- or to deny these briefin=
gs to any presidential candidate -- is that
 correct?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#821=
7;m not sure of the specifics of the law.&nbsp; What I can say is that the =
Director of National Intelligence has indicated that he&#8217;s prepared to=
 move forward at an appropriate time, probably after the convention,
 with giving intelligence briefings to the two major party nominees.&nbsp; =
And Director Clapper has assigned that responsibility to one of the career =
intelligence professionals in his office, and the President has confidence =
in those professionals and their ability
 to determine how and when those briefings should take place.<o:p></o:p></p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I&#8217;ll give you the l=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has t=
he President invited the Indian Prime Minister to the White House next mont=
h?&nbsp; Do you have anything to say?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&=
#8217;t have an update for you.&nbsp; I know that there&#8217;s been some d=
iscussion about the potential of Prime Minister Modi visiting Washington an=
d visiting the White House.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have an update for you
 on those discussions at this point.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And o=
n the statement made by the President today on the shell companies opened b=
y foreigners in the U.S., it&#8217;s reported that quite a number of Indian=
 politicians and businesses have opened shell companies here
 in the U.S.&nbsp; Is the U.S. willing to share that information with the I=
ndian government and help to get those money back to India?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
let me say a couple things about this.&nbsp; The rule that was announced to=
day by the Treasury Department applied to a very specific group of LLCs, an=
d it would have an impact on that specific group.&nbsp;
 I know that it is not uncommon for the United States to reach transparency=
 agreements with other countries in terms of sharing this information -- th=
ose are typically reciprocal agreements.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what kind=
 of agreement is in place to govern the conversations
 between the United States and India.&nbsp; I&#8217;d encourage you to chec=
k with my colleagues at the Treasury Department and they could provide some=
 additional information about that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- an=
d on the F-16s to Pakistan.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a hold in the Congress righ=
t now, and the State Department has informed Pakistan that they should must=
er their national resources if they want to buy the F-16s.&nbsp; Do
 you think this would have any impact on U.S. relations with Pakistan in an=
y way?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
what I will just say is something you&#8217;ve heard me say before, which i=
s that the United States has an important counterterrorism and national sec=
urity relationship with Pakistan.&nbsp; We value the
 kind of cooperation that we get with Pakistan and we have found that coope=
ration beneficial to the national security of both of our countries.&nbsp; =
And President Obama has obviously worked hard, even in some challenging cir=
cumstances, to cultivate an effective
 working relationship with Pakistan.&nbsp; And we believe that preserving t=
hat relationship and nurturing that relationship is beneficial to the natio=
nal security of the United States, but also the national security of Pakist=
an.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
