It's out, by the way:

Bernie Sanders says he's backing DNC chair's primary opponent

Washington (CNN)Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday said he supports De=
mocratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Democrati=
c opponent in her August 30 primary, adding that if he is elected president=
, he would effectively terminate her chairmanship of the DNC.


Sanders, whose campaign has engaged in an increasingly bitter feud with the=
 DNC chairwoman during his presidential bid, said in an interview set to ai=
r on CNN's "State of the Union" that he favors Tim Canova in Florida's 23rd=
 congressional district. Canova is supporting Sanders.


"Well, clearly, I favor her opponent," Sanders told Tapper. "His views are =
much closer to mine than as to Wasserman Shultz's."

Sanders added that if he's elected president, he wouldn't reappoint Wasserm=
an Schultz to head the DNC.


Sanders' campaign has long been critical<http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/17/poli=
tics/bernie-sanders-democratic-establishment-battle-boils-over/> of Wasserm=
an Shultz's performance as head of the committee, claiming that the DNC has=
 favored his presidential primary challenger, Hillary Clinton. Sanders and =
his supporters have complained about the nomination process and ways they b=
elieve it has helped Clinton, including debates held on Saturday nights, cl=
osed primaries in major states such as New York, and the use of superdelega=
tes -- essentially free-agent party and union stalwarts who are overwhelmin=
gly backing Clinton.

Canova, who teaches at Nova Southeastern University Shepard Broad College o=
f Law in Fort Lauderdale, was asked in 2011 to serve on Sanders' Wall Stree=
t reform advisory panel. He has called<http://timcanova.com/> for greater r=
egulation of Wall Street, writing on his campaign website that "we are now =
in a new Gilded Age." Like Sanders, he also opposes the Trans-Pacific Partn=
ership trade deal.

"Time and time again, (Clinton) has voted to protect the pools of dark mone=
y in politics," Canova recently told<http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/t=
im-canova-onetime-bernie-sanders-adviser-is-running-against-debbie-wasserma=
n-schultz-7518432> the New Times newspaper of Broward-Palm Beach.


While Sanders has a strong ability to raise money and thus could impact the=
 race, he did not fare well in Wasserman Schultz's congressional district d=
uring the March Florida presidential primary, scoring 30.1% of the vote com=
pared with Clinton's 68%.

e<http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/18/politics/jeff-weaver-debbie-wasserman-schul=
tz-throwing-shade/>

On Wednesday, Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, slammed<http://www.cn=
n.com/2016/05/18/politics/jeff-weaver-debbie-wasserman-schultz-throwing-sha=
de/> Wasserman Schultz after she told CNN the Vermont senator did not do en=
ough to condemn his supporters' behavior at the party's raucous Nevada conv=
ention last week.


"We can have a long conversation about Debbie Wasserman Schultz just about =
how she's been throwing shade on the Sanders campaign from the very beginni=
ng," Weaver told CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day."


"It's not the DNC," Weaver added. "By and large, people in the DNC have bee=
n good to us. Debbie Wasserman Schultz really is the exception."

Wasserman Schultz has pushed back against Sanders' accusation that the part=
y had rigged the system against him.


"We've had the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama. These rules w=
ere adopted for state parties all across the country in 2014," she said ear=
lier this week.

Asked about the "throwing shade" line on Wednesday, Wasserman Schultz told =
CNN's Wolf Blitzer, "My response to that is hashtag SMH (shake my head)."
