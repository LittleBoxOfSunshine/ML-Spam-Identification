For Immediate Release   May 5, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT AT

2016 CINCO DE MAYO RECEPTION



East Room







4:12 P.M. EDT=20



THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. (Applause.)=20



AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!



THE PRESIDENT: No, no, I can't. No, no, no.=20



AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!



THE PRESIDENT: Let me say, in addition to the Constitution, Michelle will=
 not allow that. (Laughter.) Buenas tardes. (Applause.)=20



AUDIENCE: Buenas tardes!



THE PRESIDENT: Feliz Cinco de Mayo! (Applause.) Bienvenidos a la Casa Bla=
nca. (Applause.)=20



 This is one of our best fiestas of the year. And I want to thank Yaneley=
 for not only the introduction, but for being just -- what an unbelievabl=
e example of the young people who are going to be leading us in the futur=
e. (Applause.) She wasnt even nervous backstage. She knew she was going t=
o do great. So we're so proud of her.



We have a couple of guests I want to just make sure to mention. Represent=
ative Joaqun Castro is in the house, from the great state of Texas. (Appl=
ause.) I know your parents are proud of you, and we're proud of you.



I want to thank our special guest chef, Johnny Hernandez -- (applause) --=
 who brought his taco and margarita recipes all the way from San Antn. An=
d give it up for our outstanding performers, Man. (Applause.) I was think=
ing about coming out and playing. But I decided maybe not. (Laughter.) Le=
t me not spoil the party.



We all know the story of Cinco de Mayo. One hundred fifty-four years ago,=
 the French, one of the strongest armies of the 19th century, marched on =
the tiny town of Puebla. An ill-equipped and hastily-trained band of Mexi=
can patriots grabbed whatever weapons they could find, and they fought of=
f the opposing forces, and eventually regained full independence.=20



One hundred fifty years later, Americans and Mexicans still celebrate Cin=
co de Mayo. In backyard barbeques and baseball parks, from Chicago to Aus=
tin, folks are enjoying music and food and good times with family and fri=
ends, just like were doing here today. Earlier, I had a chance to speak w=
ith President Pea Nieto of Mexico about our shared work on advancing the =
prosperity and the security of Americans and Mexicans. And so I wished hi=
m a happy Cinco de Mayo. And he asked me to extend the same to you, so Im=
 doing my duty here. Its a reminder of not just a holiday, but the incred=
ible bonds that our two countries share.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey!



THE PRESIDENT: Hey! (Laughter.)=20



And on my final Cinco de Mayo at the White House, in the company of this =
extraordinary group, I want to remind everybody of everything weve gotten=
 done. We've been busy. And we couldnt have done it without you.



Together, we increased high school and college graduation rates, cutting =
the Latino dropout rate by more than half since 2000. (Applause.) Togethe=
r, we ensured that more than 700,000 DREAMers have the opportunity to rea=
ch their potential. (Applause.)=20



Together, we continue to fight to fix our broken immigration system. The =
fact that we werent able to get it through Congress has been one of the m=
ost frustrating aspects of my presidency. But our ability to take actions=
 within my legal authority to make our immigration system fairer and smar=
ter and more just I continue to believe are going to help pave the way fo=
r us to finally get the law passed through the next Congress.



And I got to tell you, Im going to keep on working on this not just as Pr=
esident, but as a citizen -- once Im leaving here -- because I think its =
one of the most important things we can get done. (Applause.)=20



Now, in order to do that, everybody has got to follow this young ladys le=
ad and get out there and vote. (Applause.) So well have another occasion =
to talk about that. But we're going to have to have some historic turnout=
 rates come November.



Today is really then not just a celebration of all that we've gotten done=
, but its a commitment to continue our work. Change is hard. Sometimes it=
 takes time. Sometimes you take two steps forward, and then you have to t=
ake one step back. But its always possible to bring about the change we h=
ope for as long as good people are willing to work together and remain co=
mmitted -- willing to march and organize and vote and educate our friends=
 and our families and our neighbors, and tell the stories of all the incr=
edible people who have contributed to this great nation of ours who are i=
mmigrants, who came from some other places, but ended up weaving their st=
ories together with people from all around the globe to make this unique =
country we call America.



Change is possible because of people like you. Its because of people like=
 Efrain Escobedo. I want to tell his story, because Efrain was born in Lo=
s Angeles to two immigrants from Mexico. As an oldest child, Efrain took =
on the role as his parents advocate, translating for them in school and a=
t the doctors office. And when he turned 18, eager to exercise his new ri=
ght to vote, he realized that his parents couldnt vote. He said, I had th=
ese two parents who raised me to love this country and worked so hard to =
be there, and yet, in a very important way, they werent a part of this de=
mocracy.



The more Efrain learned about the power of his vote, the more he threw hi=
mself into the work of turning whole neighborhoods of people like him int=
o active and engaged citizens. And through the organization where he work=
s, the California Community Foundation, hes worked tirelessly to encourag=
e people to apply for citizenship and become involved in their communitie=
s, and to vote, and to consider running for office themselves.



In 2007, with other Latino leaders, he helped lead a campaign to encourag=
e people to become U.S. citizens, and he joined the citizenship campaign =
I launched last September. And since Efrains campaign was launched, milli=
ons of people have become U.S. citizens and active participants in our de=
mocracy. And that just shows you the difference that one person can make.=
 If we use our democracy, he says, it does work -- and every vote really =
does count.



Throughout this room, all across this land, were blessed with people like=
 Efrain. And thats what makes strong communities. Thats what makes for a =
strong country. People working to push this country forward, even just a =
little bit, and then handing it off in better shape for future generation=
s. And that's really what we celebrate here today.



And for that, I want to thank you. For that, I think you've all earned a =
few margaritas. (Laughter.)=20



So thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. Viva Mexico. (=
Applause.)=20



  END 4:20 P.M. EDT

vable example of the young people who are going to be leading
 us in the future.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t even nervous ba=

ve a couple of guests I want to just make sure to mention.&nbsp; Representa=

 (Applause.)&nbsp; I know your parents are proud of you,

ought his taco and margarita recipes all the way from San Ant=F3n.&nbsp; An=
d give it up for our outstanding performers,
 Man=E1.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I was thinking about coming out and playin=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">We al=
l know the story of Cinco de Mayo.&nbsp; One hundred fifty-four years ago, =
the French, one of the strongest armies of the 19th century, marched on the=
 tiny town of Puebla.&nbsp; An ill-equipped and
 hastily-trained band of Mexican patriots grabbed whatever weapons they cou=
ld find, and they fought off the opposing forces, and eventually regained f=
ull independence.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-autospace:none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">One h=
undred fifty years later, Americans and Mexicans still celebrate Cinco de M=
ayo.&nbsp; In backyard barbeques and baseball parks, from Chicago to Austin=
, folks are enjoying music and food and good
 times with family and friends, just like we&#8217;re doing here today.&nbs=
p; Earlier, I had a chance to speak with President Pe=F1a Nieto of Mexico a=
bout our shared work on advancing the prosperity and the security of Americ=
ans and Mexicans.&nbsp; And so I wished him a happy
 Cinco de Mayo.&nbsp; And he asked me to extend the same to you, so I&#8217=
;m doing my duty here.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a reminder of not just a holiday, b=
ut the incredible bonds that our two countries share.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-autospace:none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">And o=
n my final Cinco de Mayo at the White House, in the company of this extraor=
dinary group, I want to remind everybody of everything we&#8217;ve gotten d=
one.&nbsp; We've been busy.&nbsp; And we couldn&#8217;t have
 done it without you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none"><o:p>=
&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">Toget=
her, we increased high school and college graduation rates, cutting the Lat=
ino dropout rate by more than half since 2000.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Toge=
ther, we ensured that more than 700,000 DREAMers
 have the opportunity to reach their potential.&nbsp; (Applause.) <o:p></o:=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-autospace:none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">Toget=
her, we continue to fight to fix our broken immigration system.&nbsp; The f=
act that we weren&#8217;t able to get it through Congress has been one of t=
he most frustrating aspects of my presidency.&nbsp;
 But our ability to take actions within my legal authority to make our immi=
gration system fairer and smarter and more just I continue to believe are g=
oing to help pave the way for us to finally get the law passed through the =
next Congress.<o:p></o:p></p>

&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">And I=
 got to tell you, I&#8217;m going to keep on working on this not just as Pr=
esident, but as a citizen -- once I&#8217;m leaving here -- because I think=
 it&#8217;s one of the most important things we can get
 done.&nbsp; (Applause.) <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none"><o:p>=
&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">Now, =
in order to do that, everybody has got to follow this young lady&#8217;s le=
ad and get out there and vote.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; So we&#8217;ll have =
another occasion to talk about that.&nbsp; But we're going to have
 to have some historic turnout rates come November.<o:p></o:p></p>

&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">Today=
 is really then not just a celebration of all that we've gotten done, but i=
t&#8217;s a commitment to continue our work.&nbsp; Change is hard.&nbsp; So=
metimes it takes time.&nbsp; Sometimes you take two steps
 forward, and then you have to take one step back.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s alw=
ays possible to bring about the change we hope for as long as good people a=
re willing to work together and remain committed -- willing to march and or=
ganize and vote and educate our friends and
 our families and our neighbors, and tell the stories of all the incredible=
 people who have contributed to this great nation of ours who are immigrant=
s, who came from some other places, but ended up weaving their stories toge=
ther with people from all around
 the globe to make this unique country we call America.<o:p></o:p></p>

&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">Chang=
e is possible because of people like you.&nbsp; It&#8217;s because of peopl=
e like Efrain Escobedo.&nbsp; I want to tell his story, because Efrain was =
born in Los Angeles to two immigrants from Mexico.&nbsp;
 As an oldest child, Efrain took on the role as his parents&#8217; advocate=
, translating for them in school and at the doctor&#8217;s office.&nbsp; An=
d when he turned 18, eager to exercise his new right to vote, he realized t=
hat his parents couldn&#8217;t vote.&nbsp; He said, I had these
 two parents who raised me to love this country and worked so hard to be th=
ere, and yet, in a very important way, they weren&#8217;t a part of this de=
mocracy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-autospace:none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">The m=
ore Efrain learned about the power of his vote, the more he threw himself i=
nto the work of turning whole neighborhoods of people like him into active =
and engaged citizens.&nbsp; And through the
 organization where he works, the California Community Foundation, he&#8217=
;s worked tirelessly to encourage people to apply for citizenship and becom=
e involved in their communities, and to vote, and to consider running for o=
ffice themselves.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-autospace:none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">In 20=
07, with other Latino leaders, he helped lead a campaign to encourage peopl=
e to become U.S. citizens, and he joined the citizenship campaign I launche=
d last September.&nbsp; And since Efrain&#8217;s
 campaign was launched, millions of people have become U.S. citizens and ac=
tive participants in our democracy.&nbsp; And that just shows you the diffe=
rence that one person can make.&nbsp; If we use our democracy, he says, it =
does work -- and every vote really does count.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-autospace:none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">Throu=
ghout this room, all across this land, we&#8217;re blessed with people like=
 Efrain.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what makes strong communities.&nbsp; That&#=
8217;s what makes for a strong country.&nbsp; People working to push
 this country forward, even just a little bit, and then handing it off in b=
etter shape for future generations.&nbsp; And that's really what we celebra=
te here today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none"><o:p>=
&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">And f=
or that, I want to thank you.&nbsp; For that, I think you've all earned a f=
ew margaritas.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-autospace:none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none">So th=
