Contrast with Trump from last week:

TRUMP: =93Well, I'm going to be able to figure it out. I mean, we have had =
17 people just now and I figured that out and I will be able to figure it o=
ut with Hillary. It depends on where she is coming from. If she wants to go=
 the low road, I'm fine with that. And if she wants to go the high road, wh=
ich probably I would prefer, I would be fine with that.=94 O'REILLY: =93All=
 right. Wait, wait, wait, but, wait, you're fine with the low road? Most pe=
ople don't want to go on the low road?=94 TRUMP: =93No, I can handle the lo=
w road if I have to do it. I mean, we've had some low roads over the last f=
ew months.=94
