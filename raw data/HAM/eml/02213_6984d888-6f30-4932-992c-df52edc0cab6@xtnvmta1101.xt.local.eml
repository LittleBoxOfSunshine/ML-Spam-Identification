1) PRESSURE COOKER: FBI Director James Comey says he feels "pressure" to wrap up his investigation of HILLARY CLINTON's private server and email practices. But he says that doing the investigation in a competent way is more important than doing it quickly.

POLITICO's Josh Gerstein reports Comey gave an update - of sorts - into the investigation of Clinton's email server during a roundtable with reporters at the FBI's headquarters. Comey said he's not taking political events, including upcoming party conventions, into account: "I don't tether to any external deadline," he said. 

But Comey also batted away more specific questions about the investigation's status. Though he said that he was following it closely. "I remain close to the investigation to make sure it's done well and has the resources that are needed," Comey said.

Happy Wednesday. Don't know about Director Comey, but we feel like life is just one big external deadline and further - ah, never mind. Here's your 2016 Blast. Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through the day's campaign news, so send your tips, complaints and takes of hot fire to: hjackson@politico.com. 

2) PRELUDE TO A MEETING: Tomorrow, DONALD TRUMP and Paul Ryan will meet in Washington to try to hash things out. Today, Ryan met with some of Trump's allies on the Hill, perhaps getting a preview of what he can expect. As POLITICO's Rachael Bade reports, Ryan quietly met with a handful of Trump's supporters - including Reps. Chris Collins (R-N.Y), Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) and Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) - who made a pitch to Ryan about why he should back Trump. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6289cca30260f38e8cae9f8224b6a865b9da35c51dc155b31 This issue is dicey for Ryan: As POLITICO's Jake Sherman and Rachael Bade report, Trump's brand of politics - and his popularity within the GOP - put the House Speaker in a vise. 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6149d60fc275a44ac6673fecb49bcbbd31cac44b6a113eef8 

3) STICKER SHOCK: DONALD TRUMP had tasked a pair of conservative economists, Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore, with revising his tax plan. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee69693e5372544e120ceca964870c0e0031a01b948fe8a1cac And, they duly came up with what they called some "tweaks." As POLITICO's Shane Goldmacher reports, though, what they submitted to the nonprofit Tax Foundation for a new deficit score amounts to a dramatic rewrite of Trump's original plan. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee683ff452d49a94a07e4866c36de2846a95f00233dc142e97f As Goldmacher reports: The new plan, compared against Trump's initial proposal, would increase tax rates across all income levels, dramatically reduce the number of people who would pay no income taxes at all and impose a new cap
 on charitable deductions for the wealthy. Trump's supporters remain bullish on his economic policies, though: POLITICO's Brian Faler and Matthew Nussbaum report that a Trump adviser claims his economic policies will result in a $7 trillion net surplus - a wildly optimistic number, at best. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6c78372c45a547098fe05254e94c50134c72127114b687f2d 

4) GENERAL SENSE OF WORRY: HILLARY CLINTON is bracing for a very tight election. That's the message from Brooklyn, as her campaign tries to gear up for a general election fight against DONALD TRUMP. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee698eb84fa255fb4f9b5ed7e041ea4dd6b013f937647374ec7 As our broadcast friends say, though: But first: She's still laboring to escape a primary quagmire. POLITICO's Gabriel Debenedetti reports she's stuck between two worlds: Her nomination appears inevitable, but her path past BERNIE SANDERS is exposing her as deeply fallible. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6b842482d7a18a5cfd384038438e69705e4a4712ad5812751 

5) BERN BURNS: You know who doesn't really care about HILLARY CLINTON's quagmire? BERNIE SANDERS. Appearing on MSNBC, Sanders bristled when Andrea Mitchell asked him about Clinton's problems locking up the Democratic nomination. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6eb610888f96631076709768771ef9dc8a8c63f65b71d225f "Please do not moan to me about HILLARY CLINTON's problems," he said. Sanders' path to the Democratic nomination is difficult - to say the least. And that task was complicated by the departure of his state director in crucial California, as POLITICO's Gabriel Debenedetti reports. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6a9e4f8e1b438908076b739346b01129436ef29917bd48559 One thing Sanders is concerned about, however, is steering his supporters away from voting for
 DONALD TRUMP. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6d6724692b7eed2ad47e1c9f2d621ed5ef72b54efe496dcd4 

TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, DONALD TRUMP says intentions matter and nabs a Rubio recruit. Unions prep for a fight. HILLARY CLINTON pans his tax plan, BERNIE SANDERS gets a Geraldo scolding, and Ted Nugent, man. Ted Nugent. 

GOOD INTENTIONS: DONALD TRUMP says Muslims being admitted to the U.S. depends on their "intentions." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee60a7e74963f8095143608ae1979079c14d4aa07400ab8778b 

RUBIO RECRUIT: DONALD TRUMP has hired Eli H. Miller, deputy finance director for MARCO RUBIO's presidential bid, as the chief operating officer of his finance operation. (The New York Times) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6de4c63379b54630f22900be0f9b50f839314b2d3c6d545c7 

UNION JOB: Unions are preparing a super PAC to take on DONALD TRUMP. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6967fe75fd540e542be55459607e72c7d9d02f53f53ca7078 

'CRAZY BERNIE': DONALD TRUMP has crafted a new (Blast Note: Kinda lame) nickname for BERNIE SANDERS: "Crazy Bernie." (Business Insider) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6229f532bb5cb3584d6ceb4a6ffe50e47001a63d5c05fad7e 

TAX PAN: HILLARY CLINTON ripped DONALD TRUMP's tax plan as being written for the wealthy. (ABC) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee64f7c0a6e1f5ed15cf6eb264666ce75cc3dcf88bc4509454a 

ALIEN CONCEPT: For at least the third time this cycle, HILLARY CLINTON has pegged herself as outer space alien curious. The truth is out there. (The Stranger) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee61b6c13476c3fffb35174886ec076aff1d73fbaec3b9d6140 

HE WOULD KNOW, EH? Controversial HILLARY CLINTON confidant Sid Blumenthal says there's "no bombshell" in her emails. What else would he say? (CNN) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6b80b077077276efb07e1d515670617529081473eb0ad04cd 

RIVER(A) ON FIRE: Geraldo Rivera ripped BERNIE SANDERS on a hot mic. Didn't care enough to walk it back. (Washington Post). http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6b46a162faf8a90758d5c282a8bab192b678de7717ad5a4ba

CAT SCRATCH FEVER: Ted Nugent posted a video of BERNIE SANDERS shooting HILLARY CLINTON. Yikes! http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee6cdeaaefa5bea68e04ddf7561c43f97c9d93309bf7656ade2 

WHAT'S NEXT: Democrats continue to focus on June 7 states. BERNIE SANDERS heads to South Dakota. 

THEY SAID IT: "We want to do it well and we want to do it promptly. I feel pressure to do both of those things. As between the two things, we will always choose 'well.'" - James Comey, giving an update on the FBI investigation into HILLARY CLINTON's email practices. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee68cf3ba0719356cd0659a8593d10df6ba9f731419fbc5a2df 

MAGIC NUMBER: 27. That's how many days until California holds its primary - and BERNIE SANDERS now lacks a state director there. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e7661b306bf05ee62bd7331f35e98b01baa9466879f295f3980230015f4f4908
