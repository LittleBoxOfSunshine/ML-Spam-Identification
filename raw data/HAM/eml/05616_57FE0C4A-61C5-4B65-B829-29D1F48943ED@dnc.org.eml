Not for sharing before it airs obviously but Palin is asked about Paul Ryan distancing himself from Trump and said he is trying to prep to run in 2020 and he is going to lose like Eric Cantor and she endorses his primary opponent.

She also disagrees with Trump on changing the abortion piece of the platform.

When asked about being Trump's VP she says she's the most vetted person in America and she doesn't know that he would want to choose her but if she can help she will.
