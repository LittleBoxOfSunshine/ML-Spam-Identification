Hi Ryan,

Thanks for getting back to me. The original email to you is below.

Here are some facts you wanted:

The Costa Report is nationally syndicated so our audience is in all 50 states.

Here is a map of our coverage area:

http://www.rebeccacosta.com/syndicated-stations.htm

We have an audience of just over 2,000,000 listeners. So our audience is greater than MSNBC and CNN.

This is a talk radio audience so this is an audience that is older, politically engaged, and votes consistently.

We have a social media and newsletter audience of 250,000 subscribers.

In terms of guests we have had on:

Tom Daschle

Juan Williams

Ralph Nader

Michael Hayden

Mark Pryor

Dana Milbank

Tim Pawlenty

Jim Lehrer

We have had on most of the presidential candidates this election season.

The list of guests we had on is here if you need something more comprehensive:

http://www.rebeccacosta.com/the-costa-report.htm

I have May 12 open right now, which is right before the California primary.

There are a few options for a phone interview:

1. Live interview scheduled in between 2:00 - 3:00 pm (Pacific Time) with various breaks in between.

2. A recorded interview between 9:00 - 10:00 am (Pacific Time).

3. A recorded interview between 10:00 - 11:00 am (Pacific Time).

Thanks,

Brad

Dear Mr. Banfill,

My name is Brad Polisuk and I am a producer for the nationally syndicated The Costa Report featuring Rebecca Costa, broadcast from KSCO studios in Santa Cruz, California, one of the last independently owned radio stations in the US.

The Costa Report is a post-partisan human affairs show with an audience of over 2 million people with over 250,000 followers on social media.

I am pitching this to you because Rebecca Costa is interested in doing an interview with Congresswoman Wasserman-Schultz that isn't particularly partisan or political in nature but to appeal to our higher angels as Americans in terms of our love for civic duty and commitment to public service.

I am sure the Congresswoman would like to do an interview where she is not either on the offensive or defensive as chair of the DNC or as a political candidate.

Put simply, it won't be a hostile interview but more of an interview that focuses on what can we do as a country together, regardless if Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump becomes president or if Congress stays the same or changes hands.

Also, to be blunt, we would love to have more Democrats in Congress on the program.

You can hear recordings of past work here: http://www.rebeccacosta.com/the-costa-report.htm  You will see that we have had on major players on before.

I have May 12 open right now, which is right before the California primary. It would be an opportune time for her to be on and reach out to a talk radio audience that would open to another perspective on the Congresswoman's life and career.

There are a few options for a phone interview:

1. Live interview scheduled in between 2:00 - 3:00 pm (Pacific Time) with various breaks in between.

2. A recorded interview between 9:00 - 10:00 am (Pacific Time).

3. A recorded interview between 10:00 - 11:00 am (Pacific Time).

Also, I would like to develop a long-term relationship with her so we can feature more Democrats on the program but more from a public servant perspective with an agenda to move forward and get things done.

If this interests you and Congresswoman Wasserman-Schultz, please let me know as soon as you can.  Thanks for your time.


Sincerely,

Brad   ---
