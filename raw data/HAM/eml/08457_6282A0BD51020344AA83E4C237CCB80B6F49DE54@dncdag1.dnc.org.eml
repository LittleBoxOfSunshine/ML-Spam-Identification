Marco Rubio warming up to Donald Trump<http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/marco-rubio-warming-up-to-donald-trump/2275308>

Marco Rubio appears to be warming up to Donald Trump, saying Friday his "performance has improved significantly." Rubio has also continued to withold an endorsement of Ted Cruz, even though he previously praised him as the conservative in the race.

Last Sunday on Univision Rubio said it appeared Trump will lock down the nomination.

"If he keeps winning delegates like he did the other night in New York, I think he's going to reach that number," Rubio said on Al Punto Florida. "But let's see. There are still other states to go."

And Rubio, who continues to hold onto more than 100 delegates, has warned against a contested convention.

"I do think it's valid to argue to delegates: 'Look, let's not divide the party. You have someone here who has all these votes, very close to get 1,237, let's not ignore the will of the people or they're going to be angry.' And delegates may decide that on that reason  they decide to vote for Donald Trump but if they don't it's not illegitimate in any way," he told Miami radio host Jimmy Cefalo.

"I've always said I'm going to support the Republican nominee, and that's especially true now that it's apparent that Hillary Clinton is going to be the Democratic candidate," Rubio said. "My differences with Donald Trump are well documented ... ."
