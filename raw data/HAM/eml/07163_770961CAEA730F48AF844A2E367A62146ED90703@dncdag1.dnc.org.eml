Part of Good Morning Britain interview:


- People saying he's a racist, comparing him to Hitler know it's not true

EU referendum
- Doesn't want anyone to change their opinion, speaks for himself, but thin=
ks Britain should do it. A lot of the immigration has been because of the E=
U, it's been a disaster. He has no preference. If he were from Britain he w=
ould not want it, he would want to go back to a different system.
- EU very bureaucratic. In terms of Britain he'd say what do you need it fo=
r. But that's him

Trade if Britain left EU
- They wouldn't be hurt at all. With him they'd always be treated fantastic=
ally. Would certainly not be back of the queue, won't say front of the queu=
e
- Obama shouldn't be worried about Europe. Let them solve their own problem=
s. We've got too many problems in the US. What's he worried about Europe fo=
r. He needs to work on the US

U.S. weak?
- We're weak and stupid. We've made bad decisions like Hillary has bad judg=
ment. Libya has oil in ISIS now
- He said we would destabilize the Middle East.

Do we have a moral obligation to help women and children in these areas we'=
ve destabilized?
- we have a moral obligation. He loves people, he's a nice person.

Praising Melania and Ivanka

Do you think you're sexist?
- No one has more respect for women than him

What do you say to British people who are afraid?
- they'll have a great friend in him, he'll be a great ally

segment ends and host asks if we really want someone who has to reassure pe=
ople he's a nice person
