PRESS CALL

BY TINA TCHEN, CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE FIRST LADY,

MEGAN BEYER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE

PRESIDENT=92S COMMITTEE ON THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES,

AND DEBORAH RUTTER, PRESIDENT OF THE=20

KENNEDY CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS,

ON THE FIRST LADY=92S ANNOUNCEMENT=20

ON THE LEGACY AND FUTURE OF TURNAROUND ARTS

=A0

Via Conference Call=20

11:34 A.M. EDT

=A0

MS. DRAKE:=A0 Thank you for joining this on-the-record conference call to=
 discuss Turnaround Arts and the talent show tomorrow, where the First La=
dy will be making a major announcement about the future of the Turnaround=
 Arts program.=A0=20

=A0

We=92re joined today by Tina Tchen, Assistant to the President and Chief =
of Staff to the First Lady; Megan Beyer, Executive Director, the Presiden=
t=92s Committee on the Arts and Humanities; and Deborah Rutter, President=
 of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.=A0 If you=92d like to get=
 updates on the event, please email FirstLadyPress@who.eop.gov.=A0 And ju=
st to note, this call is embargoed until tomorrow at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.=A0=
=20

=A0

So now I=92ll hand it over to Tina, Megan and Deborah.=A0 And then depend=
ing on time, we=92ll take a few questions on background.=A0=20

=A0

MS. TCHEN:=A0 Thanks, Tiffany.=A0 And thank you, everyone, for joining us=
 this morning.=A0 So tomorrow, we=92re looking forward to our second Turn=
around Arts Talent Show here at the White House.=A0 This is really unlike=
 any other musical event we have here, where the spotlight is not on prof=
essional singers, dancers, actors or artists, but instead on young studen=
ts, some of whom may be not that used to performing and may be their firs=
t time on such a stage.

=A0

But in our view, these performers are every bit as meaningful and impactf=
ul -- maybe even more so -- than the world-class talent who often grace o=
ur stage.=A0 Because these young people represent the future, and, more i=
mportantly, they are examples of how critical the arts are to the educati=
on of our kids.

=A0

We all know the statistics when it comes to the power of the arts and edu=
cation.=A0 We know that kids who get involved in the arts have higher gra=
des, higher graduation rates, higher college enrollment rates.=A0 And the=
 President=92s Committee on Arts and Humanities has put this information =
into action through the Turnaround Arts program, going into some of the m=
ost underperforming schools in the country -- those with low test scores,=
 rampant disciplinary problems, high teacher turnover and low parent enga=
gement -- and showing what can happen when you reintroduce the arts into =
these schools.=A0 And the literal turnaround of these schools has been am=
azing, which Megan will talk about in a minute.=A0=20

=A0

Through programs like Turnaround Arts, we see how arts education makes a =
school a more interesting, engaging and dynamic place for our children to=
 be, and enhances their learning across subjects.=A0 And we saw this firs=
thand with the Savoy School from here in D.C.=A0 We=92ve had them to the =
White House a couple of times, including most recently during our Nordic =
state visit, where they performed for the First Lady and for the gathered=
 spouses of our Nordic leaders.=A0 And the First Lady went to visit the S=
avoy School with Kerry Washington.

=A0

When we were there, you could see how the kids were engaged with all of t=
he arts in the hallways, and how the entire school got involved in the pe=
rformance they did for the First Lady.=A0 The principal said the program =
gave the school a whole new vitality, and even got the parents more engag=
ed.=A0 And artists themselves have found it enormously rewarding, and hav=
e had such great hands-on involvement with the students.=A0 And you=92ll =
see that at work at the talent show itself.

=A0

As you know, both the President and the First Lady love the arts.=A0 They=
=92ve seen how they bring a richer cultural life to young students.=A0 Th=
ey know that without students experiencing the arts in the schools, we ar=
e all missing out on their potential, and may even be missing out on the =
next Lin-Manuel Miranda.=A0 That=92s what can happen when arts come out a=
t schools, and that=92s why we are so excited also about the Every Studen=
t Succeeds Act.=A0=20

=A0

The Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, which President Obama signed int=
o law in December of last year, puts arts back into the definition of a w=
ell-rounded education, which is what we are asking schools to strive for.=
=A0 And that in and of itself is a turnaround.=A0=20

=A0

So we want to see this continue into the future.=A0 PCAH has developed a =
model.=A0 They=92ve studied it and it works.=A0 And we are excited that t=
here is an opportunity now to take it to scale beyond this administration=
, which Deborah will discuss in a few moments.=A0=20

=A0

So now let me turn the call over to Megan Beyer.=A0 She=92s going to talk=
 a little bit more about Turnaround Arts and where it=92s headed in the f=
uture.=A0=20

=A0

MS. BEYER:=A0 Thank you, Tina.=A0 I want to first talk about a study that=
 was done in one of the first years that this Committee, the President=92=
s Committee on the Arts and Humanities, came together.=A0 It was a study =
called Reinvesting in Arts Education:=A0 Winning America=92s Future Throu=
gh Creative Schools.=A0 It showed that students who are engaged with the =
arts, as Tina has talked about, have a higher likelihood of a success thr=
oughout their education.=A0 They actually were shown to have higher atten=
dance records, higher GPAs, and are more likely to participate in math pr=
ograms or science fairs.

=A0

Fifteen percent of our nation=92s schools generate over 60 percent of our=
 high school dropouts.=A0 And we are in those schools.=A0 We are in schoo=
ls in -- struggling schools, the lowest 5-percent-performing schools.=A0 =
So we know that if we can move the needle in just a percentage of these l=
owest-performing schools with the arts, we can have a huge impact.

=A0

And the children who need it most are getting it the least.=A0 Our studie=
s showed that the way our schools are funded, it was -- the schools that =
are struggling were dropping these arts programs.=A0 After decades of bud=
get cuts and high-stakes testing, arts education virtually disappeared fr=
om our neediest schools.=A0 Department of Education studies said that 6 m=
illion elementary and middle schools students in America have no art or m=
usic classes.

=A0

Arts education also gives struggling schools the tools that they really n=
eed -- tools to engage students and their parents, to motivate positive b=
ehavior and boost morale, and to literally change the way that a school f=
eels when a student walks through that door.=A0 It=92s a world of differe=
nce when you go to a Turnaround Arts school before the program and two ye=
ars in.

=A0

So in 2011, after doing this study, our committee decided that they thems=
elves would test the premise.=A0 We conducted a pilot program called Turn=
around Arts.=A0 We went into eight struggling schools, infusing them with=
 art, music, dance and theater programs, musical instruments, art supplie=
s that came in from Crayola, musical instruments from the National Associ=
ation of Music Merchants, and a lot of teacher training.=A0 We completely=
 re-engineered the curriculum.=A0 Students learned science and math and r=
eading with songs, art projects and plays.=A0=20

=A0

And the way that it worked in an actual classroom was, you=92re taking bi=
ology, there=92s the biology song.=A0 You=92re in chemistry, you=92re in =
the chemistry play.=A0 You=92re painting by fractions.=A0 We brought some=
 of the best actors and musicians in America into these schools to do som=
e of these great art-based curriculums.=A0=20

=A0

We had Sarah Jessica Parker, Alfre Woodard, Yo-Yo Ma -- these are all mem=
bers of the President=92s Committee.=A0 And of course, as Tina just menti=
oned, the First Lady has visited Savoy School here in Washington with Ker=
ry Washington, and has brought our kids into the White House -- and invol=
ved with White House initiatives countless times.

=A0

So what we discovered was that the arts work.=A0 We saw it play out in th=
ese eight schools.=A0 Booz Allen Hamilton did a study on Turnaround Arts =
in these schools and found, yes, the math scores went up 23 percent on av=
erage.=A0 Reading went up 13 percent on average.=A0 Parent engagement sky=
rocketed.=A0 Attendance rates went up.=A0 And as for behavioral issues, y=
ou had more students headed to play practice than the principal=92s offic=
e.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 So now, in just five years, Turnaround Arts has grown from t=
hose eight schools in that pilot phase to now, this fall, 68 schools in 1=
5 states and the District of Columbia.=A0 That will affect 45,000 student=
s.=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 And tomorrow, as part of the President=92s Committee on the =
Arts and the Humanities, the First Lady, who is our honorary chairperson,=
 will welcome students and artists from across the country to perform at =
the White House Turnaround Arts Talent Show to showcase the proven school=
 and life changes -- the arts.=A0 The students are going to perform acts =
alongside some of your mentors, including Keb=92 Mo=92, Tim Robbins, Bern=
ie Williams, Irvin Mayfield, Lil Buck, Citizen Cope, Damian Woetzel, and =
Paula Fuga from Hawaii.=A0 And we're thrilled that the First Lady will be=
 making a major announcement tomorrow about the future of Turnaround Arts=
.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 And in that vein, I will turn it over to Deborah Rutter.=A0=20=


=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 MS. RUTTER:=A0 Thank you, Megan.=A0 And thank you, Tina, for=
 establishing the interest, the reasoning, and what has happened before.=A0=
 We're really thrilled to be a part of the talent show tomorrow, and then=
 also to know that the First Lady will announce that the President=92s Co=
mmittee on the Arts and the Humanities will be forging a new partnership =
with us here at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to imp=
lement and expand Turnaround Arts into the future.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 This is a strategic partnership, and it represents an alignm=
ent of our values between the President=92s committee and the John F. Ken=
nedy Center for the Performing Arts to provide service to at-risk communi=
ties with a commitment to national arts education programs.=A0=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 The Kennedy Center and the President=92s committee -- we=92d=
 like to call it PCAH, which is not an easy acronym, but it=92s the short=
er one -- represent a really powerful team.=A0 And we really acknowledge =
and applaud the President=92s committee for taking the leap into the unkn=
own with this work.=A0 And they have proven that this can be school chang=
ing and, more importantly, life changing for young people in the most und=
erserved communities across the country.=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Now, for those of you who may not know, the Kennedy Center h=
as more than 40 years of experience providing high-quality arts education=
 programming.=A0 We're mostly known for the work -- more broadly known, p=
erhaps, for the work that we put on the stages here at the Kennedy Center=
.=A0 But parallel to that, we have a huge and valuable legacy in providin=
g arts education programming across the country, whether it is touring th=
eater for young audience, or bringing teachers and the civic leaders of c=
ommunities together to provide strong arts education programs.=A0 We beli=
eve that this expertise in this area will strengthen the Turnaround Arts =
operations and allow that program to expand and to probably amplify its i=
mpact on our communities.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Now, some people have asked me why it=92s important that Tur=
naround Arts comes to the Kennedy Center and vice versa.=A0 The addition =
really allows us to focus on some of the new geographic areas.=A0 The Ken=
nedy Center reaches nearly every state, but these will be new geographic =
areas, and it complements the ones that we are already serving.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 We are already reaching 11 million students and families and=
 educators through programs that we already have in place, such as ArtsEd=
ge, which is our digital channel for education programs; Any Given Child;=
 our Changing Education Through the Arts; and the National Partnerships i=
n Education.=A0 But those are more at a high level, helping teachers and =
administrators, civic leaders to help understand and work to strengthen s=
chools.=20

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 With the Turnaround Arts programming, we will partner with a=
 really fantastic team that the President=92s committee has built to actu=
ally deliver the programs in these schools.=A0 So this is one of those ma=
gical partnerships where the strengths that we have and the strengths tha=
t the Turnaround Arts team have will really benefit each of the already e=
xisting programs.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 The Kennedy Center can provide access to resources.=A0 We ca=
n strengthen some of the capacity-building and professional development.=A0=
 And we have a vast network of teaching artists and arts educators throug=
h the programs I just mentioned, which will then help support the Turnaro=
und Arts program.=A0 We also have a very rigorous research and developmen=
t component here built into our education team, which can measure the imp=
act and then help refine programming and inform future programming.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 So this is one of those fantastic experiences where we find =
that we come together and two plus two probably equals six or eight -- so=
mething much more than the just the two organizations coming together.=A0=
 And if we can use it as an opportunity to shine a spotlight on the benef=
it and the value that arts education can do, not just for the least serve=
d but for all students across the country, that we can remove barriers to=
 arts learning and support the emerging citizen artists that we need to i=
nspire the next generation.=A0 We couldn=92t be more thrilled about this =
next step for our two organizations.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We=92re joined today by T=

<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So now I=92ll hand it ove=
r to Tina, Megan and Deborah.&nbsp; And then depending on time, we=92ll tak=
e a few questions on background.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MS. TCHEN:&nbsp; Thanks, =
Tiffany.&nbsp; And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.&nbsp; =
So tomorrow, we=92re looking forward to our second Turnaround Arts Talent S=
how here at the White House.&nbsp; This is really unlike any
 other musical event we have here, where the spotlight is not on profession=
al singers, dancers, actors or artists, but instead on young students, some=
 of whom may be not that used to performing and may be their first time on =
such a stage.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But in our view, these pe=
rformers are every bit as meaningful and impactful -- maybe even more so --=
 than the world-class talent who often grace our stage.&nbsp; Because these=
 young people represent the future, and,
 more importantly, they are examples of how critical the arts are to the ed=
ucation of our kids.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We all know the statistic=
s when it comes to the power of the arts and education.&nbsp; We know that =
kids who get involved in the arts have higher grades, higher graduation rat=
es, higher college enrollment rates.&nbsp; And
 the President=92s Committee on Arts and Humanities has put this informatio=
n into action through the Turnaround Arts program, going into some of the m=
ost underperforming schools in the country -- those with low test scores, r=
ampant disciplinary problems, high
 teacher turnover and low parent engagement -- and showing what can happen =
when you reintroduce the arts into these schools.&nbsp; And the literal tur=
naround of these schools has been amazing, which Megan will talk about in a=
 minute.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Through programs like Tur=
naround Arts, we see how arts education makes a school a more interesting, =
engaging and dynamic place for our children to be, and enhances their learn=
ing across subjects.&nbsp; And we saw this
 firsthand with the Savoy School from here in D.C.&nbsp; We=92ve had them t=
o the White House a couple of times, including most recently during our Nor=
dic state visit, where they performed for the First Lady and for the gather=
ed spouses of our Nordic leaders.&nbsp; And
 the First Lady went to visit the Savoy School with Kerry Washington.<p></p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">When we were there, you c=
ould see how the kids were engaged with all of the arts in the hallways, an=
d how the entire school got involved in the performance they did for the Fi=
rst Lady.&nbsp; The principal said the program
 gave the school a whole new vitality, and even got the parents more engage=
d.&nbsp; And artists themselves have found it enormously rewarding, and hav=
e had such great hands-on involvement with the students.&nbsp; And you=92ll=
 see that at work at the talent show itself.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As you know, both the Pre=
sident and the First Lady love the arts.&nbsp; They=92ve seen how they brin=
g a richer cultural life to young students.&nbsp; They know that without st=
udents experiencing the arts in the schools, we
 are all missing out on their potential, and may even be missing out on the=
 next Lin-Manuel Miranda.&nbsp; That=92s what can happen when arts come out=
 at schools, and that=92s why we are so excited also about the Every Studen=
t Succeeds Act.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The Every Student Succeed=
s Act, or ESSA, which President Obama signed into law in December of last y=
ear, puts arts back into the definition of a well-rounded education, which =
is what we are asking schools to strive
 for.&nbsp; And that in and of itself is a turnaround.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we want to see this co=
ntinue into the future.&nbsp; PCAH has developed a model.&nbsp; They=92ve s=
tudied it and it works.&nbsp; And we are excited that there is an opportuni=
ty now to take it to scale beyond this administration,
 which Deborah will discuss in a few moments.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So now let me turn the ca=
ll over to Megan Beyer.&nbsp; She=92s going to talk a little bit more about=
 Turnaround Arts and where it=92s headed in the future.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MS. BEYER:&nbsp; Thank yo=
u, Tina.&nbsp; I want to first talk about a study that was done in one of t=
he first years that this Committee, the President=92s Committee on the Arts=
 and Humanities, came together.&nbsp; It was a study
 called Reinvesting in Arts Education:&nbsp; Winning America=92s Future Thr=
ough Creative Schools.&nbsp; It showed that students who are engaged with t=
he arts, as Tina has talked about, have a higher likelihood of a success th=
roughout their education.&nbsp; They actually were
 shown to have higher attendance records, higher GPAs, and are more likely =
to participate in math programs or science fairs.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Fifteen percent of our na=
tion=92s schools generate over 60 percent of our high school dropouts.&nbsp=
; And we are in those schools.&nbsp; We are in schools in -- struggling sch=
ools, the lowest 5-percent-performing schools.&nbsp;
 So we know that if we can move the needle in just a percentage of these lo=
west-performing schools with the arts, we can have a huge impact.<p></p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the children who need=
 it most are getting it the least.&nbsp; Our studies showed that the way ou=
r schools are funded, it was -- the schools that are struggling were droppi=
ng these arts programs.&nbsp; After decades of
 budget cuts and high-stakes testing, arts education virtually disappeared =
from our neediest schools.&nbsp; Department of Education studies said that =
6 million elementary and middle schools students in America have no art or =
music classes.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Arts education also gives=
 struggling schools the tools that they really need -- tools to engage stud=
ents and their parents, to motivate positive behavior and boost morale, and=
 to literally change the way that a
 school feels when a student walks through that door.&nbsp; It=92s a world =
of difference when you go to a Turnaround Arts school before the program an=
d two years in.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So in 2011, after doing t=
his study, our committee decided that they themselves would test the premis=
e.&nbsp; We conducted a pilot program called Turnaround Arts.&nbsp; We went=
 into eight struggling schools, infusing them
 with art, music, dance and theater programs, musical instruments, art supp=
lies that came in from Crayola, musical instruments from the National Assoc=
iation of Music Merchants, and a lot of teacher training.&nbsp; We complete=
ly re-engineered the curriculum.&nbsp; Students
 learned science and math and reading with songs, art projects and plays.&n=
bsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the way that it worke=
d in an actual classroom was, you=92re taking biology, there=92s the biolog=
y song.&nbsp; You=92re in chemistry, you=92re in the chemistry play.&nbsp; =
You=92re painting by fractions.&nbsp; We brought some of the
 best actors and musicians in America into these schools to do some of thes=
e great art-based curriculums.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We had Sarah Jessica Park=
er, Alfre Woodard, Yo-Yo Ma -- these are all members of the President=92s C=
ommittee.&nbsp; And of course, as Tina just mentioned, the First Lady has v=
isited Savoy School here in Washington with
 Kerry Washington, and has brought our kids into the White House -- and inv=
olved with White House initiatives countless times.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So what we discovered was=
 that the arts work.&nbsp; We saw it play out in these eight schools.&nbsp;=
 Booz Allen Hamilton did a study on Turnaround Arts in these schools and fo=
und, yes, the math scores went up 23 percent on
 average.&nbsp; Reading went up 13 percent on average.&nbsp; Parent engagem=
ent skyrocketed.&nbsp; Attendance rates went up.&nbsp; And as for behaviora=
l issues, you had more students headed to play practice than the principal=
=92s office.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now, in just five years,=
 Turnaround Arts has grown from those eight schools in that pilot phase to =
now, this fall, 68 schools in 15 states and the District of Columbia.&nbsp;=
 That will affect 45,000 students.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And tomorrow, as part of th=
e President=92s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, the First Lady, w=
ho is our honorary chairperson, will welcome students and artists from acro=
ss the country to perform at the White House Turnaround
 Arts Talent Show to showcase the proven school and life changes -- the art=
s.&nbsp; The students are going to perform acts alongside some of your ment=
ors, including Keb=92 Mo=92, Tim Robbins, Bernie Williams, Irvin Mayfield, =
Lil Buck, Citizen Cope, Damian Woetzel, and
 Paula Fuga from Hawaii.&nbsp; And we're thrilled that the First Lady will =
be making a major announcement tomorrow about the future of Turnaround Arts=
.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in that vein, I will tu=
rn it over to Deborah Rutter.&nbsp;
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. RUTTER:&nbsp; Thank you=
, Megan.&nbsp; And thank you, Tina, for establishing the interest, the reas=
oning, and what has happened before.&nbsp; We're really thrilled to be a pa=
rt of the talent show tomorrow, and then also to know that the First
 Lady will announce that the President=92s Committee on the Arts and the Hu=
manities will be forging a new partnership with us here at the John F. Kenn=
edy Center for the Performing Arts to implement and expand Turnaround Arts =
into the future.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a strategic partner=
ship, and it represents an alignment of our values between the President=92=
s committee and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to provi=
de service to at-risk communities with a commitment to national
 arts education programs.&nbsp; <p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kennedy Center and the =
President=92s committee -- we=92d like to call it PCAH, which is not an eas=
y acronym, but it=92s the shorter one -- represent a really powerful team.&=
nbsp; And we really acknowledge and applaud the President=92s committee
 for taking the leap into the unknown with this work.&nbsp; And they have p=
roven that this can be school changing and, more importantly, life changing=
 for young people in the most underserved communities across the country.
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, for those of you who m=
ay not know, the Kennedy Center has more than 40 years of experience provid=
ing high-quality arts education programming.&nbsp; We're mostly known for t=
he work -- more broadly known, perhaps, for the work that we
 put on the stages here at the Kennedy Center.&nbsp; But parallel to that, =
we have a huge and valuable legacy in providing arts education programming =
across the country, whether it is touring theater for young audience, or br=
inging teachers and the civic leaders
 of communities together to provide strong arts education programs.&nbsp; W=
e believe that this expertise in this area will strengthen the Turnaround A=
rts operations and allow that program to expand and to probably amplify its=
 impact on our communities.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, some people have asked=
 me why it=92s important that Turnaround Arts comes to the Kennedy Center a=
nd vice versa.&nbsp; The addition really allows us to focus on some of the =
new geographic areas.&nbsp; The Kennedy Center reaches nearly every
 state, but these will be new geographic areas, and it complements the ones=
 that we are already serving.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are already reaching 11 =
million students and families and educators through programs that we alread=
y have in place, such as ArtsEdge, which is our digital channel for educati=
on programs; Any Given Child; our Changing Education Through
 the Arts; and the National Partnerships in Education.&nbsp; But those are =
more at a high level, helping teachers and administrators, civic leaders to=
 help understand and work to strengthen schools.
<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the Turnaround Arts pr=
ogramming, we will partner with a really fantastic team that the President=
=92s committee has built to actually deliver the programs in these schools.=
&nbsp; So this is one of those magical partnerships where the
 strengths that we have and the strengths that the Turnaround Arts team hav=
e will really benefit each of the already existing programs.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kennedy Center can prov=
ide access to resources.&nbsp; We can strengthen some of the capacity-build=
ing and professional development.&nbsp; And we have a vast network of teach=
ing artists and arts educators through the programs I just mentioned,
 which will then help support the Turnaround Arts program.&nbsp; We also ha=
ve a very rigorous research and development component here built into our e=
ducation team, which can measure the impact and then help refine programmin=
g and inform future programming.<p></p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is one of those fan=
tastic experiences where we find that we come together and two plus two pro=
bably equals six or eight -- something much more than the just the two orga=
nizations coming together.&nbsp; And if we can use it as an
 opportunity to shine a spotlight on the benefit and the value that arts ed=
ucation can do, not just for the least served but for all students across t=
he country, that we can remove barriers to arts learning and support the em=
erging citizen artists that we need
 to inspire the next generation.&nbsp; We couldn=92t be more thrilled about=
 this next step for our two organizations.<p></p></p>
