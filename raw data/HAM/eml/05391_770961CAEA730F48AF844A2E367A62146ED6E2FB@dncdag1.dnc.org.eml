- He's got a print out of a Washington Post article saying it's time for people to admit the voters want him
- Club for Growth "whatever that is" spends millions on negative ads
- Club for Growth asked him for $1 million. He'd rather just throw that money out a window and let people pick it up
- Trump claims Tom Brady likes him, so that's good. Crowd boos Tom Brady
- bragging that he goes on TV so much because he gets great ratings
- Calling protestors thugs, the guy who jumped on a cop car should be put in jail for five years. Our police in this country are incredible and they put up with a lot
- Says mayor of Terre Haute is doing a great job, needs a little help from the federal government. Need China to stop devaluing its currency
- Talking about Carrier. Says Terre Haute has lost 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since recession
- Says we have a $505 billion trade deficit with China (fact checks say it's not this high)
- Global warming is the single biggest problem in our society, but it's of the nuclear variety.
- We have no growth. It's so little it's not even really measurable. Thinks it's actually probably negative growth
- Calls to knock the hell out of ISIS
- He didn't want to go into Iraq right from the beginning, thought it would destabilize (fact checks say false)
- Iraq is like a revolution. Iran will take over without hardly a shot fired, they'll get the second largest oil reserves in the world.
- Hillary could have run the government in Iraq, both are crooked
- Doesn't love Saddam Hussein, but he killed terrorists. And he didn't give trials that lasted forever. We read people their rights. Tries to say if someone doesn't have a lawyer we let them go. It's so stupid.
- Claims 5 percent unemployment is a phony number (fact checks say false)
- Claims his wall will cost $10 billion
- Trump says something about wanting his own Washington monument?
- Trump arguing Bobby Knight endorsement better than Fiorina endorsement. That's what you call somebody who matters.
- Bragging about endorsements from Joe Arpaio, Jerry Falwell jr, Border agent union
- NAFTA has destroyed every place it's touched. We're going to renegotiate our trade deals
- Cruz and Kasich are hanging by their fingers. Soon will go after crooked Hillary
- Doesn't really want Lindsey Graham's endorsement
- Women want to see a strong military, strong borders. Nobody will be better for women or women's health issues than him
- Brings up Heidi Cruz saying Ted is an immigrant, saying he's been saying that for months that Cruz is an immigrant and can't be president
- People hate Ted
- Lot of bad things happened in IA, should have won
- GOP one of the hottest parties in the world right now
- Claims Trump is buying off delegates
- If they win in Indiana it's over, so excited to go after Crooked Hillary
- Mocking Lindsey Graham some more
- He's not playing the second ballot game, he's only playing to win
- Hitting Cruz for choosing a VP even though he has no path to victory
- He's going to be presidential once president
- drugs are pouring across our border like water
- complaining we're protecting Saudi Arabia. America First.
- When does the UN go and make deals? Why don't you hear about them making deals anymore?
- Palestinians grow up as young people hating Israel
- Never met a person from Israel that didn't want to make the deal.
- Says we should threaten to leave NATO if they won't pay. Not only do they have to pay us, they have to pay us for the delinquent.
- Again claims he didn't want to go into Iraq. Hillary wanted to go into Iraq. She has bad judgment. Sanders said she has bad judgment, he's going to use that as a soundbite.
