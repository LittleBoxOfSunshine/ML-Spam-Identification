The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friend --

Every day the Democratic Party fights for people of all stripes, because =
we know that America is at its best when each of us has the opportunity to =
fulfill our God-given potential. That's why we fought to expand healthcare =
to millions of Americans, ensure equal pay for women, and protect the =
middle class.=20

The values we share as Democrats could not stand in starker contrast to =
those of Republicans and their presumptive nominee for president, Donald =
Trump.

Their dangerous vision for America threatens all of the progress we have =
made under President Obama, which is why we must stand up and fight -- for =
his legacy and our future. We have the opportunity to take a stand when =
DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz rallies Democrats in Knoxville on =
Thursday, June 2nd. To RSVP for this important event, please click the =
link below:

https://finance.democrats.org/KnoxvilleJune2

This election is too important to remain on the sidelines.

Thank you for your support.
