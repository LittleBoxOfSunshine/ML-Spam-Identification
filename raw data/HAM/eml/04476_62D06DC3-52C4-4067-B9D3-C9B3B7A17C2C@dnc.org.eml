FYI, this morning on CNN Jeff Weaver was asked about the protests and threa=
ts of violence in Nevada. He begins by saying Sanders supporters should =93=
act in a civil way=94 but then goes on to hit the state party. Here is a tr=
anscript:

Jeff Weaver--

=85 Well, look, the senator has been very clear, people who are supporting =
the senator should act in a civil way. They should obviously fight within t=
he context, and by fight, I mean contest if there is a convention, they sho=
uld be there, they should present their case. And then they should let the =
votes fall where they may. The situation in Nevada is a little bit differen=
t. Obviously no context justifies any kinds of threat or violence. But you =
know, we have been obviously campaigning in Nevada for almost a year, becau=
se of, you know, it's one of the early states. The state party there has a =
lot of problems. They've run things very poorly. It has been done very unde=
mocratically. And there seems to be an unwillingness on the part of the Nev=
ada democratic party to bring in all of the new people that Bernie Sanders =
has brought into the process. If you read some of the reports from what wen=
t on there, the chair was clearly ignoring votes from the floor at the Clar=
k county democratic convention in Nevada. They tried to arrest their own cr=
edentials chair, because she was being too fair to the Sanders people. I me=
an, it is dysfunctional or worse out there in the Nevada state democratic p=
arty. Obviously it is not a reflection of all Democrats in Nevada, but the =
party hierarchy, there=92s a lot of problems there. I mean they had a conve=
ntion where they didn't have enough chairs for the number of people who wer=
e supposed to be there. Obviously you're trying to exclude people if the ro=
om is too small for the anticipated audience. So there is a lot of work to =
be done. We could have a whole show on the Nevada state democratic party. B=
ut regardless =96

Chris Cuomo, CNN--

You're making the same case that Trump seems to be making, the system is se=
t up against Sanders, the Democrats are against him, and that he should run=
 for a third party.

Is Trump right?

Jeff Weaver--

No, Trump is wrong. You know, we have interacted with state parties all acr=
oss the country. And some are more fair than others. Some are, I have to sa=
y, some are extremely fair. It just happens in Nevada not to be the case.
