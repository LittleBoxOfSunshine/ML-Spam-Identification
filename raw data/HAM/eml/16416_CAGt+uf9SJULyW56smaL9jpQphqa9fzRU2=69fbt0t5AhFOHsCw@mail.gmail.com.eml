Dear A.J.,

President Obama is headlining a roundtable fundraiser in the DC area on
Wednesday, May 18th benefitting the DNC.

The Goldbergs attended a roundtable over a year ago.  The format is exactly
the same.  Up to 25 guests seated "roundtable style" with briefing from a
top Democratic official preceded or followed by one hour discussion with
the President.  A candid photo is taken with the President and each guest
as he enters the room and greets guests walking around the "table" as he
proceeds to his seat.

The money goes to our crucial build for the election this year, with focus
on the presidential and down ballot opportunities.  This involves
constantly updating and providing our voter file to state parties and
Democratic candidates, running an aggressive press/media program, preparing
for legal challenges and voting irregularities and funding our convention
obligations.

The presidential election year is by far our biggest budget obligation out
of the four year cycle since the last presidential election.

Would the Goldbergs be interested in hosting the event at their Maryland
home on May 18th?  We are asking any hosts to commit to put together/raise
half of the event goal.  This would involve about $350,000 in host
commitment.

As you know, individual donors can contribute up to $334,000 to the DNC in
a single calendar year.

After their previous gifts this year via HVF, they can each give up to
$300,600 directly to the DNC. This benefits the eventual presidential
nominee in a major way.

We don't have exact timing yet that day.  We hope to hear from the White
House very shortly on exact start time for the event.

Let me know if you need further information. Very sorry for the short
notice.  If it is possible to have an answer by earlier tomorrow, that is
very helpful.  Thanks to them for any consideration!

All the best,

Andrew
