REPUBLICAN KASICH ASSESSES FUTURE AFTER CRUZ DROPS OUT<http://www.newsweek.com/republican-kasich-assesses-future-after-cruz-drops-out-455589>
NEWSWEEK // MICHELE GORMAN
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper on Wednesday issued a statement criticizing Governor Kasich for traveling out of the state for more than 200 days during his presidential campaign. He listed issues that need to be dealt with in the state, including job growth that has trailed the national average, a public school system that has plummeted from fifth to 23rd in the country and more children living in poverty now than during the height of the recession in 2008.

"It's time that Ohio had a governor who was actually doing something about all of that, rather than gallivanting across the country," Pepper said. "We hope that the Kasich administration will provide a full accounting of the cost to Ohio taxpayers and Kasich's campaign will reimburse the state for every single penny that his failed campaign cost the taxpayers of Ohio."

Nevada Democratic Party hopes Trump will be 'albatross' for down-ballot Republicans<http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/nevada-democrats-trump-down-ballot-222799>
POLITICO // BRIANNA GURCIULLO
As political leaders across the ideological spectrum weighed in Wednesday on a Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton match-up, the Nevada State Democratic Party had a snarkier take.

In a letter to "Dangerous Donald," Chair Roberta Lange congratulated Trump on his victory in Indiana on Tuesday, which led to Ted Cruz and John Kasich suspending their campaigns. And Lange invited Trump to "come back to Nevada as soon as possible."

"Nevada will be a key battleground up and down the ballot in 2016," Lange wrote. "But we're eager to see just how big of an albatross you can be for down-ballot Republicans."

The chair added: "And we know for a fact your racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant rhetoric will inspire even more of our supporters to get involved and elect Democrats."

Many Nevada Republicans get behind Trump as nominee
<http://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2016/05/04/many-nevada-republicans-get-behind-trump-nominee/83951220/>RENO GAZETTE JOURNAL // SETH A. RICHARDSON
The overall support from Republican candidates comes as Democrats released a flurry of criticisms against Trump aimed at courting voters in the general election. The Clinton campaign released a statement calling Trump a bully while Nevada Democratic Party Chairwoman Roberta Lange released a letter - referring to Trump as "Dangerous Donald" - stating an eagerness "to see just how big of an albatross" Trump will be in the state races.

"Unlike the Republicans, Democrats are actually going to hold you accountable," Lange said in the letter. "And we know for a fact your racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant rhetoric will inspire even more of our supporters to get involved and elect Democrats."
...

Plus, Hansen said, the Democrats have problems of their own with a still-contested primary between Clinton and Sanders.

"I think if you end up with Hillary for the Democrats and Trump for the Republicans, I think Hillary will actually suppress the base vote of the Democratic Party," Hansen said. "The younger people who have been supporting Bernie Sanders will not be very enthusiastic about her. And I think Trump will have a substantial crossover."

Trump's looming nomination poses problem for GOP candidates in Nevada<http://www.reviewjournal.com/politics/elections/trump-s-looming-nomination-poses-problem-gop-candidates-nevada>
LAS VEGAS REVIEW JOURNAL
The Nevada State Democratic Party reacted with a tongue-in-cheek letter inviting Trump to the state. Signed by state party Chairwoman Roberta Lange, the letter to Trump highlighted Nevada's role as a battleground state, including congressional races and the open Senate seat that Reid is vacating. Lange wrote that Democrats are in "strong position to win" those races, adding, "But we're eager to see just how big of an albatross you can be for down-ballot Republicans." Pointing to prominent GOP candidates supporting Trump, including Heck and Hardy, Lange wrote: "So Nevada Republicans are sure to welcome you here with open arms." She added: "Unlike the Republicans, Democrats are actually going to hold you accountable. And we know for a fact your racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant rhetoric will inspire even more of our supporters to get involved and elect Democrats."

There are a few Democratic-leaning states he might make more competitive, such as Pennsylvania, with its large population of disaffected working-class whites. But there are others that have been reliably Republican, like Arizona and Georgia, that could come into play if Latinos and other minorities, antagonized by Trump's insults, turn out in high numbers.

In Nevada, a major battleground in the last few elections, the state Democratic Party sent a taunting letter Wednesday urging Trump - "Dear Dangerous Donald" - to campaign there, figuring it would hurt his candidacy and other Republicans as well.

"General election," wrote Nevada Democratic Party Chairwoman Roberta Lange, "here we go!"

Ohio Democrats happy about Trump as presumptive GOP nominee
<http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article75819237.html>AP // DAN SEWELL
Ohio Democrats are happy for businessman Donald Trump - that is, happy for the prospect of the brash presumptive Republican presidential nominee topping the opposition ticket in November.

Party Chairman David Pepper said Thursday that Democrats are preparing for a tough campaign in the swing state, but think Trump could lift turnout for Democrats while complicating other Republicans' campaigns.

"Every candidate will have to win their own race, but I think the broader environment is one that puts people like (U.S. Sen.) Rob Portman in a very difficult position, not just because I think a lot of Republicans will be torn about the top of the ticket; I also think the tone that Donald Trump is setting makes it very hard," Pepper said.

As Pepper spoke, an aide held up a poster with a large Portman photo with a smaller one of Trump calling on him to "denounce Trump."

Portman had hoped Ohio Gov. John Kasich would be the nominee. After Kasich bowed out Wednesday, Portman's campaign reiterated he intends to support the GOP nominee as he battles for re-election against Democratic former Gov. Ted Strickland. Strickland campaign spokesman David Bergstein says Trump's nomination will be Portman's "election nightmare.
...

Democrat state Rep. Denise Driehaus, running for Hamilton County commissioner, and Aftab Pureval, an attorney of Asian descent running for county clerk of courts, joined Pepper and said Trump's insulting comments about women and immigrants will hang over other Republicans.

WMUR 9 // JOHN DISTASO
A state Democratic Party that's feeling pretty good about its chances in November will roll out a memo on Thursday tying Trump to Ayotte and the four GOP candidates for governor.

Surprise! It predicts disaster for the GOP candidates in New Hampshire.

The memo cites reports that split ticket voting is not as prevalent as it once was and polling numbers, including a recent WMUR Granite State Poll, which showed Trump losing the state to either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.

The memo predicts that Republicans will try to distance themselves from Trump, but that it will be a failed strategy.

"The numbers tell a different tale," the memo says. "They say that come November, Trump's candidacy will be a disaster for whoever emerges as the Republican gubernatorial candidate, for Sen. Ayotte and for the rest of New Hampshire Republicans."

State GOP: Rally for Trump or run for the hills - or Hillary?<http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/state-gop-divided-over-trumps-triumph/>
SEATTLE TIMES // JIM BRUNNER
The top-of-the-ticket problem for Washington Republicans is not new. The state hasn't favored a Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Democrats are already working to tie all GOP candidates to the party's presidential nominee. "The Republican Party is now officially the party of Trump," state Democratic Party chair Jaxon Ravens said in a statement, trashing Trump's "hateful and dangerous remarks about women, Hispanics, and Muslims."

VT DIGGER // JASPER CRAVEN
Leaders in the Vermont Democratic Party have been prepping for a Trump candidacy for months and will likely work to link every controversial Trumpism to Vermont Republicans as the election approaches. "The Republican Party has all but officially nominated a man for president who has created a campaign out of fear and hatred," said Vermont Democratic spokeswoman Christina Amestoy in a statement Wednesday. "... His blatant disregard for civil liberties, his promotion of violence, and his horrifying language directed at women and minorities cannot be taken lightly and must be stopped."

As GOP divisions grow, Martinez remains silent on Trump endorsement<http://www.taosnews.com/article_bcf7b628-12fe-11e6-a05e-e7a29ced5031.html>
TAOS NEWS // STEVE TERRELL
In a statement Tuesday night, New Mexico Democratic Party Chairwoman Debra Haaland said, "Gov. Martinez can't hide from reporters much longer - New Mexicans deserve an honest answer on whether our governor will stand with Donald Trump and his offensive remarks and reckless policy positions now that he has a clear path to the nomination." Though Martinez didn't initially announce her intentions, the state Republican Party, echoing the sentiments expressed by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, issued a statement shortly after the Indiana results were in. "With Donald Trump's win in Indiana and Ted Cruz dropping out, Trump has functionally secured the nomination," party spokesman Tucker Keene said. "We look forward to seeing Donald Trump in New Mexico and working with our nominee to defeat Hillary Clinton in November and delivering our five electoral votes for the Republicans."

In New Mexico, Democrats and GOP scrutinize Trump<http://krqe.com/2016/05/05/in-new-mexico-democrats-and-gop-scrutinize-trump/>
KRQE NEWS // AP
Leading Democrats in New Mexico are taking aim at Donald Trump as the state's Republican governor withholds her full endorsement of the presumptive GOP nominee. State Democratic lawmakers and party leaders gathered at an outdoor plaza Thursday in Albuquerque to highlight a disconnect they see between Trump's candidacy and New Mexico values. Both major parties are reaching out to constituents days before a registration deadline to vote in New Mexico's June 7 primary election. Republican Gov. Susana Martinez won't indicate yet whether she will vote for Trump and says she first wants to hear how he plans to support national weapons laboratories and military bases in the state. State Democratic Chairwoman Debra Haaland says Trump is unqualified and needs to be pressed on issues such as immigration and income inequality.

Arkansas GOP says loyal will sign on to Trump bid<http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/may/05/state-gop-says-loyal-will-sign-on-20160/#/>
ARKANSAS ONLINE // FRANK LOCKWOOD
A Democratic Party of Arkansas official said it's too early to say how Trump's nomination would play out in Arkansas. "We're in uncharted territory right now," said party spokesman H.L. Moody. "What was funny yesterday is no longer a joke, and no one is laughing today." Trump's ascendancy is cause for concern, he said. "This guy is the most dangerous person who the Republican Party could possibly nominate. He doesn't have the knowledge or the experience or the worldview to be the commander in chief," Moody said.

WRAL // LAURA LESLIE
With so many of Trump's comments recorded on video or social media and heavily reported by the press, state Democratic Party spokesman David Miranda said the rebranding of the Republican front-runner is likely to be difficult. "We've seen him over the course of this debate divide the country, insulting the disabled, African-Americans, Latinos, women repeatedly - any group, name it," Miranda said. "Trump has divided us as a country, and that's not what we need. We need someone who can bring us together."

...

Current national poll averages show Clinton ahead of Trump. Still, Miranda said, Democrats believe Trump would be a "disastrous" president and will work hard to make sure he doesn't occupy the Oval Office. "We're not taking anything for granted. Republicans took Donald Trump for granted, and now he's the nominee," Miranda said. "We think he is a very serious threat to the country. So, we're going to work hard for every vote, and we're hopeful that, if we do the work, we can win here in North Carolina and around the country, up and down the ticket."

ATLANTA JOURNAL CONSTITUTION // GREG BLUESTEIN AND JIM GALLOWAY
Georgia Democrats are attempting to do their part, by tying the new GOP standard-bearer. Noting our Thursday piece about Republican statewide officials closing ranks around the billionaire, state Democratic party chair DuBose Porter expressed horror at the "shocking embrace" of Donald Trump. Said Porter:"Donald Trump may be the most dangerous presidential candidate of our lifetime and the ruling class of the Georgia GOP seems perfectly fine with the impending chaos of a potential-yet improbable-Trump presidency. How on Earth could Johnny Isakson, David Perdue and the rest of that crew trust a volatile, divisive figure to lead the greatest armed forces in the World? How can they sleep at night with the looming prospect of Donald Trump being in possession of nuclear codes?"

Virginia Democrats wasted little time rousing supporters after Trump emerged victorious. The first anti-Trump fundraising appeal went out immediately after Cruz withdrew. In a statement, Democratic Party of Virginia Chairwoman Susan Swecker called Trump "the most dangerous person who has ever been nominated by a national party." "His policies would drive our economy into ruin, subvert the status of women in the United States, and cause irreparable damage to the international world order," Swecker said. "Donald Trump is dangerous, he is not fit to be president, and Democrats are united to defeat him."

BRISTOL HERALD COURIER // ROBERT SORRELL
Susan Swecker, chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, issued a statement after Trump became the likely nominee. "Donald Trump is the most dangerous person who has ever been nominated by a national party," Swecker said. "He cannot be trusted with our military, nuclear weapons and diplomatic relations. Donald Trump is not suited to be commander in chief of the United States of America. His policies would drive our economy into ruin, subvert the status of women in the United States, and cause irreparable damage to the international world order." She added that Trump is "dangerous, not fit to be president and Democrats are united to defeat him." In Tennessee, state Democratic Party Chairwoman Mary Mancini also said Trump is dangerous. "Donald Trump has built his campaign on fear, stoking the embers of racism, sexism, and xenophobia that still remain in this country, but that hasn't stopped the Tennessee Republicans from endorsing and actively campaigning for him," Mancini said.

WASHINGTON POST // LAURA VOZZELLA
Democrats pounced, issuing a statement that sought to link Gillespie to some of Trump's most controversial comments. (Wittman's statement came after the Democrats sent out their release, so it needled him only for remaining "silent.") "With Gillespie's newfound support of Trump, Virginians are left with several questions: Does Gillespie support Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border?," the Democratic Party of Virginia said in its release. "Does Gillespie agree with Donald Trump that women should be punished for seeking abortions? Does Gillespie agree with Donald Trump that Islam hates America and that Muslims should be banned from traveling to the United States?"

State Democrats Say Trump Nomination is a Gift<http://www.courant.com/politics/hc-democrats-congress-nominate-20160506-story.html>

The state Democratic Party will nominate six incumbents as it looks to maintain control over Connecticut's delegation in Washington. And right now, the Democrats like what they see on the political horizon. Nick Balletto, chairman of the party, said he thinks the slate will do well against a Republican ticket led by Donald Trump, the presumptive presidential nominee. He said Trump's extremist views are out of step with Connecticut voters. "For us I think the best thing in the world is Trump at the top of the Republican ticket," Balletto said. Balletto said Republicans are "in their own little universe," and recalled a bumper sticker he had recently seen - "Democratic Party: We're not perfect, but they're nuts."

Already, Democrats were targeting that demographic.

The national Democratic Governors Association is going after Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, accusing him of silently supporting presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.
...

But local and national Democrats say that's not enough. They said by failing to speak out and declaring Trump a danger to his party, the state and the country, Hogan is helping him.

"Absolutely, it is a silent endorsement. By doing nothing, he caused the outcome," said Patrick Murray, executive director of the Maryland state Democratic Party. "Frankly, Larry Hogan had ample opportunity to convince Maryland Republicans that Donald Trump is dangerous for our state and our country. He didn't take those opportunities."

The criticism came as Trump began the process of selecting a running mate and uniting the party

On the other side of the political coin, Democratic Party Chair Joe McNamara said he believes both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders would beat Trump in November, but he still expressed fear at the thought of him in the Oval Office. "The possibility that he could be president is horrifying," said Rep. McNamara. "Some of his statements he has made are so outrageous. They just highlight the fact that the world would be a much more dangerous place." McNamara referenced Trump's plan to stop muslim immigration, and his support for the use of torture. "Look at the big picture," Trillo said. "Don't zero in on these small little things that are politically incorrect." Trillo said he believes Trump could win Rhode Island in November, but the numbers from last week's Rhode Island primary indicate it's still a blue state. "Hillary Clinton lost, and got more votes than the entire GOP field," said McNamara. About 52,700 Rhode Islanders voted for Clinton in the primary, compared to about 39,200 for Trump. Bernie Sanders won the most votes, at nearly 67,000.

Texas Democrats, meanwhile, declared the rival party dead as s00n as it became clear Trump was the presumptive nominee.

The chair of the Florida Democratic Party is scolding Republican candidates for supporting Donald Trump as the Republican nominee. "Donald Trump is the most dangerous presidential candidate in living memory, and every Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Florida believes he has passed the commander-in-chief test," said Allison Tant in a statement. "Their willingness to turn over the most powerful military in the world to a pathological liar with poor impulse control disqualifies them from serving the people of Florida in the Senate."

On Thursday, the state Democratic Party said the support for Trump will be remembered when voters head to the polls this year."Floridians from all walks of life who have been targets of Trump's racism, sexism, and xenophobia will remember in November," said Tant in a statement.

The Pennsylvania Democratic Party targeted Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who is seeking his second term in what is expected to be a close race against Democrat Katie McGinty, with a series of questions aimed to tying Toomey to Trump."Does Toomey think Donald Trump is qualified to nominate the next Supreme Court justice?" the statement asked. "How does Toomey square his support of Trump with the presidential nominee's belief that 'wages are too high' in America?" Toomey initially endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, for president. After Rubio dropped out, Toomey voted for Cruz in the Pennsylvania primary. But like so many Republican elected officials, even those wary of Trump, he has said he will also back whoever wins the nomination.

Arizona Democratic Party <http://www.azdem.org/john-mccain%E2%80%99s-running-trump>
JOHN MCCAIN'S RUNNING WITH TRUMP
It's official: John McCain now supports Donald Trump for president. After months of pledging to support the GOP nominee no matter who, even if it's Trump, McCain now gets to support the new face of the Republican Party.

Thirty-three years in Washington have changed John McCain from a "straight talker" and maverick to a politician focused on his own political survival. A truth reinforced by the actions of his former top aide, Mark Salter, whose disgust with Donald Trump led him to declare his support for Hillary Clinton.

Despite Salter's recognition of the dangerous policies of Donald Trump, McCain has vowed he'll support the GOP nominee -- even if it's Trump.

"John McCain has made it clear he will continue to support Donald Trump even though Trump has attacked women, Latinos, Muslims, and POW's," said Arizona Democratic Party spokesman Enrique Gutierrez. "That's not the kind of straight talk John McCain used to offer, and it's proof that he has changed after 33 years in Washington. Now, McCain must answer for the divisive, hate-mongering candidate at top of the GOP ticket."

TENNESSEE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIR: "TRUMP MOST DANGEROUS NOMINEE IN HISTORY"
Tennessee Democratic Party Chair Mary Mancini released the following statement regarding the 'Real' Donald Trump and his connection to Tennessee Republicans:

"Donald Trump has built his campaign on fear, stoking the embers of racism, sexism, and xenophobia that still remain in this country, but that hasn't stopped the Tennessee Republicans from endorsing and actively campaigning for him.

Their support for Trump reveals their true priorities, which have nothing to do with solving problems or governing Tennessee effectively and everything to do with the politics of pleasing the extremists in their own Party. It is beyond sad that our state's Republicans are standing behind someone who continues to do so much harm to our country."

Thune and Noem Must Draw Line in Sand on Trump
The South Dakota Democratic Party called on South Dakota Republican leadership to denounce Donald Trump ahead of the June 7th primary. Ann Tornberg, Chair of the South Dakota Democratic Party released the following statement:

"Sometimes silence speaks louder than words. By staying silent, John Thune and Kristi Noem have allowed Donald Trump's violent, misogynistic, conspiratorial, racist campaign to blossom. Mike Rounds has practically endorsed the KKK's endorsement of Trump.

History will not judge the weak-willed who acquiesced to Trump's bigotry kindly. John Thune and Kristi Noem can't have it both ways. They can't brag about their spots in party leadership, but then contend they're powerless to stop him. What has that leadership gotten South Dakota? What has it done for our country?
...
There is only one acceptable answer. Draw a line in the sand, put your country ahead of your party and denounce the threat Trump poses to American democracy."



Texas Democratic Party<http://www.txdemocrats.org/press/dangerous-reality-tv-star-donald-trump-will-be-the-republican-nominee>
RELEASE: Dangerous Reality TV star Donald Trump will be the Republican Nominee
Today, John Kasich ended his lackluster campaign making tabloid-touting reality TV star Donald Trump the last remaining Republican candidate. It's time for Republicans to get real comfortable with dangerous Donald Trump being the voice and face of their party.

Texas Democratic Party Deputy Executive Director Manny Garcia issued the following statement:

"For years, Texas Republicans have created the environment for someone like Donald Trump to thrive. The Grand Old Party is dead. This is now Donald Trump's Republican Party.

"Put simply, Trump only cares about Trump. He has built a campaign on racism, sexism, and xenophobia. He has the support of KKK leaders and incites violence among his supporters. Clearly, he's not fighting for Texas families.

"It's time Republicans recognize their party is imploding."

Louisiana Democratic Party<https://louisianademocrats.org/2016/05/04/bobby-jindal-embraces-madman-endorses-trump-with-kiss-of-death/>
BOBBY JINDAL EMBRACES 'MADMAN,' ENDORSES TRUMP WITH KISS OF DEATH
As Donald Trump consolidates his death-grip on the Republican presidential nomination, former Governor Bobby Jindal has eagerly abandoned any pretense of principle to jump on the bandwagon and endorse a candidate he once described as a "madman who must be stopped." With his own vanity campaign long since run into the ground, and with the people of Louisiana focused on rebuilding from the ruins of his disastrous administration, Jindal showed the depth of his conviction by voicing support for a "narcissistic egomaniac" for president.
...

"On the verge of winning the Republican nomination, it looks like Donald Trump just received the political 'Kiss of Death,'" said Michael McHale, Vice Chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party. "Getting the support of a failed governor and a failed candidate like Bobby Jindal shows you just what kind of a disaster Trump would be. Jindal and Trump are peas in a pod: both cynical opportunists without real ideas or real solutions. Hopefully Mr. Trump's campaign will receive the same kind of support as Jindal's presidential campaign, and we can move them both into the ash bin of history."

Kansas Democratic Party<http://www.ksdp.org/2016/05/rep-kevin-yoder-endorses-donald-trump-who-else/>

Rep. Kevin Yoder endorses Trump; Kansas awaits answers from Jenkins, Huelskamp, Pompeo, Moran, and Roberts
Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump has employed hate and bigotry as his platform. Today, we face a sobering reality: Donald Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee.

This man is a danger to our country and to its people. He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to lead the United States. He's brazenly attacked immigrants, women, and countless other groups, even as he refused to disavow the support of David Duke and white supremacist groups. Our own Kansas Representative Kevin Yoder of the 1st Congressional District announced his support for Trump yesterday. His district did not vote for Trump in the
caucuses, nor did most of Kansas.

"Right here in our state, we've seen the devastation that the GOP can inflict firsthand - we're living it every day. We can't have our elected federal officials supporting someone who will further the divisive atmosphere and encourage hatred and violence," said KDP Executive Director Kerry Gooch. "A vote this year for Kevin Yoder is a vote for Donald Trump."



The Kansas Democratic Party calls on our remaining officials Sen. Pat Roberts,
Sen. Jerry Moran, Rep. Tim Huelskamp (CD 1), Rep. Lynn Jenkins (CD 2), Rep. Mike Pompeo (CD 4): Will you support Donald Trump for president? Kansans deserve to know.

Nebraska Democratic Party
If Major Republican Leaders won't Endorse Donald Trump, Then Why is Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert?
Yesterday the political shockwaves were still being felt with Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert's public endorsement of Donald Trump for President. With Jean Stothert's endorsement of a candidate who calls women "dogs" and "fat pigs" and Mexican immigrants "rapists" and "drug dealers", the question Omahans are still asking her is: why?

On Wednesday, former Douglas County Republican Party Chairman Bryan Baumgart announced he is leaving the Republican Party because Donald Trump is the GOP nominee.

"The party is not unified behind Donald Trump," Baumgart said. "We want to separate ourselves from the Donald Trump supporters. We don't condone the disparaging remarks he makes against women or veterans or minorities or handicapped<http://nebraskademocrats.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=167dfca327ee062d99da12c83&id=ca54483f59&e=c2627598eb>."

However, it only appears to get worse for Jean Stothert in her decision to endorse Donald Trump. Just yesterday, Former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush announced<http://nebraskademocrats.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=167dfca327ee062d99da12c83&id=67378d6177&e=c2627598eb> they would not be endorsing Donald Trump for President.

...
"Jean Stothert will at some point have to explain why she endorsed someone who not only offends women, minorities, and veterans, but also distinguished leaders and members of her own political party," Richters said.

WISCONSIN DEMOCRATIC PARTY
<http://www.wisdems.org/news/icymi-the-headline-says-it-all>ICYMI: The Headline Says It All
Asked, as he was ending Friday's press conference, if Trump can win a general election in Wisconsin, Johnson described the question as "hypothetical." A reporter pointed out that, with Trump as the presumptive nominee, it's no longer hypothetical."

Read the following article: Ron Johnson on Donald Trump: 'I fully intend to support our nominee'<http://wisdems.us1.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=5fdce0a26f89c28febc13998d&id=54c3ceb7fd&e=90841c27c2>

DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF WISCONSIN
<http://www.wisdems.org/news/senate-republicans-are-all-aboard-the-trump-train>Wisconsin Republicans are All Aboard the Trump Train
On Tuesday, Donald Trump successfully completed his hostile takeover of the Republican Party by winning the Indiana primary which forced out his two main rivals and all but secured the Republican presidential nomination. Donald Trump's dangerous, sexist, racist, and xenophobic rhetoric didn't stop Republican leaders in Wisconsin from eagerly jumping on the Trump train.

"Throughout the entire primary season, Democrats have acted presidential, sharing ideas on how to make the economy work for everyone, make higher education affordable, raise wages for workers, increase access to quality and affordable healthcare, and invest in hard-working families through paid family leave," Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair, Martha Laning, said on Friday. "Any responsible leader can see that Donald Trump is dangerous and lacks both the judgement and the temperament to be president. His nomination is a result of the Republicans elevating extreme voices and using divisive campaigns for years that sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain. Republicans in Wisconsin should rip up their tickets to the Trump Train."
...

"As Republicans attempt to reconcile their failed strategy of running to the extreme, fervent base of their own Party during the primary, one thing is clear: Donald Trump is a dangerous candidate who should not be a serious consideration for the highest office in the nation. Our country deserves a President with the experience, intelligence and class to serve as leader of the free world. Republicans who board the Trump Train or fail to denounce Donald Trump and his candidacy in an outright manner are doing a disservice to Wisconsinites and their country. Thankfully we have two outstanding Democratic candidates for President who will continue to treat the office with the respect we all know the position deserves. Democrats will be united and hold Donald Trump accountable every day until November 8th." concluded Laning.

 The Clinton campaign released a statement calling Trump a bully while Nevada Democratic Party Chairwoman Roberta Lange released a letter &#8211; referring to Trump as &#8220;Dangerous Donald&#8221; &#8211; stating an eagerness &#8220;to see just how big of an albatross&#8221; Trump will be in
 the state races.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Unlike the Republicans, Democrats are actually going to hold you accountable,&#8221; Lange said in the letter. &#8220;And we know for a fact your racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant rhetoric will inspire even more of our supporters to get involved and elect Democrats.&#8221;</span><o:p></o:p></p>

 about her. And I think Trump will have a substantial crossover.&#8221;</span><o:p></o:p></p>

 as presumptive GOP nominee</span></b><b><span style="color:black;text-decoration:none"><br>
</span></b></a><b><span style="color:black">AP // DAN SEWELL </span></b><span style="color:black"><br>
Ohio Democrats are happy for businessman Donald Trump &#8212; that is, happy for the prospect of the brash presumptive Republican presidential nominee topping the opposition ticket in November.<br>
<br>
Party Chairman David Pepper said Thursday that Democrats are preparing for a tough campaign in the swing state, but think Trump could lift turnout for Democrats while complicating other Republicans' campaigns.<br>
<br>
&quot;Every candidate will have to win their own race, but I think the broader environment is one that puts people like (U.S. Sen.) Rob Portman in a very difficult position, not just because I think a lot of Republicans will be torn about the top of the ticket;
 I also think the tone that Donald Trump is setting makes it very hard,&quot; Pepper said.<br>
<br>
As Pepper spoke, an aide held up a poster with a large Portman photo with a smaller one of Trump calling on him to &quot;denounce Trump.&quot;<br>
<br>
Portman had hoped Ohio Gov. John Kasich would be the nominee. After Kasich bowed out Wednesday, Portman's campaign reiterated he intends to support the GOP nominee as he battles for re-election against Democratic former Gov. Ted Strickland. Strickland campaign
 spokesman David Bergstein says Trump's nomination will be Portman's &quot;election nightmare.<br>
...<br>
<br>
Democrat state Rep. Denise Driehaus, running for Hamilton County commissioner, and Aftab Pureval, an attorney of Asian descent running for county clerk of courts, joined Pepper and said Trump's insulting comments about women and immigrants will hang over other
 Republicans.<br>

 for governor.<br>
<br>
Surprise! It predicts disaster for the GOP candidates in New Hampshire.<br>
<br>
The memo cites reports that split ticket voting is not as prevalent as it once was and polling numbers, including a recent WMUR Granite State Poll, which showed Trump losing the state to either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.<br>
<br>
The memo predicts that Republicans will try to distance themselves from Trump, but that it will be a failed strategy.<br>
<br>
&#8220;The numbers tell a different tale,&#8221; the memo says. &#8220;They say that come November, Trump&#8217;s candidacy will be a disaster for whoever emerges as the Republican gubernatorial candidate, for Sen. Ayotte and for the rest of New Hampshire Republicans.&#8221;<br>

 Cruz withdrew. In a statement, Democratic Party of Virginia Chairwoman Susan Swecker called Trump &#8220;the most dangerous person who has ever been nominated by a national party.&#8221; &#8220;His policies would drive our economy into ruin, subvert the status of women in the

 drive our economy into ruin, subvert the status of women in the United States, and cause irreparable damage to the international world order.&#8221; She added that Trump is &#8220;dangerous, not fit to be president and Democrats are united to defeat him.&#8221; In Tennessee,
 state Democratic Party Chairwoman Mary Mancini also said Trump is dangerous. &#8220;Donald Trump has built his campaign on fear, stoking the embers of racism, sexism, and xenophobia that still remain in this country, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped the Tennessee Republicans
 from endorsing and actively campaigning for him,&#8221; Mancini said.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:black">It&#8217;s official: John McCain now supports Donald Trump for president. After months of pledging to support the GOP nominee no matter who, even if it's Trump,
 McCain now gets to support the new face of the Republican Party.<br>
<br>
Thirty-three years in Washington have changed John McCain from a &quot;straight talker&quot; and maverick to a politician focused on his own political survival. A truth reinforced by the actions of his former top aide, Mark Salter, whose disgust with Donald Trump led
 him to declare his support for Hillary Clinton.<br>
<br>
Despite Salter's recognition of the dangerous policies of Donald Trump, McCain has vowed he&#8217;ll support the GOP nominee -- even if it&#8217;s Trump.<br>
<br>
&#8220;John McCain has made it clear he will continue to support Donald Trump even though Trump has attacked women, Latinos, Muslims, and POW&#8217;s,&#8221; said Arizona Democratic Party spokesman Enrique Gutierrez. &#8220;That's not the kind of straight talk John McCain used to
 offer, and it's proof that he has changed after 33 years in Washington. Now, McCain must answer for the divisive, hate-mongering candidate at top of the GOP ticket.&quot;<br>

<br>
&#8220;Donald Trump has built his campaign on fear, stoking the embers of racism, sexism, and xenophobia that still remain in this country, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped the Tennessee Republicans from endorsing and actively campaigning for him.
<br>
<br>
Their support for Trump reveals their true priorities, which have nothing to do with solving problems or governing Tennessee effectively and everything to do with the politics of pleasing the extremists in their own Party. It is beyond sad that our state&#8217;s
 Republicans are standing behind someone who continues to do so much harm to our country.&#8221;</span><o:p></o:p></p>

</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:black">As Donald Trump consolidates his death-grip on the Republican presidential nomination, former Governor Bobby Jindal has eagerly abandoned any pretense of principle to
 jump on the bandwagon and endorse a candidate he once described as a &#8220;madman who must be stopped.&#8221; With his own vanity campaign long since run into the ground, and with the people of Louisiana focused on rebuilding from the ruins of his disastrous administration,
 Jindal showed the depth of his conviction by voicing support for a &#8220;narcissistic egomaniac&#8221; for president.<br>
&#8230;</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:black"><br>
&#8220;On the verge of winning the Republican nomination, it looks like Donald Trump just received the political &#8216;Kiss of Death,&#8217;&#8221; said Michael McHale, Vice Chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party. &#8220;Getting the support of a failed governor and a failed candidate
 like Bobby Jindal shows you just what kind of a disaster Trump would be. Jindal and Trump are peas in a pod: both cynical opportunists without real ideas or real solutions. Hopefully Mr. Trump&#8217;s campaign will receive the same kind of support as Jindal&#8217;s presidential
 campaign, and we can move them both into the ash bin of history.&#8221;</span><o:p></o:p></p>

On Tuesday, Donald Trump successfully completed his hostile takeover of the Republican Party by winning the Indiana primary which forced out his two main rivals and all but secured the Republican presidential nomination. Donald Trump's dangerous, sexist, racist,

 affordable, raise wages for workers, increase access to quality and affordable healthcare, and invest in hard-working families through paid family leave,&quot; Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair, Martha Laning, said on Friday. &quot;Any responsible leader can see that
 Donald Trump is dangerous and lacks both the judgement and the temperament to be president. His nomination is a result of the Republicans elevating extreme voices and using divisive campaigns for years that sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain.
 Republicans in Wisconsin should rip up their tickets to the Trump Train.&quot;</span><o:p></o:p></p>

 Donald Trump is a dangerous candidate who should not be a serious consideration for the highest office in the nation. Our country deserves a President with the experience, intelligence and class to serve as leader of the free world. Republicans who board the
 Trump Train or fail to denounce Donald Trump and his candidacy in an outright manner are doing a disservice to Wisconsinites and their country. Thankfully we have two outstanding Democratic candidates for President who will continue to treat the office with
 the respect we all know the position deserves. Democrats will be united and hold Donald Trump accountable every day until November 8th.&quot; concluded Laning.
