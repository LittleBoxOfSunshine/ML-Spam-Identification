Hello Finance,

Unfortunately, Mother Nature has rained on our Scandinavian parade. If you have donors who plan on attending, let them know as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Scott

Hi Becca (and Scott, CCed for reference):

Please see below regarding the cancellation of tomorrow's outdoor Nordic Arrival Ceremony due to inclement weather. Please notify your guests that they *will not be able to attend* tomorrow's ceremony now that it will take place indoors, and any guests who show up will be turned away.

Thanks,
Angelica

Good Evening,

Due to inclement weather, the outdoor portion of tomorrow's Nordic Arrival Ceremony has been cancelled and moved inside the White House. Unfortunately, the event is now closed to the public and any guest who arrives for the State Arrival ceremony will be turned away. Please advise your guests of this change and ensure they understand that it nullifies their invitation to the event.

There are no opportunities for the public to attend the indoor ceremony; no exceptions will be made. We encourage guests to view the ceremony live on Whitehouse.gov/live.

As always, feel free to direct your guests to the 24-hour hotline if they have any questions (202-456-7041). This number can also be found at the bottom of their State Arrival Boarding Pass.

Thank you,
The White House Visitors Office
