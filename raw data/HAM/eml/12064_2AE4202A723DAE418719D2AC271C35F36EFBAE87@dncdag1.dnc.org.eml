Trump Now the "Puppet" of GOP SuperPACs and
Right-Wing Billionaires

"Despite numerous promises that he would fund his own
campaign, Trump is now clearly the 'puppet' of
Republican SuperPACs and right-wing billionaires."
 - DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach


Despite arguing that he is "really rich" [link] and wouldn't
take campaign funds from donors because he XXX [comment
and link] Trump has since changed his tune.

This week he said would accept contributions for
his general election campaign. And, today, GOP
mega-donor Sheldon Adelson -- who spent XXX [amount
and link] on SuperPACs during the 2012 election -- said he
would support Trump's campaign. Of, course Trump
said just six months ago that Adelson was "looking to
give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold
him into his perfect little puppet." [link]

Sheldon Adelson Says He Will Support Donald Trump
10:07 pm ET
Thomas Kaplan
and
Maggie Haberman

The casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson said on Thursday night that he would =
support Donald J. Trump now that he has become the Republican Party=92s pre=
sumptive nominee.

=93Yes, I=92m a Republican, he=92s a Republican,=94 Mr. Adelson said in a b=
rief interview. =93He=92s our nominee. Whoever the nominee would turn out t=
o be, any one of the 17 =97 he was one of the 17. He won fair and square.=
=94

Mr. Adelson made the comments while at a gala dinner in Manhattan for the W=
orld Values Network, a Jewish organization.

Mr. Trump went after Mr. Adelson on Twitter in October, writing that the do=
nor wanted to make Senator Marco Rubio of Florida =93his perfect little pup=
pet.=94 But Mr. Trump also courted him; the two men met in December. Mr. Ad=
elson later said they discussed Israel, and that he found Mr. Trump to be =
=93very charming.=94 Mr. Adelson ultimately stayed neutral through the past=
 few months of nominating contests.
Mr. Adelson said on Thursday that he had spoken to Mr. Trump recently, but =
did not elaborate about the timing or nature of their communication. He tol=
d another journalist that he thinks that Mr. Trump =93will be good for Isra=
el.=94

Also on Thursday Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, whose family helped financ=
e a =93super PAC=94 devoted solely to stopping Donald J. Trump, will endors=
e the Republican Party=92s standard-bearer at an Omaha rally on Friday, an =
aide confirmed.

Taylor Gage, a spokesman for the governor, said Mr. Ricketts would appear a=
nd give remarks at the event with Mr. Trump.

The governor =93has said for months that he would support the Republican no=
minee,=94 Mr. Gage said.

Members of the Ricketts family donated millions of dollars to the Our Princ=
iples PAC and seeded its earliest efforts at denying Mr. Trump the nominati=
on. The PAC is still active, but it spent lightly in the Indiana primary, w=
hich Mr. Trump won soundly on Tuesday night.

Mr. Trump also won support from a former rival and the former Texas governo=
r, Rick Perry, who told CNN on Thursday that he would try to help Mr. Trump=
 and was open to being his vice-presidential nominee.

Mr. Perry had carved out early territory in the presidential race last summ=
er by describing Mr. Trump as a =93cancer on conservatism.=94 But Mr. Trump=
 essentially rolled over him, claiming him as an early victim of his own ca=
ndidacy.

Mr. Perry told CNN he would do everything he could to help Mr. Trump.

Those endorsements came on the same day that the House speaker, Paul Ryan o=
f Wisconsin, said he was not prepared to support the nominee yet. Mary Mata=
lin, a former adviser to Dick Cheney, told Bloomberg Politics that she had =
switched her registration to Libertarian.

., on Thursday.]
Donald J. Drumpf wore a miners hard hat during a speech in Charleston, W.V.=
, on Thursday. Ty Wright for The New York Times

CHARLESTON, W.Va. =96 For his first act as the presumptive Republican nomin=
ee, Donald J. Trump strode on stage, extended his arms and conducted the cr=
owd through a chorus of =93Take Me Home, Country Roads.=94

=93We need to put our miners back to work!=94 he shouted Thursday to the cr=
owd of more than 12,000 in the sunken, cavernous concrete Civic Center here=
. Hundreds of miners invited by the campaign to sit behind his podium rose =
in an extended standing ovation.

What followed, in his first campaign event as the last candidate standing i=
n the Republican nomination process, was a Trump rally evolving for the gen=
eral election, still retaining the energetic, fervent and free-flowing styl=
e that endeared him to voters and vaulted him to victory.

Gone was =93lyin=92 Ted,=94 but replaced in equal vitriol with =93crooked H=
illary.=94 Mr. Trump spent extended riffs going after Hillary Clinton, repe=
atedly referencing her comments about wanting to put the coal industry out =
of business (her campaign says she misspoke). He called the Clinton Foundat=
ion =93disgusting,=94 referred to the investigation into her emails as secr=
etary of state and Bill Clinton=92s role in creating the North American Fre=
e Trade Agreement, and made a thinly veiled joke about Mr. Clinton=92s infi=
delities.

=93The Clinton administration, of which Hillary was definitely a part,=94 M=
r. Trump said, continuing, =93she was a part of almost everything. Almost, =
I say, not everything. Almost.=94

.@realDonaldTrump<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump>, conducting the rest=
 of "Take Me Home, Country Roads" -- the song he walked out to in WV tonigh=
t
=97 Jeremy Diamond (=FD@JDiamond1) 10:00 PM - 5 May 2016<https://twitter.co=
m/JDiamond1/status/728404073305800704> =B7 Charleston, WV, United States<ht=
tps://twitter.com/search?q=3Dplace%3A71f2805dd75bc147>

He paused for a beat, as the crowd grew into a mix of laughter and cheers.

=93Terrible,=94 Mr. Trump said, a wry joking tone in his voice. =93I didn=
=92t think the people of West Virginia thought about that. You should be as=
hamed of yourselves. Terrible, terrible people.=94

Also gone were his complaints about the system being rigged against his can=
didacy, although for that he gave an honest answer. =93I used to say it=92s=
 a rigged system, but now I don=92t say it anymore because I won,=94 he sai=
d. =93I don=92t care.=94

And gone were the repeated boasts of being self-funding.

=93By the way, for the general election, I=92m going to help raise money fo=
r the party,=94 he said.

Notably, he made no reference of the speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, wh=
o hours before the event said he was =93not ready=94 to endorse Mr. Trump.

But over all, the candidate was in good spirits, relishing his victory and =
buoyed by the feverish crowd, which shrieked its support at every applause =
break in his speech.

Mr. Trump even donned a hard hat after receiving the endorsement of the Wes=
t Virginia Coal Association, miming using a pick and shovel, before taking =
it off and risking his carefully crafted hair.

=93You know you=92re not allowed to hair spray anymore because it affects t=
he ozone,=94 he said.

He added, in an allusion perhaps to his campaign=92s overall slogan: =93Hai=
r spray=92s not like it used to be. It used to be real good.=94

<p>The casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson said on Thursday night that he wou=
ld support Donald J. Trump now that he has become the Republican Party=92s =
presumptive nominee.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>=93Yes, I=92m a Republican, he=92s a Republican,=94 Mr. Adelson said in =
a brief interview. =93He=92s our nominee. Whoever the nominee would turn ou=
t to be, any one of the 17 =97 he was one of the 17. He won fair and square=
.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Mr. Adelson made the comments while at a gala dinner in Manhattan for th=
e World Values Network, a Jewish organization.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Mr. Trump went after Mr. Adelson on Twitter in October, writing that the=
 donor wanted to make Senator Marco Rubio of Florida =93his perfect little =
puppet.=94 But Mr. Trump also courted him; the two men met in December. Mr.=
 Adelson later said they discussed Israel,
 and that he found Mr. Trump to be =93very charming.=94 Mr. Adelson ultimat=
ely stayed neutral through the past few months of nominating contests.<br>
Mr. Adelson said on Thursday that he had spoken to Mr. Trump recently, but =
did not elaborate about the timing or nature of their communication. He tol=
d another journalist that he thinks that Mr. Trump =93will be good for Isra=
el.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Also on Thursday Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, whose family helped fin=
ance a =93super PAC=94 devoted solely to stopping Donald J. Trump, will end=
orse the Republican Party=92s standard-bearer at an Omaha rally on Friday, =
an aide confirmed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Taylor Gage, a spokesman for the governor, said Mr. Ricketts would appea=
r and give remarks at the event with Mr. Trump.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>The governor =93has said for months that he would support the Republican=
 nominee,=94 Mr. Gage said.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Members of the Ricketts family donated millions of dollars to the Our Pr=
inciples PAC and seeded its earliest efforts at denying Mr. Trump the nomin=
ation. The PAC is still active, but it spent lightly in the Indiana primary=
, which Mr. Trump won soundly on
 Tuesday night.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Mr. Trump also won support from a former rival and the former Texas gove=
rnor, Rick Perry, who told CNN on Thursday that he would try to help Mr. Tr=
ump and was open to being his vice-presidential nominee.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Mr. Perry had carved out early territory in the presidential race last s=
ummer by describing Mr. Trump as a =93cancer on conservatism.=94 But Mr. Tr=
ump essentially rolled over him, claiming him as an early victim of his own=
 candidacy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Mr. Perry told CNN he would do everything he could to help Mr. Trump.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p>Those endorsements came on the same day that the House speaker, Paul Rya=
n of Wisconsin, said he was not prepared to support the nominee yet. Mary M=
atalin, a former adviser to Dick Cheney, told Bloomberg Politics that she h=
ad switched her registration to
 Libertarian.<o:p></o:p></p>

</div>
<p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. =96 For his first act as the presumptive Republican no=
minee, Donald J. Trump strode on stage, extended his arms and conducted the=
 crowd through a chorus of =93Take Me Home, Country Roads.=94<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p>=93We need to put our miners back to work!=94 he shouted Thursday to the=
 crowd of more than 12,000 in the sunken, cavernous concrete Civic Center h=
ere. Hundreds of miners invited by the campaign to sit behind his podium ro=
se in an extended standing ovation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>What followed, in his first campaign event as the last candidate standin=
g in the Republican nomination process, was a Trump rally evolving for the =
general election, still retaining the energetic, fervent and free-flowing s=
tyle that endeared him to voters
 and vaulted him to victory.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Gone was =93lyin=92 Ted,=94 but replaced in equal vitriol with =93crooke=
d Hillary.=94 Mr. Trump spent extended riffs going after Hillary Clinton, r=
epeatedly referencing her comments about wanting to put the coal industry o=
ut of business (her campaign says she misspoke).
 He called the Clinton Foundation =93disgusting,=94 referred to the investi=
gation into her emails as secretary of state and Bill Clinton=92s role in c=
reating the North American Free Trade Agreement, and made a thinly veiled j=
oke about Mr. Clinton=92s infidelities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>=93The Clinton administration, of which Hillary was definitely a part,=
=94 Mr. Trump said, continuing, =93she was a part of almost everything. Alm=
ost, I say, not everything. Almost.=94<o:p></o:p></p>

</div>
<p>He paused for a beat, as the crowd grew into a mix of laughter and cheer=
s.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>=93Terrible,=94 Mr. Trump said, a wry joking tone in his voice. =93I did=
n=92t think the people of West Virginia thought about that. You should be a=
shamed of yourselves. Terrible, terrible people.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Also gone were his complaints about the system being rigged against his =
candidacy, although for that he gave an honest answer. =93I used to say it=
=92s a rigged system, but now I don=92t say it anymore because I won,=94 he=
 said. =93I don=92t care.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And gone were the repeated boasts of being self-funding.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>=93By the way, for the general election, I=92m going to help raise money=
 for the party,=94 he said.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Notably, he made no reference of the speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan,=
 who hours before the event said he was =93not ready=94 to endorse Mr. Trum=
p.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>But over all, the candidate was in good spirits, relishing his victory a=
nd buoyed by the feverish crowd, which shrieked its support at every applau=
se break in his speech.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Mr. Trump even donned a hard hat after receiving the endorsement of the =
West Virginia Coal Association, miming using a pick and shovel, before taki=
ng it off and risking his carefully crafted hair.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>=93You know you=92re not allowed to hair spray anymore because it affect=
s the ozone,=94 he said.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>He added, in an allusion perhaps to his campaign=92s overall slogan: =93=
Hair spray=92s not like it used to be. It used to be real good.=94<o:p></o:=
