By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)

Good Monday morning. AP reminds us that 55 years ago today, in a speech to the National Association of Broadcasters, FCC Chairman Newton N. Minow - a loyal Playbooker, now age 90 -- decried the majority of television programming as a "vast wasteland."

JOE SCARBOROUGH, on MSNBC's "Morning Joe": "How you doing, Donald? It's very funny when you say you don't watch the show. I think it's cute. Keep it up. It makes us feel good that you care that much that you tweet about us." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c9389e570f8f0f1bd317007c1ea59bd2d98c48e8cb3d7746418a

JUST POSTED - "Trump's empty administration: As presumptive nominee takes first steps on transition, GOP policy veterans say they're not interested," by Darren Samuelsohn and Morning Money's Ben White: "Politico interviewed nearly five dozen Republicans over the past two weeks - people with experience working in government and who understand how Congress can enact, or shred, a new president's agenda - and heard the same sentiment expressed repeatedly. If Trump doesn't change his tune or extend much longer olive branches, many of these government veterans say they intend to cede highly coveted administration posts to less-experienced competitors. ... 

"The lack of interest in serving Trump extends from the energy and financial services sectors to defense and foreign policy. ... [T]he absence of experienced professionals at the assistant-secretary level could have profound consequences on the government. ... 'Trump will be able to fill these jobs because there is a whole class of people who want these titles so badly it doesn't matter who is president,' said a former senior George W. Bush administration official. 'But these are B- or C-level people. ... The A-level people, and there are not that many of them to begin with, mostly don't want to work for Trump." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c9383112f91a160a98a34fcb7d567bc8d8dacc668989ae37ef9d

--"Stunned Trump foes face diminished options at GOP convention," by AP's Alan Fram, with Julie Pace and Tom Beaumont: "Trump opponents see the Republican platform ... as a place for a stand in Cleveland. ... Many conservatives say they will use that vote to keep Trump from reshaping GOP dogma against abortion, for free trade and on other issues. ... Erick Erickson, a Trump opponent, said he expected delegates to accede to Trump's selection, saying that by July, 'the phases of depression and anger' will subside as Republicans accept 'their coming defeat.' ...

"Beth Myers, ... Romney's campaign manager in 2012, was not a Trump supporter during the primaries. But she said Trump knows TV and expects his convention to outshine the Democrats' in stagecraft and draw millions more viewers than usual. ... '[I]t will be a production of Trump, Inc., and it will be pretty good live television.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c93896a2d33dcc4cee7f7deadbbcc916e46b09da50c0cb235494 

TRUMP vs. RYAN -- N.Y. Times 1-col. lead, "SPARRING IN G.O.P. RISES OVER PLANS FOR CONVENTION: TRUMP ISSUES WARNING -- Candidate Continues to Spurn the Leaders of Republican Party," by Jeremy Peters: "Trump refused to rule out blocking ... Ryan ... from serving as the convention's chairman. ... [T]he list of speakers from the 2012 convention reads like a list of Mr. Trump's enemies. Many have denounced him, including Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Representative Barbara Comstock of Virginia." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c93853d8e1f61c7c607a5e75982d7892cbb571111f8769e9e970

--WHAT TRUMP SAID on "Meet the Press," when Chuck Todd asked him if Ryan should remain convention chair if he can't endorse the nominee: "I don't want to mention now. I'll see after. I will give you a very solid answer, if that happens, about one minute after that happens. OK? But there's no reason to give it right now. But I'll be very quick with the answer. Let's see what happens ... I don't think that's going to happen. You know, the party's come together. ...

"I'm never going to get Romney's endorsement. He choked. ... I'm never going to get Bush's election. ... I was tough on him, and he was trying to be tough on me, but he's not a very tough guy. ... [A]nd by the way, Chuck, very important: He signed a pledge. He pledged that he would support the nominee. And so did this lightweight, Lindsey Graham."

TRUMP'S AMERICA - "Trump's war on the foreign press: Foreign reporters are steamed at the campaign's ... freeze-out," by Ben Schreckinger and Hadas Gold: "The nationalist tone of Trump's campaign is being echoed in its press credentialing practices, with foreign media giants regularly denied press access and even blocked from general admission. Meanwhile, local outlets, down to the high school level, find there is plenty of room. ... [J]ournalists from Russia, France and Germany [are] reporting freeze-outs at the same time that Qatari-owned Al Jazeera and Japanese television find their way in." With a Carol Lee cameo http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c93808de3a2bddad60d0c369e46c8cbdf1fe9baa189cf60f76fb

--Houston Chronicle front page, above fold, "Anger over Trump spurs Latino voter registration: Spike in naturalizations across Texas and U.S. doesn't bode well for GOP," by Lomi Kriel: "Since last summer, ... average monthly citizenship applications nationwide spiked nearly 15 percent to about 64,800 between August and January compared to the same period the year before." Paywall http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c93815a20db9dd4338fce838822f0be4a713726113f56414f215

HILLARY'S WEEK AHEAD, per a campaign official: "Clinton will continue her 'Breaking Down Barriers' tour ... with stops in Virginia and Kentucky, talking with young families about the struggles they face with affordable child care, paid family leave and health care. ... The campaign ... release[d] a new video [today] highlighting Clinton's work in Arkansas in creating a pre-K program decades ago." 1-min. video http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c93804dd3944a2bd3d697c8c766cd3abdcffa90fa49bc67c0835 

--WashPost A1, top of col. 1, "Clinton's agenda is big on small steps: Incremental approach could increase burden on federal bureaucracy," by Dave Fahrenthold (online: "Clinton's wonky policies of fine-grained complexity contrast with rivals' grandiose ideas"): "To her, complexity is realism. Clinton says she simply can't make the simple, grand promises of her rivals - free college tuition, a big, beautiful, free wall. Instead, she skips ahead to what policy looks like the way it's actually been done: complicated, ugly and in small steps.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c9384ab5cfda2ced253a8d01028c9e73f64029a70549a03c046a

BEN RHODES, White House Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications & Speechwriting, does damage control after NYT magazine profile, writing on Medium, "How We Advocated for the Iran Deal": "First, we never made any secret of our interest in pursuing a nuclear deal with Iran. ... Second, we did aggressively make the case for the Iran deal during the congressional review mandated by statute last summer, as it was imperative that the facts of the deal be understood for it to be implemented. ... Third, there was no shortage of good reporting and analysis-positive, negative, and mixed-about the Iran deal." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c938bfa18cb1ae8054d0068325879e5fd45f193a4bc5c46cf883 ...

VALLEY TALK - "Cheddar, the 'CNBC for Millennials,' Goes Behind a Paywall: Streaming video site from former BuzzFeed executive Jon Steinberg will start charging $6.99 a month," by WSJ's Shalini Ramachandran: "Former BuzzFeed executive Jon Steinberg's ... startup ... has been streaming videos for free on Facebook Live and Cheddar.com for the last few months, airing interviews and commentary from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 

"[Today,] Mr. Steinberg will debut a new subscription video-on-demand service for Cheddar priced at $6.99 a month, powered by IAC/InterActiveCorp's video platform Vimeo. ... The idea is that smaller clips will appear for free on Facebook but full-length CEO interviews, for instance, would be exclusive for subscribers. ... 

"The Cheddar service is part of Vimeo's effort to become a destination for creators that want to build a Netflix of their own. ... 'I didn't want to get into the ad business again,' said Mr. Steinberg, the former chief operating officer and president of BuzzFeed and a former executive at the DailyMail.com. 'It was becoming increasingly clear that was becoming a winner-takes-all situation for Facebook and Google.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c938aaab733d5c2867fee620e1c8173c607d091491e01acc80fc ... www.cheddar.com 

FOR YOUR RADAR - "Exxon scrambles to contain climate crusade: A green campaign to make the company pay for climate change is besieging the oil industry and its conservative allies," by Andrew Restuccia and Elana Schor: "[I]nterviews with dozens of activists, industry officials and lawmakers suggest that support for a legal crusade against Exxon is growing far beyond the political fringe - and now poses the biggest existential threat the company has faced in decades. ... A four-year effort by green activists, scientists and lawyers to turn Big Oil's biggest player into the poster child for climate change [is] deliberately patterned after the successful campaign to take down tobacco ... 

"Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers [said the] greens' campaign is built on 'distorted reports that they have commissioned and a distorted history of climate research that we've done openly with government bodies' ... The industry is even exploring the idea of launching a counter-probe: A lobbyist for one of Exxon's industry rivals told POLITICO he has reached out to red-state attorneys general to gauge their interest in probing where environmental groups are getting their funding. No takers have emerged so far. ... 

"Oil companies may face yet another headache if Democrats regain the Senate in November: Lawmakers such as Whitehouse told POLITICO they will push to hold hearings like those in the 1990s where tobacco executives had to testify under oath." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c9381a7028b9aefd6950eb57d2e1e117c8118a5735387efcc7c0

"CONTAGION" -- "Brexit vote set to fuel more referendums," by Financial Times' Christian Oliver in Brussels: "Britain's referendum is widely expected to trigger a domino effect of similar votes on EU membership ... An Ipsos poll in nine leading EU states found that almost half of people thought that next month's Brexit vote posed a risk of contagion. ... 58 per cent of Italians and 55 per cent of the French already wanted their own referendums on EU membership, regardless of the [U.K.] result on June 23." (h/t Ryan Heath's Brussels Playbook) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c9381fe2aa36f3bd439cccd94e8d4947f9eabb965341ba097f84

--"FORGET THE HYPE" -- TOM McTAGUE, Politico's Chief UK Political Correspondent, writes from London: "David Cameron is on course to comfortably win Britain's impending referendum on the EU membership. This, at least, is the growing consensus among polling experts and Westminster insiders, not to mention the U.K. betting markets which now put the chances of Brexit at just 25 percent." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=402538100ea8c9388b506467d6442fb9d874ab321bc3d17070d8b949a4d8dddd

** A message from the Alzheimer's Association: Costing taxpayers $18.3 million every HOUR, Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's and more than 15 million unpaid caregivers are providing care for a loved one. Alzheimer's is a national issue, and now it's time we make it a national priority. Alzheimer's yearly cost of $236 billion will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation - an epidemic we cannot afford and shouldn't accept. While it is the only leading cause of death that can't be prevented, cured or even slowed, research and medical advancement can change that. That's why the Alzheimer's
 Association is fighting to eliminate the disease through the advancement of research and providing care and support for all affected. Learn more at www.alz.org/advocacy. **

</b> Costing taxpayers $18.3 million every HOUR, Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's and more than 15 million unpaid caregivers are providing care for a loved one. Alzheimer's is a national issue, and now it's time we make it a national priority. Alzheimer's yearly cost of $236 billion will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation - an epidemic we cannot afford and shouldn't accept. While it is the only leading cause of death that can't be prevented, cured or even slowed, research and medical advancement can change that. That's why the Alzheimer's Association is fighting to eliminate the
 disease through the advancement of research and providing care and support for all affected.
