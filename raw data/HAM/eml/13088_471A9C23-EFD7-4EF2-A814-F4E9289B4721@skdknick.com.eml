Here's what we had given on background, and going forward will just keep pu=
nting to Ryan:


The DNC is neutral in the primary.

The DNC Chair has repeatedly said on the air and otherwise that it's not he=
r job to tell either candidate to get out and has never called for anyone t=
o get out of the race. She has talked in very positive terms<https://www.de=
mocrats.org/Post/dnc-chair-statement-on-april-26-primary-results> about bot=
h of our candidates<https://www.democrats.org/Post/dnc-chair-statement-on-s=
outh-carolina-primary-results-feb-27> and the substantive campaigns they've=
 run<https://www.democrats.org/Post/dnc-chair-statement-on-new-hampshire-pr=
imary-results>. As for the stuff that Joe and Mika tried to rehash this mor=
ning about debates, the fact is our debates earned far better ratings<https=
://medium.com/@MiraLuisDC/democratic-debate-ratings-rank-far-ahead-of-most-=
primary-debates-889d8ab42ca#.qepssg11f> overall this year than they did in =
past cycles. And as NBC knows all too well, when we were able to get both c=
ampaigns to agree, we added four.


The rules in place for this election have been pretty much the same for sev=
eral cycles. In fact, the major change from 2008 - when Obama beat Clinton =
--- is that there are actually LESS unpledged "super" delegates, now down t=
o 15% from 20% prior to the change. No one wrote or rewrote any rules to he=
lp or hurt any specific candidate, these are the Party rules.



The single biggest factor determining the nominee (85%) is the participatio=
n of voters in primaries and caucuses. You can see a post we did here that =
lays out the facts on Super Delegates<https://medium.com/@patricetaylor/her=
e-are-the-actual-facts-about-super-delegates-7660c5c7dd1#.288n079v7>. It al=
so debunks the false myths about Iowa.



The DNC's delegate selection rules for this primary were set before any of =
these candidates declared, and are consistent with the rules in place for s=
everal cycles - including 2008 when Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clinton.



Off the Record: There's just no evidence that the process has been rigged. =
It certainly wasn't rigged in Nevada last weekend, which was not a DNC even=
t but a state party one. But don't take it from us, here's what Jon Ralston=
 wrote:
