SL: Trump Justifies Attacks with Poll Numbers; No Wonder the GOP is in Chaos

Today, Donald Trump continued his reckless and dangerous campaign for president, applauding himself for the fact that his nastiest and most divisive rhetoric might bump up his poll numbers. When asked this morning whether he regretted his comments that Senator John McCain was not a war hero, he said<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-i-dont-regret-mccain-comments-my-polls-numbers-went-up?utm_term=.goXa0RmOp#.gimVdkKjP>, "there are many people that like what I said. You know after I said that, my poll numbers went up seven points."

This is not Trump's first tasteless self-congratulation over how he boosts his poll numbers. In December<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/03/donald-trump-retweets-supporter-who-suggests-san-bernardino-shootings-will-help-his-poll-numbers/?postshare=4381449151451550&tid=ss_tw> of last year, he retweeted a supporter who suggested that the shootings in San Bernardino, California, which killed 14 and injured 17, "would help Trump's 'poll numbers.'" The next day he told Bloomberg TV that, "every time there is a horrible act, like Paris ... my poll numbers go up."

"With this type of repeated, thoughtless, divisive rhetoric, it's no wonder that the Republican Party is in chaos. Trump is willing to justify his political attacks and reckless temperament, whether with respect to a veteran's war record or a mass tragedy, because he believes they drive up his poll numbers. It's a strategy that will backfire on Republicans."


Just want to make sure the text above accurately reflects the content of these bullet points. Thanks.

Trump: "Every Time There Is A Horrible Act ... My Poll Numbers Go Up." TRUMP: "It is interesting, because every time there is a horrible act, and this is a shame in many respects, but from the standpoint of what happens, every time a really bad act takes place, like Paris -- it happened with Paris, it happens now -- my cold and was go up - my poll numbers go up. Look, I'm going to be tough, going to be strong, and people can't get away with the kind of stuff they are getting away with no. We have to be smart, have to have borders, have to have restricted military, take care of our vets." [With All Due Respect, Bloomberg, 12/4/15]

12/3/15: Donald Trump Retweeted A Claim That His "Poll Numbers Jump Every Time Instances Like This Occur" The Morning After A Mass Shooting Killed 14 And Injured 17 In San Bernardino, California. "Donald Trump's retweeting habits leave something to be desired. ... Early Thursday morning, Trump did it again. This time, he retweeted a supporter who pretty clearly appeared to suggest that the shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., on Wednesday - shootings that killed 14 and injured 17 - would help Trump's 'poll numbers.' ''@DLake66675: @ChateauEmissary @trumpettes16 @realDonaldTrump his poll numbers jump every time instances like this occur.' The tweet is a pretty clear reference to the San Bernardino shootings, [and] The man Trump retweeted made his feelings on the connection between the shootings and Trump's poll numbers even clearer in a previous tweet."
