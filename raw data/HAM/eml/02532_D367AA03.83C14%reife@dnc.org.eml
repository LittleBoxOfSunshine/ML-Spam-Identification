I=92m sure you=92ve been hearing everywhere from cable news to the folks in=
 line next to you at your grocery store just how unprecedented this electio=
n is and that we=92ve never seen anything like it.

Part of that is true =97 Donald Trump is an unprecedentedly unqualified can=
didate for a major party=92s nomination for president. His lack of knowledg=
e about any type of policy and lack of interest or willingness to listen or=
 learn is certainly unique. His behavior and temperament on the campaign tr=
ail are definitely unlike anything I=92ve seen.

But here=92s what=92s not different =97 the fact that we have supporters li=
ke you willing to do what it takes between now and Election Day to elect De=
mocrats who share our values and will fight for us every day. Just like you=
 did when we elected President Obama in 2008 and again in 2012, and in so m=
any other elections, we are counting on you to go the extra mile, whether t=
hat=92s literally by going door to door around your city, making phone call=
s, sharing the latest news on social media, or checking to make sure everyo=
ne you know is registered and has a plan to vote.

It also means digging a little deeper to help us raise the money we need to=
 make sure Democrats have the resources that are absolutely necessary to wi=
n in November. Every dollar counts when it comes to stopping Trump and the =
rest of his pals in the GOP =97 can I count on you to pitch in $10 or more =
before our end-of-month deadline next week?

Thanks for all you do, NAME. We=92re counting on you to help us get this do=

Subject: Be optimistic, NAME

Friend --

We=92re 63 days away from the start of our convention in Philadelphia, wher=
e we=92ll nominate the 45th President of the United States -- and Democrats=
 have every reason to feel optimistic about the future of our party.

For starters, we have two outstanding candidates running for president. And=
 even as the Republicans' presumptive nominee starts to gather support from=
 GOP leaders like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and special-interest groups=
 like the NRA, the truth is that Donald Trump is the most unqualified presi=
dential candidate in the history of modern American politics. So I feel pre=
tty darn good about either of our candidates defeating Trump in November.

Secondly and most importantly, NAME, we have you.

You=92re one of millions of Democrats from all corners of the country who r=
efuse to let Republicans take us backwards. So much of the success that we=
=92ve achieved happened because grassroots supporters like you stepped up i=
n moments like this and did whatever it took so we could elect Democrats up=
 and down the ballot -- and with all the progress we=92ve made under Presid=
ent Obama at stake in this election, your support has never been more impor=
tant than it is right now. That=92s why I=92m asking for your help today.

LINKS

I=92m confident that by the time Election Day comes, we will have gotten ou=
r message out so that every American understands how important putting anot=
her Democrat in the White House is to keeping our country moving forward. B=
ut we can=92t take anything for granted, NAME -- so before our end-of-May d=
eadline, pitch in $10 or more to help make sure we beat Donald Trump and th=
e Republicans supporting him in November.

Thank you so much, NAME.

All the best,
