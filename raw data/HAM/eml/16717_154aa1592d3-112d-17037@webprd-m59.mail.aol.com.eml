Andrew,
 
How lovely to hear from you...think of you every time I pass Bread and Chocolate, which is just about daily.  How is the South?  Send details.
 
As for May 18, Barbara has a prior business-related commitment; however, I am putting the invitation in front of her for her to consider.
 
Big hugs and love to your 3 beautiful girls,
 
Esky
