Today, we can not only serve, one of us is the newly confirmed<http://www.n=

SECRETARY OF THE ARMY.

The list of accomplishments<http://www.equalitygiving.org/Accomplishments-b=

most quaint now.

(Add to it little things like marriage equality and clear support for trans=
gender rights and dignity.)

So here we are at another momentous crossroads.  I think it=92s clear it ma=
tters who runs the world, who appoints the judges, who holds the veto pen.

And I am inviting you to our 17th annual June LGBT dinner =96 which like la=
st year=92s will probably be held in September =96 and I=92m asking that yo=
u do something heroic, RIGHT NOW, because . . .


(a)    the DNC has core functions to perform . . . on which ALL our candida=
tes rely, not just those running for President . . .

(b)    we lack the resources to perform them

(One of those functions is the Convention.  The basic infrastructure of it =
only the DNC, by law, can pay for, which never used to be a problem =96 Unc=
le Sam underwrote it for both parties, to the tune of something north of $1=
5 million each.  This time, in its infinite wisdom, Congress zeroed out tha=
t funding.)

It will all work out, and if we all step up, we will win.

My ask, as you know, is that each of us do 1% of his or her net worth =96 l=
ike a lobster claw, it will grow back in a few months =96 which may seem gr=
eedy, but it still leaves you with 99%, and if you amortize that 1% over th=
e next 30 years of a progressive Supreme Court, it beats even Berkshire Hat=
haway in its IRR.  (You were a fine arts major?  IRR stands for =93Incredib=
le Rate of Return.=94)

Please:  https://my.democrats.org/page/contribute/lgbtlc .

At any membership level, you=92ll be paid up for the dinner.  But feeding y=
ou in not really the point.

We=92ve seen what 8 years of the wrong leadership can do =96 George W. Bush=
 -- sandwiched between 8 years each of what the right leadership can do =96=
 Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.  I think you agree that a Trump win would b=
e catastrophic.  Let=92s each invest 1% and not have to find out.

Thanks!

Andy
