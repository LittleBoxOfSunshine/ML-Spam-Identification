Panel: Brit Hume, Amy Walter, George Will, Bob Woodward.

Woodward, WaPo has 20 people working on Trump.
Woodward: Correct. We=92re doing a book and we=92re doing stories. Equivale=
nt effort will be made on HRC. It=92s traditional. We need to tell people e=
verything we can find out.
Equal effort for HRC?
Not number of people, it=92s who is working on it. Goal is best obtainable =
version of the truth. Biography is character. With Trump, every business de=
al. He said on tax returns 500 entities.

Brit, do you think probing into Trump is legitimate and what about complain=
ts that mainstream media trying to sink Trump and help HRC?
Hume: It=92s legitimate. Utterly legitimate. When you think of Trump is a n=
ewcomer to politics, who=92s record unexplored, worthwhile. I hope similar =
attempt made on HRC but mainstream media showing little interest in stories=
 like Benghazi. NYT broke story about Clinton Foundation but thread largely=
 lost.
Woodward: it will be done. You can=92t do this in afternoon. Jeff Bezos sai=
d to editor of WaPo you will have resources to do this on both candidates.

George Wallace: Trump fired back about NYT story, here is his tweet! Amy, d=
oes this add to Trump=92s problem with women voters?
Amy Water: Doesn=92t help. Women not happy with his past statements but mos=
t concerned about his overall judgment, worried he will get us in trouble w=
ith the rest of the world. Less concerned about past but what he would do a=
s president. You will hear much more about that from Dems/HRC.
Where they asked about Clintons?
Walter: In focus groups? Women are not in love with HRC, their support is m=
ore anti-Trump.

Wallace: How do you think Trump=92s charm offensive is going with GOP?
Will: A lot of GOPers making semantic somersaults, saying they vote but do =
not endorse for Trump. The mating dance between Trump/Ryan interesting. I=
=92ll bet statement issued was written before the meeting. Ryan and Trump h=
ave fundamental differences in how they view presidential power.
Wallace: A source close to Ryan said Trump said he understood separation of=
 powers, where his authority is.
Will: If he gets that then he knows what he is promising at rallies can=92t=
 be done.
Wallace: A number of conservatives can=92t stomach Trump and looking for a =
3rd party candidate.
Will: You can=92t beat something with nothing. Everyone has said no.
Walter: I=92m looking at percentage of GOP voters who say they will support=
 Trump. It=92s at 72 percent. If it gets to 90, doesn=92t matter what big r=
epublicans are saying.

Gingrich and Tim Huelskamp debate on backing Trump, VP stakes for Newt

You already said you won=92t let your son watch Trump because of language. =
Does this add to your concerns about his character? Should Cruz come back?
Huelskamp: It=92s not just me but millions of parents trying to raise their=
 kids and their presidential candidate demeaning to women, vulgar, crass. T=
he best thing about Trump is he isn=92t HRC.

What do you make of these reports Newt?
Gingrich: For NYT to have reports on Bill Clinton flying around with pedoph=
ile and dismissing SS tells you everything you need to know about NYT and W=
aPo. Trump makes no claims about life before running. 16 other people compe=
ted because voters decided they wanted Trump.

Huelskamp do you trust Trump as conservative?
Huelskamp: Not a conservative, look at life, marriage and family. He sugges=
ted appointing pro-choice sister to Supreme Court. We don=92t want HRC maki=
ng nominations but Trump has a problem with soccer moms and football dads. =
When you live and die by the media, tough election.

Newt: Trump not traditional conservative and never claimed to be. But he ha=
s said he will nominate very conservative judges. Working with Federalist s=
ociety for speech on judiciary. HRC represents 8 years of bad government in=
 DC and 100 years of left-wing court. Is Trump more dangerous than HRC? Any=
 rational conservative can vote for him.

Huelskamp: We=92re being told vote for lesser of two evils. But there are m=
illions who might just not vote for someone who demeans women. NYT not a su=
rprise. He is vulgar and crass. My son could never say the things Trump say=
s. People might be worried about statements about women. On the court, he i=
s all over the place. No certainty in his positions.

Newt: Certain he would be more conservative than HRC. Why does he get more =
votes than any Republican in history? Country is desperate to overturn bure=
aucracy in DC.

When it comes to economic issues like trade, immigration, entitlement refor=
m, what=92s your biggest problem with Trump?
Huelskamp: Wants to raise taxes on the rich. Slamming down the border shut =
is not conservative. Conservatives want to compete in the world. His positi=
ons change in the same speech. People don=92t want someone flexible. Trump=
=92s stands will change. Trump flexible on abortion, which is very damaging=
 for values voters who might stay home.

Issue of flips. No question Trump has changed positions. (clip of Trump cha=
nging position on banning Muslims). Doesn=92t flexibility become a problem?
Newt: One of Trump=92s problems is he speaks 1.5 hours off cuff and you wil=
l have moments you regret. Reagan signed immigration bill because it contro=
lled border. On trade, good for us to be tougher on trade. When you hear Ch=
inese stole $360 billion in intellectual property from us, it=92s a good th=
ing to be tougher.
Huelskamp: Trump has no clear position on anything. It isn=92t he talks for=
 long time, it=92s that he says different things as he talks. Conservatives=
 do not demean women. We have a chance to take out Clinton machine but nomi=
nating someone with no values.

He will be nominee. If Trump vs HRC, what will you for?
Huelskamp: I don=92t think it matters what I think.

Matters to me!
Huelskamp: I don=92t know. I need to talk to my wife. We=92re both so upset=
. Why does he have to talk like that and demean women? All words, no action=
s. Better than HRC? He is. Didn=92t work out well for Romney in 2012.

Newt, lot of speculation about you being VP. If he asks you, you=92ll say y=
es?
Newt: I=92d sit down and talk about it. What does he think the job involved=
? If he can convince me it is doable and serious, we=92d be hard pressed no=
t to say yes.
Do you want to do it?
Newt: Certainly it=92s a hard challenge. I lead interesting, exciting life.=
 I could be lured into a new path.

Reince (this is pretty brutal)

NYT article on Trump and women and repeated instances of Trump insulting wo=
men. Bother you?
A lot of things bother me and I=92m the wrong person to ask that question

Why is that? That=92s your nominee
We=92ve been working on this primary for a year and I think these stories t=
hat come out, people don=92t care. People look at Trump and Clinton and say=
 =91how will bring earthquake to DC?=92 Bigger issue if stones being thrown=
 at glass houses. Trump=92s personal life not something people looking it, =
not surprised Trump has girlfriends

Whether he mistreated women, made unwanted advances, humiliated women. I do=
n=92t understand why you think people don=92t care, will you look into this=
?
Not saying people don=92t care. He is where he is because he is much differ=
ent from traditional candidate. Everything bothers me but I don=92t know th=
e ruth of this. Trump will have to answer questions on this. After a year o=
f different stories, nothing applies. All I=92m saying. Bigger question is =
who represents something who brings more efficient accountable DC, career p=
olitician or outsider with potentially some flaws?

Question of character is important. Trump brings up Clintons=92 character. =
Trump used to pretend to be John Miller. (plays clip and Trump denial) Trum=
p admitted it was him in 90s and testified as such. Real question, what do =
you say to women voters who will hear this?
I think each individual person should evaluate our nominee based on answers=
 he gives but also look at what=92s at stake and whether HRC will bring cha=
nge. A story of 30 years ago is not the most important thing when you look =
at HRC and Clinton Foundation being charged with exchanging access to cash,=
 Benghazi, instead we=92re talking about this planted story. Old playbook i=
sn=92t applying in this election. I get that this is interesting but it won=
=92t move dial.

Trump=92s refusal to release tax returns until audit complete. Won=92t give=
 effective tax rate. Every nominee since Nixon has released their returns. =
Transparency we can expect?
I=92m not sure. Romney released taxes late and payed a dear price for it pl=
aying games and it turned out to not be good for us in 2012. But I don=92t =
know if Americans care. He will benefit or suffer based on if they do. So f=
ar most things voters don=92t care about. Who will blow up system and bring=
 change? People are angry and want something done and think Trump can do it=
.

Don=92t you think HRC has been vetted. Isn=92t it legitimate to look at who=
 Trump is? Bob Woodward says 20 reporters at the Post looking at Trump. We =
don=92t know much about him.
I=92m not saying it=92s not legitimate, I just don=92t think it will affect=
 peoples view of Trump. I don=92t have a problem with reporters looking at =
things but they should look at HRC and her treatment of women and how she a=
cted at Foundation and Benghazi. There is a reason HRC still stuck in the m=
ud. Issues that apply to Trump so big and fundamental and universal that th=
ese individual things, I don=92t think they will hit him.

Trump met with Paul Ryan. You were in the room. Yesterday Ryan spoke to GOP=
 state convention and said he was not ready to endorse Trump. (clip) How co=
nfident are you Ryan will endorse and how long will that take?
I don=92t speak for Ryan but I can tell you both guys came in expecting a g=
ood meeting and left after a great meeting. I=92d be surprised if we didn=
=92t get there soon. Ryan wouldn=92t say the things he said just to say the=
m. He wants to understand Trump.

Report today that a number of conservatives are talking about 3rd party bid=
. How seriously do you take that?
I take it seriously but law makes it difficult. They could hijack another p=
arty but it=92s a suicide mission because you are throwing 8 years down WH =
and 100 years on the Supreme Court. Other ways to get assurances on things =
they are worried about.

What would you say to Mitt Romney and Bill Kristol?
Consider the ramifications on Supreme Court. Talk to Trump and get assuranc=
es on judges.
