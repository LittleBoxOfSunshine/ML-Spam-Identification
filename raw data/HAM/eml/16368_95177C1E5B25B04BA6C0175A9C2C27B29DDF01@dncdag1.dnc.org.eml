Trump in 2007: 'I'm excited' For Housing Market Crash<http://www.nbcnews.co=
m/politics/2016-election/trump-2007-i-m-excited-housing-market-crash-n57876=
1>
NBC NEWS // ALEXANDRA JAFFE
Donald Trump counseled Trump University students to take advantage of the h=
ousing bubble as an investment opportunity and said, just a year before it =
burst, that he was "excited" for it to end because of the money he'd make.

"People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm =
excited if it is,' he told the Globe and Mail in March of 2007<http://www.t=
heglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/trump-touts-soft-markets-in-cities-li=
ke-toronto/article17993211/>. "I've always made more money in bad markets t=
han in good markets."

At that time, the housing market was already beginning to decline, and just=
 over a year later the subprime mortgage crisis hit, part of a chain reacti=
on of events that led to the stock market crash of 2008 and cemented the Gr=
eat Recession.

The subprime mortgage crisis alone caused millions of Americans to lose the=
ir homes, but that same Globe and Mail piece reports Trump was "advising in=
vestors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a di=
scount, and repossessed houses at low prices."

It's not a new - or particularly surprising - stance from the business mogu=
l, who made a fortune he values in the billions investing over the course o=
f four decades in real-estate in New York City and across the world. Trump =
has always touted himself as a great deal-maker and outlines the genesis of=
 his penchant for risky investments in his first book, "The Art of the Deal=
," which chronicles the early deals that helped establish him as a major pl=
ayer in New York's real-estate market.

But those comments are just one of many that could come back to haunt him a=
s he heads into a general election showdown with likely Democratic nominee =
Hillary Clinton. Clinton and Democratic Party operatives have telegraphed p=
lans to paint Trump as a greedy con-man whose business acumen is overblown =
and whose policies most benefit himself, and comments he's made touting pro=
fits from the pain of millions of Americans who lost their homes in the hou=
sing market crash will help them make their case.

The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on his past sta=
tements.

His remarks to the Globe and Mail weren't the only he made on the money-mak=
ing possibilities found in a bursting bubble.

The real-estate mogul lost big during the early 1990s recession, filing ban=
kruptcies on a number of properties and liquidating others to keep himself =
above-water. But in 2004, Trump told CNN, "I love bad markets," insisting t=
he real-estate market crash in the late 1980s wasn't the main driver of his=
 financial difficulties.

"The real estate markets crashed. Now, I don't want to blame the real estat=
e markets, because I always made a lot of money in bad markets. I love bad =
markets. You can do very well in a bad market," he said.

And that was the exact advice he gave followers of Trump University a year =
later, framing the next housing bubble - at that time, still just a theoret=
ical risk posed by analysts - as a "remarkable opportunity."

"How you react to the so-called housing bubble can be a barometer of your b=
usiness personality. Are you the type of person who takes advantage of posi=
tive situations when they present themselves...or do you heed every message=
 of doom and gloom, avoiding risks that could be some remarkable opportunit=
ies?" he wrote in a 2005 post on his Trump University blog<https://web.arch=
ive.org/web/20060507012209/http:/donaldtrump.trumpuniversity.com/default.as=
p?item=3D98726>.

A CNN report last week<http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/19/politics/donald-trump-=
2006-hopes-real-estate-market-crashes/index.html> unearthed his 2006 declar=
ation in a Trump University audiobook that "I sort of hope" the real estate=
 market crashes.

In his 2006 audio book "Bubble-Proof Real Estate Investing," Trump also fra=
med the housing bubble as an opportunity for profit for those "willing to d=
o what it takes."

"Is it the so-called bubble you're afraid of or is it hard work? If you're =
willing to do what it takes, you will succeed in any market," he said.

The audiobook directed those interested in learning "what it takes" to subs=
cribe to the full 12-month program at TrumpUniversity.com.
