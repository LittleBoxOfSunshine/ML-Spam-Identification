Obamacare brings record low for US health uninsured rate<http://www.cnbc.co=

CNBC

How low can Obamacare go?

Fewer than 1 in 10 Americans lacked health insurance in 2015, the first tim=
e ever in the nation's history that the uninsured rate has fallen so low, a=
nd a clear sign of Obamacare's impact.

The U.S. uninsurance rate fell to 9.1 percent last year, according to data =
released Tuesday by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It was the first time the percentage of people without some form of health =
coverage has gone into single digits, and a 2.4 percentage point drop from =
2014.

The number of people uninsured in 2015 was 28.6 million, which was 7.4 mill=
ion fewer than 2014, according to the CDC.

Since 2011, when the uninsured rate stood at 15.1 percent, that rate has fa=
llen 6 full percentage points, according to the CDC's National Health Inter=
view Survey.

Obamacare began going into full effect in 2014, which was the first year th=
at people could have private health insurance plans purchased on government=
-run marketplaces. That was also the first year that nearly all Americans w=
ere obligated to have some form of health insurance or face a possible tax =
penalty.

Before that, the Affordable Care Act had for the first time allowed adults =
under the age of 26 to stay on their parents' health plans, which was anoth=
er factor that has played a role in driving down the uninsured rate.

A third factor in bringing down the uninsured rate has been the expansion o=
f Medicaid benefits in a majority of states to cover many more poor adults =
than had been eligible under that joint federal-state health insurance prog=
ram before the ACA became law.

The Obama administration has said more than 20 million Americans have gaine=
d health insurance coverage since the ACA became law in 2010.

The new report Tuesday was warmly greeted by the Obama administration, whic=
h last week lost a key court decision that, if upheld, could damage the Oba=
macare program.

A federal court judge ruled that the administration violated the law by giv=
ing insurers money, without congressional approval, to offset the cost of c=
overing subsidized out-of-pocket health costs of many Obamacare customers.

The administration also has been dealing with a flurry of news stories deta=
iling possibly steeper Obamacare rate hikes for 2017, and the departure of =
some insurers from various markets across the nation.

Sylvia Burwell, secretary of health and human services, said, "Today's repo=
rt is further proof that our country has made undeniable and historic strid=
es thanks to the Affordable Care Act."

"The report documents the progress we've made expanding coverage across the=
 country," Burwell said.

"Meanwhile, premiums for employer coverage, Medicare spending and health-ca=
re prices have risen at exceptionally slow rates. Our country ought to be p=
roud of how far we've come and where we're going," she said.

The CDC's survey found that among adults aged 18-64, the percentage who wer=
e uninsured decreased from 16.3 percent in 2014 to 12.8 percent last year.

"A corresponding increase was seen in the percentage having private coverag=
e, from 67.3 percent to 69.7 percent, respectively," the report said.

"Among children aged 0=9617 years, the percentage who were uninsured decrea=
sed from 5.5 percent in 2014 to 4.5 percent in 2015," the report said.

"Among those under age 65, the percentage with private coverage through the=
 Health Insurance Marketplace [the federal Obamacare exchange HealthCare.go=
v<http://healthcare.gov>] or state-based exchanges increased from 2.5 perce=
nt (6.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 3.4 percent (9.1 million)=
 in the fourth quarter of 2015," according to the CDC.

The report said that In 2015, adults between the ages of 25 and 34 were mor=
e than twice as likely as adults aged 45 to 64 to lack health insurance cov=
erage =97 17.9 percent compared with 8.8 percent.

"In 2015, 27.7 percent of Hispanic, 14.4 percent of non-Hispanic black, 8.7=
 percent of non-Hispanic white, and 7.9 percent of non-Hispanic Asian adult=
s aged 18=9664 lacked health insurance coverage at the time of interview," =
the report said.

"Significant decreases in the percentage of uninsured adults were observed =
between 2013 and 2015 for Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white,=
 and non-Hispanic Asian adults," the report said.

"Hispanic adults had the greatest percentage point decrease in the uninsure=
d rate between 2013 and 2015," falling from 40.6 percent to 27.7 percent, a=
ccording to the report.
