Outrage and relief at Nathan Deal=E2=80=99s veto of =E2=80=98campus carry=

Georgia's Republican governor rejected the two top priorities of a legisla=

on in March. But he waited until Tuesday=2C the last possible day to issue=
 vetoes=2C to block another bill that would have allowed people over 21 an=
d with state permits to carry concealed handguns on college campuses. Both=
 proposals were popular with the majority of Georgia's Republican lawmaker=

cratic Party of Georgia issued a carefully-worded statement devoid of much=
 specific mention of Deal. =E2=80=9CGeorgia Democrats hope that next year=
