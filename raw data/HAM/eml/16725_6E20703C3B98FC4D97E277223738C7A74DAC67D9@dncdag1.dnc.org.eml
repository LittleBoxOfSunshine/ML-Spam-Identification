By Nathan McDermott // BuzzFeed News

Roger Stone, a longtime political ally and former campaign adviser to Donal=
d Trump, admitted on Saturday that Trump posed as his own publicist in the =
early 1990s, likening Trump's actions to the Founding Fathers.



On Friday, The Washington Post published<https://www.washingtonpost.com/pol=
itics/donald-trump-alter-ego-barron/2016/05/12/02ac99ec-16fe-11e6-aa55-670c=
abef46e0_story.html?postshare=3D5791463140164931&tid=3Dss_tw> audio of a 19=
91 interview between a People magazine reporter and a man who identified as=
 John Miller. The Post and other outlets identified Miller as actually bein=
g Trump, but in an interview<http://www.today.com/news/donald-trump-denies-=
posing-spokesman-recordings-washington-post-uncovered-t92421> on Today, Tru=
mp denied the accusation.



Stone, who was on Breitbart<https://soundcloud.com/breitbart/breitbart-news=
-daily-roger-stone-may-13-2016> radio on Saturday, dismissed the story, but=
 admitted Trump posed as his own PR man.



"They focus on whether or not Donald Trump may or may not have posed as a p=
ublic relations man in order to get his spin and his side of the story," St=
one said of the Washington Post story, "This is ridiculous. James Madison, =
John Adams, Alexander Hamilton - they all wrote under pseudonyms, they all =
had things they wanted to say, and they wrote under pseudonyms."



"Trump wanted to get his spin and his side of the story, so he handled the =
press call himself, probably because he didn't want to pay a public relatio=
ns expert. What difference does it make?"



Stone added that there are more important stories for the media to cover, s=
uch as Hillary Clinton's role in the death of four Americans in Benghazi or=
 her ongoing email scandal.
