Ha! Susan, I like your spirit but you're dead wrong. Off the record, the po=
int I was making is that you're misrepresenting the nature of my work. I wa=
s not involved in any activity that would trigger registration. Period.

Huh -- nobody put me up to this -- I read that you were hired by Trimpa in =
either Mother Jones or the Nation -- so no one ever paid you any money to w=
ork on Cuba related matters? Why would your name come up at all in these ar=
ticles? I'm going to have to say that in the article I write -- that you're=
 disavowing any involvement on the Cuba issue unless you explain to me exac=
tly how you were involved -- unless of course the Nation or Mother Jones ar=
ticle got it wrong. If so, they should run a correction and I will talk to =
the pubs about that and then if they stand by their story, then that become=
s the story I write.

Susan, Off the record, your premise is wrong. For starters I was never an e=

Probably for Monday -- not sure I am writing anything -- just want to see w=
hy no one registered to lobby for the Cuba lobbying campaign that has been =
extensively written about.
Also,  I'm not sure that you were easy to get a hold of at that time -- in =
August of last year. I called and emailed repeatedly the logical place to r=
each you, the employer that seemed to be taking credit for the lobbying cam=
paign for #CubaNow.
 They told me to call James Williams, the point man, I guess, and I tried h=
im every way I could but he never responded. Follow ups to Trimpa to reach =
you or anyone else about it were not responded to.

Nice to hear from you. Last August before I went on maternity leave when I =
did the story. Wasn't going to bring up your name today but Josh was trying=
 to get me to be more forthcoming about what I was getting at and I underst=
ood why he was doing that and thought o would just be forthcoming.
 But I do have questions about your role in the Trimpa Group's lobbying on =
the Cuba issue. I contacted the Trimpa Group several times to try to reach =
you -- didn't know you had moved on to the DNC until yesterday.
