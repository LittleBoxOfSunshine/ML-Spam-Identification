Swing-state poll: Voters want Garland to get hearing<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/merrick-garland-supreme-court-223040>

POLITICO // NICK GASS

They may be split between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, but registered voters in the swing states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania both favor President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. Even more said they want the Senate to consider him before a new president takes office, according to a Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday surveying registered voters in the three states. Pluralities of voters said they approved of Obama's nomination of Garland, announced a month after the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia. In Florida, 51 percent approved compared to 33 percent who disapproved and 16 percent who said they were not sure. Among Ohio voters, 47 percent said they approved, while 33 percent disapproved and 20 percent were not sure. In Pennsylvania, 52 percent said they viewed Obama's nomination favorably, while 29 percent said they did not and an additional 19 percent were ambivalent. As far as whether the Senate should consider Garland's nomination or wait until there is a new president in the White House, voters were more emphatic. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has long maintained that Congress would not move forward with hearing or confirming a Supreme Court nominee in 2016 regardless of his or her qualifications.

Republican leaders remain divided ahead of key Trump-Ryan meeting<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republican-leaders-remain-divided-ahead-of-key-trump-ryan-meeting/2016/05/10/cc700412-16e5-11e6-924d-838753295f9a_story.html>

WASHINGTON POST // PAUL KANE AND MIKE DEBONIS

National Republican leaders remained sharply divided Tuesday over the likely coronation of Donald Trump as the party's standard-bearer, foreshadowing a lengthy battle in the two months leading up to the presidential nominating convention in Cleveland. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) dug in for a protracted discussion with Trump after last week's stunning declaration that he was "not there yet" on embracing his party's likely presidential nominee. Ryan's ambivalence raised the stakes on his meeting with the businessman slated for Thursday at the Republican National Committee headquarters on Capitol Hill. "It's going to take more than a week just to repair and unify this party," Ryan said in an interview Tuesday with the Wall Street Journal's Gerald F. Seib, broadcast online by Facebook. "If we just pretend we're unified without actually unifying, then we'll be at half-strength in the fall, and that won't go well for us."



Donald Trump Has Another Brush With a White Nationalist<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/10/donald-trump-has-another-brush-with-a-white-nationalist/?ref=politics>

NEW YORK TIMES // MAGGIE HABERMAN

Donald J. Trump's campaign aides said that because of a technical glitch, a well-known white nationalist leader was included on a list of California delegates that they submitted to the secretary of state's office. It was the latest flap over support that Mr. Trump has received from a white nationalist figure; he was criticized for declining to disavow the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke's support in February despite being asked to repeatedly in an interview if he would do so. Mr. Trump later said, "I disavow" regarding Mr. Duke, and he rejected more recent statements from Mr. Duke that invoked anti-Semitism. The list of prospective delegates for California, where the primary is on June 7, initially included the white nationalist leader William Johnson, who heads the American National "super PAC." His inclusion was first reported by Mother Jones. In a statement, the Trump campaign's California state director, Tim Clark, said that the list was submitted on Monday to be certified by the secretary of state.



After Trump, the GOP may need a better voting system<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/after-trump-the-gop-may-need-a-better-voting-system/2016/05/10/203ca80c-16eb-11e6-924d-838753295f9a_story.html>

WASHINGTON POST // KATHLEEN PARKER

It should be obvious to all by now that Donald Trump knows nothing of what he speaks. His disastrous economic ideas are but the latest in a litany of nonsensical proposals. And still, his supporters - that Republican base so carefully nurtured by the very GOP operatives and politicians who now find its members so distasteful - proclaim his supremacy with such bracing observations as "Well, at least he's got [spheres]," or "At least he speaks his mind," or "At least he doesn't suck up to anybody." These selections from the morning mail share a common element - "at least" - which seems apt enough, though "the least" seems more to the point. Trump was the least of so many Republican candidates, including people who offered governing experience, knowledge and even, in some cases, wisdom.
