Wall Street Journal
May 17th, 2016

White nationalists are hailing Donald Trump<http://topics.wsj.com/person/T/=
Donald-Trump/159>=92s elevation to presumptive Republican presidential nomi=
nee, while also trying to boost their own political profiles and activity.

Although Mr. Trump has spurned these extreme groups=92 support, the level o=
f interest within them for the White House candidate rivals that for segreg=
ationist George Wallace, who won five states in the 1968 election, and for =
conservative Republican Pat Buchanan, who denounced multiculturalism in the=
 1990s.

Mr. Trump is being heralded by these groups for his proposals to bar Muslim=
 immigrants, deport millions of people living illegally in the U.S., and bu=
ild a wall along the southern border.

=93White men in America and across the planet are partying like it=92s 1999=
 following Trump=92s decisive victory over the evil enemies of our race,=94=
 wrote Holocaust denier Andrew Anglin, who calls Mr. Trump =93the Glorious =
Leader=94 on his Daily Stormer website, after the candidate all but sewed u=
p the GOP nomination<http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-grip-tighten=
s-on-gop-race-with-indiana-win-expected-1462315006> on May 3.

While his policy prescriptions proved popular with GOP primary voters, Mr. =
Trump is now the presumptive nominee of a party that has struggled in recen=
t presidential elections to expand its appeal beyond white voters. At the s=
ame time, his hard-line immigration policy and high profile are big lures f=
or extreme groups seeking to elevate their status and views.

Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Mr. Trump =93has disavowed and will co=
ntinue to disavow the support of any such groups associated with a message =
of hate.=94

The businessman isn=92t the only candidate who has attracted white supremac=
ists.

Ku Klux Klan leader  Will Quigg of California, who last year backed Mr. Tru=
mp on Twitter, told the Telegraph newspaper in March that he wants Democrat=
 Hillary Clinton<http://topics.wsj.com/person/C/Hillary-Clinton/6344> to wi=
n. The Clinton campaign rejected that support.

Last year, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz<http://topics.wsj.com/person/C/Ted-Cruz/7753=
> brushed off donations to his presidential campaign from Earl Holt III, le=
ader of a white supremacist group that authorities allege was cited as an i=
nspiration by Dylann Roof, the man charged with killing nine people at a hi=
storically black church in Charleston, S.C., in June 2015. The campaign sai=
d it refunded $2,300 to Mr. Holt and sent $2,700 as a donation to a fund se=
t up for the families of the church-shooting victims.

It also isn=92t the first time the KKK tried to align with a nominee in the=
 modern era. Klan leaders in 1984 tried to throw their support publicly to =
President Ronald Reagan, who rebuffed their overtures.

Mr. Trump earlier this year drew criticism for his hesitation to disavow th=
e support of David Duke<http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-grip-tigh=
tens-on-gop-race-with-indiana-win-expected-1462315006>, a former KKK leader=
 and former state representative from Louisiana. But earlier this month, af=
ter Mr. Duke described Mr. Trump=92s success as overcoming =93these Jewish =
supremacists who control our country,=94 Mr. Trump said, =93Anti-Semitism h=
as no place in our society, which needs to be united not divided.=94

He also returned a $250 contribution in February from white nationalist lea=
der William Johnson, whom the campaign listed among its California GOP conv=
ention delegates before striking him from the list last week.

Mr. Trump=92s rejections have failed to deter support from leaders of what =
civil-rights groups label =93right-wing hate groups.=94

These groups=92 websites, radio shows and podcasts are filled with praise f=
or Mr. Trump=92s views on immigration, appeals to vote for him and calls to=
 volunteer for his campaign. Some white nationalist leaders have boasted on=
line about attending his rallies, either as supporters or as journalists, a=
nd say the traffic on their websites is increasing since the rise of Mr. Tr=
ump.

=93Trump=92s candidacy has absolutely electrified the radical right,=94 sai=
d Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil-r=
ights organization that tracks extremist groups.

People who identify as white nationalists, white-rights advocates or race r=
ealists say that even if Mr. Trump=92s views don=92t exactly line up with t=
heir own, they appreciate his willingness to speak his mind, regardless of =
the backlash.

=93The main reason white nationalists support Donald Trump is that he is th=
e real deal,=94 said Mr. Johnson, the rejected California delegate. =93I sp=
eak from the heart and so does he.=94

Attendance at this coming weekend=92s annual conference hosted by American =
Renaissance, which publishes a website on topics including eugenics and all=
eged IQ differences between races, is expected to double to 300 people, sai=
d editor Jared Taylor, in part because of Mr. Trump=92s success.

=93Donald Trump says what millions of Americans have thought for years=97an=
d is much too popular to be silenced,=94 reads a notice about the event nea=
r Nashville, Tenn., that is described as a =93celebration of our world brot=
herhood of Europeans.=92=92

Mr. Taylor did a robocall earlier this year before the primaries in Iowa an=
d New Hampshire in which he said: =93We don=92t need Muslims. We need smart=
, well-educated white people who will assimilate to our culture. Vote Trump=
.=94 The call was funded by an outside group and not approved by the Trump =
campaign.

Exit polls show large majorities of Republican primary and caucus voters ag=
ree with Mr. Trump=92s plan to ban Muslim immigrants, at least temporarily.=
 Mr. Trump has said the ban is necessary to prevent terrorist attacks becau=
se the process of screening immigrants is inadequate.

=93It=92s very encouraging when someone of the prominence of the Republican=
 presumptive nominee says some of the same things we=92ve been saying for y=
ears,=94 Mr. Taylor said. =93Who needs Muslims? Who needs Mexicans? Once yo=
u ask those questions, you think, =91Who needs Haitians?=92 Mr. Trump is re=
acting in an almost visceral way to the idea of whites becoming a minority.=
=94

Mr. Trump=92s allies say he can=92t control who backs him, and he is wary o=
f drawing more attention to their rhetoric, said the Rev. Darrell Scott, a =
black pastor in Cleveland and the chief executive of the National Diversity=
 Coalition for Trump, a multiracial, multiethnic group of supporters.

=93I don=92t think he wants to make an issue of white supremacists,=94 Mr. =
Scott said. =93Any radical element of society that says they like Trump get=
s the opportunity for media coverage, and he doesn=92t want to magnify that=
.=94

Civil-rights groups say Mr. Trump, despite his disavowals, has sent signals=
 to people who hold racist views. His posture toward immigrants also has be=
en repudiated by many leaders in his own party.

=93White supremacists and white nationalists have been marginalized in our =
political discourse, but Trump=92s campaign is bringing them out of the woo=
dwork and making it easier for them say certain things,=94 said Peter Montg=
omery, senior fellow at the People for the American Way, a liberal group.

In his campaign announcement speech in June 2015, Mr. Trump said some Mexic=
an immigrants are rapists and drug dealers. He said he would consider shutt=
ing down mosques to prevent terrorist attacks, and he backed a =93deportati=
on force=94 such as the one used by the Eisenhower administration to round =
up illegal Mexican immigrants and send them back across the border.

With millions of followers on Twitter, Mr. Trump has retweeted encouragemen=
t from white supremacists, as well as faulty crime statistics that suggest =
the vast majority of murders of white people are committed by blacks. Earli=
er this month, he told NBC News that Germany is =93crime-riddled=94 because=
 of Muslim immigrants. Mr. Trump didn=92t offer evidence to back up these c=
laims. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the vast majority =
of murders of white people are committed by other white people. German news=
papers have reported that government statistics show the increase in migran=
ts hasn=92t been accompanied by a proportionate increase in crime.

In February, the Anti-Defamation League sent a list of 11 =93racist individ=
uals and extremists groups=94 to all of the Democrats and Republicans runni=
ng for president, urging them to steer clear. All of those on the list had =
expressed support for Mr. Trump.

=93We=92ve seen him use blistering attacks against his opponents but we hav=
en=92t seen him use the same level of force and clarity against these racis=
ts and anti-Semites,=94 said Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL=92s national dire=
ctor. =93As the GOP nominee he absolutely needs to do more.=94

 Muslims. We need smart, well-educated white people who will assimilate to =
our culture. Vote Trump.=94 The call was
 funded by an outside group and not approved by the Trump campaign.<o:p></o=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Exit polls show large majorities of Republican prima=
ry and caucus voters agree with Mr. Trump=92s plan to ban Muslim immigrants=
, at least temporarily. Mr. Trump has said the ban is necessary to prevent =
terrorist attacks because the process
 of screening immigrants is inadequate.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"background:yellow;mso-highlight:yello=
w">=93It=92s very encouraging when someone of the prominence of the Republi=
can presumptive nominee says some of the same things we=92ve been saying fo=
r years,=94</span> Mr. Taylor said. =93Who needs
 Muslims? Who needs Mexicans? Once you ask those questions, you think, =91W=
ho needs Haitians?=92 Mr. Trump is reacting in an almost visceral way to th=
e idea of whites becoming a minority.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Mr. Trump=92s allies say he can=92t control who back=
s him, and he is wary of drawing more attention to their rhetoric, said the=
 Rev. Darrell Scott, a black pastor in Cleveland and the chief executive of=
 the National Diversity Coalition for
 Trump, a multiracial, multiethnic group of supporters.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=93I don=92t think he wants to make an issue of whit=
e supremacists,=94 Mr. Scott said. =93Any radical element of society that s=
ays they like Trump gets the opportunity for media coverage, and he doesn=
=92t want to magnify that.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Civil-rights groups say Mr. Trump, despite his disav=
owals, has sent signals to people who hold racist views. His posture toward=
 immigrants also has been repudiated by many leaders in his own party.<o:p>=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=93White supremacists and white nationalists have be=

 at the People for the American Way, a liberal group.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">In his campaign announcement speech in June 2015, Mr=
. Trump said some Mexican immigrants are rapists and drug dealers. He said =
he would consider shutting down mosques to prevent terrorist attacks, and h=
e backed a =93deportation force=94 such
 as the one used by the Eisenhower administration to round up illegal Mexic=
an immigrants and send them back across the border.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">With millions of followers on Twitter, Mr. Trump has=
 retweeted encouragement from white supremacists, as well as faulty crime s=
tatistics that suggest the vast majority of murders of white people are com=
mitted by blacks. Earlier this month,
 he told NBC News that Germany is =93crime-riddled=94 because of Muslim imm=
igrants. Mr. Trump didn=92t offer evidence to back up these claims. Accordi=
ng to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the vast majority of murders of =
white people are committed by other white
 people. German newspapers have reported that government statistics show th=
e increase in migrants hasn=92t been accompanied by a proportionate increas=
e in crime.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">In February, the Anti-Defamation League sent a list =
of 11 =93racist individuals and extremists groups=94 to all of the Democrat=

 those on the list had expressed support
 for Mr. Trump.<o:p></o:p></p>

 he absolutely needs to do more.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
