>=20

 In a Facebook post, Bush lambasted Trump as someone " who has not demonstra=
ted that temperament or strength of character. He has not displayed a respec=
t for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative. These are a=
ll reasons why I cannot support his candidacy."

uggested that it might be time for someone other than Ryan to be speaker. An=

andedly destroyed his hapless run for president."
>=20

 have spoken it's time to get behind Trump and those who view backing the bi=
llionaire as an abandonment of the true principles of conservatism.
>=20
> And there's no one able stop it. Republican National Committee Chairman Re=

ne. Lots of other eminences grises within the party -- the Bushes, Bob Dole,=

ave no interest in serving as a bridge.
>=20
> That means it's likely that the schism will get worse before it gets bette=
r. Ifit gets better. A party being torn in two is bad enough. That process h=
appening within 184 days until a presidential election and in full view of t=
he general public is even worse. And this might not even be the bottom yet.
