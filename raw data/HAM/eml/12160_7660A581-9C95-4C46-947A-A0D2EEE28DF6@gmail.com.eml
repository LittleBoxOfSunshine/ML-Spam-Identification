Here it is with my changes. We need to make sure that Sheila or whoever is i=
ntroducing me, is comfortable with this. But this is what they need to use.



Alaska Introduction for DWS

5 minutes

=20

Good evening Alaska Democrats!!

=20

This has been an incredible convention.  I have never seen such enthusiasm i=
n all my years in Democratic politics and it is a testament to both our cand=
idates=E2=80=99 championship for hardworking American families and the reali=
ty TV show that has been the Republican nomination process.  If there is any=
thing more frightening in this election than President Donald Trump taking t=
he reins at the White House, I don=E2=80=99t know what is.

=20

Now, well before the Republicans had a nominee and well before our primary p=
rocess had even started, our Chair Casey Steinau set her goals high and pers=
onally asked DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz to join us in Alaska.  That w=
as over a year ago and even with her hectic schedule =E2=80=93 being a Mom, M=
ember of Congress, a candidate, and Chair of the national Party =E2=80=93 sh=
e said YES!  Kay [Brown] can tell you how many times we got a call from the D=
NC and crossed our fingers hoping she wouldn=E2=80=99t have to cancel=E2=80=A6=
and of course not!!  Her staff told us time and time again:  DWS couldn=E2=80=
=99t wait to get to Alaska=E2=80=A6 even though this is her twin=E2=80=99s 1=
7th birthday weekend.=20



We are all very excited for you to hear from the Chairwoman this evening.  S=
ince becoming Chair in May 2011, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has traveled to 47=
 states and participated in nearly 1,800 events for the national and state p=
arties.  Now, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a woman who truly knows how to mak=
e it all work.  She=E2=80=99s heading back tonight on a redeye so she can co=
ok a birthday dinner for her twins.=20

=20

Before I continue my introduction of Chair Wasserman Schultz, I want to ackn=
owledge a very special guest in the audience.  Where is Shelby Schultz?  Wil=
l everyone join me to give a big Alaska welcome to the Chairwoman=E2=80=99s 1=
2 year old daughter who is making her first trip to Alaska just for this Con=
vention.  I hear she=E2=80=99s the adventurous one in the family and had a g=
reat time driving up to the mountains for an up close and personal view of o=
ne of Alaska=E2=80=99s great treasures =E2=80=93 our glaciers.  Welcome to A=
laska, Shelby!=20

=20

Now, where Debbie Wasserman Schultz=E2=80=99s heart is and the job she cheri=
shes like no other is being a legislator.  Debbie has served her constituent=
s in South Florida for nearly 25 years.  She was the youngest woman elected t=
o the Florida state legislature - at 26 - and the first Jewish woman elected=
 to the U.S. Congress from the state of Florida.=20

=20

Just ten weeks after taking office in Washington, D.C., she led the fight an=
d stood up to the GOP establishment and President George W. Bush when Congre=
ss took action to require Terri Schiavo=E2=80=99s husband to keep her on lif=
e support =E2=80=93 a complete slap in the face to our constitutional right t=
o privacy and separation of church and state.=20

=20

There is no advocate for women, children, and young families like Debbie Was=
serman Schultz.  In 2007, she sponsored the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool & Spa=
 Safety Act named after Secretary of State James Baker=E2=80=99s granddaught=
er who died when she became trapped in a pool drain.  Drowning is the number=
 one cause of unintentional death for children under 5 years of age and sinc=
e this law was passed, there have been NO drownings in the entire country du=
e to entrapments like what happened to Virginia.=20

=20

Next, she teamed up with then Senator Joe Biden to pass the Protect Our Chil=
dren Act.  This bill gave law enforcement the tools and resources they need t=
o track down and prosecute criminals exploiting children online.  Even when G=
OP obstructionist number one, Tom Coburn, held up the bill, Debbie Wasserman=
 Schultz fought tooth and nail to get it passed into law.=20

=20

In 2008, while campaigning for then Senator Barack Obama, she quietly faced h=
er own personal battle with breast cancer.  After seven surgeries, winning h=
er own reelection, and electing the first African American President to the W=
hite House, she told the world her cancer story by doing what else -  holdin=
g a press conference to introduce the Education and Awareness Requires Learn=
ing Young Act - the EARLY Act.  This law provides critical funds and directs=
 the Centers for Disease Control to educate young women and health care prov=
iders, that young women in fact can and do get breast cancer and build aware=
ness for those women who are at higher or genetic risk for this disease.   =20=


=20

Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been a champion for progressive values and work=
ing families her entire career.  She's used her voice and her vote to suppor=
t a $15 minimum wage, was a champion for the Affordable Care Act, and is the=
 lead sponsor in Congress to fully fund the Zika virus crisis which is a maj=
or health concern in her home state of Florida and across the country.=20

=20

Michelle Obama was right when President Obama nominated her to chair the DNC=
: =E2=80=9CIf you want something done, give it to a busy woman.=E2=80=9D  We=
ll, President Barack Obama found the busiest one out there and named her DNC=
 Chair not once, but TWICE!

=20

Thank you for heading to Alaska, Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz!  We are so ex=
cited to have you here.=20

=20
