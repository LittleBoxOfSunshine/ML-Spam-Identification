THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release May 19, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

AT CEREMONY HONORING THE RECIPIENTS OF

THE NATIONAL MEDAL OF SCIENCE, AND

THE NATIONAL MEDAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION



East Room





2:44 P.M. EDT





 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you so much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, ever=
ybody. Please have a seat. Welcome to the White House. Today, I have the =
privilege to present our nations highest honor for scientific and technol=
ogical achievement - the National Medals of Science, and the National Med=
als of Technology and Innovation.=20



The amount of brainpower in this room right now is astonishing. (Laughter=
.) But when you talk to these brilliant men and women, its clear the hono=
r has not yet gone to their heads. They still put their lab coats [on] on=
e arm at a time. (Laughter.)=20



Joining us to celebrate these achievements are members of Congress; Secre=
tary of Energy Ernie Moniz -- a pretty good scientist himself -- my Scien=
ce Advisor, John Holdren; the Director of the National Science Foundation=
, France Crdova; the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Mi=
chelle Lee; and Jim Rathmann from the National Medals of Science and Tech=
nology Foundation. I want to thank them for all the work that they do eac=
h year to help us organize and honor the scientists and innovators in thi=
s great nation of ours.=20



Now, we are engaging in a lot of science and tinkering here at the White =
House. Weve got Astronomy Night. We got Hack-a-thons. We got Code-a-thons=
. We have Science Fairs, Maker Faires. It is fun. I love this stuff. I ge=
t to test out some of the cool stuff that ends up here in the White House=
. At this years Science Fair, one nine-year-old, named Jacob Leggette, tu=
rned the tables on me and suggested that we needed to start a kids adviso=
ry group -- (laughter) -- so that young people can help us understand wha=
ts interesting to them when it comes to STEM education, which I thought w=
as a pretty good idea. (Laughter.)=20



So, today, I can announce that we are launching a Kid Science Advisors ca=
mpaign for young scientists and innovators to send in their suggestions f=
or what we should be doing to support science and technology, and inspire=
 the next generation of scientists and innovators. So those young people =
out there who are listening, go to our website -- were going to be lookin=
g for some advisors, some advice. (Laughter.)



The real reason we do this, as Ive said before, is to teach our young peo=
ple that its not just the winner of the Super Bowl or the NCAA tournament=
 that deserves a celebration; that we want the winners of science fairs, =
we want those who have invented the products and lifesaving medicines and=
 are engineering our future to be celebrated as well. Because immersing y=
oung people in science, math, engineering -- thats whats going to carry t=
he American spirit of innovation through the 21st century and beyond.



Thats what the honorees who are here today represent. Many of them came f=
rom humble or ordinary beginnings, but along the way, someone or somethin=
g sparked their curiosity. Someone bought them their first computer. Some=
one introduced them to a lab. A child in their lives needed specialized m=
edical help. And because they lived in an America that fosters curiosity,=
 and invests in education, and values science as important to our progres=
s, they were able to find their calling and do extraordinary things. So t=
here are few better examples for our young people to follow than the Amer=
icans that we honor today.=20



Just to take a couple of examples: Shirley Ann Jackson, who is part of my=
 science advisory group, grew up right here in Washington, D.C. Hers was =
a quiet childhood. Her first homemade experiment involved, I understand, =
collecting and cataloging bumblebees in her backyard. (Laughter.) Two eve=
nts happened that would not only change our countrys course, but Shirleys=
. In Brown v. Board of Education"," the Supreme Court handed down a landm=
ark decision that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,=
 and the Soviets launched Sputnik up in the sky, sparking a space race. A=
s Shirley put it, Those two events in history changed my life for good.=20=




She went on to become the first African American to earn a doctorate in p=
hysics from MIT, the second woman to do so anywhere in America. And over =
the years, Dr. Jackson has revolutionized the way science informs public =
policy from rethinking safety at our nuclear plants to training a new gen=
eration of scientists and engineers that looks more like the diverse and =
inclusive America she loves.



Then you have Mark Humayan, who immigrated to the United States with his =
family when he was nine years old. When his diabetic grandmother lost her=
 vision, he began studying to become an ophthalmologist, hoping he could =
save the sight of others. Mark helped create the Argus II, a bionic eye t=
hat has restored vision to patients whove been blind for up to 50 years. =
He says the moment when he witnessed someone seeing light and shapes, som=
eone experiencing the miracle of sight for the first time in decades -- t=
hose moments have been some of the happiest and most rewarding of his pro=
fessional career. In his words -- and I think no pun is intended -- There=
 wasnt a dry eye in the operating room. (Laughter.)=20



Growing up in Chicago, Mary-Claire Kings dad would sit with her in front =
of the TV for Cubs and White Sox games -- (laughter) -- and make up story=
 problems for her to solve about the players on the field. She just thoug=
ht thats how everyone watched baseball -- which explains why, when a coll=
ege advisor encouraged her to take a genetics course, she said, I couldnt=
 believe anything could be so fun.=20



But every single American should be grateful for Mary-Claire Kings path. =
Were glad that she thought it was fun because. at a time when most scient=
ists believed that cancer was caused by viruses, she relentlessly pursued=
 her hunch that certain cancers were linked to inherited genetic mutation=
s. This self-described stubborn scientist kept going until she proved her=
self right. Seventeen years of work later, Mary-Claire discovered a singl=
e gene that predisposes women to breast cancer. And that discovery has em=
powered women and their doctors with science to better understand the cho=
ices that they make when it comes to their health and their future.=20



So these are just three examples of the remarkable stories that are repre=
sented here today. They illustrate why this is such an extraordinary mome=
nt to be a scientist in this country. Americas progress in science and te=
chnology has countless revolutionary discoveries within our reach. New ma=
terials designed atom by atom. New forms of clean energy. New breakthroug=
hs in treating cancer and ending the wait for organ transplants. Private =
space flights, a planned human mission to Mars, a NASA probe that broke f=
ree from the Solar System three years ago and just kept on going. Thats s=
ome of what America can do.=20



Thats why were constantly pushing Congress to fund the work of our scient=
ists, engineers, entrepreneurs and dreamers to keep America on the cuttin=
g-edge.=20



As President, Im proud to honor each of you for your contributions to our=
 nations. As an American, Im proud of everything that youve done to contr=
ibute to that fearless spirit of innovation thats made us who we are, and=
 that doesnt just benefit our citizens but benefits the world. Were very =
proud of what youve done. So congratulations to all of you.=20

you so much.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.) Thank you, everybody.&nbsp;=
 Please have a seat.&nbsp; Welcome to the White House.&nbsp; Today, I have =
the privilege to present our nation&#8217;s highest honor for scientific an=
d technological
 achievement &#8211;- the National Medals of Science, and the National Meda=
ls of Technology and Innovation.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The amount of brainpower =
in this room right now is astonishing.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But when you=
 talk to these brilliant men and women, it&#8217;s clear the honor has not =
yet gone to their heads.&nbsp; They still put their lab coats
 [on] one arm at a time.&nbsp; (Laughter.) <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Joining us to celebrate t=
hese achievements are members of Congress; Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz =
-- a pretty good scientist himself -- my Science Advisor, John Holdren; the=
 Director of the National Science Foundation,
 France C=F2rdova; the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Mi=
chelle Lee; and Jim Rathmann from the National Medals of Science and Techno=
logy Foundation.&nbsp; I want to thank them for all the work that they do e=
ach year to help us organize and honor
 the scientists and innovators in this great nation of ours.&nbsp; <o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, we are engaging in a=
 lot of science and tinkering here at the White House.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve go=
t Astronomy Night.&nbsp; We got Hack-a-thons.&nbsp; We got Code-a-thons.&nb=
sp; We have Science Fairs, Maker Faires.&nbsp; It is fun.&nbsp; I love this
 stuff.&nbsp; I get to test out some of the cool stuff that ends up here in=
 the White House.&nbsp; At this year&#8217;s Science Fair, one nine-year-ol=
d, named Jacob Leggette, turned the tables on me and suggested that we need=
ed to start a kids&#8217; advisory group -- (laughter)
 -- so that young people can help us understand what&#8217;s interesting to=
 them when it comes to STEM education, which I thought was a pretty good id=
ea.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, today, I can announce=
 that we are launching a &#8220;Kid Science Advisors&#8221; campaign for yo=
ung scientists and innovators to send in their suggestions for what we shou=
ld be doing to support science and technology, and
 inspire the next generation of scientists and innovators.&nbsp; So those y=
oung people out there who are listening, go to our website -- we&#8217;re g=
oing to be looking for some advisors, some advice.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The real reason we do thi=
s, as I&#8217;ve said before, is to teach our young people that it&#8217;s =
not just the winner of the Super Bowl or the NCAA tournament that deserves =
a celebration; that we want the winners of science
 fairs, we want those who have invented the products and lifesaving medicin=
es and are engineering our future to be celebrated as well.&nbsp; Because i=
mmersing young people in science, math, engineering -- that&#8217;s what&#8=
217;s going to carry the American spirit of innovation
 through the 21st century and beyond.<o:p></o:p></p>

<span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">That&#8217;s what the h=
onorees who are here today represent.&nbsp; Many of them came from humble o=
r ordinary beginnings, but along the way, someone or something sparked thei=
r curiosity.&nbsp; Someone bought them their first computer.&nbsp;
 Someone introduced them to a lab.&nbsp; A child in their lives needed spec=
ialized medical help.&nbsp; And because they lived in an America that foste=
rs curiosity, and invests in education, and values science as important to =
our progress, they were able to find their
 calling and do extraordinary things.&nbsp; So there are few better example=
s for our young people to follow than the Americans that we honor today.

<span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Just to take a couple o=
f examples:&nbsp; Shirley Ann Jackson, who is part of my science advisory g=
roup, grew up right here in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; Hers was a quiet childho=
od.&nbsp; Her first homemade experiment involved, I understand,
 collecting and cataloging bumblebees in her backyard.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nb=
sp; Two events happened that would not only change our country&#8217;s cour=
se, but Shirley&#8217;s.&nbsp; In Brown v. Board of Education<i>,</i> the S=
upreme Court handed down a landmark decision that separate
 educational facilities are inherently unequal, and the Soviets launched Sp=
utnik up in the sky, sparking a space race.&nbsp; As Shirley put it, &#8220=

<span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">She went on to become t=
he first African American to earn a doctorate in physics from MIT, the seco=
nd woman to do so anywhere in America.&nbsp; And over the years, Dr. Jackso=
n has revolutionized the way science informs public
 policy from rethinking safety at our nuclear plants to training a new gene=
ration of scientists and engineers that looks more like the diverse and inc=
lusive America she loves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Then you have Mark Humaya=
n, who immigrated to the United States with his family when he was nine yea=
rs old.&nbsp; When his diabetic grandmother lost her vision, he began study=
ing to become an ophthalmologist, hoping
 he could save the sight of others.&nbsp; Mark helped create the &#8220;Arg=
us II,&#8221; a &#8220;bionic eye&#8221; that has restored vision to patien=
ts who&#8217;ve been blind for up to 50 years. He says the moment when he w=
itnessed someone seeing light and shapes, someone experiencing the
 miracle of sight for the first time in decades -- those moments have been =
some of the happiest and most rewarding of his professional career.&nbsp; I=
n his words -- and I think no pun is intended -- &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t =
a dry eye in the operating room.&#8221;&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Growing up in Chicago, Ma=
ry-Claire King&#8217;s dad would sit with her in front of the TV for Cubs a=
nd White Sox games -- (laughter) -- and make up story problems for her to s=
olve about the players on the field.&nbsp; She
 just thought that&#8217;s how everyone watched baseball -- which explains =
why, when a college advisor encouraged her to take a genetics course, she s=
aid, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t believe anything could be so fun.&#8221;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But every single American=
 should be grateful for Mary-Claire King&#8217;s path.&nbsp; We&#8217;re gl=
ad that she thought it was fun because. at a time when most scientists beli=
eved that cancer was caused by viruses, she relentlessly
 pursued her hunch that certain cancers were linked to inherited genetic mu=
tations.&nbsp; This self-described &#8220;stubborn&#8221; scientist kept go=
ing until she proved herself right.&nbsp; Seventeen years of work later, Ma=
ry-Claire discovered a single gene that predisposes women
 to breast cancer.&nbsp; And that discovery has empowered women and their d=
octors with science to better understand the choices that they make when it=
 comes to their health and their future.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So these are just three e=
xamples of the remarkable stories that are represented here today.&nbsp; Th=
ey illustrate why this is such an extraordinary moment to be a scientist in=
 this country.&nbsp; America&#8217;s progress in science
 and technology has countless revolutionary discoveries within our reach.&n=
bsp; New materials designed atom by atom.&nbsp; New forms of clean energy.&=
nbsp; New breakthroughs in treating cancer and ending the wait for organ tr=
ansplants.&nbsp; Private space flights, a planned human
 mission to Mars, a NASA probe that broke free from the Solar System three =
years ago and just kept on going.&nbsp; That&#8217;s some of what America c=
an do.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That&#8217;s why we&#8217=
;re constantly pushing Congress to fund the work of our scientists, enginee=
rs, entrepreneurs and dreamers to keep America on the cutting-edge.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As President, I&#8217;m p=
