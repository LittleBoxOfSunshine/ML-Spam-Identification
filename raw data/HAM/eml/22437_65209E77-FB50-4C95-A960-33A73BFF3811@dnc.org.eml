Hi Zach,

First of all =97 thx for letting me know.  Neither Ruth not I have yet give=
n to the DNC as you sorta know (unless I had given behind your back, which =
I did not).  I assume this makes us eligible for up to six guests (for our =
collective $66,800).  Correct?

Will there be personal photos, or =93audience photos?=94  Once, at a Spike =
Lee home event (just 30-40 people) there were no staged photos with the Pre=
z).  I want to know what to say to my potential attendees (any who might wa=
nt to hold out for the other type of photo)

I=92m going to go ahead and proffer several invites (indeed 6 =97 can=92t s=
ee why it would be less) tonight.  Please assume (if you can =97 for 24-36 =
hours and slightly pending your answers to my questions) that I will want 6=
 seats at $10K a crack and will pay (between me and Ruth $66,800 for them).

I hope you and Ruth are well. I wanted to let you know, per our phone call,=
 that President Obama will be in NYC on June 8th for an event for the DNC  =
- invitation for which is attached. It's a 60-70 person dinner ($10,000 per=
 person), so not sure it fits what you had in mind, but did want to make yo=
u at least aware.


My best,
Zach
