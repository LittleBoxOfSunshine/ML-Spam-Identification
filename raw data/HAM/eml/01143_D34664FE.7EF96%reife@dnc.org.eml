Subject: My vote for president
Friend --

In a few months, I'll be heading into the voting booth to cast my vote for =
the next President of the United States. And, like so many of you, I've spe=
nt this primary observing the candidates and the parties, and what they rep=
resent.

And I have to say, this has been a difficult period for the Republicans. Th=
ey're trying to figure out what they're standing for -- whether they will b=
e the party of building walls and surveilling neighborhoods, whether they w=
ill be the party that enshrines discrimination in our laws.

But the good news for Democrats is that we know what we believe. We believe=
 that climate change is real and that we must do something about it. We bel=
ieve in raising the minimum wage, and that women should be paid the same as=
 men for doing the same job. We believe that our laws should reflect our he=
ritage as a nation of immigrants. We believe that all people should be trea=
ted with dignity and respect, no matter their race or religion, gender or s=
exual orientation.

We have two fine Democratic candidates who, no matter their differences, sh=
are this same set of core beliefs that defines our party. And in November, =
we're going to make sure that one of them becomes our next president.

But first -- right now -- I need to know that you're in:
