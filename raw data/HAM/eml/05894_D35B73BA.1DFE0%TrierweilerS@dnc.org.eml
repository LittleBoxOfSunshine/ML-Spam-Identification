DNC Chair Statement on Trump Tax Returns

This morning Donald Trump once again went back on his word, refusing to rel=
ease his tax returns. When asked<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trum=
p-refuses-reveal-tax-rate-business/story?id=3D39086788> during an interview=
 whether he would disclose his tax rate, Trump snapped at the interviewer a=
nd said it was =93none of your business.=94 He also argued that voters do n=
ot have a right to see his tax returns before Election Day.

Of course, when Trump first considered running for President in 1999, he sa=
id<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/during-1999-run-trump-vowed-to-=
release-his-tax-returns?utm_term=3D.muL9odKmN#.wmoEdDVGq> he, =93probably w=
ouldn=92t have a problem with=94 releasing his tax returns if he ran. Later=
, in 2012, he argued<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dzihdu8RFO5Y&feature=
=3Dyoutu.be> if you=92re running for President, =93at a minimum, probably, =
you=92re going to have to show your [tax] returns=94 and they should be rel=
eased by April 1st<http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/01/19/trump-gop-s=
top-playing-president-obamas-hands/> of the election year.
DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement:

=93Trump=92s refusal to release his tax returns raises serious questions ab=
out what he=92s hiding, whether or not he pays his fair share and how much =
he would benefit from his own reckless tax plan. If Trump can=92t be open a=
nd honest about his purported wealth today as a candidate, there=92s no tel=
ling how much he would rig the system to enrich himself and others at the t=
op at the expense of hardworking families as president.=94
