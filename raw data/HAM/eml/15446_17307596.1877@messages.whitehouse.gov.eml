Subject: Travel pool 5/Jade pagoda

Potus motorcade breezed through HCMC boulevards with crowds lining either=
 side the entire route and in some cases down side streets. Pulling up to=
 Jade Emperor Pagoda, the Beast limo drove right through the front gate a=
nd parked in the right entrance pavilion, then executed a tight 3-pt turn=
 as the pool hustled past it and into the pagoda. We stopped in front of =
a Buddha statue behind glass and a spotlight, surrounded by other smaller=
 statues, purple and white flowers and red candles with incense. The pago=
da's Abbott gave Potus a tour of the pagoda then came into the room where=
 the pool was to see the Buddha statue. Your pool overheard a bit of dial=
ogue:

The Abbott told Potus that the Buddha statue represents the confession of=
 the people and can see the suffering. Then he pointed to another statue =
to say In Tibet and India it was male but China and Vietnam transformed t=
o female per local custom. He said some people in Asian still hope for so=
ns and take some sort of drink for good luck.
"I like daughters," Potus replied.
Another man then struck a gong several times. The pool was moved out to a=
n outdoor pavilion with I sense burning shrine where Potus walked to go b=
ack to his limo, amid shrieks from onlookers behind a wire fence. The mot=
orcade departed back thru the streets with the cheering crowds to the Dre=
amplex for the entrepreneur event at 5 pm.
