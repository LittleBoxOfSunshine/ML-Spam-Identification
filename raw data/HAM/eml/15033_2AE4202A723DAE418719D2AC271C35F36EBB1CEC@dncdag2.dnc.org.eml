THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH // JACK TORRY
WASHINGTON - Republican presidential candidate John Kasich rejected a sweep=
ing overhaul of the tax code with his new economic plan and instead offered=
 a more traditional Republican blueprint that he says will spark the U.S. e=
conomy and eventually balance the federal budget.

Although critics say that Kasich's plan, unveiled this month in New Hampshi=
re, is based on overly optimistic projections of economic growth and illuso=
ry budget restraints, the Ohio governor steered clear of more-radical conse=
rvative ideas to scrap the tax code and substitute either a single-rate inc=
ome tax or a tax solely on consumption.

The Dispatch took a closer look at the plan and found Kasich is employing c=
oncepts championed for the past three decades by establishment Republicans.=
 For example, he wants to compress the seven current individual tax rates i=
nto three while avoiding more controversial ideas to sweep away scores of d=
eductions and preferences in the tax code.

He blends his tax-reduction plan with a dose of federalism in which Washing=
ton will provide states with the money and authority to design their own ed=
ucation, transportation and Medicaid systems.

And he favors the old Republican brew of curbing federal environmental and =
financial regulations, boosting defense spending, and freezing spending on =
domestic programs such as the environment, criminal justice, housing and ed=
ucation.

"The flat tax is an attractive idea, especially in terms of simplification,=
" said Scott Milburn, a senior adviser to Kasich's campaign. "He continues =
to be very interested in it, and we continue to explore it. At the same tim=
e, balancing the budget has a profound stimulative effect and our overall e=
conomic policy needs to continually be driving toward that goal. ...

"Conservatives know which ideas can work," Milburn said. "There's widesprea=
d agreement. That is why it is all the more frustrating when Washington mak=
es so little progress in enacting the reforms so many people can agree on. =
We need someone who knows how to bring people together, knock a few heads t=
ogether if needed, and produce the results Americans so badly want."

But even as budget experts credit Kasich for offering ideas to reduce the m=
ore than $7 trillion in publicly held debt that will be added during the ne=
xt decade, many flatly dismiss his insistence that reducing tax rates will =
spark a major economic revival and generate larger tax revenue for the fede=
ral treasury.

"The way they rhetorically deal with the irresponsibility of their tax cuts=
 is to claim those tax cuts will pay for themselves, which of course they d=
on't," said Harry Stein, director of fiscal policy at the left-leaning Cent=
er for American Progress Action Fund in Washington.

"When you look at Kasich's plan, it's shocking - for somebody with a reputa=
tion for seriousness and moderation ... - how unserious and extreme Kasich'=
s plan is, and you really see this most on the tax side," Stein said.

Critics say that Kasich provides only vague details on restraining the expl=
osive growth of Medicaid and Medicare, which pay for health care for the po=
or and elderly. By 2025, federal spending on Social Security, Medicare and =
Medicaid will consume $3.2 trillion of the projected $6 trillion federal bu=
dget.

Max Richtman, president and CEO of the National Committee To Preserve Socia=
l Security and Medicare, said "the impact" of restraining Medicare's growth=
 to 5.3 percent annually as Kasich wants "would be either much higher out-o=
f-pocket costs for beneficiaries or more substandard care or a combination =
of both."

Since President Ronald Reagan and economic conservatives seized control of =
the Republican Party in 1980, Republicans have emphasized tax cuts, deregul=
ation and more defense spending, saying the gusher of new tax revenue gener=
ated by a growing economy would sweep away federal deficits.

In practice, the income-tax cuts Reagan and President George W. Bush pushed=
 through Congress in 1981 and 2001 helped usher in staggering deficits that=
 never would have been acceptable to earlier Republican presidents.

Although Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian-leaning Cato Instit=
ute in Washington, acknowledged that "most tax cuts do not pay for themselv=
es," he said, "Some tax cuts can have substantial positive effects on gross=
 domestic product because corporate tax-rate reductions will cause corporat=
ions to increase capital investment, which will increase employment."

Kasich has made a career of preaching that huge deficits can hamper economi=
c growth. But in his effort to simultaneously appeal to tax-cutting conserv=
atives and those backing balanced budgets, he appears to be heading in oppo=
site directions at the same time.

For example, he wants Congress to repeal key parts of the 2010 health-care =
law signed by President Barack Obama but keep the section that provides sta=
tes with billions of federal dollars to expand Medicaid to millions of low-=
income people.

At the same time, Kasich wants to restrain the rate of growth of Medicaid t=
o 3 percent annually. Richtman said, "There's no way that will keep pace wi=
th medical inflation, which has run twice that rate."

Such a challenge is daunting for Kasich. The nonpartisan Congressional Budg=
et Office calculates that Medicaid spending this year will increase 16 perc=
ent primarily because governors such as Kasich took advantage of the 2010 h=
ealth-care law to expand Medicaid enrollment in their states.

Kasich aides counter that providing states with greater authority to design=
 their own Medicaid plans, such as funneling more people into managed care,=
 will save billions. They also suggest Medicare savings can be achieved thr=
ough managed-care programs such as Medicare Advantage and dealing more effi=
ciently with chronic diseases such as diabetes.

Even those Medicare reforms may not save enough money. According to the Cat=
o Institute's Edwards: "The way to reform the program is switch to a system=
 where money goes to individual consumers in a fixed amount and the consume=
rs use their dollars and force the hospitals and doctors to compete for the=
ir consumer cash."

The other key component of Kasich's plan is to freeze new federal regulatio=
ns during his first year as president, which would delight companies that s=
ay the new financial regulations imposed by Congress during Obama's preside=
ncy stifled economic growth.

"As a practical matter, that would certainly be a confidence signal to the =
business community that the new president is serious about getting control =
of the regulatory process," said John D. Graham, dean of the School of Publ=
ic and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University, who was consulted on th=
e regulatory proposals.

Yet such a freeze is likely to provoke intense opposition from those who bl=
ame lax regulation for the 2008 collapse of the nation's financial system.

Richard Cordray, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a=
nd former attorney general of Ohio, warned in a speech last March, "Anarchy=
 in the marketplace has never worked and never will work."
