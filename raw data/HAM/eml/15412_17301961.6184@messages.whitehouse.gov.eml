For Immediate Release May 5, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT,

THE VICE PRESIDENT,=20

THE FIRST LADY AND DR. BIDEN

AT JOINING FORCES 5TH ANNIVERSARY=20



Joint Base Andrews





6:18 P.M. EDT





 THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, everyone! (Applause.) Great to see you! Can't=
 be anyplace I'd rather be. I was going to say something nice about Jon, =
but the hell with him. (Laughter.)=20



 Jon, thank you for continuing to shine a spotlight on our incredible war=
riors, and also for all you did for the 9/11 first responders. Jon, had y=
ou not literally thrown your body in front of the train, they would have =
never gotten the coverage they got. And I want to thank you, man. Because=
 what Jon does -- what Jon does comes from his heart. He means it. So, th=
ank you very much, Jon. (Applause.)=20



 I want to thank all the artists you're about to hear tonight. We just go=
t to meet backstage. I want to thank everyone in uniform here today and a=
ll of you overseas for what you do for this country day in and day out. A=
nd, J.D., thank you. You're always, always looking out for our military f=
amilies, including mine.=20



 Every military family in here can tell you -- those who are here and tho=
se who are listening -- that every family knows it's the little things --=
 it's the little things that really matter.



 USO volunteers are there to say good-bye to our warriors as they deploy.=
 And theyre the first ones to welcome them home when they return. It matt=
ers. I know it mattered to our son, Beau. He, after a year in Iraq, set f=
oot on American soil at the Pease Air National Guard Base in New Hampshir=
e, there was a long line of warriors standing there to salute his brigade=
 as they got off, to say thank you, thank you, thank you. They represente=
d everything from World War II to the Korean War, to Iraqi Freedom.



 And you know, he said -- and it always surprised me when people would as=
k me about it -- he said it was the most meaningful thing that happened t=
o us, he said, getting off that plane and seeing everybody just standing =
there. It was the middle of the night. Just saying, welcome home.=20



 You all know it. You know what it feels like.=20



 And on a personal note, we also remember how the USO embraced us when we=
 lost Beau.



 Joining Forces, five years -- Michelle and Jill making things better all=
 across the country and around the world. You all know not only they work=
ed so hard for your families, because they believed. But youve inspired t=
hem. Youve inspired Jill. Whether it's at Brooke Army Medical Center or W=
alter Reed, or Ramstein Airbase in Germany, or Camp Lejeune, Fort Leonard=
 Wood, Aviano Airbase in Italy, United Arab Republic, Kadena Airbase in J=
apan, or standing next to me at Al Faw Palace -- where some of you were -=
- at Camp Victory, congratulating your Mexican immigrant who was being sw=
orn in, in uniform, as a United States citizen.



 Ladies and gentlemen, the President and I -- you might expect us to say =
this -- are incredibly proud of what Michelle and Jill have done. Always,=
 always fighting for your families. Because you are -- you are virtually =
the bone and sinew of this country. You're Americas backbone.=20



And all those family members who watched their son or daughter or husband=
, wife deploy, every single day, every minute that went by, you thought o=
f them -- once a day, twice a day, 10 times a day. Theres a famous Englis=
h poet who wrote, They also serve who only stand and wait. So to every fa=
mily member -- I mean this from the bottom of my heart -- for every famil=
y member of anyone in uniform, we owe you.=20



My mom used to have an expression -- shed say, remember, Joe, you're defi=
ned by your courage and you're redeemed by your loyalty. I heard it once,=
 I heard it a hundred times growing up. To all of you in this room, in th=
is hangar, all of you here, you live up to my mothers code every single, =
solitary day. And we owe you.



As Jill always points out, 1 percent of you are the ones defending the en=
tire population, but 99 percent remaining of the population owes you our =
thanks, our appreciation, and our gratitude.=20



You here and all those listening and so many more are all part of the gre=
atest generation of warriors -- and this is not hyperbole -- the greatest=
 generation of warriors the world has ever seen. More than 4.6 million of=
 you signed up since 9/11, knowing with almost virtual certainty youd be =
deployed into harms way; 2.7 million of you have been deployed into harms=
 way. An unbroken chain of patriots, youve stood guard over this country =
in a way that is just -- you have to see you in the field to really under=
stand it.=20



The President and I -- I've seen you in Bosnia, Basra, Fallujah, Ramadi, =
Kabul, Kandahar, the Upper Kunar Valley. A great opportunity was being ba=
ck last week in Baghdad and Erbil. You are literally the finest warriors =
in the history of the world. You're incredible.



But I'm not the only one who understands this. The man I'm honored to sta=
nd with for the last eight years, in quiet moments, in difficult moments,=
 in debates within the Oval Office and in the White House -- we were down=
 in the Situation Room. We had been given bad news and sometimes good new=
s. Every decision he makes -- I can say this without fear of contradictio=
n -- every decision he makes he makes with you and your families in mind.=
 You're the beginning of every important decision that this man makes.



So, ladies and gentlemen, welcome our Commander-in-Chief, Barack Obama. T=
he President of the United States of America. (Applause.)=20



THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody! (Applause.) Give it up for Joe Biden! (A=
pplause.) Oh, it is good to see all of you here today. (Applause.) Thank =
you so much. Everybody, please have a seat.



I want to recognize all of our outstanding military leaders who are here.=
 And I want to acknowledge our Secretary of the Air Force, Deborah Lee Ja=
mes. (Applause.) Chief Master Sergeant Mitchell Brush from the National G=
uard. (Applause.) Major General Darryl Burke. (Applause.) Wing Commander =
Bradley Hoagland. (Applause.) And I want to thank the USO for the outstan=
ding work that they have done for so many years and that means so much to=
 not only those who serve in uniform but also their families. So please g=
ive it up for the USO. (Applause.) WE are very proud of them.=20



And lets hear it for the funny people who are here tonight who are going =
to be -- I think -- telling a few jokes, I hope, including our host, the =
Bob Hope of this USO Show -- Jon Stewart. The one and only. (Applause.) I=
 do want to mention, though, any jokes told about me, you should not laug=
h. (Laughter.) I'm just kidding. This is actually my second comedy show i=
n the past week. (Laughter and applause.) The good news is there are no t=
uxedos. (Laughter.) And most importantly, I get to spend some time with y=
ou, the men and women who make up the greatest fighting force the world h=
as ever seen. (Applause.)=20



I know we already did the rollcall, but I just want to see if you guys ca=
n do it a little bit better this time. (Laughter.) And by the way, I'm go=
ing to start with Army, because Jon made fun of you. Army! (Applause.) Th=
ere you go. We got Navy here. (Applause.) Air Force is in the house! (App=
lause.) This is an Air Force base. (Laughter.) I'm just saying. You got a=
 little home field advantage. (Laughter.)=20



Marines! (Applause.) And Coast Guard. (Applause.) Good job, Coast Guard. =
(Laughter.) Military spouses and kids, lets hear you! (Applause.)

=20

This is a nice way for me to not just say thank you for your service, but=
 to give a particular thanks to Joint Base Andrews, home of the 89th Airl=
ift Wing. Because Joe and I spend a little bit of time on this base. (Lau=
ghter.) You guys are the ones who take care of our planes. You keep us on=
 time -- most of the time. (Laughter.) And you're always the first ones t=
o welcome us home. So you mean so much to us. And I'm so glad we're able =
to do something here so that you guys know we don't take you for granted.=
 And Michelle and I, Joe and Jill, when we come in and out of this base, =
we know how many people stand behind the planes and the helicopters and a=
ll the incredible work that's being done just moving us around every sing=
le day. So thank you very much. We really mean it. Thank you. (Applause.)=


=20

Thanks for your service here. Thanks for your service around the world. N=
ow, because I'm standing between you and a party, I am going to be the Co=
mmander-in-Brief. (Laughter.)=20



One of my greatest honors is to serve you and your families. And that mea=
ns using our military power wisely. It means sending you into harms way w=
hen its absolutely necessary. It means making sure that you -- our troops=
, our veterans, your families=20

-- are getting the care and the benefits that youve earned. It means cutt=
ing the disability claims backlog. It means helping you and your families=
, whether it's starting a business or pursuing your education under the P=
ost-9/11 GI Bill.=20



And the good news is we've made a lot of progress over these past eight y=
ears. But the work of doing right by you and your families is never done.=
 And it is not just a job for government. And thats why were here today.=20=




Back on the campaign in 2008, Michelle sat down with some military spouse=
s, and she was deeply moved by the stories of your service, and your stre=
ngth, and your resilience. She heard stories of families enduring multipl=
e deployments. This was obviously at a time when we still had 180,000 tro=
ops deployed between Iraq and Afghanistan. Spouses and veterans were comi=
ng home and struggling to find jobs. Children constantly moving from scho=
ol to school. And these are stories you live out every day, but theyre on=
es that the rest of the country wasnt always hearing. So Michelle pledged=
 that if she became First Lady, shed help share those stories far and wid=
e -- and challenge Americans to stand with you.=20



And five years ago, she teamed up with another formidable force, Jill Bid=
en, to start Joining Forces. As a Blue Star Mom, as a teacher whose dad s=
erved in World War II, Jill was already fired up about reaching out to mi=
litary kids. And together, they wanted to channel what they knew was Amer=
icas goodwill towards our military into something concrete and something =
real. Not just a parade on Veterans Day or Memorial Day; not just honors =
at a ballgame, but what was happening day-to-day to make peoples lives be=
tter. And so Michelle and Jill wanted to help folks answer a question tha=
t a lot of people were asking, which is, how can we do more? How can we h=
elp more?=20



So they started by focusing on the most basic ingredient of stability and=
 security -- a job. In the aftermath of the economic crisis, the unemploy=
ment rate overall had reached 10 percent. But for some of our veterans it=
 was even worse. As many as one in four of our youngest vets were looking=
 for jobs. And too many of our military spouses were struggling to find w=
ork because their families were constantly relocated.=20



So Michelle and Jill reached out to hundreds of Americas biggest brands a=
nd employers -- companies like Walmart and Disney and Amazon -- telling t=
hem the same thing I tell CEOs every time, which is, if you want a job do=
ne right, hire a vet, hire a military spouse. (Applause.) They know how t=
o handle stress. They know how to do the job. They know how to perform un=
der pressure. Theyve proven themselves. (Applause.)=20



And the good news is, over the past five years, Americas businesses have =
begun to answer the call. All told, the unemployment rate for veterans ha=
s been cut in half, and through Joining Forces, companies have hired or t=
rained more than 1.2 million veterans and military spouses.=20



But Michelle and Jill didnt stop there. They worked with states to change=
 professional licensing laws so that our vets can get credit for your mil=
itary training and spouses can get hired when you move across state lines=
. Theyre working to rally almost 900 mayors and local leaders to get our =
homeless veterans into housing and to get the support that they need. The=
y help teachers and schools support military students from kindergarten t=
hrough college. They supported our caregivers and our wounded warriors. A=
nd theyve worked to destigmatize mental health challenges.=20



Theyve worked with Hollywood to share your stories with the American peop=
le in movies and television. And theyve shined a special light on our wom=
en servicemembers and our veterans. And theyve mobilized communities all =
across the country to honor and support our military families.=20



All of this just in five years. And heres the thing. This event is not th=
e endpoint, it's not the finish line. This is just a marker on the race. =
It's a mile-marker. Because every year, around 200,000 American heroes ar=
e transitioning back into civilian life. And whether its wartime or peace=
time, many of our troops still serve far from home and families like your=
s sacrifice. So Michelle and Jill have pledged to keep charging forward o=
n this issue -- not just for the next nine months, but long after we leav=
e office.=20



Thats why tonight, on this fifth anniversary, I want to renew Michelle an=
d Jills call from the day they launched this effort. I challenge every Am=
erican to keep asking that simple question -- How can I give back to thes=
e troops and families who have given me so much? Everybody should have th=
at in their minds. Because thanks to Joining Forces, we have answers in t=
erms of how you can help.=20



If youre a business owner, hire more veterans and military spouses. And i=
f you don't know how to do it, let us know. We'll tell you. If youre a te=
acher, reach out to the military students in your class. And if you need =
ideas for how to provide more support, Joining Forces will let you know. =
If youre a mayor, or a coworker, or a neighbor, go to JoiningForces.gov t=
o find out how you can make a difference for military families in your co=
mmunities. Thats how we can concretely show that we have your backs -- th=
at it's not just lip service, but we're actually doing something concrete=
.=20



Thats what today is about. I could not be prouder of everything the Ameri=
can people have done and will continue to do through Joining Forces. More=
 importantly, I think I speak for Joe Biden to say I could not be prouder=
 of two people who are as smart and charismatic and committed and dedicat=
ed -- what theyve been able to accomplish with almost no budget, but just=
 through sheer force of will and personality and commitment to you is som=
ething that leaves me in awe. I am so proud of them.



Give it up for two champions for our troops and our veterans and our mili=
tary families -- Michelle Obama and Jill Biden. (Applause.)=20



 DR. BIDEN: Thank you to the Commander-in-Chief, President Obama, for tha=
t wonderful introduction. Thank you. (Applause.)



 And, of course, I want to say thank you to my husband, Joe, the Vice Pre=
sident --



 THE PRESIDENT: Hes all right. (Laughter.)



 DR. BIDEN: -- for always supporting and encouraging me to do as much as =
we can to show our military families how much we appreciate them.=20



 And tonights celebration wouldnt have happened without the USO. Lets giv=
e the USO a big round of applause. (Applause.) For the past seven years, =
its been an honor to work with the USO on a number of issues affecting ou=
r troops, our veterans, and their families. Weve done everything together=
 -- from stuffing care packages on Capitol Hill for women soldiers to hos=
ting barbecues for wounded warriors at the Vice Presidents residence, to =
block parties with military families on bases in Hawaii, Germany, Japan, =
Italy, Singapore, and throughout the United States.



 Everywhere we go, the USO is there. I feel like Ive seen your volunteers=
 so often that theyve really become like family. Just as youve been there=
 for so many military families over the years, youve been there for us ev=
ery step of the way. You were there for my father during World War II. Yo=
u were there for our son when he deployed to Iraq. And it was your work t=
hat inspired our work.=20



Your mission is one of the reasons Michelle and I started Joining Forces =
in the first place -- to give all Americans the opportunity to step up an=
d show their support for our military and their families. You even helped=
 Michelle and me launch our Joining Forces initiative with Sesame Street.=
=20



So thank you for all the work that you continue to do and congratulations=
 on the 75 years of incredible work that you do every single day for our =
warriors and their families around the world. Its making a difference in =
more lives than you will ever know.=20



 To all of the military and their families here tonight, you are our hero=
es. Your selflessness and sacrifice on behalf of our country is so inspir=
ing. We can never do enough to thank you for your service and we hope you=
 have a little fun tonight.



 So now its my honor to introduce our countrys great supporter of our mil=
itary and their families, my friend and Joining Forces partner, the First=
 Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama. (Applause.)=20



 MRS. OBAMA: All right, you guys! (Applause.) Yes! (Applause.) All right,=
 were going to get this party started but before we begin, I have to than=
k my husband, Barack. (Applause.) Thanks to Joe and Jill. Thank you, J.D.=
 and Jon and, most of all, thank all of you for joining us tonight. I hop=
e you all are good. Were so excited.



 Let me just tell you, in order to get four of us on a stage -- its reall=
y hard. (Laughter.) And were doing it because of you. We have cleared our=
 schedules, we made this happen because we all care and you mean so much =
to us. We are so incredibly honored to be here with all of you to celebra=
te the fifth anniversary of Joining Forces. I cant believe its been just =
five years.=20



 Make no mistake about it, Joining Forces is about one thing and one thin=
g only: Its about you. Its about rallying this country to honor, support,=
 and thank all of you -- (applause) -- our extraordinary servicemembers, =
our veterans, and of course, those military families who are so near and =
dear to my heart. (Applause.)=20



You just have to understand, we know what you do for our country every si=
ngle day because over the past five years, through Joining Forces, Jill a=
nd I, weve had the pleasure of traveling across America and around the wo=
rld, as youve heard, to bases and schools, communities and hospitals. Wev=
e had the privilege of really getting to know so many of you. The spouses=
 whove endured those long deployments; all those difficult moves.=20

Our military kids who bravely walk through the doors of yet another new s=
chool. The wounded warriors who tell us they would do it all again for th=
e chance to serve their country. The heroes -- that is all of you who mak=
e such extraordinary sacrifices to keep us safe.



 Now, let me tell you, in many ways you all have made our job with Joinin=
g Forces easy, because all we have to do is tell your stories. Thats real=
ly it. Because when people hear about you, they want to step up. They wan=
t to express their gratitude. They want to serve you as well as youve ser=
ved this country. You inspire people all across this country, and that is=
 absolutely true for Jill and for me. Getting to know all of you -- oh, y=
ou all just make us want to be better. You inspire us to be better mother=
s and spouses, better public servants, better citizens, better human bein=
gs. You do that.=20



 You inspire us to try every day to use this platform, this light to serv=
e and support everything you do. The courage, the honor, the boundless lo=
ve for this country -- thats what weve come to know. And tonight, we just=
 want you to know that serving you, doing this work with Joining Forces, =
of all the things that I have experienced -- weve experienced -- serving =
you has been one of the greatest privileges of our lives. (Applause.)



 AUDIENCE: We love you! (Applause.)



 MRS. OBAMA: We love you. (Applause.) Were here tonight, gathered here to=
 thank you. Thank you for that privilege. Were here tonight to once again=
 honor you for everything youve done and to tell you again and again how =
much we love you.



 So tonight, we want you all to have some fun, all right? (Applause.) Ple=
ase have the time of your lives. (Applause.) I hope theres food or drink =
or something around here. (Laughter.) Enjoy every single minute. Soak thi=
s all in, because youve more than earned it, and we are proud of you all.=
 (Applause.)



 So with that, Im going to stop talking and turn things back over to Jon =
so that we can get this party started. How bout it? Thank you all so much=
. God bless you. (Applause.)

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jon, thank you for continui=
ng to shine a spotlight on our incredible warriors, and also for all you di=
d for the 9/11 first responders.&nbsp; Jon, had you not literally thrown yo=
ur body in front of the train, they would have never gotten
 the coverage they got. And I want to thank you, man.&nbsp; Because what Jo=
n does -- what Jon does comes from his heart.&nbsp; He means it.&nbsp; So, =
thank you very much, Jon.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to thank all the art=

 thank you.&nbsp; You're always, always looking out for our military famili=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every military family in he=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USO volunteers are there to=
 say good-bye to our warriors as they deploy.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re the f=
irst ones to welcome them home when they return.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp; I =
know it mattered to our son, Beau.&nbsp; He, after a year in Iraq, set foot=
 on American
 soil at the Pease Air National Guard Base in New Hampshire, there was a lo=
ng line of warriors standing there to salute his brigade as they got off, t=
o say thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; They represented everything fr=
om World War II to the Korean War, to
 Iraqi Freedom.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you know, he said -- an=
d it always surprised me when people would ask me about it -- he said it wa=
s the most meaningful thing that happened to us, he said, getting off that =
plane and seeing everybody just standing there.&nbsp; It was
 the middle of the night.&nbsp; Just saying, welcome home.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You all know it.&nbsp; You =

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on a personal note, we =

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joining Forces, five years =
-- Michelle and Jill making things better all across the country and around=
 the world.&nbsp; You all know not only they worked so hard for your famili=
es, because they believed.&nbsp; But you&#8217;ve inspired them.&nbsp; You&=
#8217;ve
 inspired Jill. Whether it's at Brooke Army Medical Center or Walter Reed, =
or Ramstein Airbase in Germany, or Camp Lejeune, Fort Leonard Wood, Aviano =
Airbase in Italy, United Arab Republic, Kadena Airbase in Japan, or standin=
g next to me at Al Faw Palace --
 where some of you were -- at Camp Victory, congratulating your Mexican imm=
igrant who was being sworn in, in uniform, as a United States citizen.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ladies and gentlemen, the P=
resident and I -- you might expect us to say this -- are incredibly proud o=
f what Michelle and Jill have done.&nbsp; Always, always fighting for your =
families.&nbsp; Because you are -- you are virtually the bone and
 sinew of this country.&nbsp; You're America&#8217;s backbone.&nbsp; <o:p><=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And all those family memb=
ers who watched their son or daughter or husband, wife deploy, every single=
 day, every minute that went by, you thought of them -- once a day, twice a=
 day, 10 times a day.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a famous
 English poet who wrote, &#8220;They also serve who only stand and wait.&#8=
221;&nbsp; So to every family member -- I mean this from the bottom of my h=
eart -- for every family member of anyone in uniform, we owe you.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">My mom used to have an ex=

and you're redeemed by your loyalty.&nbsp; I heard it once, I heard it a hu=

 in this hangar, all of you here, you live up to my mother&#8217;s code eve=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As Jill always points out=
, 1 percent of you are the ones defending the entire population, but 99 per=
cent remaining of the population owes you our thanks, our appreciation, and=
 our gratitude.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">You here and all those li=
stening and so many more are all part of the greatest generation of warrior=
s -- and this is not hyperbole -- the greatest generation of warriors the w=
orld has ever seen.&nbsp; More than 4.6 million
 of you signed up since 9/11, knowing with almost virtual certainty you&#82=
17;d be deployed into harm&#8217;s way; 2.7 million of you have been deploy=
ed into harm&#8217;s way.&nbsp; An unbroken chain of patriots, you&#8217;ve=
 stood guard over this country in a way that is just -- you have
 to see you in the field to really understand it.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The President and I -- I'=
ve seen you in Bosnia, Basra, Fallujah, Ramadi, Kabul, Kandahar, the Upper =
Kunar Valley.&nbsp; A great opportunity was being back last week in Baghdad=
 and Erbil. You are literally the finest
 warriors in the history of the world.&nbsp; You're incredible.<o:p></o:p><=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But I'm not the only one =
who understands this.&nbsp; The man I'm honored to stand with for the last =
eight years, in quiet moments, in difficult moments, in debates within the =
Oval Office and in the White House -- we
 were down in the Situation Room.&nbsp; We had been given bad news and some=
times good news.&nbsp; Every decision he makes -- I can say this without fe=
ar of contradiction -- every decision he makes he makes with you and your f=
amilies in mind.&nbsp; You're the beginning of
 every important decision that this man makes.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">One of my greatest honors=
 is to serve you and your families. And that means using our military power=
 wisely.&nbsp; It means sending you into harm&#8217;s way when it&#8217;s a=
bsolutely necessary.&nbsp; It means making sure that you --
 our troops, our veterans, your families <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">-- are getting the care and the benefits that you&#8=
217;ve earned.&nbsp; It means cutting the disability claims backlog.&nbsp; =
It means helping you and your families, whether it's starting a business or=
 pursuing your education under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the good news is we'v=
e made a lot of progress over these past eight years.&nbsp; But the work of=
 doing right by you and your families is never done.&nbsp; And it is not ju=
st a job for government.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re
 here today.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Back on the campaign in 2=
008, Michelle sat down with some military spouses, and she was deeply moved=
 by the stories of your service, and your strength, and your resilience.&nb=
sp; She heard stories of families enduring
 multiple deployments.&nbsp; This was obviously at a time when we still had=
 180,000 troops deployed between Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp; Spouses and ve=
terans were coming home and struggling to find jobs.&nbsp; Children constan=
tly moving from school to school.&nbsp; And these are
 stories you live out every day, but they&#8217;re ones that the rest of th=
e country wasn&#8217;t always hearing.&nbsp; So Michelle pledged that if sh=
e became First Lady, she&#8217;d help share those stories far and wide -- a=
nd challenge Americans to stand with you.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And five years ago, she t=
eamed up with another formidable force, Jill Biden, to start Joining Forces=
.&nbsp; As a Blue Star Mom, as a teacher whose dad served in World War II, =
Jill was already fired up about reaching
 out to military kids.&nbsp; And together, they wanted to channel what they=
 knew was America&#8217;s goodwill towards our military into something conc=
rete and something real.&nbsp; Not just a parade on Veterans Day or Memoria=
l Day; not just honors at a ballgame, but what was
 happening day-to-day to make people&#8217;s lives better.&nbsp; And so Mic=
helle and Jill wanted to help folks answer a question that a lot of people =
were asking, which is, how can we do more?&nbsp; How can we help more?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So they started by focusi=
ng on the most basic ingredient of stability and security -- a job.&nbsp; I=
n the aftermath of the economic crisis, the unemployment rate overall had r=
eached 10 percent.&nbsp; But for some of our veterans
 it was even worse.&nbsp; As many as one in four of our youngest vets were =
looking for jobs.&nbsp; And too many of our military spouses were strugglin=
g to find work because their families were constantly relocated.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So Michelle and Jill reac=
hed out to hundreds of America&#8217;s biggest brands and employers -- comp=
anies like Walmart and Disney and Amazon -- telling them the same thing I t=
ell CEOs every time, which is, if you want
 a job done right, hire a vet, hire a military spouse.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nb=
sp; They know how to handle stress.&nbsp; They know how to do the job.&nbsp=
; They know how to perform under pressure.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve proven thems=
elves.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the good news is, ove=
r the past five years, America&#8217;s businesses have begun to answer the =
call.&nbsp; All told, the unemployment rate for veterans has been cut in ha=
lf, and through Joining Forces, companies have
 hired or trained more than 1.2 million veterans and military spouses.&nbsp=
; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But Michelle and Jill did=
n&#8217;t stop there.&nbsp; They worked with states to change professional =
licensing laws so that our vets can get credit for your military training a=
nd spouses can get hired when you move across state
 lines.&nbsp; They&#8217;re working to rally almost 900 mayors and local le=
aders to get our homeless veterans into housing and to get the support that=
 they need.&nbsp; They help teachers and schools support military students =
from kindergarten through college.&nbsp; They supported
 our caregivers and our wounded warriors.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ve worked to=
 destigmatize mental health challenges.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">They&#8217;ve worked with=
 Hollywood to share your stories with the American people in movies and tel=
evision.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ve shined a special light on our women servic=
emembers and our veterans.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ve mobilized communities
 all across the country to honor and support our military families.&nbsp; <=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All of this just in five =
years.&nbsp; And here&#8217;s the thing.&nbsp; This event is not the endpoi=
nt, it's not the finish line.&nbsp; This is just a marker on the race.&nbsp=
; It's a mile-marker.&nbsp; Because every year, around 200,000 American
 heroes are transitioning back into civilian life.&nbsp; And whether it&#82=
17;s wartime or peacetime, many of our troops still serve far from home and=
 families like yours sacrifice.&nbsp; So Michelle and Jill have pledged to =
keep charging forward on this issue -- not just
 for the next nine months, but long after we leave office. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That&#8217;s why tonight,=
 on this fifth anniversary, I want to renew Michelle and Jill&#8217;s call =
from the day they launched this effort.&nbsp; I challenge every American to=
 keep asking that simple question -- &#8220;How can I give
 back to these troops and families who have given me so much?&#8221;&nbsp; =
Everybody should have that in their minds.&nbsp; Because thanks to Joining =
Forces, we have answers in terms of how you can help.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">If you&#8217;re a busines=
s owner, hire more veterans and military spouses.&nbsp; And if you don't kn=
ow how to do it, let us know.&nbsp; We'll tell you.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re a=
 teacher, reach out to the military students in your class.&nbsp; And
 if you need ideas for how to provide more support, Joining Forces will let=
 you know.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re a mayor, or a coworker, or a neighbor, go =
to JoiningForces.gov to find out how you can make a difference for military=
 families in your communities.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how
 we can concretely show that we have your backs -- that it's not just lip s=
ervice, but we're actually doing something concrete.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That&#8217;s what today i=
s about.&nbsp; I could not be prouder of everything the American people hav=
e done and will continue to do through Joining Forces.&nbsp; More important=
ly, I think I speak for Joe Biden to say I could not
 be prouder of two people who are as smart and charismatic and committed an=
d dedicated -- what they&#8217;ve been able to accomplish with almost no bu=
dget, but just through sheer force of will and personality and commitment t=
o you is something that leaves me in awe.&nbsp;
 I am so proud of them.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Give it up for two champi=
ons for our troops and our veterans and our military families -- Michelle O=
bama and Jill Biden.&nbsp; (Applause.)
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DR. BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you =
to the Commander-in-Chief, President Obama, for that wonderful introduction=
.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, of course, I want to s=
ay thank you to my husband, Joe, the Vice President --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; He&#82=
17;s all right.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DR. BIDEN:&nbsp; -- for alw=
ays supporting and encouraging me to do as much as we can to show our milit=
ary families how much we appreciate them.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And tonight&#8217;s celebra=
tion wouldn&#8217;t have happened without the USO.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s give t=
he USO a big round of applause.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; For the past seven =
years, it&#8217;s been an honor to work with the USO on a number of issues =
affecting our troops,
 our veterans, and their families.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve done everything togeth=
er -- from stuffing care packages on Capitol Hill for women soldiers to hos=
ting barbecues for wounded warriors at the Vice President&#8217;s residence=
, to block parties with military families on bases
 in Hawaii, Germany, Japan, Italy, Singapore, and throughout the United Sta=
tes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everywhere we go, the USO i=
s there.&nbsp; I feel like I&#8217;ve seen your volunteers so often that th=
ey&#8217;ve really become like family.&nbsp; Just as you&#8217;ve been ther=
e for so many military families over the years, you&#8217;ve been there for=
 us every step
 of the way.&nbsp; You were there for my father during World War II.&nbsp; =
You were there for our son when he deployed to Iraq.&nbsp; And it was your =
work that inspired our work.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Your mission is one of th=
e reasons Michelle and I started Joining Forces in the first place -- to gi=
ve all Americans the opportunity to step up and show their support for our =
military and their families.&nbsp; You even
 helped Michelle and me launch our Joining Forces initiative with &#8220;Se=
same Street.&#8221;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So thank you for all the =
work that you continue to do and congratulations on the 75 years of incredi=
ble work that you do every single day for our warriors and their families a=
round the world.&nbsp; It&#8217;s making a difference
 in more lives than you will ever know.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To all of the military and =
their families here tonight, you are our heroes.&nbsp; Your selflessness an=
d sacrifice on behalf of our country is so inspiring.&nbsp; We can never do=
 enough to thank you for your service and we hope you have a little
 fun tonight.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now it&#8217;s my honor =
to introduce our country&#8217;s great supporter of our military and their =
families, my friend and Joining Forces partner, the First Lady of the Unite=
d States, Michelle Obama.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; All right=
, you guys!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; All right,=
 we&#8217;re going to get this party started but before we begin, I have to=
 thank my husband, Barack.&nbsp; (Applause.) Thanks to Joe and Jill.&nbsp; =
Thank you, J.D. and
 Jon and, most of all, thank all of you for joining us tonight.&nbsp; I hop=
e you all are good.&nbsp; We&#8217;re so excited.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just tell you, in or=
der to get four of us on a stage -- it&#8217;s really hard.&nbsp; (Laughter=
.)&nbsp; And we&#8217;re doing it because of you.&nbsp; We have cleared our=
 schedules, we made this happen because we all care and you mean so much to=
 us.&nbsp;
 We are so incredibly honored to be here with all of you to celebrate the f=
ifth anniversary of Joining Forces.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s =
been just five years.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make no mistake about it, J=
oining Forces is about one thing and one thing only:&nbsp; It&#8217;s about=
 you.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about rallying this country to honor, support, and t=
hank all of you -- (applause) -- our extraordinary servicemembers, our vete=
rans,
 and of course, those military families who are so near and dear to my hear=
t.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">You just have to understa=
nd, we know what you do for our country every single day because over the p=
ast five years, through Joining Forces, Jill and I, we&#8217;ve had the ple=
asure of traveling across America and around
 the world, as you&#8217;ve heard, to bases and schools, communities and ho=
spitals.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had the privilege of really getting to know so m=
any of you.&nbsp; The spouses who&#8217;ve endured those long deployments; =
all those difficult moves. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Our military kids who bra=
vely walk through the doors of yet another new school.&nbsp; The wounded wa=
rriors who tell us they would do it all again for the chance to serve their=
 country.&nbsp; The heroes -- that is all of you
 who make such extraordinary sacrifices to keep us safe.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me tell you, in ma=
ny ways you all have made our job with Joining Forces easy, because all we =
have to do is tell your stories.&nbsp; That&#8217;s really it.&nbsp; Becaus=
e when people hear about you, they want to step up.&nbsp; They want to expr=
ess
 their gratitude.&nbsp; They want to serve you as well as you&#8217;ve serv=
ed this country.&nbsp; You inspire people all across this country, and that=
 is absolutely true for Jill and for me.&nbsp; Getting to know all of you -=
- oh, you all just make us want to be better.&nbsp; You inspire
 us to be better mothers and spouses, better public servants, better citize=
ns, better human beings.&nbsp; You do that.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You inspire us to try every=
 day to use this platform, this light to serve and support everything you d=
o.&nbsp; The courage, the honor, the boundless love for this country -- tha=
t&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve come to know.&nbsp; And tonight, we just want yo=
u
 to know that serving you, doing this work with Joining Forces, of all the =
things that I have experienced -- we&#8217;ve experienced -- serving you ha=
s been one of the greatest privileges of our lives.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p><=
/o:p></p>

 we love you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So tonight, we want you all=
 to have some fun, all right?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Please have the time =
of your lives.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I hope there&#8217;s food or drink o=

 Soak this all

&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with that, I&#8217;m goi=
