CONVENTIONWATCH -- "GOP shuns electronic ballots at open convention: Republicans opt for tradition over tech to maximize drama for national audience," by Darren Samuelsohn: "[Senior party officials - worried about hacking and Internet reliability in the overcrowded Cleveland arena and eager to preserve the live television drama surrounding a drawn-out roll call - are ruling out a change to convention bylaws that would allow for electronic voting [and] will follow the old-fashioned, traditional practice in which each state delegation takes its alphabetical turn calling out its picks." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9cfae7a4480003edc635baf2693d094068d0b99f2c1b18014a9411bfdbf4a0b5 

TRUMP'S PLAN B, per AP's Julie Bykowicz: "Outside groups, including one led by ... Roger Stone, and a loose collection of colorful supporters such as 'Bikers for Trump' are organizing ahead of the July convention ... soliciting money to pay for their transportation and housing ... already trying to influence the mood of the convention with a social media campaign saying that anything short of a Trump nomination would be 'stealing.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9cfae7a4480003ed4a45fff78bcea0fccb0c62f88e7d3659d50fe45eafe2e12e

MONEY QUOTE - In a WSJ B1 story by Keach Hagey and Nick Niedzwiadek, "Election Race Lights a Fire Under CNN," CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker says: "I think it was a legitimate criticism of CNN that it was a little too liberal ... We have added many more middle-of-the-road conservative voices to an already strong stable of liberal voices. And I think that we are a much more-balanced network and, as a result, a much more inviting network to a segment of the audience that might not have otherwise been willing to come here." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9cfae7a4480003ed5eaca3f5c995c109cce61234ad73586f643b7db6066ba1b5

"OFF THE RESERVATION" - Nick Gass: Trump needles Clinton for telling CNN's Jake Tapper that she has "a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation." Critics slammed Clinton for insensitivity to Native Americans -- #OffTheReservation. Amanda Renteria, the campaign's national political director, tweeted that Clinton "meant no disrespect." Trump piles on with a "Crooked Hillary" tweet: "Actually, she has done poorly with such men!" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9cfae7a4480003ed55421f741e98dfd4355bf405782879daf2a22d062cad7ac8

JEFFREY TOOBIN in The New Yorker, "The Showman: How U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara struck fear into Wall Street and Albany": "It seems likely ... that he would welcome an offer to be the U.S. Attorney General in a Democratic Administration.

FIRST LADY MELANIA -- "The Model American: Melania Trump is the exception to her husband's nativist politics," by The New Yorker's Lauren Collins: "Melania will become the first foreign-born First Lady since Louisa Adams, though Louisa Adams doesn't really count, as her father was an American ... Like Donald, Melania doesn't drink. She never breaks ranks, not even with a teasing criticism. ... Melania is as imperial as her husband, if not more so ... positions herself as aspirational, playing ice queen rather than soccer mom. Not only does she never joke about her husband; she is entirely self-serious." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9cfae7a4480003ed31fb09e5b51b4d21d4ae270ddacd9777624056c617199019 

WEST WING ARRIVAL LOUNGE -- Carl Woog to the NSC - "After nearly six years at the Department of Defense, this month I am taking a new assignment at the White House working on the communications team for the National Security Council. I am excited about the opportunity to help the administration finish out the year strong and get to work everyday with so many great friends and professionals. Before I left the Pentagon, Secretary Carter had my family in for a farewell celebration. ... 

"I'm particularly grateful for Secretary Carter and his encouragement to think 'outside the five sided box' - as the cake said! I am extremely proud of all the initiatives we launched together from building bridges with Silicon Valley to opening up more opportunities for women and all to serve in our armed forces - and there's much more to come. It's been an extraordinary honor in every way to work alongside the military and see them do what they do best around the world. Thanks to all of you for helping keep us safe."

COMING ATTRACTIONS - Director Rob Reiner and Castle Rock Entertainment has a film in the works about the former Knight Ridder journos Warren Strobel, Jonathan Landay, John Walcott and Joe Galloway who wrote stories disputing the WMD intel pre-Iraq. The working title is "Shock and Awe." On a recent Sunday Strobel and his former colleagues met for about 7 hours at the Four Seasons in Georgetown to go over the script "page by page" with Reiner, his wife Michelle, financier Johnson Chan, and scriptwriter Joey Hartstone.

--BACKSTORY -- Warren told Playbook: "About 2 years ago, Rob Reiner actually called us and told us he's been wanting to do this movie for awhile and we've been working with him and a script writer for the last two years and things have really accelerated in the last few months. ... It tells the story of how me, Landay, Walcott and Joe Galloway challenged the Bush Administration's case for war. ... The movie very much tries to show the cost of what was Bush's decision. ... 

"The movie does have financing, the script has been written and is being tweaked and we have every indication that this project is going to go forward. ... There is no casting yet." Strobel says he never thought at that time that there could ever be a movie made about the reporting. "I think I speak for all four of us [that this] is surreal and surprising. ... We've talked a lot and joked a lot about who might play the four of us." He also hopes to go on set for at least part of the shooting.

--About the message of the film: "This has been cast often in the public sphere as an intelligence failure but I'm hoping the movie will make clear that it really wasn't an intelligence failure. That these people wanted to go to war long before the intelligence was clear one way or the other. We also hope that it serves as maybe what 'Spotlight' did to motivate young journalists and show what investigative journalism is like and how important it is."

MILESTONE -- "20 Years Later, Welfare Overhaul Resonates for Families and Candidates," by Clyde Haberman for NYT's Retro Report: "In a sense, this is a "Back to the Future' presidential campaign, with candidates revisiting a specific time in the past to explain - and often lament - where the country is today. ... One 'Back to the Future' issue from the '90s has received relatively scant attention, but the next president may have a hard time avoiding it, for it affects millions of Americans. It involves the welfare system, overhauled in 1996 by a Republican Congress and a Democratic president." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=9cfae7a4480003ed303d57414da27d026048a5d88031f89489875cbcacb0c69d

</b> Director Rob Reiner and Castle Rock Entertainment has a film in the works about the former Knight Ridder journos Warren Strobel, Jonathan Landay, John Walcott and Joe Galloway who wrote stories disputing the WMD intel pre-Iraq. The working title is &quot;Shock and Awe.&quot; On a recent Sunday Strobel and his former colleagues met for about 7 hours at the Four Seasons in Georgetown to go over the script &quot;page by page&quot; with Reiner, his wife Michelle, financier Johnson Chan, and scriptwriter Joey Hartstone.</p><p><b>--BACKSTORY -- Warren told Playbook:
</b> &quot;About 2 years ago, Rob Reiner actually called us and told us he's been wanting to do this movie for awhile and we've been working with him and a script writer for the last two years and things have really accelerated in the last few months. ... It tells the story of how me, Landay, Walcott and Joe Galloway challenged the Bush Administration's case for war. ... The movie very much tries to show the cost of what was Bush's decision. ... </p><p><b>&quot;The movie does have financing, 
</b>the script has been written and is being tweaked and we have every indication that this project is going to go forward. ... There is no casting yet.&quot; Strobel says he never thought at that time that there could ever be a movie made about the reporting. &quot;I think I speak for all four of us [that this] is surreal and surprising. ... We've talked a lot and joked a lot about who might play the four of us.&quot; He also hopes to go on set for at least part of the shooting.</p><p><b>--About the message of the film:
</b> &quot;This has been cast often in the public sphere as an intelligence failure but I'm hoping the movie will make clear that it really wasn't an intelligence failure. That these people wanted to go to war long before the intelligence was clear one way or the other. We also hope that it serves as maybe what 'Spotlight' did to motivate young journalists and show what investigative journalism is like and how important it is.&quot;</p><p><b>MILESTONE -- &quot;20 Years Later, Welfare Overhaul Resonates for Families and Candidates,&quot; by Clyde Haberman for NYT's Retro Report:
