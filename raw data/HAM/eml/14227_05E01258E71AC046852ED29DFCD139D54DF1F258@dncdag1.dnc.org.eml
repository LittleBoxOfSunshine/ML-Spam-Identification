Internal strife rocked the Alaska Democratic Party on Friday as it headed i=
nto its three-day state convention, with some members of the party that hea=
vily favor Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton protesting the convention by=
 planning an alternative event Saturday night.

=93Alaska voters are an independent people and they don=92t want to be told=
 what to do,=94 said Ed Cullinane, a member of the state central committee =
from an Anchorage House district.

Cullinane helped organize the protest to the convention, where Democrats on=
 Saturday will choose delegates to cast votes at the Democratic National Co=
nvention in Philadelphia in July.

Though Clinton appears poised for victory in the hard-fought race, Sanders =
supporters say he can still claim a win though it would take a surge of del=
egates.

The anti-convention event at the Egan Civic and Convention Center comes bec=
ause Florida congresswoman and Democratic National Committee chair Debbie W=
asserman Schultz plans to give the keynote speech at the convention in Anch=
orage Saturday, Cullinane said.

Alaskan Democrats gave Sanders 81.6 percent of their support in the March c=
aucus. Many believe Wasserman Schultz has limited debates and unfairly allo=
cated resources to give Clinton a boost, he said.

=93A lot of us feel that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has displayed very unethi=
cal behavior,=94 he said.

At the state convention on Friday afternoon at the UAA Student Union, durin=
g an opening day filled with discussions on matters such as Medicaid expans=
ion and climate change, supporters of both Sanders and Clinton said it was =
important for Alaska Democrats to unite as the national convention approach=
es.

=93We all need to be respectful and find common ground,=94 said Shauna Thor=
nton, a state delegate and =93Bernie fan=94 who hopes to be selected as a n=
ational delegate from Alaska on Saturday.

Thornton, who is running for a state House seat on the Kenai Peninsula, sai=
d she=92s not angry Wasserman Schultz is speaking.

=93She was asked to come over a year ago, so what do you do? So I=92ll atte=
nd and ask questions about her positions,=94 Thornton said.

Cullinane also launched a petition at MoveOn.org asking the Alaska party to=
 =93un-invite=94 Wasserman Schultz. It had 64 signatures Friday afternoon.

He said the anti-convention, which has no official name, will feature a tel=
econferenced appearance from Tim Canova, Schultz=92 Democratic primary oppo=
nent in Florida. Plans also include a prerecorded presentation by Jane Sand=
ers=92 and a dunk tank with political activist Ray Metcalfe in the wet seat=
. The event will be held in Summit Hall at the Egan, starting at 6:30 p.m.

Wasserman's speech is planned for 8 p.m. Saturday at the Dena'ina Civic and=
 Convention Center. She's also scheduled to attend a reception there at 6 p=
.m.

People need to put aside the =93divisiveness=94 said Jennifer Smith, a stat=
e convention delegate from a Juneau district who supports Clinton because s=
he=92s =93cool under fire=94 and well-versed on critical national issues.

=93If you want to have an alternative convention then fine, but if you real=
ly want to have change in the party structure you should directly address i=
t to (Wasserman Schultz), and not do it through protests,=94 she said.


Alaska Democratic Convention gets underway in Anchorage<http://www.ktva.com=
/alaska-democratic-convention-gets-underway-in-anchorage-925/>

By Lauren Maxwell<http://www.ktva.com/authors/lauren-maxwell/>, KTVA Alaska

At the State Democratic Convention in Anchorage, one of the big jobs party =
leaders have is to elect delegates to attend the national convention in Jul=
y, when the presidential nominee will be decided.

Back in March, candidate Bernie Sanders won the state=92s Democratic caucus=
 in a big way. All 16 of the state=92s regular delegates who will go the na=
tional convention in Philadelphia are pledged to vote for him. But the stat=
e also has four super delegates who can vote for whomever they want.

Casey Steinau is one of the super delegates. Steinau is the chairman of the=
 Alaska Democratic Party, but as a super delegate, she=92s undeclared.

=94I am the chairman of the party and I believe that it is my job to repres=
ent 100 percent of the Alaska Democrats and I take that roll very seriously=
,=94 Steinau said. =93I don=92t think my personal preferences should be inf=
luencing anyone.=94

But the idea that super delegates can vote for whomever they want doesn=92t=
 sit well with many Democrats.

=93I think there probably will be a resolution or a platform change or some=
thing coming out of this convention which says we don=92t necessarily agree=
 with this and we would ask the DNC to reassess it,=94 Steinau said.

Steinau said the resolution might ask to get rid of super delegates altoget=
her or require them to vote for the person who won the state caucus.

Meanwhile, Ddemocrats who support Hilary Clinton are also attending the con=
vention. Carolyn Lee with the Hilary for Alaska campaign said there are a l=
ot of people who like both candidates.

=93We are also getting a lot of Bernie supporters coming up and saying, =91=
I=92m going to be with Hilary in a couple of weeks but today I=92m with Ber=
nie,=92=94 Lee said.

Steinau said she was hopeful Alaska Democrats would support whichever candi=
date wins the Party=92s nomination.

=93They both bring so much to the table and at the end of the day when that=
 person is decided I know that we will come together as a united front.=94
