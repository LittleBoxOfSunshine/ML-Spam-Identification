le role model in everything she does, but especially as a mom to Sasha and =
Malia. So let=92s all make sure that her final White House Mother=92s Day i=

Friend --

Michelle Obama is seriously the best.

She fights every day to help keep America moving forward, she champions rig=
hts for girls across the country, and she never stops working to expand opp=
ortunity for every American family. Our First Lady wears a lot of hats but =
none is more important than her role as a mother.  So let=92s all do a some=
thing special to wish her a Happy Mother=92s Day.

Right now, take a moment to sign the card and wish Michelle Obama a happy M=
other=92s Day!

Thanks, NAME. The First Lady=92s going to love this.

All the best,
