True, but the Chair has been advised to not engage.

So we'll have to leave it alone.

Wondering if there's a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Ber=
nie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess.

Specifically, DWS had to call Bernie directly in order to get the campaign =
to do things because they'd either ignored or forgotten to something critic=
al.

She had to call Bernie after the data breach to make his staff to respond t=
o our concerns. Even then they didn't get back to us, which is why we had t=
o shut off their access in order to get them to finally let us know exactly=
 how they snooped around HFA's data.

Same was true with the standing committee appointments. They never got back=
 to us with their names (HFA and even O'Malley got there's in six weeks ear=
lier) for the committees. So, again, the chair had to call Bernie personall=
y for his staff to finally get us critical information. So, they gave us an=
 awful list just a few days before we had to make the announcements.

It's not a DNC conspiracy, it's because they never had their act together.
