At the invitation of the President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam T=
ran Dai Quang, President of the United States of America Barack Obama pai=

e two leaders, the United States and Vietnam adopted this Joint Statement=
.



Both sides noted with satisfaction the rapid, substantive, and comprehens=
ive growth of U.S.-Vietnam relations over the past year, guided by the U.=
S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership of 2013 and the Joint Vision Stateme=
nt issued during the historic visit to the United States by General Secre=
tary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam Nguyen Ph=
u Trong in July 2015.



The common interests of the United States and Vietnam continued to expand=

ing dialogue mechanisms; promoting economic growth thanks to enhanced tra=
de and investment relations; and deepening cooperation in education, scie=
nce and technology, health, security and national defense, people-to-peop=
le ties, human rights, humanitarian, and war legacy issues. The increasin=
gly enhanced U.S.-Vietnam relations have positively contributed to the jo=
int efforts of the international community in maintaining peace, stabilit=
y, cooperation, and respect for international law in the region, and buil=
ding a rules-based region. Together, we are addressing regional and globa=
l challenges, including climate change, sustainable development, global h=
ealth, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, peacekeeping, an=
d wildlife trafficking.=20



Toward that end, the two countries reaffirmed their obligations to observ=
