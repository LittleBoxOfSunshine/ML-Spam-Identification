THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release May 13, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20





1:24 P.M. EDT



 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Friday. Glad it's finally =
here. I do not have any announcements to begin, so we can go straight to =
your questions.=20



Kathleen, would you like to start?



Q Sure. Thank you. I'm going to start with the administration's letter on=
 transgender bathroom guidance for schools.



MR. EARNEST: I thought you might.



Q I thought I'd give you a chance to respond to Texas's  the lieutenant g=
overnor, Dan Patrick, who said that the letter -- he called the letter "b=
lackmail," and said that the administration is doing everything it can to=
 -- or he said it's going to divide the country and it has everything to =
do with keeping the federal government out of local issues.



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think this does underscore the risk of electing a ri=
ght-wing radio host to a statewide elected office. So let's just walk thr=
ough the facts here. The first is, this was guidance that was issued by t=
he Department of Education and the Department of Justice in response to r=
equests for information and guidance from school administrators across th=
e country.=20



Just last week, for example, the National Association of Secondary School=
 Principals put forward a specific formal request to the Department of Ed=
ucation about how to create the kind of respectful, inclusive environment=
 that school administrators across the country are seeking to maintain. T=
hese principals also are interested in making sure that they're acting co=
nsistent with the law. And they sought guidance because they're not inter=
ested in a political argument, they're actually interested in practical s=
uggestions about how they confront this challenge that they face every da=
y.



So let's just be clear about what's included in the guidance. The guidanc=
e does not add additional requirements to the applicable law. The guidanc=
e does not require any student to use shared facilities when schools make=
 alternate arrangements. But what the framework does provide is advice fo=
r how school administrators can protect the dignity and safety of every s=
tudent under their charge. And that advice includes practical, tangible, =
real-world suggestions to school administrators who have to deal with thi=
s issue. They can't rely on political arguments that are framed as a solu=
tion to a problem that nobody can prove exists. They actually have to dea=
l with the responsibility that they have to promote an inclusive, respect=
ful environment for all of their students.=20



And what the Department of Education has issued today is specific, tangib=
le, real-world advice and suggestions to school administrators across the=
 country about exactly they can do that.



Q But you wouldnt argue -- or it seems as though the administration is al=
so trying to paint this as a major civil rights issue, right? This isnt j=
ust a pragmatic sort of everyday guidance to schools. Attorney General Ly=
nch has compared this to racial segregation.



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think Attorney General Lynch was talking about a ver=
y specific enforcement action that the Department of Education announced =
-- or the Department of Justice announced with regard to a specific law t=
hat was passed by the state of North Carolina. In this instance, this is =
not an enforcement action. As I pointed out, this does not add any additi=
onal requirements to any school district or state under the applicable la=
w. This is in response to extensive requests for guidance and for informa=
tion and advice that have been put forward by school administrators and t=
eachers and, in some cases, even parents who are seeking practical soluti=
ons to this challenge.



And the challenge here is not to isolate anybody, it's not to discriminat=
e against anybody, it's not to make anybody unsafe -- it's actually to en=
sure that our schools are as inclusive and respectful and safe as they ca=
n possibly be. And that's why the guidance that we've put forward include=
s tangible, specific suggestions for how that can be achieved.=20



So let me just give you one example. There are some school districts acro=
ss the country that have sought to enhance the privacy of their students =
by making relatively minor changes to shared-use facilities. In some case=
s, that means just putting up curtains so that people have more privacy w=
hen they're changing their clothes or taking showers in what had previous=
ly been shared-use facilities. So that is something that benefits all stu=
dents, and that's what we're looking for -- solutions that protect the sa=
fety and dignity of every single student in the school.



Q And if schools individually decide not to follow this guidance, there i=
snt a threat that they could lose federal funding --



MR. EARNEST: Well, if there are schools -- first of all, let me just stat=
e that it is my strongly held belief -- and I'm pretty sure I'm going to =
be right about this -- that the vast majority of schools and school distr=
icts and school administrators across the country will welcome this guida=
nce and will implement it. For those that dont, there's an established pr=
ocess for them to raise any concerns that they may have. And there's an e=
stablished process for that, and we'll go through it. But the vast majori=
ty of schools and school administrators will incorporate this advice as t=
hey confront the challenge of ensuring that they're promoting the kind of=
 respectful, safe learning environment that can ensure the success of all=
 of their students.



Q Okay, and I'm going to just switch topics. Chairman Rogers is saying he=
's put together a Zika measure -- and he didnt put a dollar figure amount=
, but it's safe to say it's going to be well under what you all have aske=
d, even under the Senate, of $1.1 trillion [sic]. So are you willing to a=
ccept $1.1 trillion? Is that enough money to fight Zika?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I havent seen the details related to Chairman =
Rogers's proposal. I think what I would encourage him to do before he put=
s it forward -- I dont know if he has yet -- but if he hasnt, if there's =
still time, he should consult with the public health professionals that t=
he administration talked to in putting forward our funding request for wh=
at is necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people =
from the Zika virus. Time's a-wastin'. And you saw that from the graphic =
that we presented in the briefing earlier this week. As the weather warms=
 up, as the mosquito population grows, the risk to pregnant women and the=
ir babies all across the country grows.=20



And so it's long past time for people like Chairman Rogers, who's got a s=
ubstantial responsibility here -- he's the Chairman of the House Appropri=
ations Committee -- when our public health professionals say that they ne=
ed resources to protect the American people, they're looking exactly at C=
hairman Rogers to see exactly what he's doing. And here we are, three mon=
ths after the administration has put forward our proposal, that he comes =
forward with a much smaller one that is inconsistent with the recommendat=
ions of our public health professionals. It's also inconsistent of the re=
quest that was put forward by Democratic and Republican governors from ac=
ross the country who said that they needed urgent congressional action to=
 provide the necessary resources to keep the American people safe.



 So before that proposal is put forward, I would encourage the Chairman t=
o consult with governors who are responsible for the safety of the citize=
ns of their state and the public health professionals who have taken a lo=
ok at this, and understand exactly what can be done and what should be do=
ne to ensure the safety and security of the American people, and particul=
arly pregnant women and their babies.



 Roberta.



 Q Hezbollahs top military commander has been killed, and I'm wondering, =
does the administration have any understanding of who was responsible for=
 that, and any comment on what impact this may have on the group?



 MR. EARNEST: I've certainly seen reports that Mustafa Badreddine was kil=
led this week in Syria. And we noted the fact that preparations are under=
way for his funeral. Badreddine was Hezbollahs top military commander. In=
 June of 2011, a special tribunal for Lebanon charged him with the 2005 a=
ttack that killed former Prime Minister Hariri. In September of 2012, the=
 United States imposed sanctions against Hezbollah leaders, including Bed=
reddine, in part to expose Hezbollahs support for the Assad regime and it=
s role in conducting indiscriminate terrorist attacks in Syria and Lebano=
n.



 We've noted that the Syrian regime and Hezbollah have a long military al=
liance, and Hezbollah leaders have previously sought safe haven in Syria =
and have even routed weapons from Iran into Lebanon. So the interplay bet=
ween the Assad regime and Hezbollah has been well chronicled.=20



 So we've seen the reports of his death. I can't independently confirm th=
em. And I guess the thing that I can confirm is that there were no U.S. o=
r coalition aircraft in the area where he was reported to be killed. But =
I can't further confirm the reports.



 Q Can you speak to what impact the U.S. feels this will have on the grou=
p and its activities?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we know that the Assad regime relied heavily on Hezbo=
llah for military support in the ongoing chaos inside of Syria. The Assad=
 regime, and President Assad himself, has personally benefitted from the =
activities that Hezbollah has carried out, so it's hard for me to draw an=
y firm conclusions about what operational impact this would have. But obv=
iously the concerns that we've previously expressed about Hezbollah I thi=
nk are consistent with our ongoing efforts to reduce the violence inside =
of Syria and get all of the parties, including the Assad regime, to abide=
 by the ceasefire. Those are our priorities because we want to try to bri=
ng about a political solution to the chaos inside of Syria.



 Q On the school bathroom issue, how concerned is the administration abou=
t the legal challenges? The Texas attorney general is saying that this ov=
ersteps the administrations constitutional authority. And can you speak t=
o -- I mean, you said very clearly to Kathleen that you expect the vast m=
ajority of schools will implement the guidance. But for those that don't,=
 what happens with them? Is the administration actively going to follow u=
p with them and punish them in some way?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, theres an established process for schools and the Dep=
artment of Education to discuss guidance that theyve been provided. I jus=
t want to reiterate -- and this is important for people who are intereste=
d in the legal aspect of this -- theres no additional requirement under t=
he applicable law thats being imposed on schools. Theres just not, despit=
e the claims of political opponents of the administration.=20



There is a strong desire on the part of some politicians to try and score=
 some cheap political points by presenting a solution to a problem that t=
hey can't prove exists. And what the administration has tried to do is to=
 provide, at the request of school administrators, practical, real-world =
advice they can use in their school communities to address this challenge=
. That's the practical offering that we have put forward here.



It's a lot different than the argument that others are making. For exampl=
e, is the Texas attorney general suggesting somehow that it would be prac=
tical to station a law enforcement officer outside of every public bathro=
om in an educational facility and check peoples birth certificates on the=
 way in? That doesnt sound like a practical application to me. It also do=
esnt sound like small government to me. It certainly sounds like a govern=
ment intrusion to me. But, again, thats whats hard to sift through in all=
 of this. What exactly is the practical argument or suggestion that theyr=
e making?



 I recognize that theyve got some sharp political arguments that were hon=
ed over years of morning drive-time radio in Houston, but school administ=
rators dont have the benefit of just talking. They actually have a functi=
onal responsibility to protect the safety and dignity of every student at=
 their school. And the vast majority of school administrators take that r=
esponsibility quite seriously. And I think well welcome and implement the=
 guidance thats been issued by the Department of Education today.



 Well move around. Gregory.



 Q A lot of times when a guidance or regulation or directive comes from a=
 federal agency, its portrayed as a White House action. Could you address=
 what this transgender bathroom issue -- did this come from the White Hou=
se? Was the White House consulted? How unitary is the unitary executive o=
n things like this? I guess what Im asking is, is the White House and the=
 Obama administration synonymous, for all intents and purposes, to --



 MR. EARNEST: Putting forward guidance like this is the responsibility of=
 the Department of Education. And they have to consider a broad range of =
policy implications for schools all across the country. So this is the re=
sponsibility of the Department of Education, but you would expect the Whi=
te House to be responsible for coordinating policy decisions that are mad=
e by agencies.=20



 So of course the White House was aware of the policy deliberations that =
have been underway at the Department of Education for quite some time, bu=
t ultimately this is the responsibility and the function of the Departmen=
t of Education, and they are the ones who received requests from schools =
all across the country, and they are the ones who are putting forward gui=
dance for how schools can deal with this particular situation.



 Ron.



 Q What is the rationale that the administration has come to, to base thi=
s guidance on Title IX, just to be clear about that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Im happy to be overruled by an attorney at the Depart=
ment of Justice or the Department of Education that you can consult after=
 this hearing -- or after this briefing, but let me try.=20



My understanding is that Title IX applies specifically to preventing sex =
discrimination in educational institutions. And the idea that individuals=
 are discriminated against because of their gender identity is the basis =
for the guidance that were putting forward. Nobody should be discriminate=
d against because of who they are. And our suggestion is that the rules s=
hould apply to everybody equally, and thats the basis of this guidance --=
 that every student should have access to facilities that every other stu=
dent has access to. No one should be discriminated against because of who=
 they are. And thats the basis for this guidance.



 Thats also why we say no student is forced to use shared facilities. And=
 if there are alternate facilities available, that are made available by =
administrators, then every student should have access to those as well.



 Q But why shouldnt local communities be making these very intimate decis=
ions? How does the federal government know whats best in so many differen=
t communities where there are different cultural sensitivities? Why is th=
is not a local matter?



 MR. EARNEST: It is a local matter. That is exactly the position of the O=
bama administration.



 Q But why is the federal government involved?



 MR. EARNEST: The federal government is providing specific suggestions ba=
sed on examples that weve collected from across the country. And the guid=
ance is presented -- it is not an additional requirement under the applic=
able law. It doesnt provide any obligation to a student, for example, to =
use a shared facility. Rather, what it does is we have consulted with sch=
ools all across the country and surfaced good suggestions, good examples =
-- in some cases, even best practices -- for addressing this situation. T=
hats the essence of guidance thats at the essence of the coordinating rol=
e that the Department of Education plays. At the same time, Ron, theres a=
 long history in our country of the federal government playing a very imp=
ortant role in ensuring that people arent discriminated against.



 Q With regard to the health care law and the new rule, whats different? =
How does this apply to the transgender community specifically now? Whats =
different?



 MR. EARNEST: So this is a good example of what I was just talking about.=
 There is a new rule that is part of the Affordable Care Act, or the impl=
ementation of the Affordable Care Act, that prohibits discrimination base=
d on race, color, national origin, sex, gender identity, age or disabilit=
y, and it ensures that individuals with limited English proficiency can a=
ccess language assistance when theyre seeking health care.



 Again, a basic responsibility of the federal government -- and this has =
been true throughout our nations history -- is ensuring that people arent=
 discriminated against. And thats particularly true when it comes to heal=
th care as well. And thats true of any potential sex discrimination, but =
that also is relevant to discrimination that could be targeted at people =
because of their race, because of a perceived disability, because somebod=
y is pregnant, because somebody doesnt speak English very well. We believ=
e people should be treated the same and afforded the same kind of opportu=
nities, regardless of these specific individual characteristics.



 Q Isnt the mention of transgender patients -- isnt that specific? Isnt t=
hat new? Isnt that different?



 MR. EARNEST: All of what Ive laid out is a new part of the rule thats be=
en issued today.



 Q What was the harm, in terms of the transgender community? Was there so=
me identifiable problem out there that required this clarification or thi=
s augmentation to the rule?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, Ron, this is much broader than just applying t=
o the transgender community. But the transgender community is included. I=
n the same way that we want to prevent discrimination against pregnant wo=
men, we want to make sure that were preventing discrimination against tra=
nsgendered women. In the same way that were preventing discrimination aga=
inst people who dont speak English very well or people who have a specifi=
c disability, we want to make sure that transgendered men are not discrim=
inated against either.



 Q Specifically because theres some concern in that community about acces=
s to transition drugs and medications and services, was that something th=
at the administration was concerned about in terms of trying to, I guess =
you could say, refine this rule?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess in terms of the way that it has an impact on =
individual health care decisions, Id refer you to Health and Human Servic=
es for answering that question. But, look, the idea behind this specific =
rule is to prevent discrimination against a wide range of groups.



 Q One other area. There are these reports about immigration raids that a=
re supposedly happening during May. Youve heard even Secretary Clinton an=
d Senator Sanders comment on this. Theres the belief that the administrat=
ion is going to conduct huge raids during May and June, rallying up signi=
ficant numbers of women and children, recent people who have crossed the =
country in significant numbers. Is that true? Is there something differen=
t happening now?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, this is an excellent question. Were talking about a D=
HS enforcement action, so there are some limitations about what I can say=
, but let me help you understand exactly the policy that DHS is implement=
ing. And I think I can largely answer your question.=20



The first is -- and this is something that Secretary Johnson himself has =
said -- that the operations that are underway are merely the continuation=
 of operations that were announced in January and in March. And those ope=
rations are conducted under the rubric of the guidance that President Oba=
ma and Secretary Johnson put in place in November of 2014. And that is gu=
idance that made a priority of individuals who are convicted criminals or=
 otherwise a threat to public safety, or individuals who were apprehended=
 after crossing the border after January 1st of 2014.=20



 So weve made clear that our priorities are people who pose a threat to t=
he community, people who are convicted criminals, or people who have only=
 recently crossed the border. So those priorities remain in place, and th=
ose priorities are followed even as these operations continue.



 Let me say two more things. The first is, no one is removed if they have=
 an ongoing, pending claim or appeal for asylum or some other form of hum=
anitarian relief. People are given access to due process. And that is a f=
oundational principle for all of this. So the only people who are the tar=
gets of these operations are people who are subject to an order by an imm=
igration court for removal and people who have also, in addition to being=
 subject to that order, have exhausted any potential claims that they hav=
e for humanitarian relief.



 The last thing is DHS enforcement agents also follow what I understand i=
s to be longstanding guidance that ensures that these operations are not =
conducted in sensitive places. These operations are not conducted in scho=
ols or hospitals or places of worship, for example.



 Q So is there no reason to fear that the numbers of deportations aren't =
going to increase or spike -- whatever words you want to use now -- becau=
se theres something, a specific operation underway thats different from w=
hats normally happening there along the border?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, what Secretary Johnson has described is that t=
he operations that are underway now are a continuation of operations that=
 were previously announced.



 But look, I think we would anticipate that the deportation numbers would=
 continue to go up. This administration is serious about enforcing the la=
w. And I recognize that our political opponents don't like to acknowledge=
 that fact. But we've made clear how we're going to use law enforcement r=
esources to enhance or border security and to enhance the security of com=
munities across the country. Most importantly, we're going to enforce our=
 laws.=20



 And this is something that President Obama is committed to. And the trut=
h is, we would have a whole lot more resources to do exactly that if Repu=
blicans in the House of Representatives had not blocked comprehensive imm=
igration reform legislation that did include an historic investment in ou=
r border security. But we do not enjoy the benefits of that border securi=
ty today because House Republicans blocked the passage of that legislatio=
n.=20



 Q And just lastly, its not your political opponents -- well, some of the=
 people who are objecting to this or raising concerns about this are Secr=
etary Clinton and Senator Sanders, who I wouldnt think youd consider poli=
tical opponents.



 MR. EARNEST: No, but its our political opponents who suggest that Presid=
ent Obama is not interested in enforcing the law. And I think that is dem=
onstrably false. That's that point that Im making. That's the reason that=
 we're having this conversation right now.



 Anita. Oh, Leslie, Im sorry. Im sorry.



 Q That's okay. She was here yesterday.



 MR. EARNEST: She was. Its nice to see you, Leslie.



 Q That's fine, thanks. I had a couple questions on the gender guidelines=
 you sent out last night. Given that North Carolinas House Bill 2, that's=
 sort of part of this, is headed to the courts, why did the White House f=
eel the need to put out this directive to the law?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, this is a directive that is responsive to requests th=
at we've received all across the country from school administrators and t=
eachers and parents and others. So this is not a response to the ongoing =
legal dispute related to HB2. This is a response to requests that the Dep=
artment of Education has received from teachers and administrators all ac=
ross the country.



 Q But youve cautioned before about being careful of not putting your fin=
ger on the scale. Doesn't this sort of suggest that you're putting the Wh=
ite Houses finger on the scale?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we've been quite clear about the need to keep enforce=
ment actions separate from any sort of political interference. This is no=
t an enforcement action. This is a policy decision that was made by the D=
epartment of Education. And, yes, the White House was appropriately invol=
ved in coordinating that policy decision. But ultimately its the responsi=
bility of the Department of Education to make this policy decision and to=
 communicate it to the schools and administrators all across the country.=




 Notably, its not an enforcement action. It does not add a requirement to=
 the applicable law. And it doesn't pose any requirements on students for=
 the use of shared facilities.



 Q One of the other questions I had for you. You mentioned -- you were as=
ked about the lieutenant governors comments on it, and you said that it r=
uns the risk -- or it underscores the risk of electing a right-wing radio=
 host.



 MR. EARNEST: To statewide office, yes.



 Q Yes, to statewide office. Yes.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Yes. (Laughter.)=20



 Q Given that the White House last year when the Supreme Court ruled on s=
ame-sex marriage, the White House put the lights out on the fountain, how=
 much of this was a political consideration in doing these guidelines?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think as I pointed out before, the guidelines conta=
in practical advice and suggestions for school administrators across the =
country that have to deal with this challenge inside their communities. T=
hey dont have the luxury of relying on political arguments that are an at=
tempt to try to score some political points that propose to address a sol=
ution to a problem that doesnt actually exist. These are school administr=
ators who are trying to do the right thing. They're trying to promote an =
atmosphere of dignity and security for the students and their schools. An=
d so what the Department of Education has put forward are practical sugge=
stions for how exactly they can do that consistent with civil rights law.=
=20



Q And the White House is not looking to score any political points on it,=
 even though it's been hailed by a number of organizations as a new front=
ier in same-sex law?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not surprised to hear that there are people who ag=
ree that we shouldnt discriminate against people because of who they are.=
 I think most Americans agree with that notion. So that's part of why I a=
nticipate that school administrators across the country would welcome thi=
s guidance.



Look, I'll also say, I think school administrators across the country who=
 dont agree with the politics of this administration will also welcome th=
ese suggestions, because they recognize that they have a challenge that t=
hey have to deal with and that, frankly, they dont have the luxury of eng=
aging in a partisan political argument with a right-wing radio host. In f=
act, what they have to do is they have to provide for the safety and dign=
ity of the students who are under their care. And that's exactly what thi=
s guidance does, is it gives them some useful tools for considering a ran=
ge of options that they can use to do exactly that.



So this has very little to do with politics, except for our critics who w=
ant to make this entirely about politics. This administration is interest=
ed in providing workable, practical solutions to school administrators wh=
o are trying to provide for the safety and dignity of the students under =
their care.



Thanks, Leslie. Mark.



Q Josh, is it the intention of the administration that the guidance lette=
r be seen as a threat to deny federal funds to school districts that dont=
 comply with the policy decisions as interpreted by DOE and DOJ?



MR. EARNEST: No, they should not view it that way. They should view this =
as guidance, as specific suggestions and a framework for dealing with a v=
ery straightforward challenge: How do school administrators, all across t=
he country, ensure that they're protecting both the safety and dignity of=
 every single student at the school. It's as simple as that. And what the=
 Department of Education has done is they've drawn on their own internal =
expertise, and they've drawn on the creative solutions that have been imp=
lemented by school administrators all across the country to put all that =
good information in one place and provide some practical advice to school=
 administrators who are trying to solve this problem. And that's a good t=
hing.



I think what is true, what is undeniably true is the foundation of this g=
uidance is the principle that people shouldnt be discriminated against ju=
st because of who they are. And school administrators dont have a glamoro=
us job. These are individuals who, I think in most cases, feel quite pass=
ionate about their work. They view their work as a calling. They're looki=
ng to prepare the next generation of Americans to succeed. And they want =
to create a learning environment where every student can feel safe, where=
 every student can feel included, where every student can feel respected.=
 That's what the vast majority of school administrators are interested in=
, and that's why I think the vast majority of school administrators are g=
oing to use this guidance, they're going to carefully consider the sugges=
tions that have been put forward by the Department of Education, and they=
're going to put forward a solution that works in their community. That's=
 the way this should work.



Q Could you see how some might see the guidance letter as an implied thre=
at of loss of federal funds, being that you mentioned that under the prov=
isions of Title IX, schools that receive federal funds are obligated to c=
omply with the provisions that are stated forth in the guidance letter?



MR. EARNEST: Look, there is a desire in the guidance to be as clear as po=
ssible about why this guidance is being issued. But look, it's quite clea=
r what we're interested in here. The Department of Education is intereste=
d in providing guidance and suggestions to school administrators who are =
trying to do the right thing. And that right thing is to prevent people f=
rom being discriminated against, but also make sure that every single stu=
dent in their school has their safety and their dignity protected.



Q On another issue -- do you have any further guidance on the WASPs legis=
lation?



MR. EARNEST: I do not. This is the bill about the --



Q Women Airforce Service Pilots.



MR. EARNEST: Yes, the World War II women Airforce veterans -- pilots. I d=
o not believe that we have received that from Congress yet. I dont know i=
f we've got an update on that. But we'll be tracking that, and we'll keep=
 you posted on that status. But the President does intend to sign it.



Q Right. And you said yesterday. Do you know why the President could not =
have, as Commander-in-Chief, directed the Army to allow a burial for thes=
e women at Arlington without legislation?



MR. EARNEST: I dont know exactly how the law works. I dont know if his au=
thority as Commander-in-Chief could have been used for that purpose. But =
we certainly welcomed the bipartisan legislation from Congress that would=
 make the use of that -- or the exercise of that authority unnecessary, b=
ecause Congress has passed a law making it possible.



Chris.



Q Thanks. Everyone is in my business today.=20



MR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?



Q Everyone is in my business today. (Laughter.)=20



MR. EARNEST: I know, man. (Laughter.) You got to elbow those people out.=20=




Q Yesterday, you said that there was a determination, as a result of mult=
iagency review, that there would be no loss of federal funds at this time=
 to North Carolina as a result of possible suit. But at the same time, th=
is guidance on transgender students is issued. Isnt that sending a mixed =
message?



MR. EARNEST: Well, no, I dont think it's a mixed message. I think it's im=
portant for people to understand what's happening here. This guidance tha=
t was put forward by the Department of Education does not impose any new =
requirements under the applicable law. It's guidance that's issued to sch=
ool administrators in school districts all across the country.



The conversation that we've been having over the course of this week has =
largely been centered on the state of North Carolina and what impact thei=
r law could have on their compliance with the Civil Rights Act. So it was=
 related to a specific piece of legislation that was passed almost litera=
lly in the dark of night by the legislation that convened a one-day speci=
al session to pass this bill. It was signed the same day by the governor.=
 And the rebuke from business leaders in North Carolina and business lead=
ers who are contemplating doing business in North Carolina has been force=
ful. And I think it's an indication that the legislation that was passed =
by the state legislature was much more -- was much broader than just some=
thing that would apply in an educational setting.



So the situations are quite different. I think they do illustrate how con=
sistent and forceful this administration has been about fighting against =
the idea that people could be discriminated against because of who they a=
re. That's a principle the President does feel strongly about. It's obvio=
usly a principle that Attorney General Lynch spoke movingly about. And pr=
eventing discrimination and treating people fairly is a core principle th=
at does guide a lot of the policy that's made by the Obama administration=
. But the enforcement action that was announced by the Attorney General t=
his week was enforcement action that was the decision of attorneys at the=
 Department of Justice. That decision was not influenced by White House o=
fficials. The notification that was distributed by the Department of Educ=
ation today is not an enforcement action; it was a policy decision that d=
id include some White House involvement, but was the realm and responsibi=
lity of the Department of Education.

 Q But nonetheless, given that the major component of House Bill 2 is tha=
t transgender students in North Carolina are prohibited from using the re=
stroom consistent with their gender identity, doesnt that necessarily mea=
n that even if schools not to follow this guidance that the Department of=
 Education has put out, that they will not suffer a loss of federal funds=
?



MR. EARNEST: Well, what this says is -- well, the way this works is that =
if there are schools -- and I think they will be in the minority -- but i=
f there are schools across the country that do come forward and indicate =
that they do not intend to be in compliance with this guidance, then ther=
e is an established process for litigating those differences with the Dep=
artment of Education. So there's an established process for this. We dont=
 have to invent one.



Q And was it planned to make the announcement that there would be no loss=
 of federal funds for North Carolina at this time, in conjunction with th=
e announcement from the Department of Education and Justice for this guid=
ance for transgender students? Was that coincidental?



MR. EARNEST: No, these were separate actions. So, again, as it relates to=
 North Carolina in consideration of HB2, the policy decision that was mad=
e, even as agencies were considering whether or not the passage and imple=
mentation of HB2 would put a range of federally funded programs at risk i=
n the state of North Carolina, the decision that was made was to not with=
hold any funding until the enforcement action that was announced by the D=
epartment of Justice had made its way through the courts. So that was a v=
ery specific thing, and that was a response to developments that occurred=
 this week with regard to the situation in North Carolina.



This guidance is guidance that has been in the works for years, but it is=
 guidance that is broadly consistent with the kinds of principles that th=
is President and this administration has long fought for.



Q One last question. Even after you said yesterday, with regard to HB2, t=
hat there would be no loss of federal funds to the state as the enforceme=
nt action is ongoing in the courts, a Department of Education spokesperso=
n said the review there is ongoing. Do you know why the spokesperson woul=
d have said that?



MR. EARNEST: I dont. But this is a little complicated, so it may have jus=
t been a bit of a miscommunication. But as it relates specifically to HB2=
, no federal agencies will be making a decision to withhold funding as a =
result of HB2 until the DOJ enforcement process has worked its way throug=
h the courts.



Margaret.



Q Josh, is this the extent of guidance like this? Or do you foresee simil=
ar directives to come from the administration?

MR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any other -- I mean, when you say "li=
ke this," you mean guidance that could have an impact on --



Q Well, you said that you had received inquiries from the educational com=
munity, that you're responding to it. Have you received inquiries from ot=
her industries, companies, elsewhere, also demanding this kind of clarity=
 on how they should be treating transgender people?



MR. EARNEST: It's certainly possible. I'm not aware of any guidance that'=
s likely to attract the amount of interest that this one has.



Q I'm going to go back to an idea you were talking about here with Kathle=
en. Can you just clarify: Does the President see this as a clear-cut civi=
l rights issue?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think there obviously is a question of civil rights =
here. And there is a question of how can we ensure that the civil rights =
of every student is protected. There's also a question of how do we ensur=
e that the dignity and safety of every student is protected. And the guid=
ance that we have put forward would do both. And again, I think that's wh=
y we're going to see a lot of school administrators come forward and anno=
unce their intent to implement this guidance, or they're going just going=
 to implement the guidance without announcing it. Or, like many school ad=
ministrators, they're already doing this kind of work to ensure the safet=
y and dignity of every student at the school.=20



And this is the thing that I was mentioning before. This is something tha=
t over the last week or two has been a pretty loud part of the political =
debate. But this is something that school administrators all across the c=
ountry have been dealing with for quite some time. So they dont have the =
luxury of falling back on talking points. They've got to implement practi=
cal, real-world solutions that make a difference when it comes to the saf=
ety and dignity of students at their school. Posting a law enforcement of=
ficer outside of every bathroom, and checking the birth certificate of pe=
ople who are walking through the door -- that's not a practical solution.=
 That's not going to enhance anybodys safety. It's not going to enhance a=
nybodys dignity. That's impractical. It's rooted in a political argument =
that has very little grounding in actual facts.



 So I recognize that that is sort of something that politicians frequentl=
y do, which is make arguments that may sound good politically just to sco=
re some political points. But to do that at the expense of students all a=
cross the country is something I don't think that they should do.



 Q And the question of civil rights, I mean, are you parsing here that it=
's not a civil rights issue? I mean, is this because the courts still hav=
en't ruled on whether there is protection under the law of transgender pe=
rsons as a protected class, as an extension of sex discrimination?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think whats undeniable is this is an issue where ca=
se law is still being built up. But, look, I think the reading of this gu=
idance I think is pretty common-sense. You can't discriminate against peo=
ple because of their gender identity. You can't force people with a speci=
fic gender identity to use a different facility. That's discriminating ag=
ainst them.



 What we should do is we should treat every student the same. We should p=
rotect every students safety. We should protect every students dignity. W=
e should give every student access to individual-use facilities if that's=
 what they prefer and theyre available. That's the cornerstone here of ou=
r argument.



 Q You're saying the case law is still being built up, but you're not goi=
ng so far as to say that this is on shaky legal ground because we still h=
aven't seen the federal protection?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't mean to telegraph any lack of confidence in the leg=
al conclusion that's been reached here. The law is clear. And I think it =
should be notable that it's not just the Department of Education that sig=
ned on to this, but the Department of Justice has too.=20



 The point that I'm trying to make, Margaret, is that this is something t=
hat is relatively new. This is a relatively new policy consideration that=
 school administrators are having to make. This is a relatively new eleme=
nt of our political debate.



 I was thinking about Chris earlier today because there was some discussi=
on about whether or not the word transgender had ever been uttered from t=
he White House podium before. And I think that's a pretty apt illustratio=
n of how this debate is changing and has emerged. So it's new to our poli=
tical debate, but this is not new when you consider what school administr=
ators have had to do to ensure the safety and security of every student a=
t their school. This is something that they have to deal with every day. =
And that's why most of them don't have a lot of tolerance for a bunch of =
cheap political rhetoric. Theyre looking for solutions. And solutions are=
 exactly what were provided by the Department of Education in their lette=
r today.



 Rich.



 Q Thanks, Josh. You're saying that this is a problem that school adminis=
trators are dealing with, but then it was also a problem that didnt exist=
 until it entered this political realm. How long has the administration b=
een getting questions about this? And did the North Carolina law prompt t=
his guidance or speed its timeline?



 MR. EARNEST: It did not. This is guidance that had been in the works for=
 years. This is relatively new to our political debate, but again, this i=
s something that has been the source of questions that the Department of =
Education has received for a number of years now. And again, those questi=
ons to the Department of Education were not rooted in the desire of a hig=
h school principal to make a political argument. It was rooted in the des=
ire of a high school principal to get some advice and to rely on the expe=
rts at the Department of Education to help him or her ensure the safety a=
nd dignity of every single student at their school. That's what these pri=
ncipals are looking for.



 Look, in most cases, principals aren't making a whole lot of money. It's=
 not a glamorous job. But they do it because they care deeply about our c=
hildren. They care deeply about providing a good, quality education to ou=
r kids. They care deeply about the future of this country. They care deep=
ly about ensuring that a learning environment that they are responsible f=
or managing is one that's respectful, that's inclusive, and that is safe.=
 And that's the kind of guidance that they were seeking from the Departme=
nt of Education about how best to accomplish those goals.



 Q Doesnt the administration think, though, or acknowledge at least, that=
 there still is a very difficult process here? For example, the guidance =
says that when a student or the students parent or guardian, as appropria=
te, notifies the administration that the student will assert a gender ide=
ntity that differs from their previous representations, the school will b=
egin treating that student consistent with the gender identity. And then =
it goes on to say the gender transition can happen swiftly or over a long=
 duration of time. If a principal is sitting in front of a student, there=
 could be questions of clarity, sincerity. These are all things that are =
still not answered and out there, right?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think this goes to Rons question. We acknowledge --=
 and, in fact, this is what should happen: School administrators do have =
to make decisions about the best way to protect the dignity and safety of=
 the students at their school. And, yes, these are complicated issues, an=
d that's setting aside even the kinds of arrangements that might be avail=
able to a school administrator. And so many of our schools are so wildly =
underfunded, right? So you face this question about are we going to build=
 a new bathroom, or are we going to provide up-to-date textbooks in our s=
cience classrooms. These are practical questions that administrators are =
going to have to answer for themselves.=20



 That's why it would not be wise for the federal government to be imposin=
g a solution or adding an additional requirement under the law. That's, i=
n fact, why we have not done that, because we believe in the value and th=
e importance of local control of schools. So we want schools and we want =
school administrators to be reaching the kinds of conclusions and the kin=
ds of solutions that are in the best interests of that community and that=
 are in the best interests of the students who attend that school.



 So that's also why youve seen the U.S. Department of Education draw upon=
 solutions that have been implemented by schools all across the country a=
nd surfacing those good ideas and sharing them with other school administ=
rators that are trying to solve the same problem. That's a pretty high-fu=
nctioning U.S. Department of Education providing a valuable service to sc=
hool administrators all across the country that are simply just trying to=
 provide a safe and inclusive learning environment for their kids.



 Q Lastly, the administration has come out very strongly on these issues,=
 with the action against North Carolina, with its guidance today. And tho=
se are domestic issues. Internationally, the United States still has rela=
tionships with and gives aid to countries that puts LGBT people behind ba=
rs, charges them and executes them. Is the U.S. going to exert its influe=
nce internationally on this?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Rich, I would tell you that we do. The President stro=
ngly advocates for the rights of all people when he travels around the wo=
rld. And we certainly have made direct statements -- let me say it this w=
ay. The President has been crystal-clear both in public settings, but als=
o in private settings, in his conversations with world leaders about our =
expectation and the priority that we place in this country on human right=
s.



 Q So we threaten funding?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think that that has been a question that has been d=
iscussed in a number of other settings about whether or not significant h=
uman rights violations undermine the relationship that the United States =
has with other countries, or in some cases, could even interrupt funding =
that is provided by the United States to other countries.



 There was an amusing situation a couple of years ago where there were qu=
estions about whether or not the United States was going to interrupt the=
 federal aid that we provide to Egypt in the aftermath of a crackdown on =
political dissidents there. Now, that situation is not funny, but it did =
provoke an amusing response here as I tried to describe the way that fund=
ing is provided to individual countries and tranches, and so some people =
had some fun with that.



 But it underscores that this is a policy priority of the President when =
he travels around the world. Ive sat in rooms where the President is talk=
ing to world leaders, and the President of the United States respectfully=
 but directly raises concerns about the treatment of minorities in their =
countries, including the rights of gays and lesbians, and the rights of p=
olitical dissidents, the rights of women, the rights of journalists. And,=
 look, as a country, these are values that we are deeply invested in and =
we use our influence around the world to try to advance those values. And=
 the President makes that case rather forcefully, both in public and in p=
rivate, on American soil and when hes abroad.



 Q Quickly on the guidance. Do you expect lawsuits?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, what I expect is that the vast majority of sch=
ool administrators are going to take a look at this guidance and figure o=
ut a way to implement it in their schools.



 Kenneth.



 Q Josh, thank you. To follow up to the follow-up to the follow-up on the=
 question of transgender guidance.



 MR. EARNEST: Im summoning a lot of patience today.=20



 Q Does the administration in its final months expect to issue any more g=
uidance on topics, issues that the Education Department is dealing with? =
For instance, theres a hearing that happened this morning where mothers s=
aid that football slowly killed her son because of concussions. So Im cur=
ious, are there any other directives or issues or guidance that the admin=
istration plans to give out that impacts the nations children, like guida=
nce on CTE?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I dont have any announcements about additional Depart=
ment of Education guidance thats likely to be issued in the months ahead.=
 You can certainly check with the Department of Education to see if they =
can give you a preview of what other policies they may have in store.



 Q On Zika, back to that for a second here. You mentioned yesterday a lis=
t of things that the Republican-led Congress has not done, such as Zika, =
Puerto Rico, opioid addiction. Well, the House passed --=20



 MR. EARNEST: Passing a budget.



 Q Passing a budget. The House passed 18 bills on opioid addiction yester=
day. And on Zika, I know you mentioned that the funding is not on the cur=
rent legislation thats making its way through right now. Does the Preside=
nt expect to pass these pieces of legislation if they reach his desk? And=
 are you championing the bipartisan effort by the Florida senators, Rubio=
 and Nelson, to give fully funded $1.9 billion?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly welcome the bipartisan support that our =
Zika proposal has received, including from Senator Rubio. I think this re=
flects the degree to which, for all of our policy differences with Senato=
r Rubio, when it comes to looking out for the public health and wellbeing=
 of the American people, there shouldnt be a partisan difference. And I t=
hink Senator Rubio and Senator Nelson both understand the consequences fo=
r mothers and babies in Florida of not doing everything possible to fight=
 Zika. So we certainly welcome that show of bipartisan support from Senat=
or Rubio and Senator Nelson, and hope that the United States Senate and t=
he United States House will listen to the advice of our public health exp=
erts.=20



 The $1.9 billion number was not chosen at random -- it actually reflects=
 the sum total of efforts that our public health professionals say they c=
an and should take over the long term to protect the American people from=
 Zika. So if there are some public health professionals in the United Sta=
tes Congress that have looked at this carefully enough to offer up their =
own alternative, they can do that. But $1.9 billion is what our public he=
alth professionals say that we need. $1.9 billion is what our bipartisan =
governors from all across the country believe that Congress should provid=
e so that they can fight Zika in their communities.=20



 So theres strong bipartisan support for our proposal because its rooted =
in the facts, because its rooted based on the advice of the top scientist=
s in the country. Thats why we welcome the support of Republican senators=
 like Senator Rubio. Thats why we welcome the support of Democratic and R=
epublican governors. And we would welcome bipartisan congressional passag=
e of some legislation thats long overdue.



 Q But would the President sign anything less than the $1.9 billion reque=
st?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, this is a process that, unfortunately, is still worki=
ng its way through the United States Congress. We would have liked to hav=
e seen Congress begin this effort many months ago. The President convened=
 a meeting with his national security team and his public health experts =
in January to discuss this issue. Just a couple of weeks later, he signal=
ed his intent to request resources from Congress. Just a couple of weeks =
after that, we put forward a specific proposal that detailed how that $1.=
9 billion would be spent.



 So we worked at a very rapid pace over the winter to put forward this re=
quest. Three months now have gone by, almost three months, and weve seen =
very little movement from Congress, and thats been quite disappointing. B=
ut maybe as people like Senator Rubio weigh in and demonstrate bipartisan=
 support for this recommendation from our public health professionals, ma=
ybe well build up some momentum here.



 Suzanne.



 Q Josh, on another issue. On the day that the President is hosting sever=
al world leaders -- the refugee crisis, it was back in September that he =
pledged he wanted to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees into the country by the=
 end of fiscal 2016, October. So you have some time, but the latest State=
 Department statistic is showing just a little more than 2,000. Is the ad=
ministration confident that youll reach your goal of 10,000 by October? A=
nd can you also explain some of the delays and the slower-than-expected p=
rocess that they've gone through? Whats been some of the issues?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Suzanne, the challenge here is simply this -- that in=
dividuals who enter the United States through the refugee program are sub=
jected to more screening, more background checks than any other individua=
l who tries to enter the United States. These individuals have to undergo=
 a background check, theyre interviewed in person, biometric data about t=
hem is collected, and then all of that information is then run through da=
tabases that are maintained by the United States military, U.S. intellige=
nce agencies, other national security organizations in the United States,=
 but also law enforcement organizations in the United States and law enfo=
rcement organizations overseas.



 So all of that work takes time. And the President was clear that were no=
t going to cut corners when it comes to security, even as we meet this am=
bitious goal. So I dont think anybody was under the expectation that ther=
e would be a linear increase in the number of refugees that would be admi=
tted to the United States. I think we always contemplated that this is a =
program that would ramp up over time as we added capacity and as we added=
 our capacity to conduct these background checks.



 So theres no denying that theres a lot of work to do to meet this goal. =
It is an ambitious goal and it will be challenging to get it done. But la=
st year around this time, there were questions raised about whether or no=
t we would meet our previous refugee goal because wed fallen behind pace.=
 But yet, based on the good work of our professionals at the Department o=
f State and the Department of Homeland Security, we did succeed in meetin=
g that goal last year. And the President has made clear that meeting the =
more ambitious goal this year is a top priority. And Im confident that al=
l the people who are working on this problem understands the priority tha=
t the President has placed on this issue.



 Q How has the political rhetoric, the harsh language, and some of the fe=
ar thats been drummed up around immigration and around the refugee crisis=
 impacted the administrations ability to get them through the pipeline?=20=




 MR. EARNEST: I dont think its had an impact. The people who are working =
on this inside the U.S. government are professionals, and they understand=
 exactly what needs to be done when it comes to implementing these vigoro=
us background checks. They understand why its important that a thorough v=
etting be conducted before refugees are admitted to this country. And tha=
ts what theyre doing. And the political noise has not impacted their abil=
ity to do their jobs.



 Q And just to be clear, the administration is confident it will be able =
to reach its goal of 10,000?



 MR. EARNEST: I am confident that the people who are operating this progr=
am understand that the President of the United States thinks this is a to=
p priority, and they have work to do to meet this challenging goal. So we=
 certainly intend to reach this goal.



 Janet.



 Q Hi, Josh. Thank you. Going back to immigration, many of the critics --=
 immigration critics have called for refugee status for the Central Ameri=
can families. Will there be any action on that? And would you say that th=
is is in correlation to the spike of Central American families crossing t=
he border, that have been apprehended at the border in the last few month=
s?



 MR. EARNEST: No, its not. As Secretary Johnson has indicated, the operat=
ions that are underway are a continuation of operations that were previou=
sly announced. At the same time, I do think it is important for people wh=
o are in Central America and contemplating making the dangerous journey t=
hrough Mexico to try to get to the United States, these operations should=
 make clear that thats not an option -- thats not a viable option.



 It should also make clear to parents in particular that child smugglers =
who say they can sneak their kids into the United States are not telling =
the truth. And, in fact, entrusting your children to those smugglers is d=
angerous and we strongly encourage people not to do it.



 So thats an important thing. Its important for people to understand what=
 the policy is in the United States. Its also important for people to und=
erstand what we have tried to do. And what we have tried to do is to enha=
nce the assistance that the United States provides to countries like Guat=
emala and Honduras. Last year, in the omnibus budget proposal, about $700=
 million was provided by Congress to improve the security situation in so=
me of those countries or make contributions to try to improve the securit=
y situation there and try to address some of the root causes that would p=
rompt people to undertake this dangerous journey.



 So if this serves to discourage people from considering to make this jou=
rney, that would be a good thing. But our motivation for carrying out the=
se operations is rooted in President Obama and Secretary Johnson's commit=
ment to enforcing the law. Were going to do that in a way that is humane.=
 Were going to make sure that people have access to due process. The only=
 people who would be subject to operations like this are people who are s=
ubject to an order of removal by an immigration court.



 The only people who could be part of an operation like this and removed =
from the country would be people who have exhausted any sort of claims fo=
r asylum or humanitarian relief. So there are rules that govern this, but=
 at the end of the day, the President is serious about enforcing the law.=
 The President does continue to believe that there is a better way, and t=
hat comprehensive immigration reform legislation through Congress would i=
mprove the way that we manage our immigration system in this country.



 Q But there is no viable way for refugee status for these Central Americ=
an families?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, there has been a discussion about working with the Un=
ited Nations to allow people in Central America to apply for asylum and b=
e considered, be carefully vetted for inclusion in some sort of refugee p=
rocess. And we have worked diligently with the United Nations to try to g=
et that process up and running. Theres still a lot of work to do with reg=
ard to establishing that program, but there has been some consideration t=
hats been given to that idea.=20



Whats notable about that is that is an application process that doesnt be=
gin in the United States, it actually begins in Central America. And, aga=
in, that should serve as an encouragement for people who are interested a=
nd think that they may be eligible for that kind of humanitarian relief t=
hat they can apply for it in their home country. They don't have to under=
take the dangerous journey to try to get to the United States. They don't=
 have to trust a smuggler. They can apply for that status in their home c=
ountry.



 Gardiner.



 Q Josh, as you know, data out today show pretty sharp increases in murde=
r rates in the last few months in about 20 different cities. Is that a re=
ason for concern? And do you have any more to say on Comeys interpretatio=
n of that data?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have anything to say beyond what I said yesterday. =
I will say that when Director Comey was talking about this he acknowledge=
d that theres a lot of ambiguity about the broader trends, because in som=
e parts of the country we haven't seen an increase in violent crime and, =
overall, crime across the country is at or near historic lows. The exampl=
e that he raised that I think is an illustrative one is that we have seen=
 a spike in violent crime in Dallas, but not in Houston. So the question =
is what accounts for that differing environment?=20



And so we've got experts at the Department of Justice who are taking a lo=
ok at these situations. What President Obama did last year was actually d=
irect his Attorney General to ramp up the assistance that we can provide =
to local law enforcement that is trying to fight these violent crime spik=
es in some communities in the country. And that additional assistance has=
 taken a variety of forms. It has included widespread sting operations th=
at were carried out by U.S. marshals to round up individuals who were wan=
ted for violent crimes. Theres also additional assistance that's been pro=
vided to individual law enforcement organizations to improve training of =
their law enforcement officers to make them more effective.



So there is some assistance that the federal government can provide to la=
w enforcement agencies that are dealing with these kinds of spikes. But i=
t is unclear whats contributing to those spikes, because we do know that =
as a general matter, all across the country crime rates remain at or near=
 historic lows.=20



Q You dismissed his notion that there is some sort of Ferguson effect and=
 I think you talked about theres no evidence to back that up. I guess wha=
t I'm trying to understand is do you think that he is wrong, or do you th=
ink that he just doesnt have the evidence to substantiate what he said? T=
heres sort of a difference -- either you're not sure, or you're sure hes =
wrong. Can you help me untangle that?



MR. EARNEST: I think the point that I was making yesterday is -- and this=
 is based on a conversation I had with the President -- this administrati=
on makes policy decisions that are rooted in evidence, that are rooted in=
 science. We can't make broad, sweeping policy decisions or draw policy c=
onclusions based on anecdotal evidence. That's irresponsible and ultimate=
ly counterproductive.=20



The President actually has a lot of confidence in the vast majority of la=
w enforcement officers all across the country to do their jobs and to do =
them well and to do them selflessly and to do them in a way that is effec=
tive in fighting crime and protecting civil rights at the same time. The =
President does not believe -- at least he has not seen evidence to substa=
ntiate the suggestion that there are a significant number of police offic=
ers out there who are unwilling to do their job because they fear being f=
ilmed by somebodys cellphone.=20



But, look, if theres evidence that materializes to substantiate that clai=
m, then we should figure out something to do about it. So I guess the poi=
nt is there isn't evidence out there to draw any firm conclusions about w=
hats happening. The President does have a lot of confidence in the vast m=
ajority of law enforcement officers that are selflessly protecting our co=
mmunities and doing it in the right way. But we should look at this probl=
em and get to the bottom of what exactly is going on.=20



And Director Comey did indicate that it's unclear whats going on. He ackn=
owledged that it's a complicated situation. That's where he used the Dall=
as-Houston comparison to illustrate that there is no clear answer to what=
s going on here, and what Director Comey said is we need to spend more ti=
me trying to figure out whats happening. And hes right about that. And we=
 should use the evidence that is uncovered to formulate an appropriate po=
litics response. And that's what the President believes the priority shou=
ld be.



Q Josh, I mean, theres a lot of uncertainty about everything. You guys ar=
e swimming in uncertainty. We all are. I mean, one has to act in the face=
 of uncertainty anyway. You're suggesting, it seems to me, that you're no=
t acting because you don't have evidence, when, in fact, in nearly every =
case, you have to act in the face of uncertainty anyway. Can you help me =
sort of, again, untangle that?



MR. EARNEST: I think what I would say is we do often -- the President oft=
en talks about this, about how often uncertainty impacts the decisions th=
at hes required to make as the President of the United States. That uncer=
tainty typically applies to situations in which there are no guarantees t=
hat what the President is prepared to choose will work.=20



So, for example, if we determine that the so-called Ferguson effect is po=
tentially contributing to an increase in crime, then we need to sit down =
and figure out what can we do to address it. And there will be some uncer=
tainty about whether or not that will work. But there won't be uncertaint=
y about the fact that we're trying to solve the right problem, that we're=
 trying to solve a problem that actually exists, and so collecting eviden=
ce to verify what is possible to know even if, once we get to the stage o=
f considering solutions, there will naturally be some uncertainty about w=
hat the future holds. But even in that case, there will be some evidence =
to inform the choices that the President has to make.



Q Youve got more dead bodies. I mean, that's clearly a problem. Whether -=
-



MR. EARNEST: No, no, I'm not denying that there is a problem as it relate=
s to the spike in violent crime in some communities across the country. T=
hat's why the President, last year, ordered the Attorney General to provi=
de some additional assistance to law enforcement agencies. We saw the Mar=
shals Service carry out a widespread sweep that resulted in about 8,000 f=
ugitives being captured. So theres plenty of evidence to indicate that th=
ere are some communities -- again, this is not a widespread phenomenon, a=
t least based on what we know now -- but there is evidence to indicate th=
at there are some communities, including the Presidents hometown of Chica=
go, that are experiencing a troubling surge in violent crime. And the Pre=
sident has ordered action, specific action to try to address it.=20



But theres not evidence at this point to link that surge in violent crime=
 to the so-called viral video effect, or the Ferguson effect. Theres just=
 no evidence to substantiate that. And theres some anecdotal evidence to =
indicate that that may be having some impact, but theres plenty of anecdo=
tal evidence that the vast majority of law enforcement officers, men and =
women across the country, are doing their job as well as ever; that theyr=
e fighting crime, that theyre protecting peoples civil rights, that theyr=
e acting selflessly and bravely to communicate -- or to protect the commu=
nities that they are sworn to serve and protect.=20



So that's the ambiguity that exists. And that's what we need to get to th=
e bottom of before we start offering up specific solutions.=20



Q On the transgender question, can you help us untangle the Presidents ro=
le himself? Like did he play a direct role in the guidance? Did he meet w=
ith his Attorney General in the last week or recent weeks to discuss this=
? Did he meet with his Education Secretary in the last week or the week b=
efore to discuss this? Did he encourage the issue himself of this guidanc=
e? And what in particular might have persuaded him that this was the righ=
t thing to do? So can you -- a little bit more about what President Obama=
 himself, what role he played in this?



MR. EARNEST: What I can tell you about the President is he was he was reg=
ularly updated as this policy process moved forward. So he was certainly =
aware of the policy that was under deliberation by the Department of Educ=
ation. And I can tell you that the outcome does reflect his view that the=
 Department of Education should be responsive to requests that theyve rec=
eived from school administrators and that the Department of Education has=
 an obligation to put forward tangible, real-world suggestions for how th=
is problem can be addressed in communities all across the country.



The President also agrees that imposing an additional requirement under t=
he existing law is not something the Department of Education needs to be =
doing right now. So it's possible, and in fact, important for the U.S. De=
partment of Education to play an appropriate role in offering this guidan=
ce to school administrators that are trying to enhance the safety and pro=
tect the dignity of every student in their community.



Q The suggestion is that hes sort of a bystander to this guidance coming =
out -- that it was part of a process, that it came out of the departments=
, and he didnt really do much to encourage or discourage, it just sort of=
 happened. Is that an appropriate interpretation? Or did he play a more a=
ctive role?



MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously the President sets a longer-term vision for =
the priorities that his administration is going to pursue. I can't speak =
to all of the conversations that President Obama has had with the Educati=
on Secretary about this or other matters. But I think it is fair to say -=
- and I think it's important -- that this kind of announcement reflects t=
he Presidents strongly held view about the need to prevent discrimination=
, but also the need to protect the safety and dignity of every student in=
 America.



So this does reflect the Presidents view. But, at the same time, theres a=
n established policy process for considering these kinds of questions and=
 ensuring that the outcome reflects the priorities that were set by the P=
resident of the United States. In this case, they were.



 Q In an interview with the Rutgers student newspaper, President Obama de=
fended his administrations crackdown on leaks and press freedom by saying=
 the prosecutions were a small sampling. But the truth is the administrat=
ion has targeted more whistleblowers and prosecuted more leak investigati=
ons -- including of my colleagues -- than all previous administrations co=
mbined. Can you explain the Presidents remarks? Does he -- is he aware of=
 just how many more leak investigations this administration has conducted=
 versus all of his predecessors?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think we're going to get deep into this today=
. But let me say a couple of things about this. The first is, what the Pr=
esident said is true, that a number of those investigations were initiate=
d by the previous administration. What is also true is questions of crimi=
nal investigations and criminal prosecutions are not influenced by the Pr=
esident or any other political operatives in the White House. These are d=
ecisions that are made by Department of Justice prosecutors.=20



 That's the way the process should work. And it would be inappropriate fo=
r the President to intervene either way. It would be inappropriate for th=
e President of the United States to intervene with the federal prosecutor=
 and say, you should go investigate this individual. It would be just as =
inappropriate for the President to intervene and say, you should lay off =
that guy from The New York Times. That would be inappropriate too.=20



 We've got a Department of Justice that is insulated from politics for a =
very good reason. And you should check with them for insight into the pro=
secutorial decisions that attorneys at the Department of Justice were mak=
ing.



 Q -- that these prosecutions took place during his administration? I mea=
n, he then went on to sort of talk about how his notion himself is that t=
here should be as much freedom as possible. As you say, these prosecution=
s took place during his administration, and your suggestion is that it to=
ok place essentially without any input from him or any of his direct -- i=
n the White House.



 MR. EARNEST: And I'm suggesting it would be a genuine scandal if that we=
re not the case.=20



 Q I think that's right. So is he sorry that this number of prosecutions =
took place during his administration, given the fact that he can do nothi=
ng about it?



 MR. EARNEST: No. I think the President does believe that people who swor=
e an oath to protect sensitive information should follow it. And the Pres=
ident does believe that the Department of Justice and other agencies have=
 a role in enforcing that oath. And that enforcement should take place wi=
thout regard to political considerations. And theres just such an inquiry=
 that's going on right now that I'm not going to comment on, but I think =
is an indication that this is something, at least when it comes to the ha=
ndling of these kinds of matters by the Department of Justice, that shoul=
d be firmly insulated from politics, and therefore, insulated from influe=
nce by the President of the United States.=20



 Q Do you know of any previous state dinner that celebrated five countrie=
s at once, Josh?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't. That would make tonights event all the more specia=
l.=20



 All right. Jonathan, I'll give you the last one. And then we'll do the w=
eek ahead.



 Q Okay, thank you. The President is going to Rutgers on Sunday. Why did =
he decide to go to Rutgers? Were any loud voices urging him to go? And ca=
n you give us an advance preview of what hes going to say there?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, for years, students and other leaders at Rutgers have=
 been encouraging President Obama to consider delivering the commencement=
 address this year because its the 250th anniversary of the first commenc=
ement address -- the first commencement ceremonies that were hosted at Ru=
tgers. So the President is looking forward to participating in this histo=
ric occasion. It certainly is the mark of a remarkable institution of hig=
her learning. I know that Rutgers, in particular, is quite proud of the c=
lass of 2016, and the President is looking forward to congratulating that=
 class on all that they have achieved.=20



I think hell have some observations about the world that theyre prepared =
to enter. Theyre prepared to enter a country and a planet thats rapidly c=
hanging. And these students are as well-prepared as any students have eve=
r been to confront those challenges and use this changing environment to =
create a better world. And thats what makes the President so fundamentall=
y optimistic about the future of our country, and that optimism is manife=
sted quite well in this years graduating class at Rutgers.



 So with that, why dont I do a week ahead?



 Q Will he visit the (inaudible) at all while hes at Rutgers?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont have any notes about any unplanned, any unscheduled =
movements for the President, but well see if he is able to make the most =
of his visit to Rutgers.



 So on Sunday -- this is not written down here, but obviously on Sunday, =
the President will travel to New Jersey and deliver the commencement addr=
ess at the 250th commencement at Rutgers University.=20



 On Monday, the President will host a Medal of Valor ceremony at the Whit=
e House. The Medal of Valor is awarded to public safety officers who have=
 exhibited exceptional courage, regardless of personal safety, in the att=
empt to save or protect others from harm.



 On Tuesday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.



 On Wednesday, the President will participate in a DNC roundtable.



 On Thursday, the President will award the National Medals of Science and=
 Technology and Innovation to 17 scientists, engineers, mathematicians an=
d innovators. The Medal of Science recognizes individuals who have made o=
utstanding contributions to science, engineering and mathematics. The Nat=
ional Medal of Technology and Innovation recognizes those who have made l=
asting contributions to Americas competitiveness and quality of life and =
helped the nations technological workforce.



 On Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.



 And then on Saturday, the President will depart Washington, D.C. en rout=
e Hanoi, Vietnam. This trip will highlight the Presidents ongoing commitm=
ent to the U.S. rebalance to Asia and the Pacific, designed to increase U=
.S. diplomatic, economic, and security engagement with the country and pe=
oples of the region. So this is obviously next Saturday, a week from tomo=
rrow, and well have a lot more to say about the Presidents trip to the As=
ia Pacific during next weeks briefings.



 So with all that, I hope you guys all have a great weekend. See you on M=
onday.



 Q Starting now? (Laughter.)



 MR. EARNEST: I resisted making that joke out of deference, but well pick=
 it back up next week.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Kathleen, would you like =

&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I'm going to start with the administration's letter=
 on transgender bathroom guidance for schools.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I thou=
ght you might.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tho=
ught I'd give you a chance to respond to Texas's &#8211; the lieutenant gov=
ernor, Dan Patrick, who said that the letter -- he called the letter &quot;=
blackmail,&quot; and said that the administration is doing everything
 it can to -- or he said it's going to divide the country and it has everyt=
hing to do with keeping the federal government out of local issues.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think this does underscore the risk of electing a right-wing radio host t=
o a statewide elected office.&nbsp; So let's just walk through the facts he=
re.&nbsp; The first is, this was guidance that was
 issued by the Department of Education and the Department of Justice in res=
ponse to requests for information and guidance from school administrators a=
cross the country.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Just last week, for examp=
le, the National Association of Secondary School Principals put forward a s=
pecific formal request to the Department of Education about how to create t=
he kind of respectful, inclusive environment
 that school administrators across the country are seeking to maintain.&nbs=
p; These principals also are interested in making sure that they're acting =
consistent with the law.&nbsp; And they sought guidance because they're not=
 interested in a political argument, they're
 actually interested in practical suggestions about how they confront this =
challenge that they face every day.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So let's just be clear ab=
out what's included in the guidance.&nbsp; The guidance does not add additi=
onal requirements to the applicable law.&nbsp; The guidance does not requir=
e any student to use shared facilities when schools
 make alternate arrangements.&nbsp; But what the framework does provide is =
advice for how school administrators can protect the dignity and safety of =
every student under their charge.&nbsp; And that advice includes practical,=
 tangible, real-world suggestions to school
 administrators who have to deal with this issue.&nbsp; They can't rely on =
political arguments that are framed as a solution to a problem that nobody =
can prove exists.&nbsp; They actually have to deal with the responsibility =
that they have to promote an inclusive, respectful
 environment for all of their students.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And what the Department o=
f Education has issued today is specific, tangible, real-world advice and s=
uggestions to school administrators across the country about exactly they c=
an do that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But y=
ou wouldn&#8217;t argue -- or it seems as though the administration is also=
 trying to paint this as a major civil rights issue, right?&nbsp; This isn&=
#8217;t just a pragmatic sort of everyday guidance to schools.&nbsp; Attorn=
ey
 General Lynch has compared this to racial segregation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think Attorney General Lynch was talking about a very specific enforcemen=
t action that the Department of Education announced -- or the Department of=
 Justice announced with regard to a specific
 law that was passed by the state of North Carolina.&nbsp; In this instance=
, this is not an enforcement action.&nbsp; As I pointed out, this does not =
add any additional requirements to any school district or state under the a=
pplicable law.&nbsp; This is in response to extensive
 requests for guidance and for information and advice that have been put fo=
rward by school administrators and teachers and, in some cases, even parent=
s who are seeking practical solutions to this challenge.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the challenge here is=
 not to isolate anybody, it's not to discriminate against anybody, it's not=
 to make anybody unsafe -- it's actually to ensure that our schools are as =
inclusive and respectful and safe as
 they can possibly be.&nbsp; And that's why the guidance that we've put for=
ward includes tangible, specific suggestions for how that can be achieved.&=
nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So let me just give you o=
ne example.&nbsp; There are some school districts across the country that h=
ave sought to enhance the privacy of their students by making relatively mi=
nor changes to shared-use facilities.&nbsp; In
 some cases, that means just putting up curtains so that people have more p=
rivacy when they're changing their clothes or taking showers in what had pr=
eviously been shared-use facilities.&nbsp; So that is something that benefi=
ts all students, and that's what we're
 looking for -- solutions that protect the safety and dignity of every sing=
le student in the school.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And i=
f schools individually decide not to follow this guidance, there isn&#8217;=
t a threat that they could lose federal funding --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
if there are schools -- first of all, let me just state that it is my stron=
gly held belief -- and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be right about this -- =
that the vast majority of schools and school
 districts and school administrators across the country will welcome this g=
uidance and will implement it.&nbsp; For those that don&#8217;t, there's an=
 established process for them to raise any concerns that they may have.&nbs=
p; And there's an established process for that,
 and we'll go through it.&nbsp; But the vast majority of schools and school=
 administrators will incorporate this advice as they confront the challenge=
 of ensuring that they're promoting the kind of respectful, safe learning e=
nvironment that can ensure the success
 of all of their students.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay,=
 and I'm going to just switch topics.&nbsp; Chairman Rogers is saying he's =
put together a Zika measure -- and he didn&#8217;t put a dollar figure amou=
nt, but it's safe to say it's going to be well under what you
 all have asked, even under the Senate, of $1.1 trillion [sic].&nbsp; So ar=
e you willing to accept $1.1 trillion?&nbsp; Is that enough money to fight =
Zika?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I guess I haven&#8217;t seen the details related to Chairman Rogers's propo=
sal.&nbsp; I think what I would encourage him to do before he puts it forwa=
rd -- I don&#8217;t know if he has yet -- but if he hasn&#8217;t,
 if there's still time, he should consult with the public health profession=
als that the administration talked to in putting forward our funding reques=
t for what is necessary to do everything possible to protect the American p=
eople from the Zika virus.&nbsp; Time's
 a-wastin'.&nbsp; And you saw that from the graphic that we presented in th=
e briefing earlier this week.&nbsp; As the weather warms up, as the mosquit=
o population grows, the risk to pregnant women and their babies all across =
the country grows.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so it's long past tim=
e for people like Chairman Rogers, who's got a substantial responsibility h=
ere -- he's the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee -- when our =
public health professionals say that
 they need resources to protect the American people, they're looking exactl=
y at Chairman Rogers to see exactly what he's doing.&nbsp; And here we are,=
 three months after the administration has put forward our proposal, that h=
e comes forward with a much smaller one
 that is inconsistent with the recommendations of our public health profess=
ionals.&nbsp; It's also inconsistent of the request that was put forward by=
 Democratic and Republican governors from across the country who said that =
they needed urgent congressional action
 to provide the necessary resources to keep the American people safe.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So before that proposal is =
put forward, I would encourage the Chairman to consult with governors who a=
re responsible for the safety of the citizens of their state and the public=
 health professionals who have taken a look at this, and
 understand exactly what can be done and what should be done to ensure the =
safety and security of the American people, and particularly pregnant women=
 and their babies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roberta.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hezboll=
ah&#8217;s top military commander has been killed, and I'm wondering, does =
the administration have any understanding of who was responsible for that, =
and any comment on what impact this may have on the group?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I've cer=
tainly seen reports that Mustafa Badreddine was killed this week in Syria.&=
nbsp; And we noted the fact that preparations are underway for his funeral.=
&nbsp; Badreddine was Hezbollah&#8217;s top military commander.&nbsp; In Ju=
ne of
 2011, a special tribunal for Lebanon charged him with the 2005 attack that=
 killed former Prime Minister Hariri.&nbsp; In September of 2012, the Unite=
d States imposed sanctions against Hezbollah leaders, including Bedreddine,=
 in part to expose Hezbollah&#8217;s support
 for the Assad regime and its role in conducting indiscriminate terrorist a=
ttacks in Syria and Lebanon.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've noted that the Syrian=
 regime and Hezbollah have a long military alliance, and Hezbollah leaders =
have previously sought safe haven in Syria and have even routed weapons fro=
m Iran into Lebanon.&nbsp; So the interplay between the Assad
 regime and Hezbollah has been well chronicled.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we've seen the reports o=
f his death.&nbsp; I can't independently confirm them.&nbsp; And I guess th=
e thing that I can confirm is that there were no U.S. or coalition aircraft=
 in the area where he was reported to be killed.&nbsp; But I can't further
 confirm the reports.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you=
 speak to what impact the U.S. feels this will have on the group and its ac=
tivities?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 know that the Assad regime relied heavily on Hezbollah for military suppor=
t in the ongoing chaos inside of Syria.&nbsp; The Assad regime, and Preside=
nt Assad himself, has personally benefitted from the activities
 that Hezbollah has carried out, so it's hard for me to draw any firm concl=
usions about what operational impact this would have.&nbsp; But obviously t=
he concerns that we've previously expressed about Hezbollah I think are con=
sistent with our ongoing efforts to reduce
 the violence inside of Syria and get all of the parties, including the Ass=
ad regime, to abide by the ceasefire.&nbsp; Those are our priorities becaus=
e we want to try to bring about a political solution to the chaos inside of=
 Syria.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the =
school bathroom issue, how concerned is the administration about the legal =
challenges?&nbsp; The Texas attorney general is saying that this oversteps =
the administration&#8217;s constitutional authority.&nbsp; And can you spea=
k to -- I
 mean, you said very clearly to Kathleen that you expect the vast majority =
of schools will implement the guidance.&nbsp; But for those that don't, wha=
t happens with them?&nbsp; Is the administration actively going to follow u=
p with them and punish them in some way?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
ere&#8217;s an established process for schools and the Department of Educat=
ion to discuss guidance that they&#8217;ve been provided.&nbsp; I just want=
 to reiterate -- and this is important for people who are interested in the
 legal aspect of this -- there&#8217;s no additional requirement under the =
applicable law that&#8217;s being imposed on schools.&nbsp; There&#8217;s j=
ust not, despite the claims of political opponents of the administration.&n=
bsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">There is a strong desire =
on the part of some politicians to try and score some cheap political point=
s by presenting a solution to a problem that they can't prove exists.&nbsp;=
 And what the administration has tried to
 do is to provide, at the request of school administrators, practical, real=
-world advice they can use in their school communities to address this chal=
lenge.&nbsp; That's the practical offering that we have put forward here.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">It's a lot different than=
 the argument that others are making.&nbsp; For example, is the Texas attor=
ney general suggesting somehow that it would be practical to station a law =
enforcement officer outside of every public
 bathroom in an educational facility and check people&#8217;s birth certifi=
cates on the way in?&nbsp; That doesn&#8217;t sound like a practical applic=
ation to me.&nbsp; It also doesn&#8217;t sound like small government to me.=
&nbsp; It certainly sounds like a government intrusion to me.&nbsp; But,
 again, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s hard to sift through in all of this.&nbsp=
; What exactly is the practical argument or suggestion that they&#8217;re m=
aking?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recognize that they&#8217=
;ve got some sharp political arguments that were honed over years of mornin=
g drive-time radio in Houston, but school administrators don&#8217;t have t=
he benefit of just talking.&nbsp; They actually have a functional responsib=
ility
 to protect the safety and dignity of every student at their school.&nbsp; =
And the vast majority of school administrators take that responsibility qui=
te seriously.&nbsp; And I think we&#8217;ll welcome and implement the guida=
nce that&#8217;s been issued by the Department of Education
 today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#8217;ll move around.&nb=
sp; Gregory.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot o=
f times when a guidance or regulation or directive comes from a federal age=
ncy, it&#8217;s portrayed as a White House action.&nbsp; Could you address =
what this transgender bathroom issue -- did this come from the White House?=
&nbsp; Was
 the White House consulted?&nbsp; How unitary is the unitary executive on t=
hings like this?&nbsp; I guess what I&#8217;m asking is, is the White House=
 and the Obama administration synonymous, for all intents and purposes, to =
--<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Putting =
forward guidance like this is the responsibility of the Department of Educa=
tion.&nbsp; And they have to consider a broad range of policy implications =
for schools all across the country.&nbsp; So this is the responsibility
 of the Department of Education, but you would expect the White House to be=
 responsible for coordinating policy decisions that are made by agencies.&n=
bsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So of course the White Hous=
e was aware of the policy deliberations that have been underway at the Depa=
rtment of Education for quite some time, but ultimately this is the respons=
ibility and the function of the Department of Education,
 and they are the ones who received requests from schools all across the co=
untry, and they are the ones who are putting forward guidance for how schoo=
ls can deal with this particular situation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is=
 the rationale that the administration has come to, to base this guidance o=
n Title IX, just to be clear about that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I&=
#8217;m happy to be overruled by an attorney at the Department of Justice o=
r the Department of Education that you can consult after this hearing -- or=
 after this briefing, but let me try.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">My understanding is that =
Title IX applies specifically to preventing sex discrimination in education=
al institutions.&nbsp; And the idea that individuals are discriminated agai=
nst because of their gender identity is the
 basis for the guidance that we&#8217;re putting forward.&nbsp; Nobody shou=
ld be discriminated against because of who they are.&nbsp; And our suggesti=
on is that the rules should apply to everybody equally, and that&#8217;s th=
e basis of this guidance -- that every student should
 have access to facilities that every other student has access to.&nbsp; No=
 one should be discriminated against because of who they are.&nbsp; And tha=
t&#8217;s the basis for this guidance.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s also why we sa=
y no student is forced to use shared facilities.&nbsp; And if there are alt=
ernate facilities available, that are made available by administrators, the=
n every student should have access to those as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why=
 shouldn&#8217;t local communities be making these very intimate decisions?=
&nbsp; How does the federal government know what&#8217;s best in so many di=
fferent communities where there are different cultural sensitivities?&nbsp;=
 Why is this not
 a local matter?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; It is a =
local matter.&nbsp; That is exactly the position of the Obama administratio=
n.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why=
 is the federal government involved?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The fede=
ral government is providing specific suggestions based on examples that we&=
#8217;ve collected from across the country.&nbsp; And the guidance is prese=
nted -- it is not an additional requirement under the applicable law.&nbsp;
 It doesn&#8217;t provide any obligation to a student, for example, to use =
a shared facility.&nbsp; Rather, what it does is we have consulted with sch=
ools all across the country and surfaced good suggestions, good examples --=
 in some cases, even best practices -- for
 addressing this situation.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the essence of guidance that=
&#8217;s at the essence of the coordinating role that the Department of Edu=
cation plays.&nbsp; At the same time, Ron, there&#8217;s a long history in =
our country of the federal government playing a very important
 role in ensuring that people aren&#8217;t discriminated against.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With re=
gard to the health care law and the new rule, what&#8217;s different?&nbsp;=
 How does this apply to the transgender community specifically now?&nbsp; W=
hat&#8217;s different?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; So this =
is a good example of what I was just talking about.&nbsp; There is a new ru=
le that is part of the Affordable Care Act, or the implementation of the Af=
fordable Care Act, that prohibits discrimination based on race,
 color, national origin, sex, gender identity, age or disability, and it en=
sures that individuals with limited English proficiency can access language=
 assistance when they&#8217;re seeking health care.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, a basic responsibili=
ty of the federal government -- and this has been true throughout our natio=
n&#8217;s history -- is ensuring that people aren&#8217;t discriminated aga=
inst.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s particularly true when it comes to health care=
 as
 well.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s true of any potential sex discrimination, but=
 that also is relevant to discrimination that could be targeted at people b=
ecause of their race, because of a perceived disability, because somebody i=
s pregnant, because somebody doesn&#8217;t speak
 English very well.&nbsp; We believe people should be treated the same and =
afforded the same kind of opportunities, regardless of these specific indiv=
idual characteristics.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn&#82=
17;t the mention of transgender patients -- isn&#8217;t that specific?&nbsp=
; Isn&#8217;t that new?&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that different?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; All of w=
hat I&#8217;ve laid out is a new part of the rule that&#8217;s been issued =
today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What wa=
s the harm, in terms of the transgender community?&nbsp; Was there some ide=
ntifiable problem out there that required this clarification or this augmen=
tation to the rule?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, Ron, this is much broader than just applying to the transgender commun=
ity.&nbsp; But the transgender community is included.&nbsp; In the same way=
 that we want to prevent discrimination against pregnant women, we want
 to make sure that we&#8217;re preventing discrimination against transgende=
red women.&nbsp; In the same way that we&#8217;re preventing discrimination=
 against people who don&#8217;t speak English very well or people who have =
a specific disability, we want to make sure that transgendered
 men are not discriminated against either.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifi=
cally because there&#8217;s some concern in that community about access to =
transition drugs and medications and services, was that something that the =
administration was concerned about in terms of trying to, I guess you could
 say, refine this rule?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
guess in terms of the way that it has an impact on individual health care d=
ecisions, I&#8217;d refer you to Health and Human Services for answering th=
at question.&nbsp; But, look, the idea behind this specific rule is to
 prevent discrimination against a wide range of groups.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One oth=
er area. &nbsp;There are these reports about immigration raids that are sup=
posedly happening during May.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve heard even Secretary Clint=
on and Senator Sanders comment on this.&nbsp; There&#8217;s the belief that=
 the administration is
 going to conduct huge raids during May and June, rallying up significant n=
umbers of women and children, recent people who have crossed the country in=
 significant numbers.&nbsp; Is that true?&nbsp; Is there something differen=
t happening now?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
is is an excellent question.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking about a DHS enforcem=
ent action, so there are some limitations about what I can say, but let me =
help you understand exactly the policy that DHS is implementing.&nbsp; And
 I think I can largely answer your question.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The first is -- and this =
is something that Secretary Johnson himself has said -- that the operations=
 that are underway are merely the continuation of operations that were anno=
unced in January and in March.&nbsp; And
 those operations are conducted under the rubric of the guidance that Presi=
dent Obama and Secretary Johnson put in place in November of 2014.&nbsp; An=
d that is guidance that made a priority of individuals who are convicted cr=
iminals or otherwise a threat to public
 safety, or individuals who were apprehended after crossing the border afte=
r January 1st of 2014.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&#8217;ve made clear t=
hat our priorities are people who pose a threat to the community, people wh=
o are convicted criminals, or people who have only recently crossed the bor=
der.&nbsp; So those priorities remain in place, and those priorities
 are followed even as these operations continue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say two more things.=
&nbsp; The first is, no one is removed if they have an ongoing, pending cla=
im or appeal for asylum or some other form of humanitarian relief.&nbsp; Pe=
ople are given access to due process.&nbsp; And that is a foundational
 principle for all of this.&nbsp; So the only people who are the targets of=
 these operations are people who are subject to an order by an immigration =
court for removal and people who have also, in addition to being subject to=
 that order, have exhausted any potential
 claims that they have for humanitarian relief.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last thing is DHS enfor=
cement agents also follow what I understand is to be longstanding guidance =
that ensures that these operations are not conducted in sensitive places.&n=
bsp; These operations are not conducted in schools or hospitals
 or places of worship, for example.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is t=
here no reason to fear that the numbers of deportations aren't going to inc=
rease or spike -- whatever words you want to use now -- because there&#8217=
;s something, a specific operation underway that&#8217;s different from wha=
t&#8217;s normally
 happening there along the border?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, what Secretary Johnson has described is that the operations that are u=
nderway now are a continuation of operations that were previously announced=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But look, I think we would =
anticipate that the deportation numbers would continue to go up.&nbsp; This=
 administration is serious about enforcing the law.&nbsp; And I recognize t=
hat our political opponents don't like to acknowledge that fact.&nbsp;
 But we've made clear how we're going to use law enforcement resources to e=
nhance or border security and to enhance the security of communities across=
 the country.&nbsp; Most importantly, we're going to enforce our laws.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is something that =
President Obama is committed to.&nbsp; And the truth is, we would have a wh=
ole lot more resources to do exactly that if Republicans in the House of Re=
presentatives had not blocked comprehensive immigration reform
 legislation that did include an historic investment in our border security=
.&nbsp; But we do not enjoy the benefits of that border security today beca=
use House Republicans blocked the passage of that legislation.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And jus=
t lastly, it&#8217;s not your political opponents -- well, some of the peop=
le who are objecting to this or raising concerns about this are Secretary C=
linton and Senator Sanders, who I wouldn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d consider=
 political opponents.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, but =
it&#8217;s our political opponents who suggest that President Obama is not =
interested in enforcing the law.&nbsp; And I think that is demonstrably fal=
se.&nbsp; That's that point that I&#8217;m making.&nbsp; That's the reason =
that we're
 having this conversation right now.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anita.&nbsp; Oh, Leslie, I&=
#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's =
okay.&nbsp; She was here yesterday.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; She was.=
&nbsp; It&#8217;s nice to see you, Leslie.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's =
fine, thanks.&nbsp; I had a couple questions on the gender guidelines you s=
ent out last night.&nbsp; Given that North Carolina&#8217;s House Bill 2, t=
hat's sort of part of this, is headed to the courts, why did the White Hous=
e feel the
 need to put out this directive to the law?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
is is a directive that is responsive to requests that we've received all ac=
ross the country from school administrators and teachers and parents and ot=
hers.&nbsp; So this is not a response to the ongoing legal dispute
 related to HB2.&nbsp; This is a response to requests that the Department o=
f Education has received from teachers and administrators all across the co=
untry.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you=
&#8217;ve cautioned before about being careful of not putting your finger o=
n the scale.&nbsp; Doesn't this sort of suggest that you're putting the Whi=
te House&#8217;s finger on the scale?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
've been quite clear about the need to keep enforcement actions separate fr=
om any sort of political interference.&nbsp; This is not an enforcement act=
ion.&nbsp; This is a policy decision that was made by the Department
 of Education.&nbsp; And, yes, the White House was appropriately involved i=
n coordinating that policy decision.&nbsp; But ultimately it&#8217;s the re=
sponsibility of the Department of Education to make this policy decision an=
d to communicate it to the schools and administrators
 all across the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notably, it&#8217;s not an =
enforcement action.&nbsp; It does not add a requirement to the applicable l=
aw.&nbsp; And it doesn't pose any requirements on students for the use of s=
hared facilities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of =
the other questions I had for you.&nbsp; You mentioned -- you were asked ab=
out the lieutenant governor&#8217;s comments on it, and you said that it ru=
ns the risk -- or it underscores the risk of electing a right-wing radio ho=
st.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; To state=
wide office, yes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, to=
 statewide office.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes.&nbs=
p; (Laughter.) <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given t=
hat the White House last year when the Supreme Court ruled on same-sex marr=
iage, the White House put the lights out on the fountain, how much of this =
was a political consideration in doing these guidelines?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think as I pointed out before, the guidelines contain practical advice and =
suggestions for school administrators across the country that have to deal =
with this challenge inside their communities.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t have
 the luxury of relying on political arguments that are an attempt to try to=
 score some political points that propose to address a solution to a proble=
m that doesn&#8217;t actually exist.&nbsp; These are school administrators =
who are trying to do the right thing.&nbsp; They're
 trying to promote an atmosphere of dignity and security for the students a=
nd their schools.&nbsp; And so what the Department of Education has put for=
ward are practical suggestions for how exactly they can do that consistent =
with civil rights law.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And t=
he White House is not looking to score any political points on it, even tho=
ugh it's been hailed by a number of organizations as a new frontier in same=
-sex law?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I'm not surprised to hear that there are people who agree that we shouldn&#=
8217;t discriminate against people because of who they are.&nbsp; I think m=
ost Americans agree with that notion.&nbsp; So that's part
 of why I anticipate that school administrators across the country would we=
lcome this guidance.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Look, I'll also say, I th=
ink school administrators across the country who don&#8217;t agree with the=
 politics of this administration will also welcome these suggestions, becau=
se they recognize that they have a challenge
 that they have to deal with and that, frankly, they don&#8217;t have the l=
uxury of engaging in a partisan political argument with a right-wing radio =
host.&nbsp; In fact, what they have to do is they have to provide for the s=
afety and dignity of the students who are under
 their care.&nbsp; And that's exactly what this guidance does, is it gives =
them some useful tools for considering a range of options that they can use=
 to do exactly that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this has very little t=
o do with politics, except for our critics who want to make this entirely a=
bout politics.&nbsp; This administration is interested in providing workabl=
e, practical solutions to school administrators
 who are trying to provide for the safety and dignity of the students under=
 their care.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Thanks, Leslie.&nbsp; Mar=
k.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh,=
 is it the intention of the administration that the guidance letter be seen=
 as a threat to deny federal funds to school districts that don&#8217;t com=
ply with the policy decisions as interpreted by DOE and DOJ?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, th=
ey should not view it that way.&nbsp; They should view this as guidance, as=
 specific suggestions and a framework for dealing with a very straightforwa=
rd challenge:&nbsp; How do school administrators, all
 across the country, ensure that they're protecting both the safety and dig=
nity of every single student at the school.&nbsp; It's as simple as that.&n=
bsp; And what the Department of Education has done is they've drawn on thei=
r own internal expertise, and they've drawn
 on the creative solutions that have been implemented by school administrat=
ors all across the country to put all that good information in one place an=
d provide some practical advice to school administrators who are trying to =
solve this problem.&nbsp; And that's
 a good thing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think what is true, wha=
t is undeniably true is the foundation of this guidance is the principle th=
at people shouldn&#8217;t be discriminated against just because of who they=
 are.&nbsp; And school administrators don&#8217;t have
 a glamorous job.&nbsp; These are individuals who, I think in most cases, f=
eel quite passionate about their work.&nbsp; They view their work as a call=
ing.&nbsp; They're looking to prepare the next generation of Americans to s=
ucceed.&nbsp; And they want to create a learning environment
 where every student can feel safe, where every student can feel included, =
where every student can feel respected.&nbsp; That's what the vast majority=
 of school administrators are interested in, and that's why I think the vas=
t majority of school administrators are
 going to use this guidance, they're going to carefully consider the sugges=
tions that have been put forward by the Department of Education, and they'r=
e going to put forward a solution that works in their community.&nbsp; That=
's the way this should work.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could=
 you see how some might see the guidance letter as an implied threat of los=
s of federal funds, being that you mentioned that under the provisions of T=
itle IX, schools that receive federal funds are obligated
 to comply with the provisions that are stated forth in the guidance letter=
?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST: &nbsp;Look, =
there is a desire in the guidance to be as clear as possible about why this=
 guidance is being issued.&nbsp; But look, it's quite clear what we're inte=
rested in here.&nbsp; The Department of Education is
 interested in providing guidance and suggestions to school administrators =
who are trying to do the right thing.&nbsp; And that right thing is to prev=
ent people from being discriminated against, but also make sure that every =
single student in their school has their
 safety and their dignity protected.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeste=
rday, you said that there was a determination, as a result of multiagency r=
eview, that there would be no loss of federal funds at this time to North C=
arolina as a result of possible suit.&nbsp; But at the same
 time, this guidance on transgender students is issued.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t t=
hat sending a mixed message?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
no, I don&#8217;t think it's a mixed message.&nbsp; I think it's important =
for people to understand what's happening here.&nbsp; This guidance that wa=
s put forward by the Department of Education does not impose
 any new requirements under the applicable law.&nbsp; It's guidance that's =
issued to school administrators in school districts all across the country.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The conversation that we'=
ve been having over the course of this week has largely been centered on th=
e state of North Carolina and what impact their law could have on their com=
pliance with the Civil Rights Act.&nbsp;
 So it was related to a specific piece of legislation that was passed almos=
t literally in the dark of night by the legislation that convened a one-day=
 special session to pass this bill.&nbsp; It was signed the same day by the=
 governor.&nbsp; And the rebuke from business
 leaders in North Carolina and business leaders who are contemplating doing=
 business in North Carolina has been forceful.&nbsp; And I think it's an in=
dication that the legislation that was passed by the state legislature was =
much more -- was much broader than just
 something that would apply in an educational setting.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the situations are qui=
te different.&nbsp; I think they do illustrate how consistent and forceful =
this administration has been about fighting against the idea that people co=
uld be discriminated against because of who
 they are.&nbsp; That's a principle the President does feel strongly about.=
&nbsp; It's obviously a principle that Attorney General Lynch spoke movingl=
y about.&nbsp; And preventing discrimination and treating people fairly is =
a core principle that does guide a lot of the policy
 that's made by the Obama administration.&nbsp; But the enforcement action =
that was announced by the Attorney General this week was enforcement action=
 that was the decision of attorneys at the Department of Justice.&nbsp; Tha=
t decision was not influenced by White House
 officials.&nbsp; The notification that was distributed by the Department o=
f Education today is not an enforcement action; it was a policy decision th=
at did include some White House involvement, but was the realm and responsi=
bility of the Department of Education.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But nonetheless, given that th=
e major component of House Bill 2 is that transgender students in North Car=
olina are prohibited from using the restroom consistent with their gender i=
dentity, doesn&#8217;t that necessarily mean that even if schools not to
 follow this guidance that the Department of Education has put out, that th=
ey will not suffer a loss of federal funds?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
what this says is -- well, the way this works is that if there are schools =
-- and I think they will be in the minority -- but if there are schools acr=
oss the country that do come forward and
 indicate that they do not intend to be in compliance with this guidance, t=
hen there is an established process for litigating those differences with t=
he Department of Education.&nbsp; So there's an established process for thi=
s.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have to invent one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And w=
as it planned to make the announcement that there would be no loss of feder=
al funds for North Carolina at this time, in conjunction with the announcem=
ent from the Department of Education and Justice for
 this guidance for transgender students?&nbsp; Was that coincidental?<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, th=
ese were separate actions.&nbsp; So, again, as it relates to North Carolina=
 in consideration of HB2, the policy decision that was made, even as agenci=
es were considering whether or not the passage
 and implementation of HB2 would put a range of federally funded programs a=
t risk in the state of North Carolina, the decision that was made was to no=
t withhold any funding until the enforcement action that was announced by t=
he Department of Justice had made
 its way through the courts.&nbsp; So that was a very specific thing, and t=
hat was a response to developments that occurred this week with regard to t=
he situation in North Carolina.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This guidance is guidance=
 that has been in the works for years, but it is guidance that is broadly c=
onsistent with the kinds of principles that this President and this adminis=
tration has long fought for.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One l=
ast question.&nbsp; Even after you said yesterday, with regard to HB2, that=
 there would be no loss of federal funds to the state as the enforcement ac=
tion is ongoing in the courts, a Department of Education
 spokesperson said the review there is ongoing.&nbsp; Do you know why the s=
pokesperson would have said that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&=
#8217;t.&nbsp; But this is a little complicated, so it may have just been a=
 bit of a miscommunication.&nbsp; But as it relates specifically to HB2, no=
 federal agencies will be making a decision to withhold funding
 as a result of HB2 until the DOJ enforcement process has worked its way th=
rough the courts.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,=
 you said that you had received inquiries from the educational community, t=
hat you're responding to it.&nbsp; Have you received inquiries from other i=
ndustries, companies, elsewhere, also demanding this kind
 of clarity on how they should be treating transgender people?<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; It's c=
ertainly possible.&nbsp; I'm not aware of any guidance that's likely to att=
ract the amount of interest that this one has.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm g=
oing to go back to an idea you were talking about here with Kathleen.&nbsp;=
 Can you just clarify:&nbsp; Does the President see this as a clear-cut civ=
il rights issue?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think there obviously is a question of civil rights here.&nbsp; And there=
 is a question of how can we ensure that the civil rights of every student =
is protected.&nbsp; There's also a question of how
 do we ensure that the dignity and safety of every student is protected.&nb=
sp; And the guidance that we have put forward would do both.&nbsp; And agai=
n, I think that's why we're going to see a lot of school administrators com=
e forward and announce their intent to implement
 this guidance, or they're going just going to implement the guidance witho=
ut announcing it.&nbsp; Or, like many school administrators, they're alread=
y doing this kind of work to ensure the safety and dignity of every student=
 at the school.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And this is the thing tha=
t I was mentioning before.&nbsp; This is something that over the last week =
or two has been a pretty loud part of the political debate.&nbsp; But this =
is something that school administrators all across
 the country have been dealing with for quite some time.&nbsp; So they don&=
#8217;t have the luxury of falling back on talking points.&nbsp; They've go=
t to implement practical, real-world solutions that make a difference when =
it comes to the safety and dignity of students at
 their school.&nbsp; Posting a law enforcement officer outside of every bat=
hroom, and checking the birth certificate of people who are walking through=
 the door -- that's not a practical solution.&nbsp; That's not going to enh=
ance anybody&#8217;s safety.&nbsp; It's not going to
 enhance anybody&#8217;s dignity.&nbsp; That's impractical.&nbsp; It's root=
ed in a political argument that has very little grounding in actual facts.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I recognize that that is=
 sort of something that politicians frequently do, which is make arguments =
that may sound good politically just to score some political points.&nbsp; =
But to do that at the expense of students all across the country
 is something I don't think that they should do.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the=
 question of civil rights, I mean, are you parsing here that it's not a civ=
il rights issue?&nbsp; I mean, is this because the courts still haven't rul=
ed on whether there is protection under the law of transgender persons as
 a protected class, as an extension of sex discrimination?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think what&#8217;s undeniable is this is an issue where case law is still b=
eing built up.&nbsp; But, look, I think the reading of this guidance I thin=
k is pretty common-sense.&nbsp; You can't discriminate against people becau=
se
 of their gender identity.&nbsp; You can't force people with a specific gen=
der identity to use a different facility.&nbsp; That's discriminating again=
st them.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we should do is we sho=
uld treat every student the same.&nbsp; We should protect every student&#82=
17;s safety.&nbsp; We should protect every student&#8217;s dignity.&nbsp; W=
e should give every student access to individual-use facilities if that's w=
hat they
 prefer and they&#8217;re available.&nbsp; That's the cornerstone here of o=
ur argument.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're =
saying the case law is still being built up, but you're not going so far as=
 to say that this is on shaky legal ground because we still haven't seen th=
e federal protection?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
mean to telegraph any lack of confidence in the legal conclusion that's bee=
n reached here.&nbsp; The law is clear.&nbsp; And I think it should be nota=
ble that it's not just the Department of Education that signed on to
 this, but the Department of Justice has too.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point that I'm trying t=
o make, Margaret, is that this is something that is relatively new.&nbsp; T=
his is a relatively new policy consideration that school administrators are=
 having to make.&nbsp; This is a relatively new element of our political
 debate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was thinking about Chris =
earlier today because there was some discussion about whether or not the wo=
rd &#8220;transgender&#8221; had ever been uttered from the White House pod=
ium before.&nbsp; And I think that's a pretty apt illustration of how this
 debate is changing and has emerged.&nbsp; So it's new to our political deb=
ate, but this is not new when you consider what school administrators have =
had to do to ensure the safety and security of every student at their schoo=
l.&nbsp; This is something that they have
 to deal with every day.&nbsp; And that's why most of them don't have a lot=
 of tolerance for a bunch of cheap political rhetoric.&nbsp; They&#8217;re =
looking for solutions.&nbsp; And solutions are exactly what were provided b=
y the Department of Education in their letter today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; You're saying that this is a problem that school administrator=
s are dealing with, but then it was also a problem that didn&#8217;t exist =
until it entered this political realm.&nbsp; How long has the administratio=
n been getting
 questions about this?&nbsp; And did the North Carolina law prompt this gui=
dance or speed its timeline?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST: &nbsp;It did n=
ot.&nbsp; This is guidance that had been in the works for years.&nbsp; This=
 is relatively new to our political debate, but again, this is something th=
at has been the source of questions that the Department of Education
 has received for a number of years now.&nbsp; And again, those questions t=
o the Department of Education were not rooted in the desire of a high schoo=
l principal to make a political argument.&nbsp; It was rooted in the desire=
 of a high school principal to get some advice
 and to rely on the experts at the Department of Education to help him or h=
er ensure the safety and dignity of every single student at their school.&n=
bsp; That's what these principals are looking for.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, in most cases, princi=
pals aren't making a whole lot of money.&nbsp; It's not a glamorous job.&nb=
sp; But they do it because they care deeply about our children.&nbsp; They =
care deeply about providing a good, quality education to our kids.&nbsp; Th=
ey
 care deeply about the future of this country.&nbsp; They care deeply about=
 ensuring that a learning environment that they are responsible for managin=
g is one that's respectful, that's inclusive, and that is safe.&nbsp; And t=
hat's the kind of guidance that they were
 seeking from the Department of Education about how best to accomplish thos=
e goals.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn&#=
8217;t the administration think, though, or acknowledge at least, that ther=
e still is a very difficult process here?&nbsp; For example, the guidance s=
ays that when a student or the student&#8217;s parent or guardian, as appro=
priate, notifies
 the administration that the student will assert a gender identity that dif=
fers from their previous representations, the school will begin treating th=
at student consistent with the gender identity.&nbsp; And then it goes on t=
o say the gender transition can happen
 swiftly or over a long duration of time.&nbsp; If a principal is sitting i=
n front of a student, there could be questions of clarity, sincerity.&nbsp;=
 These are all things that are still not answered and out there, right?<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think this goes to Ron&#8217;s question.&nbsp; We acknowledge -- and, in fa=
ct, this is what should happen:&nbsp; School administrators do have to make=
 decisions about the best way to protect the dignity and safety of the stud=
ents
 at their school.&nbsp; And, yes, these are complicated issues, and that's =
setting aside even the kinds of arrangements that might be available to a s=
chool administrator.&nbsp; And so many of our schools are so wildly underfu=
nded, right?&nbsp; So you face this question about
 are we going to build a new bathroom, or are we going to provide up-to-dat=
e textbooks in our science classrooms.&nbsp; These are practical questions =
that administrators are going to have to answer for themselves.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why it would not be =
wise for the federal government to be imposing a solution or adding an addi=
tional requirement under the law.&nbsp; That's, in fact, why we have not do=
ne that, because we believe in the value and the importance
 of local control of schools.&nbsp; So we want schools and we want school a=
dministrators to be reaching the kinds of conclusions and the kinds of solu=
tions that are in the best interests of that community and that are in the =
best interests of the students who attend
 that school.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's also why you&#821=
7;ve seen the U.S. Department of Education draw upon solutions that have be=
en implemented by schools all across the country and surfacing those good i=
deas and sharing them with other school administrators that
 are trying to solve the same problem.&nbsp; That's a pretty high-functioni=
ng U.S. Department of Education providing a valuable service to school admi=
nistrators all across the country that are simply just trying to provide a =
safe and inclusive learning environment
 for their kids.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly,=
 the administration has come out very strongly on these issues, with the ac=
tion against North Carolina, with its guidance today.&nbsp; And those are d=
omestic issues.&nbsp; Internationally, the United States still has relation=
ships
 with and gives aid to countries that puts LGBT people behind bars, charges=
 them and executes them.&nbsp; Is the U.S. going to exert its influence int=
ernationally on this?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ri=
ch, I would tell you that we do.&nbsp; The President strongly advocates for=
 the rights of all people when he travels around the world.&nbsp; And we ce=
rtainly have made direct statements -- let me say it this way.&nbsp; The Pr=
esident
 has been crystal-clear both in public settings, but also in private settin=
gs, in his conversations with world leaders about our expectation and the p=
riority that we place in this country on human rights.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we t=
hreaten funding?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think that that has been a question that has been discussed in a number of =
other settings about whether or not significant human rights violations und=
ermine the relationship that the United States has with other
 countries, or in some cases, could even interrupt funding that is provided=
 by the United States to other countries.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an amusing situat=
ion a couple of years ago where there were questions about whether or not t=
he United States was going to interrupt the federal aid that we provide to =
Egypt in the aftermath of a crackdown on political dissidents
 there.&nbsp; Now, that situation is not funny, but it did provoke an amusi=
ng response here as I tried to describe the way that funding is provided to=
 individual countries and tranches, and so some people had some fun with th=
at.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it underscores that thi=
s is a policy priority of the President when he travels around the world.&n=
bsp; I&#8217;ve sat in rooms where the President is talking to world leader=
s, and the President of the United States respectfully but directly
 raises concerns about the treatment of minorities in their countries, incl=
uding the rights of gays and lesbians, and the rights of political dissiden=
ts, the rights of women, the rights of journalists.&nbsp; And, look, as a c=
ountry, these are values that we are
 deeply invested in and we use our influence around the world to try to adv=
ance those values.&nbsp; And the President makes that case rather forcefull=
y, both in public and in private, on American soil and when he&#8217;s abro=
ad.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly=
 on the guidance.&nbsp; Do you expect lawsuits?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, what I expect is that the vast majority of school administrators are g=
oing to take a look at this guidance and figure out a way to implement it i=
n their schools.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, t=
hank you.&nbsp; To follow up to the follow-up to the follow-up on the quest=
ion of transgender guidance.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#8217;=
m summoning a lot of patience today. <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does th=
e administration in its final months expect to issue any more guidance on t=
opics, issues that the Education Department is dealing with?&nbsp; For inst=
ance, there&#8217;s a hearing that happened this morning where mothers said=
 that
 football slowly killed her son because of concussions.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m =
curious, are there any other directives or issues or guidance that the admi=
nistration plans to give out that impacts the nation&#8217;s children, like=
 guidance on CTE?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
don&#8217;t have any announcements about additional Department of Education=
 guidance that&#8217;s likely to be issued in the months ahead.&nbsp; You c=
an certainly check with the Department of Education to see if they can give
 you a preview of what other policies they may have in store.<o:p></o:p></p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Zika=
, back to that for a second here.&nbsp; You mentioned yesterday a list of t=
hings that the Republican-led Congress has not done, such as Zika, Puerto R=
ico, opioid addiction.&nbsp; Well, the House passed --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Passing =
a budget.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing=
 a budget.&nbsp; The House passed 18 bills on opioid addiction yesterday.&n=
bsp; And on Zika, I know you mentioned that the funding is not on the curre=
nt legislation that&#8217;s making its way through right now.&nbsp; Does th=
e President expect
 to pass these pieces of legislation if they reach his desk?&nbsp; And are =
you championing the bipartisan effort by the Florida senators, Rubio and Ne=
lson, to give fully funded $1.9 billion?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 certainly welcome the bipartisan support that our Zika proposal has receiv=
ed, including from Senator Rubio.&nbsp; I think this reflects the degree to=
 which, for all of our policy differences with Senator Rubio, when
 it comes to looking out for the public health and wellbeing of the America=
n people, there shouldn&#8217;t be a partisan difference.&nbsp; And I think=
 Senator Rubio and Senator Nelson both understand the consequences for moth=
ers and babies in Florida of not doing everything
 possible to fight Zika.&nbsp; So we certainly welcome that show of biparti=
san support from Senator Rubio and Senator Nelson, and hope that the United=
 States Senate and the United States House will listen to the advice of our=
 public health experts.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The $1.9 billion number was=
 not chosen at random -- it actually reflects the sum total of efforts that=
 our public health professionals say they can and should take over the long=
 term to protect the American people from Zika.&nbsp; So if
 there are some public health professionals in the United States Congress t=
hat have looked at this carefully enough to offer up their own alternative,=
 they can do that.&nbsp; But $1.9 billion is what our public health profess=
ionals say that we need.&nbsp; $1.9 billion
 is what our bipartisan governors from all across the country believe that =
Congress should provide so that they can fight Zika in their communities.&n=
bsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there&#8217;s strong bip=
artisan support for our proposal because it&#8217;s rooted in the facts, be=
cause it&#8217;s rooted based on the advice of the top scientists in the co=
untry.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we welcome the support of Republican senators=
 like Senator
 Rubio.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we welcome the support of Democratic a=
nd Republican governors.&nbsp; And we would welcome bipartisan congressiona=
l passage of some legislation that&#8217;s long overdue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But wou=
ld the President sign anything less than the $1.9 billion request?<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
is is a process that, unfortunately, is still working its way through the U=
nited States Congress.&nbsp; We would have liked to have seen Congress begi=
n this effort many months ago.&nbsp; The President convened a meeting
 with his national security team and his public health experts in January t=
o discuss this issue.&nbsp; Just a couple of weeks later, he signaled his i=
ntent to request resources from Congress.&nbsp; Just a couple of weeks afte=
r that, we put forward a specific proposal
 that detailed how that $1.9 billion would be spent.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we worked at a very rapi=
d pace over the winter to put forward this request.&nbsp; Three months now =
have gone by, almost three months, and we&#8217;ve seen very little movemen=
t from Congress, and that&#8217;s been quite disappointing.&nbsp; But maybe
 as people like Senator Rubio weigh in and demonstrate bipartisan support f=
or this recommendation from our public health professionals, maybe we&#8217=
;ll build up some momentum here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suzanne.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, o=
n another issue.&nbsp; On the day that the President is hosting several wor=
ld leaders -- the refugee crisis, it was back in September that he pledged =
he wanted to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees into the country by the end of fi=
scal
 2016, October.&nbsp; So you have some time, but the latest State Departmen=
t statistic is showing just a little more than 2,000.&nbsp; Is the administ=
ration confident that you&#8217;ll reach your goal of 10,000 by October?&nb=
sp; And can you also explain some of the delays and the
 slower-than-expected process that they've gone through?&nbsp; What&#8217;s=
 been some of the issues?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Su=
zanne, the challenge here is simply this -- that individuals who enter the =
United States through the refugee program are subjected to more screening, =
more background checks than any other individual who tries
 to enter the United States.&nbsp; These individuals have to undergo a back=
ground check, they&#8217;re interviewed in person, biometric data about the=
m is collected, and then all of that information is then run through databa=
ses that are maintained by the United States
 military, U.S. intelligence agencies, other national security organization=
s in the United States, but also law enforcement organizations in the Unite=
d States and law enforcement organizations overseas.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So all of that work takes t=
ime.&nbsp; And the President was clear that we&#8217;re not going to cut co=
rners when it comes to security, even as we meet this ambitious goal.&nbsp;=
 So I don&#8217;t think anybody was under the expectation that there would =
be
 a linear increase in the number of refugees that would be admitted to the =
United States.&nbsp; I think we always contemplated that this is a program =
that would ramp up over time as we added capacity and as we added our capac=
ity to conduct these background checks.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there&#8217;s no denying=
 that there&#8217;s a lot of work to do to meet this goal.&nbsp; It is an a=
mbitious goal and it will be challenging to get it done.&nbsp; But last yea=
r around this time, there were questions raised about whether or not we wou=
ld
 meet our previous refugee goal because we&#8217;d fallen behind pace.&nbsp=
; But yet, based on the good work of our professionals at the Department of=
 State and the Department of Homeland Security, we did succeed in meeting t=
hat goal last year.&nbsp; And the President has
 made clear that meeting the more ambitious goal this year is a top priorit=
y.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m confident that all the people who are working on thi=
s problem understands the priority that the President has placed on this is=
sue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How has=
 the political rhetoric, the harsh language, and some of the fear that&#821=
7;s been drummed up around immigration and around the refugee crisis impact=
ed the administration&#8217;s ability to get them through the pipeline?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t think it&#8217;s had an impact.&nbsp; The people who are working on t=
his inside the U.S. government are professionals, and they understand exact=
ly what needs to be done when it comes to implementing these vigorous backg=
round
 checks.&nbsp; They understand why it&#8217;s important that a thorough vet=
ting be conducted before refugees are admitted to this country.&nbsp; And t=
hat&#8217;s what they&#8217;re doing.&nbsp; And the political noise has not=
 impacted their ability to do their jobs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And jus=
t to be clear, the administration is confident it will be able to reach its=
 goal of 10,000?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I am con=
fident that the people who are operating this program understand that the P=
resident of the United States thinks this is a top priority, and they have =
work to do to meet this challenging goal.&nbsp; So we certainly
 intend to reach this goal.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Janet.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, Jos=
h.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Going back to immigration, many of the critics --=
 immigration critics have called for refugee status for the Central America=
n families.&nbsp; Will there be any action on that?&nbsp; And would you say=
 that this is
 in correlation to the spike of Central American families crossing the bord=
er, that have been apprehended at the border in the last few months?<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, it&#=
8217;s not.&nbsp; As Secretary Johnson has indicated, the operations that a=
re underway are a continuation of operations that were previously announced=
.&nbsp; At the same time, I do think it is important for people who are in
 Central America and contemplating making the dangerous journey through Mex=
ico to try to get to the United States, these operations should make clear =
that that&#8217;s not an option -- that&#8217;s not a viable option.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should also make clear t=
o parents in particular that child smugglers who say they can sneak their k=
ids into the United States are not telling the truth.&nbsp; And, in fact, e=
ntrusting your children to those smugglers is dangerous and
 we strongly encourage people not to do it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that&#8217;s an importan=
t thing.&nbsp; It&#8217;s important for people to understand what the polic=
y is in the United States.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also important for people to un=
derstand what we have tried to do.&nbsp; And what we have tried to do is to=
 enhance the
 assistance that the United States provides to countries like Guatemala and=
 Honduras.&nbsp; Last year, in the omnibus budget proposal, about $700 mill=
ion was provided by Congress to improve the security situation in some of t=
hose countries or make contributions
 to try to improve the security situation there and try to address some of =
the root causes that would prompt people to undertake this dangerous journe=
y.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if this serves to discou=
rage people from considering to make this journey, that would be a good thi=
ng.&nbsp; But our motivation for carrying out these operations is rooted in=
 President Obama and Secretary Johnson's commitment to enforcing
 the law.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to do that in a way that is humane.&nbsp;=
 We&#8217;re going to make sure that people have access to due process.&nbs=
p; The only people who would be subject to operations like this are people =
who are subject to an order of removal by an immigration court.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only people who could b=
e part of an operation like this and removed from the country would be peop=
le who have exhausted any sort of claims for asylum or humanitarian relief.=
&nbsp; So there are rules that govern this, but at the end
 of the day, the President is serious about enforcing the law.&nbsp; The Pr=
esident does continue to believe that there is a better way, and that compr=
ehensive immigration reform legislation through Congress would improve the =
way that we manage our immigration system
 in this country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the=
re is no viable way for refugee status for these Central American families?=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
ere has been a discussion about working with the United Nations to allow pe=
ople in Central America to apply for asylum and be considered, be carefully=
 vetted for inclusion in some sort of refugee process.&nbsp; And
 we have worked diligently with the United Nations to try to get that proce=
ss up and running.&nbsp; There&#8217;s still a lot of work to do with regar=
d to establishing that program, but there has been some consideration that&=
#8217;s been given to that idea.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What&#8217;s notable abou=
t that is that is an application process that doesn&#8217;t begin in the Un=
ited States, it actually begins in Central America.&nbsp; And, again, that =
should serve as an encouragement for people who are interested
 and think that they may be eligible for that kind of humanitarian relief t=
hat they can apply for it in their home country.&nbsp; They don't have to u=
ndertake the dangerous journey to try to get to the United States.&nbsp; Th=
ey don't have to trust a smuggler.&nbsp; They can
 apply for that status in their home country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gardiner.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, a=
s you know, data out today show pretty sharp increases in murder rates in t=
he last few months in about 20 different cities.&nbsp; Is that a reason for=
 concern?&nbsp; And do you have any more to say on Comey&#8217;s interpreta=
tion of that
 data?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have anything to say beyond what I said yesterday.&nbsp; I will say that wh=
en Director Comey was talking about this he acknowledged that there&#8217;s=
 a lot of ambiguity about the broader trends, because in some parts of
 the country we haven't seen an increase in violent crime and, overall, cri=
me across the country is at or near historic lows.&nbsp; The example that h=
e raised that I think is an illustrative one is that we have seen a spike i=
n violent crime in Dallas, but not in
 Houston.&nbsp; So the question is what accounts for that differing environ=
ment?&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so we've got experts =
at the Department of Justice who are taking a look at these situations.&nbs=
p; What President Obama did last year was actually direct his Attorney Gene=
ral to ramp up the assistance that we can
 provide to local law enforcement that is trying to fight these violent cri=
me spikes in some communities in the country.&nbsp; And that additional ass=
istance has taken a variety of forms.&nbsp; It has included widespread stin=
g operations that were carried out by U.S.
 marshals to round up individuals who were wanted for violent crimes.&nbsp;=
 There&#8217;s also additional assistance that's been provided to individua=
l law enforcement organizations to improve training of their law enforcemen=
t officers to make them more effective.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So there is some assistan=
ce that the federal government can provide to law enforcement agencies that=
 are dealing with these kinds of spikes.&nbsp; But it is unclear what&#8217=
;s contributing to those spikes, because we do
 know that as a general matter, all across the country crime rates remain a=
t or near historic lows.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You d=
ismissed his notion that there is some sort of Ferguson effect and I think =
you talked about there&#8217;s no evidence to back that up.&nbsp; I guess w=
hat I'm trying to understand is do you think that he is wrong,
 or do you think that he just doesn&#8217;t have the evidence to substantia=
te what he said?&nbsp; There&#8217;s sort of a difference -- either you're =
not sure, or you're sure he&#8217;s wrong. Can you help me untangle that?<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I thin=
k the point that I was making yesterday is -- and this is based on a conver=
sation I had with the President -- this administration makes policy decisio=
ns that are rooted in evidence, that are
 rooted in science.&nbsp; We can't make broad, sweeping policy decisions or=
 draw policy conclusions based on anecdotal evidence.&nbsp; That's irrespon=
sible and ultimately counterproductive.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The President actually ha=
s a lot of confidence in the vast majority of law enforcement officers all =
across the country to do their jobs and to do them well and to do them self=
lessly and to do them in a way that
 is effective in fighting crime and protecting civil rights at the same tim=
e.&nbsp; The President does not believe -- at least he has not seen evidenc=
e to substantiate the suggestion that there are a significant number of pol=
ice officers out there who are unwilling
 to do their job because they fear being filmed by somebody&#8217;s cellpho=
ne.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But, look, if there&#8217=
;s evidence that materializes to substantiate that claim, then we should fi=
gure out something to do about it.&nbsp; So I guess the point is there isn'=
t evidence out there to draw any firm conclusions
 about what&#8217;s happening.&nbsp; The President does have a lot of confi=
dence in the vast majority of law enforcement officers that are selflessly =
protecting our communities and doing it in the right way.&nbsp; But we shou=
ld look at this problem and get to the bottom of
 what exactly is going on.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And Director Comey did in=
dicate that it's unclear what&#8217;s going on.&nbsp; He acknowledged that =
it's a complicated situation.&nbsp; That's where he used the Dallas-Houston=
 comparison to illustrate that there is no clear answer
 to what&#8217;s going on here, and what Director Comey said is we need to =
spend more time trying to figure out what&#8217;s happening.&nbsp; And he&#=
8217;s right about that.&nbsp; And we should use the evidence that is uncov=
ered to formulate an appropriate politics response.&nbsp; And that's
 what the President believes the priority should be.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh,=
 I mean, there&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty about everything.&nbsp; You guy=
s are swimming in uncertainty.&nbsp; We all are.&nbsp; I mean, one has to a=
ct in the face of uncertainty anyway.&nbsp; You're suggesting, it seems to =
me,
 that you're not acting because you don't have evidence, when, in fact, in =
nearly every case, you have to act in the face of uncertainty anyway.&nbsp;=
 Can you help me sort of, again, untangle that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I thin=
k what I would say is we do often -- the President often talks about this, =
about how often uncertainty impacts the decisions that he&#8217;s required =
to make as the President of the United States.&nbsp;
 That uncertainty typically applies to situations in which there are no gua=
rantees that what the President is prepared to choose will work.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, for example, if we de=
termine that the so-called Ferguson effect is potentially contributing to a=
n increase in crime, then we need to sit down and figure out what can we do=
 to address it. And there will be some
 uncertainty about whether or not that will work.&nbsp; But there won't be =
uncertainty about the fact that we're trying to solve the right problem, th=
at we're trying to solve a problem that actually exists, and so collecting =
evidence to verify what is possible to
 know even if, once we get to the stage of considering solutions, there wil=
l naturally be some uncertainty about what the future holds.&nbsp; But even=
 in that case, there will be some evidence to inform the choices that the P=
resident has to make.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#=
8217;ve got more dead bodies.&nbsp; I mean, that's clearly a problem.&nbsp;=
 Whether --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, no=
, I'm not denying that there is a problem as it relates to the spike in vio=
lent crime in some communities across the country.&nbsp; That's why the Pre=
sident, last year, ordered the Attorney General
 to provide some additional assistance to law enforcement agencies.&nbsp; W=
e saw the Marshals Service carry out a widespread sweep that resulted in ab=
out 8,000 fugitives being captured.&nbsp; So there&#8217;s plenty of eviden=
ce to indicate that there are some communities --
 again, this is not a widespread phenomenon, at least based on what we know=
 now -- but there is evidence to indicate that there are some communities, =
including the President&#8217;s hometown of Chicago, that are experiencing =
a troubling surge in violent crime.&nbsp; And
 the President has ordered action, specific action to try to address it.&nb=
sp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But there&#8217;s not evi=
dence at this point to link that surge in violent crime to the so-called vi=
ral video effect, or the Ferguson effect.&nbsp; There&#8217;s just no evide=
nce to substantiate that. And there&#8217;s some anecdotal
 evidence to indicate that that may be having some impact, but there&#8217;=
s plenty of anecdotal evidence that the vast majority of law enforcement of=
ficers, men and women across the country, are doing their job as well as ev=
er; that they&#8217;re fighting crime, that
 they&#8217;re protecting people&#8217;s civil rights, that they&#8217;re a=
cting selflessly and bravely to communicate -- or to protect the communitie=
s that they are sworn to serve and protect.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that's the ambiguity t=
hat exists.&nbsp; And that's what we need to get to the bottom of before we=
 start offering up specific solutions.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On th=
e transgender question, can you help us untangle the President&#8217;s role=
 himself?&nbsp; Like did he play a direct role in the guidance?&nbsp; Did h=
e meet with his Attorney General in the last week or recent weeks to
 discuss this?&nbsp; Did he meet with his Education Secretary in the last w=
eek or the week before to discuss this?&nbsp; Did he encourage the issue hi=
mself of this guidance?&nbsp; And what in particular might have persuaded h=
im that this was the right thing to do?&nbsp; So can
 you -- a little bit more about what President Obama himself, what role he =
played in this?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; What I=
 can tell you about the President is he was he was regularly updated as thi=
s policy process moved forward.&nbsp; So he was certainly aware of the poli=
cy that was under deliberation by the Department
 of Education.&nbsp; And I can tell you that the outcome does reflect his v=
iew that the Department of Education should be responsive to requests that =
they&#8217;ve received from school administrators and that the Department o=
f Education has an obligation to put forward
 tangible, real-world suggestions for how this problem can be addressed in =
communities all across the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The President also agrees=
 that imposing an additional requirement under the existing law is not some=
thing the Department of Education needs to be doing right now.&nbsp; So it'=
s possible, and in fact, important for the
 U.S. Department of Education to play an appropriate role in offering this =
guidance to school administrators that are trying to enhance the safety and=
 protect the dignity of every student in their community.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The s=
uggestion is that he&#8217;s sort of a bystander to this guidance coming ou=
t -- that it was part of a process, that it came out of the departments, an=
d he didn&#8217;t really do much to encourage or discourage, it
 just sort of happened.&nbsp; Is that an appropriate interpretation?&nbsp; =
Or did he play a more active role?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
obviously the President sets a longer-term vision for the priorities that h=
is administration is going to pursue.&nbsp; I can't speak to all of the con=
versations that President Obama has had with the
 Education Secretary about this or other matters.&nbsp; But I think it is f=
air to say -- and I think it's important -- that this kind of announcement =
reflects the President&#8217;s strongly held view about the need to prevent=
 discrimination, but also the need to protect
 the safety and dignity of every student in America.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this does reflect the =
President&#8217;s view.&nbsp; But, at the same time, there&#8217;s an estab=
lished policy process for considering these kinds of questions and ensuring=
 that the outcome reflects the priorities that were set
 by the President of the United States. In this case, they were.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an i=
nterview with the Rutgers student newspaper, President Obama defended his a=
dministration&#8217;s crackdown on leaks and press freedom by saying the pr=
osecutions were a small sampling.&nbsp; But the truth is the administration=
 has
 targeted more whistleblowers and prosecuted more leak investigations -- in=
cluding of my colleagues -- than all previous administrations combined.&nbs=
p; Can you explain the President&#8217;s remarks?&nbsp; Does he -- is he aw=
are of just how many more leak investigations this
 administration has conducted versus all of his predecessors?<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
don't think we're going to get deep into this today.&nbsp; But let me say a=
 couple of things about this.&nbsp; The first is, what the President said i=
s true, that a number of those investigations were initiated by the previou=
s
 administration.&nbsp; What is also true is questions of criminal investiga=
tions and criminal prosecutions are not influenced by the President or any =
other political operatives in the White House.&nbsp; These are decisions th=
at are made by Department of Justice prosecutors.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the way the process =
should work.&nbsp; And it would be inappropriate for the President to inter=
vene either way.&nbsp; It would be inappropriate for the President of the U=
nited States to intervene with the federal prosecutor and say, you
 should go investigate this individual.&nbsp; It would be just as inappropr=
iate for the President to intervene and say, you should lay off that guy fr=
om The New York Times.&nbsp; That would be inappropriate too.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've got a Department of J=
ustice that is insulated from politics for a very good reason.&nbsp; And yo=
u should check with them for insight into the prosecutorial decisions that =
attorneys at the Department of Justice were making.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- that=
 these prosecutions took place during his administration?&nbsp; I mean, he =
then went on to sort of talk about how his notion himself is that there sho=
uld be as much freedom as possible.&nbsp; As you say, these prosecutions to=
ok place
 during his administration, and your suggestion is that it took place essen=
tially without any input from him or any of his direct -- in the White Hous=
e.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; And I'm =
suggesting it would be a genuine scandal if that were not the case.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think=
 that's right.&nbsp; So is he sorry that this number of prosecutions took p=
lace during his administration, given the fact that he can do nothing about=
 it?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nbsp=
; I think the President does believe that people who swore an oath to prote=
ct sensitive information should follow it.&nbsp; And the President does bel=
ieve that the Department of Justice and other agencies have a role in
 enforcing that oath.&nbsp; And that enforcement should take place without =
regard to political considerations.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s just such an in=
quiry that's going on right now that I'm not going to comment on, but I thi=
nk is an indication that this is something, at least
 when it comes to the handling of these kinds of matters by the Department =
of Justice, that should be firmly insulated from politics, and therefore, i=
nsulated from influence by the President of the United States.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you =
know of any previous state dinner that celebrated five countries at once, J=
osh?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't.=
&nbsp; That would make tonight&#8217;s event all the more special.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Jonathan, =
I'll give you the last one.&nbsp; And then we'll do the week ahead.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, t=
hank you.&nbsp; The President is going to Rutgers on Sunday.&nbsp; Why did =
he decide to go to Rutgers?&nbsp; Were any loud voices urging him to go?&nb=
sp; And can you give us an advance preview of what he&#8217;s going to say =
there?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, fo=
r years, students and other leaders at Rutgers have been encouraging Presid=
ent Obama to consider delivering the commencement address this year because=
 it&#8217;s the 250th anniversary of the first commencement address
 -- the first commencement ceremonies that were hosted at Rutgers.&nbsp; So=
 the President is looking forward to participating in this historic occasio=
n.&nbsp; It certainly is the mark of a remarkable institution of higher lea=
rning.&nbsp; I know that Rutgers, in particular,
 is quite proud of the class of 2016, and the President is looking forward =
to congratulating that class on all that they have achieved.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think he&#8217;ll have =
some observations about the world that they&#8217;re prepared to enter.&nbs=
p; They&#8217;re prepared to enter a country and a planet that&#8217;s rapi=
dly changing.&nbsp; And these students are as well-prepared as any students
 have ever been to confront those challenges and use this changing environm=
ent to create a better world.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what makes the Preside=
nt so fundamentally optimistic about the future of our country, and that op=
timism is manifested quite well in this year&#8217;s
 graduating class at Rutgers.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with that, why don&#8217=
;t I do a week ahead?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will he=
 visit the (inaudible) at all while he&#8217;s at Rutgers?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t have any notes about any unplanned, any unscheduled movements for the=
 President, but we&#8217;ll see if he is able to make the most of his visit=
 to Rutgers.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So on Sunday -- this is not=
 written down here, but obviously on Sunday, the President will travel to N=
ew Jersey and deliver the commencement address at the 250th commencement at=
 Rutgers University.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Monday, the President wi=
ll host a Medal of Valor ceremony at the White House.&nbsp; The Medal of Va=
lor is awarded to public safety officers who have exhibited exceptional cou=
rage, regardless of personal safety, in the attempt to save
 or protect others from harm.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Tuesday, the President w=
ill attend meetings here at the White House.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Wednesday, the President=
 will participate in a DNC roundtable.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Thursday, the President =
will award the National Medals of Science and Technology and Innovation to =
17 scientists, engineers, mathematicians and innovators.&nbsp; The Medal of=
 Science recognizes individuals who have made outstanding contributions
 to science, engineering and mathematics.&nbsp; The National Medal of Techn=
ology and Innovation recognizes those who have made lasting contributions t=
o America&#8217;s competitiveness and quality of life and helped the nation=
&#8217;s technological workforce.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Friday, the President wi=
ll attend meetings at the White House.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on Saturday, the P=
resident will depart Washington, D.C. en route Hanoi, Vietnam.&nbsp; This t=
rip will highlight the President&#8217;s ongoing commitment to the U.S. reb=
alance to Asia and the Pacific, designed to increase U.S. diplomatic,
 economic, and security engagement with the country and peoples of the regi=
on.&nbsp; So this is obviously next Saturday, a week from tomorrow, and we&=
#8217;ll have a lot more to say about the President&#8217;s trip to the Asi=
a Pacific during next week&#8217;s briefings.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with all that, I hope yo=
u guys all have a great weekend.&nbsp; See you on Monday.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Startin=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I resist=

week.<o:p></o:p></p>
