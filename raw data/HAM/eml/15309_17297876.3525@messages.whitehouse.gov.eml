PRESS BRIEFING

BY SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST;

DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR=20

FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS BEN RHODES;

U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CEO TOM DONOHUE;

AND DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY CEO ANDREW LIVERIS=20



Hannover Messe Fairgrounds

Hannover, Germany=20





9:53 A.M. CEST





 MR. EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. It's nice to see you. We've got so=
me special guests at the top of our briefing today. I'm joined by Tom Don=
ohue, who is the CEO of the United States Chamber of Commerce. To his rig=
ht is Andrew Liveris, who is the CEO of Dow. Both of them are obviously h=
ere traveling with the President to attend the Hannover Messe.=20



They are part -- there are a couple of reasons why it's significant that =
theyre here. Theyre part of the contingent of about 350 U.S. business lea=
ders who are here at Hannover, including about 200 business leaders repre=
senting small and medium U.S. companies. So they are a good representatio=
n of the U.S. business communitys participation in this presidential trip=
.



In addition, both Tom and Andrew joined the President last night for dinn=
er with Chancellor Merkel and other business leaders, and it was an oppor=
tunity for business leaders in our two countries to have a conversation a=
bout the business climate, and opportunities for expanding business betwe=
en our two countries.



So theyll have some insight on a range of issues. And each of them has pr=
epared short opening statements that theyll deliver. And then I'll call o=
n you and you can ask them whatever questions you would like. After theyv=
e concluded, then I'll be joined by my colleague, Ben Rhodes, and he and =
I can take your questions on other areas of interest.



 So, with that, Tom, do you want to go first?



 MR. DONOHUE: Well, thank you very much, Josh. And it's very nice to see =
you all. I'm pleased to be here with Andrew Liveris from DOW, one of Amer=
icas great CEOs, involved in extraordinary changes in his industry, and y=
oull be pleased to visit with him.



 Let me begin by thanking the President, Ambassador Froman, Secretary Pri=
tzker and others for making this trip. I was here a number of years ago, =
and encouraged them to do this because this is an extraordinary opportuni=
ty to come together with people from the EU, particularly from Germany, t=
o talk about what we have to do to strengthen our economies and to pass t=
he trade bills that are going to help us do that.=20



 It sends a strong message -- their presence -- about the vital importanc=
e of the transatlantic partnership, the largest commercial relationship i=
n the world and one based on shared values. No other partnership in the l=
ast 70 years has done more to advance global economic growth, establish a=
 robust and fair trading system, and to enforce the democratic opportunit=
y, security and values around the world. Like the President, the U.S. Cha=
mber is here to bolster that relationship.



 Last night, as Josh indicated, we had a great discussion with President =
Obama and German Chancellor Merkel on these issues and others. Today, the=
 Chamber will also be cohosting a bilateral business summit here at the f=
air focusing on the importance of the steps we've got to take to shore up=
 our economies and to strengthen the relationship between the U.S. and th=
e EU. And tomorrow I'll be in Munich to pursue these very same arguments =
with the business leaders there.



 Our primary message on this trip is that the transatlantic relationship =
is more important than ever, and so is our global leadership in that rega=
rd. We may not see eye-to-eye all the time with this administration -- no=
r should we -- but we stand shoulder-to-shoulder when it comes to advanci=
ng job-creating trade agreements like the Transatlantic Trade and Investm=
ent Partnership and the TPP.=20



 The one that we're discussing here is a once-in-a-generation opportunity=
 not only to boost our economic advantage, but to fundamentally strengthe=
n this relationship. It's going to spur jobs and investment. It's going t=
o reduce needless regulation. It's going to take away barriers, and it's =
going to help us in a geopolitical way as well.



 Later today, we'll all be filing a joint -- the Chamber and others -- en=
couragement, a public statement that sort of follows what I just said. We=
 appreciate the Presidents support of TPP. The demands on the President, =
no matter whether you agree with him, you don't agree with him, whatever =
issue is on the table, are unbelievable. And that he took this time to co=
me here was very important, and I congratulate him for it.=20



 And thank you very much.



 MR. LIVERIS: Thank you, Tom. Great to share the podium with you and to t=
ake this opportunity to also reinforce the importance of this trip and th=
ank the President for taking the leadership to be the number-one salesman=
 for the United States of America.



 And I would say that as a global company with a large presence here in G=
ermany. We have 17 facilities, 14 manufacturing plants, 5,000 employees. =
It's our third largest country, and we've been here over 60 years. We are=
 as German as we are American. And we believe that the human spirit shift=
ing back on trade as the primary way of seeking to get economic balance a=
round the world -- from all the technologies available to us, whether it =
be in the United States or Germany, or in the EU, in general -- effective=
 water treatment to energy efficiency, to all the things that we can inve=
nt and innovate, this cross-border trading mechanism is key.=20



And, of course, being here at Hannover Masse, which is the bastion of the=
 civil world of trade and investment, from a German perspective, post-Wor=
ld War II -- we heard from both the President and the Chancellor yesterda=
y in the opening of how important this site was to all things innovation =
and trade.



 There is a rich history here, and both the President and the Chancellor =
referred to it not only in their speeches, but also at the dinner. I must=
 say I sat there in awe of seeing these two great leaders with their two =
business delegations talking business and government and at its intersect=
ions. Because like the Chamber, and like all of us who operate at the int=
ersection of business and government, it's vital that we're at the table,=
 and it's vital that this is a public-private collaboration of which the =
two leaders sponsor.



 And the mechanism to achieve that to the next level for the benefit of a=
ll European citizens and American citizens is T-TIP, and getting that thr=
ough the agenda this year. This is a comprehensive negotiation. It means =
a lot of hard work. It means to take what Tom talked about to the next le=
vel of transatlantic cooperation.=20



I heard the President last night say that there is no more important rela=
tionship than the Atlantic relationship to the United States of America. =
This is very true as well on the business side. Why? Because of innovatio=
n centricity. These two cultures and sets of countries cooperated through=
 postwar environments, Cold War environments, and now through a trade and=
 innovation environment.



 And I'm very proud of the fact that T-TIP has bubbled to the top of the =
agenda for both the continent of Europe as well as, of course, the United=
 States. The AmCham EU Group did a study that said it could lift Germany'=
s GDP by 0.6 percent if T-TIP was adopted.=20



We have our work to do to talk about the benefits, and I want to home in =
on two particular benefits. The one, a rising tide lifts all boats. There=
 is no compromise on regulatory standards here. There's dilution of the g=
reat EU standards, nor the great American standards, but a harmonization =
to remove frictions costs, to have these standards speak to each other, t=
o do it in such a way that's transparent so that it can lift exporters of=
 both nations -- Made in America, Made in Germany, Made in the EU as a hi=
gher standard.=20



We owe it to humanity that, in fact, we go to the second point on making =
that happen, which is leadership. Both the Chancellor and the President a=
nd, for that matter, all the EU leaders have to embrace this as global le=
adership. Just like Paris and COP21, there's no more important sense of l=
eadership on trade than trade and investment across borders, and to put t=
ransparency in standards to raise the quality of life for all of our citi=
zens.



Those two reasons are the reasons people like me come to missions like th=
is. It's important to take time out of our agenda to show up and reinforc=
e these two leaders in what they have to do. We have a job to do to commu=
nicate. Your job and our job is to allow all of our citizens to understan=
d why this is good for them, why this, in fact, will help them on quality=
 of life, and will help them on increasing wages and making them part of =
an improving economy, not one that suffers at the hands of trade, as some=
 people are prone to think.



So, with that, I'd like to hand it over to Josh, and take Q&A. Thank you,=
 Josh.



MR. EARNEST: Thank you, Andrew.=20



Questions. Justin, you want to go first?



Q Yes, I had a few for you guys. I was wondering if you could talk a litt=
le bit about what you see as the likelihood of TPP negotiations -- or the=
 TPP vote finishing this year, and T-TIP negotiations finishing by the en=
d of the President's term. I'm also wondering if there was any discussion=
 at dinner with Chancellor Merkel of Volkswagen and their emissions probl=
ems, and how -- well, any discussion on that at all.=20



And finally, Mr. Donahue, there's news back home the Kasich and Cruz camp=
aigns are now coordinating together to sort of prevent Donald Trump from =
getting the number of delegates he needs for the Republican nomination. (=
Laughter.) I know the Chamber has expressed concern over his trade polici=
es before, and so I'm wondering if that's something you endorse.



MR. DONAHUE: Well, first of all, let me be very clear. Last night there w=
as no discussion of Volkswagen.=20



And now let's get to the other issues. I think your question we expected,=
 by the way, because we're thinking about it all the time -- is when is t=
he vote on TPP going to happen? Well, as you know, in the Senate, it's go=
ing to be the closest vote for Senate in a long, long time, and there are=
 four or five people that are running -- that are in the Republican caucu=
s that would be at risk, perhaps, if they voted for it right now, today. =
And so I would say that that would -- that vote in the Senate would come =
after the election. It will come.=20



The vote in the House, with any luck, could be a little bit earlier -- no=
t much. And the reason that I would encourage that is because it will be =
hard to cram two votes into a lame duck issue.



Now, let me just say one deal about those votes. In a tough economy, in a=
n election year, nobody is in favor of trade. It seems it's something the=
y can blame on everybody else, and so it's hard to get a vote. But when y=
ou do vote a trade bill, what you need is you need to win by two votes --=
 one vote to win, and one vote in case somebody dies on the way to the vo=
te. And everybody else can be excused from the vote. And we don't care ho=
w many we win by -- we only care that we win. And both of these votes wil=
l, in my opinion, be held before the end of this administration.



On the question of the T-TIP, that will go through the Congress much easi=
er -- much more easily -- because it's a relationship with our largest tr=
ading partner who, for the longest time, said to have stronger regulation=
s, more favorable labor regulations and other issues, and with that as an=
 argument, I think we could get that done in a very convenient and more e=
asily passed. But it's going to take a while to get people here and peopl=
e in the United States focused on doing not a half-baked bill but a reall=
y good trade agreement. And I would hope that you'd see something happen =
there in the next 90 days.



MR. EARNEST: Other questions this morning?



Yes, this gentleman in the back.



Q You just said that last night there were no talks about Volkswagen, so =
I wonder, what about today?



MR. LIVERIS: I've heard nothing.=20



MR. DONAHUE: I've heard nothing, either. We've been at different kinds of=
 meetings early today, and so we've not been with the President or the Ch=
ancellor, or with the leaders of the governments. We'll see more of those=
 people today. I don't expect that while everybody is trying to drive tra=
de and investment we'll hear too much about that.



MR. EARNEST: Let me just add one part to this, which is that obviously th=
e President is constrained in what he would be able to discuss on this pa=
rticular issue, given the ongoing legal proceedings. That certainly appli=
es in public, but the truth is, that also implies to his discussions in p=
rivate, as well. So I certainly can't speak for what kinds of conversatio=
ns may be going on among business leaders who are here, but I can tell yo=
u that the President does not anticipate engaging in discussions about th=
at specific issue, either in public or in private.



Other questions?



Yes, sir.



Q My question is about procurement Buy American -- we had an interview wi=
th Sigmar Gabriel yesterday, the German federal minister for the economy,=
 who said there will be no deal on T-TIP if the U.S. doesn't open up thei=
r procurement markets. And I guess he means not only on the federal but o=
n the state level. So is there any room in the negotiations actually from=
 the American side to compromise here?



MR. LIVERIS: I'll answer that by stating nothing specific. There was actu=
ally an anecdote at dinner, but, look, operating in 162 countries, we run=
 into buy X all the time, so buy China, and China buy duh-duh-duh. This i=
s one of the biggest non-tariff tariff barriers. So speaking to common ha=
rmonization of trade starts to get at those sorts of barriers so that you=
 don't force someone to go build a factory in your home jurisdiction to h=
ave the local procurement requirement fulfilled.



I know, listening to Mike Froman last night, that the Chancellor and the =
President were urging the two negotiators to get to the details of negoti=
ations yet this summer. And I know that's one of the topics of great impo=
rt. But nothing specific -- unless, Tom, you had something.



MR. DONAHUE: The Chamber of Commerce of the United States is fundamentall=
y opposed to the Buy America efforts that are making it more difficult to=
 negotiate really strong trade agreements. Most of that comes from the st=
ates -- individual states -- not from the federal approach. And generally=
, we're able to work those out, even when the states put them in place, b=
ecause when they find out the problem it creates for their own state, we =
usually find a way around it.



But I think to get a T-TIP agreement we're going to have to pretty much p=
ut something in there that codifies that.



MR. EARNEST: Other questions?



Yes, sir.



Q Mr. Liveris, I'm just curious whether you could elaborate a little bit =
on the anecdote you just mentioned yesterday at the dinner.



MR. LIVERIS: The anecdote was exactly just -- the leaders were very relax=
ed. And if I could talk about the ambience of the relationship -- and I'v=
e been around it a little bit, not as much as maybe Tom has -- it's an ex=
ceptionally good relationship, and it permeated the whole dinner conversa=
tion. And I've been part of those sorts of dinners in other forums -- not=
 necessarily between the Chancellor and the President -- but just to see =
the way it was conducted -- and the Chancellor is just incredible in the =
sense of her humbleness and her ability to make you feel at home. It was =
just a perfect hosting event. And there were friendly little jabs at each=
 other about what could be the basis of a T-TIP negotiation. I think this=
 was all done in good humor, so anecdotes occurred. I don't know, Tom, if=
 there was any more to it than that.



MR. DONOHUE: No, I think that was great.=20



 Q Mr. Donohue, I'd like to follow up on Justins question about the Cruz =
and the Kasich campaigns and your reaction.=20



 MR. DONOHUE: I thought I did a good job --=20



 Q Yes, I thought I'd give it one more shot.=20



 MR. DONOHUE: Look, I've been around a long time, and before most other e=
lections you run into people in your business or in your personal life an=
d theyd ask you about the election, and your reaction is, well, you have =
this view, and the polls said this and this is what you might expect. Qui=
te frankly, we're not sure where this whole thing is going. Will it end u=
p in an open convention? Nobody knows. And there are challenges on the De=
mocratic side, as well.



 I think it's very hard to speculate. It is true that some are trying to =
figure out a way to head off Mr. Trump. At the rate he is gathering deleg=
ates that may be very hard. Anybody that could tell you where this thing =
plays out in July is a lot smarter than I am. But I would simply say that=
 I didnt have them before, but I now have hotel rooms in Cleveland.



 Q And I also wanted to ask, when we hear discussion of the way -- the in=
tersection of trade and the election year, it almost sounds as if it's an=
 issue to be put aside if youre a pro-trade person. We have a potential n=
ominee on both sides of the aisle who are against TPP. Is there going to =
be somebody making a proactive trade case in the coming election year? Wo=
uldn't that help your chances to succeed?



 MR. DONOHUE: We're very involved in that right now at the Chamber, as ar=
e individual companies who are spending a lot of time on the Hill now tal=
king about, for example, on the TPP agreement, where this makes a huge di=
fference for them. For example, that agreement is most favorable to agric=
ulture, which in many trade agreements is not the case. It's most favorab=
le to the technology community. It will be very favorable to the pharmace=
utical community when -- and we will fix one of the sidebars there. We wo=
n't open the agreement. We're not going to renegotiate it. But the histor=
y of trade agreements is when you find it all, youve finished it and they=
 write it all down, hey, there are a few things we've got to fix. And tha=
t's the case here. And I think you will see some of that.



 The Chamber, itself, is running a major, major effort with members of th=
e House and Senate, with all of our chambers around the country. We're ru=
nning events in every critical city with members of the House and the Sen=
ate, and we're doing it coincidental with the election on purpose. We're =
letting them know what we think is important. They can say what they have=
 to say. They have to vote the way we need them to vote, and half of them=
 can take a walk as long as we get two plus one.=20



 Thanks.



 MR. EARNEST: Let me just add one thing to that, Mike, which is that obvi=
ously the administration, over the course of this year, is going to conti=
nue to make a sustained case about the value of an agreement like the Tra=
ns-Pacific Partnership. And certainly when President Obama or other Democ=
rats on Capitol Hill who have been supportive of this process are prepare=
d to make a case, they have a strong one to make -- particularly to Democ=
ratic constituencies that often have not traditionally supported these ki=
nds of agreements.



 And the reason for that is that this agreement doesnt just cut taxes on =
18,000 American goods in some of the most economically vibrant countries =
in the Asia Pacific region, it also lives up to the kinds of values that =
Democrats and progressives have long advocated for. This includes histori=
cally high standards when it comes to the environment and human rights an=
d labor.=20



And that's the argument that youve heard the President make before and yo=
u will hear him make over the course of this year, that if you are a Demo=
crat who is concerned about labor standards in Southeast Asia, for exampl=
e, that should make you a strong advocate of the Trans-Pacific Partnershi=
p, because this is the kind of agreement that will raise those standards =
and hold those countries accountable for meeting those standards if they =
want to be a part of the agreement and if they want to have access to the=
 U.S. market.=20



That is exactly the kind of common-sense, proactive approach that the Pre=
sident is taking to ensure that our country and our workers are sufficien=
tly prepared to confront the forces of globalization that are only going =
to increase moving forward.



Justin.



Q Can I just follow on something Mr. Donohue said -- actually, it's for y=
ou, Josh -- on biologics, I think was the reference that you made. Theres=
 been a lot of questions on Capitol Hill about what the administration is=
 going to do and if the biologics issue is going to be settled in some wa=
y. Do you have any insight? You seemed to indicate that there was going t=
o be some change happening. Is that the administrations position?



MR. EARNEST: Well, what I can just say is that as it relates to the TPP g=
enerally, there are a number of conversations that we're having with both=
 Democrats and Republicans about the most effective way to move the agree=
ment forward in Congress. And we're going to continue to consult with the=
 leadership as it relates to our vote-getting strategy. We certainly are =
also engaged on the substance. It's not just about the process, but also =
on the substance. And there are a number of members of Congress who have =
demonstrated an interest in particular areas of the agreement.=20



What Tom said is true. The agreement is not going to be renegotiated. We =
have spent years -- and youve covered this, so you have a good sense of h=
ow we've spent years trying to get 12 different countries with a wide var=
iety of economic interests around the table to find common ground on thes=
e issues, and we've succeeded in doing that. And we've done that in a way=
 that represents our interests both as a country that's looking to expand=
 and grow our economy, but also as a country that stands for values that =
are critically important that we're looking to defend all around the worl=
d.



So I don't have details of those conversations to share, but we certainly=
 are interested in working in bipartisan fashion on Capitol Hill to build=
 bipartisan support for this agreement. We certainly believe that it dese=
rves it.



Other questions for the two business leaders while theyre here?



Okay. Gentlemen, thank you for your time today.



With that, we have a little bit of a time crunch that's related to the Pr=
esidents speech, so, Desiree, I'm going to be counting on you make sure t=
hat we stay on time here. But if you guys have questions on other topics,=
 Ben or I can answer them for you.



Yes, sir, in the back.



Q -- the U.S. administration is trying to increase the number of ground f=
orces in Syria. Can you comment on that?=20



MR. RHODES: Sure. Over the course of the last weeks and months, as we pur=
sue the counter-ISIL campaign, what we've done is where we see that there=
 are efforts that are making progress, we are willing and committed to ac=
celerating those efforts. And if that demands additional resources, we wi=
ll provide them.



So, for instance, last week, we announced additional support to the missi=
on in Iraq in terms of some specific equipment, including Apache helicopt=
ers that can make a difference for Iraqi forces on the ground, a substant=
ial amount of support to the Kurdish forces who are fighting in the north=
 so that they have the budgetary basis to continue to make progress again=
st ISIL, as well as a U.S. role in supporting Iraqi forces who are on the=
 offense through our Special Forces capability in Iraq.



Today what the President will be announcing is his decision to introduce =
250 additional U.S. Special Forces into Syria. This brings the number of =
U.S. Special Forces in Syria to roughly 300.



What we've seen is the small team that we put into Syria several months a=
go has been very effective in serving as a force multiplier because they =
are able to provide advice and support to the forces that are fighting ag=
ainst ISIL on the ground in Syria. And we've seen across parts of norther=
n and eastern Syria progress as ISIL has been pushed out of some strongho=
lds.



We want to accelerate that progress, and we believe a commitment of addit=
ional U.S. Special Forces can play a critical role, again, as serving as =
a force multiplier and helping to organize those local forces that are fi=
ghting against ISIL on the ground. They will be the ones in the fight, no=
t the U.S. Special Forces. But our Special Forces, again, can provide cri=
tical expertise and make them more capable as they have demonstrated that=
 they can take back territory from ISIL.



Q Does local forces mean that Kurds in the north of Syria, or other place=
s as well?



MR. RHODES: So we don't, as a matter of practice, specify the specific ge=
ographic area that U.S. Special Forces may be present in. What we have sa=
id is that we have worked with both Syria Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces =
who have been fighting against ISIL. So, again, it's not simply Syrian Ku=
rdish forces; theres also a Syrian Arab force that we have been working w=
ith on the ground. And we've seen them making progress in areas along the=
 border in north and eastern Syria and the area of -- well, I'll leave it=
 at that.=20



Q Can you talk a little bit about how this announcement figures into the =
Presidents speech today, and also the meeting he'll have with the Quint l=
eaders today -- if the remarks are going to be focused on this multilater=
al approach? Is that something hes also going to seek additional commitme=
nts from the other countries as well?



MR. RHODES: Sure. First of all, I think we're at a moment where we have s=
een the relentless nature of our campaign against ISIL has begun to bear =
significant results in terms of taking back territory. And we've been com=
mitted to providing the resources necessary to continue to get this job d=
one.=20



And so the Syria announcement today, coupled with the announcements that =
we made regarding our support to Iraq in recent days, I think indicates e=
xactly the model that we see working, which is airpower from the coalitio=
n, arming, equipment and training from the coalition, and, as needed, a S=
pecial Forces capability that can help them make progress on the ground.=20=




So I think the President will put this in the broader context of what we =
see working on the ground against ISIL. He will also make the point that =
just as we are willing to commit more to the fight against ISIL, we think=
 it's important that our allies are also committing more to the fight aga=
inst ISIL. We've seen them do that in recent months. We've seen increased=
 contributions to the air campaign in both Iraq and Syria. We've seen sup=
port in terms of financing and arms and training for forces that are figh=
ting on the ground in Iraq.



But again, we do believe that as we see what works, that there are additi=
onal things that our coalition partners can do. And that's something that=
 he'll talk about publicly and privately -- again, with the spirit that e=
verybody is in this fight and we have had important contributions from ou=
r European allies. But again, as we diagnose what is working, we see area=
s where we can provide additional support, and as we see challenges that =
emerge we want to make sure that we're providing support.



He had the same message, frankly, at the GCC summit recently in Saudi Ara=
bia where those coalition partners can also support our mission in a vari=
ety of ways. So, yes, I think his point will be, we will do our part, but=
 this will only succeed if we are working together as a coalition and as =
a global community to stamp out the threat of ISIL.



Q I'm wondering if you can just kind of talk about -- obviously the Presi=
dent has stated that there would not be ground combat operations, and a k=
ind of a sticking point was Special Forces -- if you can provide any more=
 clarity on why these are not combat troops, especially since the Pentago=
n has referred to them as such. And when we brought up this issue I think=
 back in October, whenever the 50 first went in, Josh, you said that if y=
ou were envisioning a ground combat operation we would see more than 50 S=
pecial Forces. We've quadrupled that number now, so is that the transitio=
n that's happening here?



MR. RHODES: Let me be very specific about this, Justin. Obviously any Spe=
cial Forces troops that we deploy into Iraq or Syria are going to be comb=
at-equipped troops. They may be in circumstances where they find themselv=
es in harms way because these are dangerous places. The question is, what=
 is the mission that theyre being given? And the mission that theyre bein=
g given is not to go into Syria and to engage the enemy, to engage ISIL. =
So theyre not being sent there on a combat mission; theyre being sent the=
re on a mission to, again, be advising, assisting and supporting the forc=
es that are fighting against ISIL on the ground.=20



And again, thats rooted in our belief that ultimately, lasting progress a=
nd the ability to push back ISIL and to hold territory thats reclaimed fr=
om ISIL is going to have to depend upon those local forces. So, yes, any =
Special Forces capacity that we put into a country like Iraq and Syria is=
 going to have a combat capability, but our point has been that their mis=
sion is not to be out on patrol or out to engage the enemy, it is to supp=
ort these forces that have been doing the fighting.



And I think the proof of that is in what youve seen, which is that over t=
he course of the last several months, the forces that have been fighting =
in Ramadi and Sinjar and Kobani in northern Syria have not been U.S. forc=
es. They have been Iraqi and Syrian forces that have been taking the figh=
t to ISIL, again, with the exception, of course, of when we have a leader=
ship operation which we have shared with you all.



On numbers, specifically, what was the question?



Q Yes. Well, Josh said that if you were envisioning combat operations?



MR. RHODES: Well, I think its -- yes, its in numbers and nature of the tr=
oops. And again, even a number like 300 Special Forces, were saying theyr=
e there on a support mission for those forces fighting on the ground. Wer=
e not deploying ground combat units to be out on patrol in places like Ir=
aq and Syria.=20



And in order to have, again, a U.S. ground combat mission in one of those=
 two countries, it would be substantially more than we have today. What y=
ou see is we have roughly just over 4,000 troops deployed in this theater=
 now, but theyre dispersed in difference places. Theyre dispersed among d=
ifferent Iraqi forces and Syrian forces that were supporting. In Iraq, th=
eyre in different bases and facilities. In Syria, again, we dont comment =
on their location, but theyre in that support role.=20



So were not deploying large ground combat units to take the place of thos=
e local forces. And again, I think the proof that weve been consistent in=
 that point is that anybody who has been following the progress of this c=
ampaign can see that the forces that have been fighting on the ground are=
 the local Iraqi and Syrian forces.



Q And the last one on the speech. A lot of people described it as a booke=
nd to the speech in Berlin eight or nine years ago. I know that you wrote=
 that one, so Im wondering if you can talk about some of the parallels or=
 how you see this as sort of a partner or pairing to that speech.



MR. RHODES: Sure. That does seem like long time ago. But first of all, wh=
at Id say is its important that were giving the speech in Germany in both=
 cases. Germany is both at the center of Europe and the center of the Eur=
opean project, and its also a demonstration of the value of the transatla=
ntic alliance, and a demonstration of what nations can do together when t=
hey sustain a commitment to shared security and shared values.



The point that the President made in the Berlin speech is that when the w=
orld stands together and acts through collective multilateral action, we =
will be able to deal with the challenges that confront us. And I think th=
at the last seven years bear that out. If you look at the areas where wev=
e been able to make the most progress in our foreign policy, its in areas=
 where weve been able to mobilize collective action, particularly includi=
ng our European allies. That was necessary to get the Iranian nuclear dea=
l. That was necessary to stamp out Ebola. That was certainly necessary to=
 get to the Paris climate accord.



So what weve seen is when were working collectively, we can make progress=
 against these challenges. Now, as the President was coming into office, =
those challenges included the fact that we were on the verge of a global =
financial crisis that hit right after his Berlin speech. Again, it was co=
llective action -- including very close coordination with Angela Merkel -=
- that helped us climb out of the global financial crisis.



Today, what hell say is that were dealing with a set of challenges from m=
igration, from the civil war in Syria and ISIL and from Russian aggressio=
n. And if you look at each of those issues, they, too, require us to work=
 together so that each of us is bearing our share of support for refugees=
, so that all of us are doing our fair share against ISIL, that were stic=
king together in standing up to Russian aggression.



So, once again, hell be making the point that we should not go it alone, =
we should not walk away from the values and institutions that allowed us =
to make such progress. We should be redoubling our efforts to work togeth=
er to confront those challenges. And again, here in Germany at a time whe=
n there are lots of questions that youve all covered over the course of t=
his trip about the European project, about European unity, I think the Pr=
esident is coming as the strongest ally of Europe to say that we have com=
plete confidence in Europes ability to deal with these challenges; that E=
urope itself has demonstrated over the years that its more than capable o=
f rising to the occasion when it works with us, when it works together as=
 a European Union, and when we are both committed to the values that weve=
 stood for since World War II.



Q Do you expect any new initiative or pledge to fight ISIS in Libya as we=
ll, sustaining the Government of National Accord? And on immigration issu=
e, giving them NATO assets?



MR. RHODES: So with respect to Libya, weve been concerned about the ISIL =
presence. We dont see it on the scale that we have in Iraq and Syria. But=
 we do believe that the most important effort right now is to support the=
 Government of National Accord so that there can be some governing author=
ity in Libya thats been missing over the last recent years, even as were =
also going to have targeted counterterrorism efforts when we see an ISIL =
target that needs to be taken off the battlefield.



I do think Libya has been a feature of the discussion that the President =
has had with each of the leaders along this trip. At the Gulf summit, wit=
h Prime Minister Cameron, yesterday with Chancellor Merkel. Id expect Lib=
ya to be one area of focus of the Quint meeting today. I think that there=
 will be discussions about how to support that Government of National Acc=
ord, what are the different resources that can be brought to bear from Eu=
rope and the United States.=20



There will be discussion of what are the counterterrorism concerns regard=
ing ISIL in Libya. But also, there will be a discussion of the refugee fl=
ows and what are the best ways that we can work together to manage and de=
al with those refugee flows. Were certainly doing that, of course, in the=
 Aegean.



I think more broadly, we will want to be making the point, as the Preside=
nt has done in his meetings, that as we get to the NATO summit in July, w=
ell be wanting to look at how we are reinforcing NATOs eastern flank thro=
ugh our reassurance effort in the face of Russias aggression. We also wan=
t to make sure that were reinforcing our southern flank. And thats someth=
ing, of course, that Prime Minister Renzi has raised repeatedly, and Pres=
ident Obama certainly agrees that NATO has to make sure that it has a str=
ategy and resources that are dedicated to supporting all of our allies, i=
ncluding our southern allies.



Q Two questions, one on Syria. Obviously, the President has talked a lot =
about wanting to have less of a footprint in terms of a military presence=
 in general. I wonder if you could just offer a little more insight about=
 how he weighs that against the decision to send more personnel into Syri=
a. And more broadly, he talked on Saturday a little bit about his legacy,=
 and I wonder how he would assess his foreign policy legacy at this point=
, just whether hes been able to kind of effect the change around the worl=
d he thought he would be able to in his presidency.



MR. RHODES: Those questions are somewhat related. I think, to your first =
question, its important to remember when he spoke in Berlin in 2008, the =
United States had 180,000 troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. We were=
, for all intents and purposes, providing the security in those countries=
. We were losing troops at a tragic and regular pace in both of those cou=
ntries. And the war in Iraq had dominated American foreign policy.



We have significantly changed the nature of American foreign policy over =
the course of these last seven years so that it is not overwhelmingly foc=
used on a project like the war in Iraq that we believe had distracted us =
from the fight against terrorism and many other global priorities, and it=
 is now addressing a much broader set of issues in regions.=20



Specifically on the footprint issue, again, we are fighting terrorism bec=
ause we always said -- and we said back in 2008 -- that we would be relen=
tless in pursuing strategies to root out terrorist networks. But were doi=
ng it in a different way. As I said, we have just over 4,000 U.S. forces =
in Iraq and Syria. Weve got just under 10,000 in Afghanistan. Thats signi=
ficantly lower; thats a fraction of the 180,000 that were there when the =
President took office. And, importantly, their mission is very different.=
 They are in a support role. They are conducting airstrikes through our a=
ir campaign. Theyre supporting local forces who are doing the fighting on=
 the ground and who are on the front lines. And that is a different model=
 from what we were pursuing when the President took office.



So even as we are still engaged in these conflicts, and even as we are re=
lentless against terrorist networks, we have been able to significantly r=
educe the number of American troops in harms way, the resources that we h=
ave to dedicate to those projects. Weve been able to build a large coalit=
ion to go against ISIL, which I think brings together well over 60 countr=
ies in a demonstration that this is not simply an American effort.



So weve changed the way that we fight terrorism, and weve been able to do=
 so in a way that reduces the risks and the resource allocation for the U=
nited States while still being able to take terrorists off the battlefiel=
d. And, frankly, we think its more effective in the long run, because the=
 only way youre going to get lasting security in these places is if local=
 forces take the initiative, because even when we did have these large gr=
ound forces deployed, we were still seeing a continued sectarian violence=
 fighting in the presence of terrorist networks.



To your second question, I think if you look at the Berlin speech and you=
 look at what the President wanted to get done when he came into office, =
we have been able to effect a significant amount of change around the wor=
ld.=20



First of all, the United States has been able to resolve the most pressin=
g nuclear nonproliferation concern that we had when we came into office. =
Weve been able to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And weve =
been able to do so without going to war, because weve reprioritized diplo=
macy, just like the President said that he would. It took nearly seven ye=
ars, but we were able to peacefully get Iran to significantly roll back i=
ts nuclear program. That makes us safer; it makes the world safer.



We reengaged on international climate negotiations, where the United Stat=
es had been absent when the President took office. He committed to do tha=
t when he came to Berlin in 2008, and here we are today with the most amb=
itious international climate accord that has ever been agreed to. And tha=
t to do very much to U.S. leadership in bringing along China and other na=
tions behind an ambitious set of targets.



Weve also, even as weve maintained a significant focus on the Middle East=
 -- as youve seen during this trip -- and on terrorism, been able to reba=
lance our focus to other regions of the world. So in the Asia Pacific, we=
ve been able to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, and we=
ve been able to significantly increase our diplomatic engagement and pres=
ence and what we believe is one of the most important emerging regions of=
 the world. In Latin America, weve been able to transform our position th=
rough the opening to Cuba.=20



So what the President talked about when he came into office -- prioritizi=
ng diplomacy, working with allies, building collective action to deal wit=
h the challenges of our time, and addressing issues like climate change t=
hat had not been on our foreign policy agenda -- I think weve been able t=
o follow through on those commitments.=20



The fact of the matter is, its a dangerous world, and so there are always=
 going to be challenges. And we continue to face challenges from terroris=
m, from migration, from Russia, as I mentioned. But the approaches that w=
orked the last seven years are the approaches that need to be applied to =
those issues and, again, building coalitions, doing our fair share but ma=
king sure that were working with others to see that theyre bearing their =
share of the burden as well, and staying true to the values that the U.S.=
-German and U.S.-European alliance has stood for for decades.



MR. EARNEST: Thanks, everybody. We're going to bring this to an end and l=
isten to the Presidents speech.

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Good mor=
ning, everybody.&nbsp; It's nice to see you.&nbsp; We've got some special g=
uests at the top of our briefing today.&nbsp; I'm joined by Tom Donohue, wh=
o is the CEO of the United States Chamber of Commerce.&nbsp; To his right i=
s Andrew
 Liveris, who is the CEO of Dow.&nbsp; Both of them are obviously here trav=
eling with the President to attend the Hannover Messe.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">They are part -- there ar=
e a couple of reasons why it's significant that they&#8217;re here.&nbsp; T=
hey&#8217;re part of the contingent of about 350 U.S. business leaders who =
are here at Hannover, including about 200 business leaders
 representing small and medium U.S. companies.&nbsp; So they are a good rep=
resentation of the U.S. business community&#8217;s participation in this pr=
esidential trip.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In addition, both Tom and=
 Andrew joined the President last night for dinner with Chancellor Merkel a=
nd other business leaders, and it was an opportunity for business leaders i=
n our two countries to have a conversation
 about the business climate, and opportunities for expanding business betwe=
en our two countries.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So they&#8217;ll have som=
e insight on a range of issues.&nbsp; And each of them has prepared short o=
pening statements that they&#8217;ll deliver.&nbsp; And then I'll call on y=
ou and you can ask them whatever questions you would like.&nbsp;
 After they&#8217;ve concluded, then I'll be joined by my colleague, Ben Rh=
odes, and he and I can take your questions on other areas of interest.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, with that, Tom, do you =
want to go first?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. DONOHUE:&nbsp; Well, th=
ank you very much, Josh.&nbsp; And it's very nice to see you all.&nbsp; I'm=
 pleased to be here with Andrew Liveris from DOW, one of America&#8217;s gr=
eat CEOs, involved in extraordinary changes in his industry, and you&#8217;=
ll be
 pleased to visit with him.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me begin by thanking th=
e President, Ambassador Froman, Secretary Pritzker and others for making th=
is trip.&nbsp; I was here a number of years ago, and encouraged them to do =
this because this is an extraordinary opportunity to come together
 with people from the EU, particularly from Germany, to talk about what we =
have to do to strengthen our economies and to pass the trade bills that are=
 going to help us do that.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It sends a strong message -=
- their presence -- about the vital importance of the transatlantic partner=
ship, the largest commercial relationship in the world and one based on sha=
red values.&nbsp; No other partnership in the last 70 years
 has done more to advance global economic growth, establish a robust and fa=
ir trading system, and to enforce the democratic opportunity, security and =
values around the world.&nbsp; Like the President, the U.S. Chamber is here=
 to bolster that relationship.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, as Josh indicat=
ed, we had a great discussion with President Obama and German Chancellor Me=
rkel on these issues and others.&nbsp; Today, the Chamber will also be coho=
sting a bilateral business summit here at the fair focusing
 on the importance of the steps we've got to take to shore up our economies=
 and to strengthen the relationship between the U.S. and the EU.&nbsp; And =
tomorrow I'll be in Munich to pursue these very same arguments with the bus=
iness leaders there.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our primary message on this=
 trip is that the transatlantic relationship is more important than ever, a=
nd so is our global leadership in that regard.&nbsp; We may not see eye-to-=
eye all the time with this administration -- nor should we
 -- but we stand shoulder-to-shoulder when it comes to advancing job-creati=
ng trade agreements like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership=
 and the TPP.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one that we're discussi=
ng here is a once-in-a-generation opportunity not only to boost our economi=
c advantage, but to fundamentally strengthen this relationship.&nbsp; It's =
going to spur jobs and investment.&nbsp; It's going to reduce needless
 regulation.&nbsp; It's going to take away barriers, and it's going to help=
 us in a geopolitical way as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later today, we'll all be f=
iling a joint -- the Chamber and others -- encouragement, a public statemen=
t that sort of follows what I just said.&nbsp; We appreciate the President&=
#8217;s support of TPP. The demands on the President, no matter whether
 you agree with him, you don't agree with him, whatever issue is on the tab=
le, are unbelievable.&nbsp; And that he took this time to come here was ver=
y important, and I congratulate him for it.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thank you very much.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. LIVERIS:&nbsp; Thank yo=
u, Tom.&nbsp; Great to share the podium with you and to take this opportuni=
ty to also reinforce the importance of this trip and thank the President fo=
r taking the leadership to be the number-one salesman for the United
 States of America.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I would say that as a g=
lobal company with a large presence here in Germany.&nbsp; We have 17 facil=
ities, 14 manufacturing plants, 5,000 employees.&nbsp; It's our third large=
st country, and we've been here over 60 years.&nbsp; We are as German
 as we are American.&nbsp; And we believe that the human spirit shifting ba=
ck on trade as the primary way of seeking to get economic balance around th=
e world -- from all the technologies available to us, whether it be in the =
United States or Germany, or in the EU,
 in general -- effective water treatment to energy efficiency, to all the t=
hings that we can invent and innovate, this cross-border trading mechanism =
is key.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And, of course, being her=
e at Hannover Masse, which is the bastion of the civil world of trade and i=
nvestment, from a German perspective, post-World War II -- we heard from bo=
th the President and the Chancellor
 yesterday in the opening of how important this site was to all things inno=
vation and trade.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a rich history her=
e, and both the President and the Chancellor referred to it not only in the=
ir speeches, but also at the dinner.&nbsp; I must say I sat there in awe of=
 seeing these two great leaders with their two business delegations
 talking business and government and at its intersections.&nbsp; Because li=
ke the Chamber, and like all of us who operate at the intersection of busin=
ess and government, it's vital that we're at the table, and it's vital that=
 this is a public-private collaboration
 of which the two leaders sponsor.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the mechanism to achiev=
e that to the next level for the benefit of all European citizens and Ameri=
can citizens is T-TIP, and getting that through the agenda this year.&nbsp;=
 This is a comprehensive negotiation.&nbsp; It means a lot of hard
 work.&nbsp; It means to take what Tom talked about to the next level of tr=
ansatlantic cooperation.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I heard the President las=
t night say that there is no more important relationship than the Atlantic =
relationship to the United States of America.&nbsp; This is very true as we=
ll on the business side.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because of
 innovation centricity.&nbsp; These two cultures and sets of countries coop=
erated through postwar environments, Cold War environments, and now through=
 a trade and innovation environment.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'm very proud of the f=
act that T-TIP has bubbled to the top of the agenda for both the continent =
of Europe as well as, of course, the United States.&nbsp; The AmCham EU Gro=
up did a study that said it could lift Germany's GDP by 0.6
 percent if T-TIP was adopted.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We have our work to do to=
 talk about the benefits, and I want to home in on two particular benefits.=
&nbsp; The one, a rising tide lifts all boats.&nbsp; There is no compromise=
 on regulatory standards here.&nbsp; There's dilution
 of the great EU standards, nor the great American standards, but a harmoni=
zation to remove frictions costs, to have these standards speak to each oth=
er, to do it in such a way that's transparent so that it can lift exporters=
 of both nations -- Made in America,
 Made in Germany, Made in the EU as a higher standard.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We owe it to humanity tha=
t, in fact, we go to the second point on making that happen, which is leade=
rship.&nbsp; Both the Chancellor and the President and, for that matter, al=
l the EU leaders have to embrace this as
 global leadership.&nbsp; Just like Paris and COP21, there's no more import=
ant sense of leadership on trade than trade and investment across borders, =
and to put transparency in standards to raise the quality of life for all o=
f our citizens.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Those two reasons are the=
 reasons people like me come to missions like this.&nbsp; It's important to=
 take time out of our agenda to show up and reinforce these two leaders in =
what they have to do.&nbsp; We have a job to do
 to communicate.&nbsp; Your job and our job is to allow all of our citizens=
 to understand why this is good for them, why this, in fact, will help them=
 on quality of life, and will help them on increasing wages and making them=
 part of an improving economy, not one
 that suffers at the hands of trade, as some people are prone to think.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, with that, I'd like t=
o hand it over to Josh, and take Q&amp;A.&nbsp; Thank you, Josh.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Thank =
you, Andrew.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Questions.&nbsp; Justin, =
you want to go first?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, =
I had a few for you guys.&nbsp; I was wondering if you could talk a little =
bit about what you see as the likelihood of TPP negotiations -- or the TPP =
vote finishing this year, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T-TIP negotiations finishin=
g
 by the end of the President's term. I'm also wondering if there was any di=
scussion at dinner with Chancellor Merkel of Volkswagen and their emissions=
 problems, and how -- well, any discussion on that at all.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And finally, Mr. Donahue,=
 there's news back home the Kasich and Cruz campaigns are now coordinating =
together to sort of prevent Donald Trump from getting the number of delegat=
es he needs for the Republican nomination.&nbsp;
 (Laughter.)&nbsp; I know the Chamber has expressed concern over his trade =
policies before, and so I'm wondering if that's something you endorse.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. DONAHUE:&nbsp; Well, =
first of all, let me be very clear.&nbsp; Last night there was no discussio=
n of Volkswagen.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And now let's get to the =
other issues.&nbsp; I think your question we expected, by the way, because =
we're thinking about it all the time -- is when is the vote on TPP going to=
 happen?&nbsp; Well, as you know, in the Senate,
 it's going to be the closest vote for Senate in a long, long time, and the=
re are four or five people that are running -- that are in the Republican c=
aucus that would be at risk, perhaps, if they voted for it right now, today=
. And so I would say that that would
 -- that vote in the Senate would come after the election.&nbsp; It will co=
me.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The vote in the House, wi=
th any luck, could be a little bit earlier -- not much.&nbsp; And the reaso=
n that I would encourage that is because it will be hard to cram two votes =
into a lame duck issue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, let me just say one =
deal about those votes.&nbsp; In a tough economy, in an election year, nobo=
dy is in favor of trade.&nbsp; It seems it's something they can blame on ev=
erybody else, and so it's hard to get a vote.&nbsp;
 But when you do vote a trade bill, what you need is you need to win by two=
 votes -- one vote to win, and one vote in case somebody dies on the way to=
 the vote.&nbsp; And everybody else can be excused from the vote.&nbsp; And=
 we don't care how many we win by -- we only
 care that we win.&nbsp; And both of these votes will, in my opinion, be he=
ld before the end of this administration.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">On the question of the T-=
TIP, that will go through the Congress much easier -- much more easily -- b=
ecause it's a relationship with our largest trading partner who, for the lo=
ngest time, said to have stronger regulations,
 more favorable labor regulations and other issues, and with that as an arg=
ument, I think we could get that done in a very convenient and more easily =
passed.&nbsp; But it's going to take a while to get people here and people =
in the United States focused on doing
 not a half-baked bill but a really good trade agreement.&nbsp; And I would=
 hope that you'd see something happen there in the next 90 days.<o:p></o:p>=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Other =
questions this morning?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You j=
ust said that last night there were no talks about Volkswagen, so I wonder,=
 what about today?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. LIVERIS:&nbsp; I've h=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. DONAHUE:&nbsp; I've h=
eard nothing, either.&nbsp; We've been at different kinds of meetings early=
 today, and so we've not been with the President or the Chancellor, or with=
 the leaders of the governments.&nbsp; We'll see more
 of those people today.&nbsp; I don't expect that while everybody is trying=
 to drive trade and investment we'll hear too much about that.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Let me=
 just add one part to this, which is that obviously the President is constr=
ained in what he would be able to discuss on this particular issue, given t=
he ongoing legal proceedings.&nbsp; That certainly
 applies in public, but the truth is, that also implies to his discussions =
in private, as well.&nbsp; So I certainly can't speak for what kinds of con=
versations may be going on among business leaders who are here, but I can t=
ell you that the President does not anticipate
 engaging in discussions about that specific issue, either in public or in =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My qu=
estion is about procurement Buy American -- we had an interview with Sigmar=
 Gabriel yesterday, the German federal minister for the economy, who said t=
here will be no deal on T-TIP if the U.S. doesn't open
 up their procurement markets.&nbsp; And I guess he means not only on the f=
ederal but on the state level.&nbsp; So is there any room in the negotiatio=
ns actually from the American side to compromise here?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. LIVERIS:&nbsp; I'll a=
nswer that by stating nothing specific. There was actually an anecdote at d=
inner, but, look, operating in 162 countries, we run into buy X all the tim=
e, so buy China, and China buy duh-duh-duh.&nbsp;
 This is one of the biggest non-tariff tariff barriers.&nbsp; So speaking t=
o common harmonization of trade starts to get at those sorts of barriers so=
 that you don't force someone to go build a factory in your home jurisdicti=
on to have the local procurement requirement
 fulfilled.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I know, listening to Mike=
 Froman last night, that the Chancellor and the President were urging the t=
wo negotiators to get to the details of negotiations yet this summer.&nbsp;=
 And I know that's one of the topics of great
 import.&nbsp; But nothing specific&nbsp; -- unless, Tom, you had something=
.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. DONAHUE:&nbsp; The Ch=
amber of Commerce of the United States is fundamentally opposed to the Buy =
America efforts that are making it more difficult to negotiate really stron=
g trade agreements.&nbsp; Most of that comes from
 the states -- individual states -- not from the federal approach.&nbsp; An=
d generally, we're able to work those out, even when the states put them in=
 place, because when they find out the problem it creates for their own sta=
te, we usually find a way around it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But I think to get a T-TI=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. L=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. LIVERIS:&nbsp; The an=
ecdote was exactly just -- the leaders were very relaxed.&nbsp; And if I co=
uld talk about the ambience of the relationship -- and I've been around it =
a little bit, not as much as maybe Tom has --
 it's an exceptionally good relationship, and it permeated the whole dinner=
 conversation.&nbsp; And I've been part of those sorts of dinners in other =
forums -- not necessarily between the Chancellor and the President -- but j=
ust to see the way it was conducted --
 and the Chancellor is just incredible in the sense of her humbleness and h=
er ability to make you feel at home.&nbsp; It was just a perfect hosting ev=
ent.&nbsp; And there were friendly little jabs at each other about what cou=
ld be the basis of a T-TIP negotiation.&nbsp; I
 think this was all done in good humor, so anecdotes occurred.&nbsp; I don'=
t know, Tom, if there was any more to it than that.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Don=

he Kasich campaigns and your reaction.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. DONOHUE:&nbsp; I though=
t I did a good job --&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I =
thought I'd give it one more shot.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. DONOHUE:&nbsp; Look, I'=
ve been around a long time, and before most other elections you run into pe=
ople in your business or in your personal life and they&#8217;d ask you abo=
ut the election, and your reaction is, well, you have this view,
 and the polls said this and this is what you might expect.&nbsp; Quite fra=
nkly, we're not sure where this whole thing is going.&nbsp; Will it end up =
in an open convention?&nbsp; Nobody knows.&nbsp; And there are challenges o=
n the Democratic side, as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's very hard to s=
peculate.&nbsp; It is true that some are trying to figure out a way to head=
 off Mr. Trump.&nbsp; At the rate he is gathering delegates that may be ver=
y hard.&nbsp; Anybody that could tell you where this thing plays out
 in July is a lot smarter than I am.&nbsp; But I would simply say that I di=
dn&#8217;t have them before, but I now have hotel rooms in Cleveland.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I a=
lso wanted to ask, when we hear discussion of the way -- the intersection o=
f trade and the election year, it almost sounds as if it's an issue to be p=
ut aside if you&#8217;re a pro-trade person.&nbsp; We have a potential nomi=
nee on
 both sides of the aisle who are against TPP.&nbsp; Is there going to be so=
mebody making a proactive trade case in the coming election year?&nbsp; Wou=
ldn't that help your chances to succeed?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. DONOHUE:&nbsp; We're ve=
ry involved in that right now at the Chamber, as are individual companies w=
ho are spending a lot of time on the Hill now talking about, for example, o=
n the TPP agreement, where this makes a huge difference for
 them.&nbsp; For example, that agreement is most favorable to agriculture, =
which in many trade agreements is not the case.&nbsp; It's most favorable t=
o the technology community.&nbsp; It will be very favorable to the pharmace=
utical community when -- and we will fix one of
 the sidebars there.&nbsp; We won't open the agreement.&nbsp; We're not goi=
ng to renegotiate it.&nbsp; But the history of trade agreements is when you=
 find it all, you&#8217;ve finished it and they write it all down, hey, the=
re are a few things we've got to fix.&nbsp; And that's the
 case here.&nbsp; And I think you will see some of that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chamber, itself, is run=
ning a major, major effort with members of the House and Senate, with all o=
f our chambers around the country.&nbsp; We're running events in every crit=
ical city with members of the House and the Senate, and we're
 doing it coincidental with the election on purpose.&nbsp; We're letting th=
em know what we think is important.&nbsp; They can say what they have to sa=
y.&nbsp; They have to vote the way we need them to vote, and half of them c=
an take a walk as long as we get two plus one.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Let me j=
ust add one thing to that, Mike, which is that obviously the administration=
, over the course of this year, is going to continue to make a sustained ca=
se about the value of an agreement like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.&nbsp=
;
 And certainly when President Obama or other Democrats on Capitol Hill who =
have been supportive of this process are prepared to make a case, they have=
 a strong one to make -- particularly to Democratic constituencies that oft=
en have not traditionally supported
 these kinds of agreements.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the reason for that is =
that this agreement doesn&#8217;t just cut taxes on 18,000 American goods i=
n some of the most economically vibrant countries in the Asia Pacific regio=
n, it also lives up to the kinds of values that Democrats and
 progressives have long advocated for.&nbsp; This includes historically hig=
h standards when it comes to the environment and human rights and labor.&nb=
sp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that's the argument t=
hat you&#8217;ve heard the President make before and you will hear him make=
 over the course of this year, that if you are a Democrat who is concerned =
about labor standards in Southeast Asia, for
 example, that should make you a strong advocate of the Trans-Pacific Partn=
ership, because this is the kind of agreement that will raise those standar=
ds and hold those countries accountable for meeting those standards if they=
 want to be a part of the agreement
 and if they want to have access to the U.S. market.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That is exactly the kind =
of common-sense, proactive approach that the President is taking to ensure =
that our country and our workers are sufficiently prepared to confront the =
forces of globalization that are only
 going to increase moving forward.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I=
 just follow on something Mr. Donohue said -- actually, it's for you, Josh =
-- on biologics, I think was the reference that you made.&nbsp; There&#8217=
;s been a lot of questions on Capitol Hill about what the administration
 is going to do and if the biologics issue is going to be settled in some w=
ay.&nbsp; Do you have any insight?&nbsp; You seemed to indicate that there =
was going to be some change happening.&nbsp; Is that the administration&#82=
17;s position?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
what I can just say is that as it relates to the TPP generally, there are a=
 number of conversations that we're having with both Democrats and Republic=
ans about the most effective way to move
 the agreement forward in Congress.&nbsp; And we're going to continue to co=
nsult with the leadership as it relates to our vote-getting strategy.&nbsp;=
 We certainly are also engaged on the substance.&nbsp; It's not just about =
the process, but also on the substance.&nbsp; And there
 are a number of members of Congress who have demonstrated an interest in p=
articular areas of the agreement.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What Tom said is true.&nb=
sp; The agreement is not going to be renegotiated.&nbsp; We have spent year=
s -- and you&#8217;ve covered this, so you have a good sense of how we've s=
pent years trying to get 12 different countries with
 a wide variety of economic interests around the table to find common groun=
d on these issues, and we've succeeded in doing that.&nbsp; And we've done =
that in a way that represents our interests both as a country that's lookin=
g to expand and grow our economy, but
 also as a country that stands for values that are critically important tha=
t we're looking to defend all around the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I don't have details o=
f those conversations to share, but we certainly are interested in working =
in bipartisan fashion on Capitol Hill to build bipartisan support for this =
agreement.&nbsp; We certainly believe that
 it deserves it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Other questions for the t=
wo business leaders while they&#8217;re here?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Okay.&nbsp; Gentlemen, th=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">With that, we have a litt=
le bit of a time crunch that's related to the President&#8217;s speech, so,=
 Desiree, I'm going to be counting on you make sure that we stay on time he=
re.&nbsp; But if you guys have questions on other
 topics, Ben or I can answer them for you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Yes, sir, in the back.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- th=
e U.S. administration is trying to increase the number of ground forces in =
Syria.&nbsp; Can you comment on that?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Sure.&n=
bsp; Over the course of the last weeks and months, as we pursue the counter=
-ISIL campaign, what we've done is where we see that there are efforts that=
 are making progress, we are willing and committed
 to accelerating those efforts.&nbsp; And if that demands additional resour=
ces, we will provide them.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, for instance, last we=
ek, we announced additional support to the mission in Iraq in terms of some=
 specific equipment, including Apache helicopters that can make a differenc=
e for Iraqi forces on the ground, a
 substantial amount of support to the Kurdish forces who are fighting in th=
e north so that they have the budgetary basis to continue to make progress =
against ISIL, as well as a U.S. role in supporting Iraqi forces who are on =
the offense through our Special
 Forces capability in Iraq.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Today what the President =
will be announcing is his decision to introduce 250 additional U.S. Special=
 Forces into Syria.&nbsp; This brings the number of U.S. Special Forces in =
Syria to roughly 300.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What we've seen is the sm=
all team that we put into Syria several months ago has been very effective =
in serving as a force multiplier because they are able to provide advice an=
d support to the forces that are fighting
 against ISIL on the ground in Syria. And we've seen across parts of northe=
rn and eastern Syria progress as ISIL has been pushed out of some stronghol=
ds.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We want to accelerate tha=
t progress, and we believe a commitment of additional U.S. Special Forces c=
an play a critical role, again, as serving as a force multiplier and helpin=
g to organize those local forces that
 are fighting against ISIL on the ground.&nbsp; They will be the ones in th=
e fight, not the U.S. Special Forces.&nbsp; But our Special Forces, again, =
can provide critical expertise and make them more capable as they have demo=
nstrated that they can take back territory
 from ISIL.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does =
local forces mean that Kurds in the north of Syria, or other places as well=
?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; So we d=
on't, as a matter of practice, specify the specific geographic area that U.=
S. Special Forces may be present in.&nbsp; What we have said is that we hav=
e worked with both Syria Kurdish and Syrian Arab
 forces who have been fighting against ISIL.&nbsp; So, again, it's not simp=
ly Syrian Kurdish forces; there&#8217;s also a Syrian Arab force that we ha=
ve been working with on the ground.&nbsp; And we've seen them making progre=
ss in areas along the border in north and eastern
 Syria and the area of -- well, I'll leave it at that.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can y=
ou talk a little bit about how this announcement figures into the President=
&#8217;s speech today, and also the meeting he'll have with the Quint leade=
rs today -- if the remarks are going to be focused on this
 multilateral approach?&nbsp; Is that something he&#8217;s also going to se=
ek additional commitments from the other countries as well?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Sure.&n=
bsp; First of all, I think we're at a moment where we have seen the relentl=
ess nature of our campaign against ISIL has begun to bear significant resul=
ts in terms of taking back territory.&nbsp; And we've
 been committed to providing the resources necessary to continue to get thi=
s job done.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so the Syria announce=
ment today, coupled with the announcements that we made regarding our suppo=
rt to Iraq in recent days, I think indicates exactly the model that we see =
working, which is airpower from the
 coalition, arming, equipment and training from the coalition, and, as need=
ed, a Special Forces capability that can help them make progress on the gro=
und.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I think the President =
will put this in the broader context of what we see working on the ground a=
gainst ISIL.&nbsp; He will also make the point that just as we are willing =
to commit more to the fight against ISIL,
 we think it's important that our allies are also committing more to the fi=
ght against ISIL.&nbsp; We've seen them do that in recent months.&nbsp; We'=
ve seen increased contributions to the air campaign in both Iraq and Syria.=
&nbsp; We've seen support in terms of financing
 and arms and training for forces that are fighting on the ground in Iraq.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But again, we do believe =
that as we see what works, that there are additional things that our coalit=
ion partners can do.&nbsp; And that's something that he'll talk about publi=
cly and privately -- again, with the spirit
 that everybody is in this fight and we have had important contributions fr=
om our European allies.&nbsp; But again, as we diagnose what is working, we=
 see areas where we can provide additional support, and as we see challenge=
s that emerge we want to make sure that
 we're providing support.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">He had the same message, =
frankly, at the GCC summit recently in Saudi Arabia where those coalition p=
artners can also support our mission in a variety of ways.&nbsp; So, yes, I=
 think his point will be, we will do our
 part, but this will only succeed if we are working together as a coalition=
 and as a global community to stamp out the threat of ISIL.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm w=
ondering if you can just kind of talk about -- obviously the President has =
stated that there would not be ground combat operations, and a kind of a st=
icking point was Special Forces -- if you can provide
 any more clarity on why these are not combat troops, especially since the =
Pentagon has referred to them as such.&nbsp; And when we brought up this is=
sue I think back in October, whenever the 50 first went in, Josh, you said =
that if you were envisioning a ground
 combat operation we would see more than 50 Special Forces.&nbsp; We've qua=
drupled that number now, so is that the transition that's happening here?<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Let me =
be very specific about this, Justin.&nbsp; Obviously any Special Forces tro=
ops that we deploy into Iraq or Syria are going to be combat-equipped troop=
s.&nbsp; They may be in circumstances where they find
 themselves in harm&#8217;s way because these are dangerous places.&nbsp; T=
he question is, what is the mission that they&#8217;re being given?&nbsp; A=
nd the mission that they&#8217;re being given is not to go into Syria and t=
o engage the enemy, to engage ISIL.&nbsp; So they&#8217;re not being sent
 there on a combat mission; they&#8217;re being sent there on a mission to,=
 again, be advising, assisting and supporting the forces that are fighting =
against ISIL on the ground.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And again, that&#8217;s r=
ooted in our belief that ultimately, lasting progress and the ability to pu=
sh back ISIL and to hold territory that&#8217;s reclaimed from ISIL is goin=
g to have to depend upon those local forces.&nbsp; So,
 yes, any Special Forces capacity that we put into a country like Iraq and =
Syria is going to have a combat capability, but our point has been that the=
ir mission is not to be out on patrol or out to engage the enemy, it is to =
support these forces that have been
 doing the fighting.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I think the proof of =
that is in what you&#8217;ve seen, which is that over the course of the las=
t several months, the forces that have been fighting in Ramadi and Sinjar a=
nd Kobani in northern Syria have not been
 U.S. forces.&nbsp; They have been Iraqi and Syrian forces that have been t=
aking the fight to ISIL, again, with the exception, of course, of when we h=
ave a leadership operation which we have shared with you all.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">On numbers, specifically,=
 what was the question?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&=
nbsp; Well, Josh said that if you were envisioning combat operations?<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Well, I=
 think it&#8217;s -- yes, it&#8217;s in numbers and nature of the troops.&n=
bsp; And again, even a number like 300 Special Forces, we&#8217;re saying t=
hey&#8217;re there on a support mission for those forces fighting on the
 ground.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not deploying ground combat units to be out on p=
atrol in places like Iraq and Syria.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And in order to have, aga=
in, a U.S. ground combat mission in one of those two countries, it would be=
 substantially more than we have today.&nbsp; What you see is we have rough=
ly just over 4,000 troops deployed in this
 theater now, but they&#8217;re dispersed in difference places.&nbsp; They&=
#8217;re dispersed among different Iraqi forces and Syrian forces that we&#=
8217;re supporting.&nbsp; In Iraq, they&#8217;re in different bases and fac=
ilities.&nbsp; In Syria, again, we don&#8217;t comment on their location, b=
ut
 they&#8217;re in that support role.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we&#8217;re not deploy=
ing large ground combat units to take the place of those local forces.&nbsp=
; And again, I think the proof that we&#8217;ve been consistent in that poi=
nt is that anybody who has been following the progress
 of this campaign can see that the forces that have been fighting on the gr=
ound are the local Iraqi and Syrian forces.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And t=
he last one on the speech.&nbsp; A lot of people described it as a bookend =
to the speech in Berlin eight or nine years ago.&nbsp; I know that you wrot=
e that one, so I&#8217;m wondering if you can talk about some of the
 parallels or how you see this as sort of a partner or pairing to that spee=
ch.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Sure.&n=
bsp; That does seem like long time ago.&nbsp; But first of all, what I&#821=
7;d say is it&#8217;s important that we&#8217;re giving the speech in Germa=
ny in both cases.&nbsp; Germany is both at the center of Europe and the cen=
ter
 of the European project, and it&#8217;s also a demonstration of the value =
of the transatlantic alliance, and a demonstration of what nations can do t=
ogether when they sustain a commitment to shared security and shared values=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The point that the Presid=
ent made in the Berlin speech is that when the world stands together and ac=
ts through collective multilateral action, we will be able to deal with the=
 challenges that confront us.&nbsp; And I
 think that the last seven years bear that out.&nbsp; If you look at the ar=
eas where we&#8217;ve been able to make the most progress in our foreign po=
licy, it&#8217;s in areas where we&#8217;ve been able to mobilize collectiv=
e action, particularly including our European allies.&nbsp;
 That was necessary to get the Iranian nuclear deal.&nbsp; That was necessa=
ry to stamp out Ebola.&nbsp; That was certainly necessary to get to the Par=
is climate accord.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So what we&#8217;ve seen =
is when we&#8217;re working collectively, we can make progress against thes=
e challenges.&nbsp; Now, as the President was coming into office, those cha=
llenges included the fact that we were on the verge of
 a global financial crisis that hit right after his Berlin speech.&nbsp; Ag=
ain, it was collective action -- including very close coordination with Ang=
ela Merkel -- that helped us climb out of the global financial crisis.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Today, what he&#8217;ll s=
ay is that we&#8217;re dealing with a set of challenges from migration, fro=
m the civil war in Syria and ISIL and from Russian aggression.&nbsp; And if=
 you look at each of those issues, they, too, require
 us to work together so that each of us is bearing our share of support for=
 refugees, so that all of us are doing our fair share against ISIL, that we=
&#8217;re sticking together in standing up to Russian aggression.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, once again, he&#8217;=
ll be making the point that we should not go it alone, we should not walk a=
way from the values and institutions that allowed us to make such progress.=
&nbsp; We should be redoubling our efforts to work
 together to confront those challenges.&nbsp; And again, here in Germany at=
 a time when there are lots of questions that you&#8217;ve all covered over=
 the course of this trip about the European project, about European unity, =
I think the President is coming as the strongest
 ally of Europe to say that we have complete confidence in Europe&#8217;s a=
bility to deal with these challenges; that Europe itself has demonstrated o=
ver the years that it&#8217;s more than capable of rising to the occasion w=
hen it works with us, when it works together
 as a European Union, and when we are both committed to the values that we&=
#8217;ve stood for since World War II.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do yo=
u expect any new initiative or pledge to fight ISIS in Libya as well, susta=
ining the Government of National Accord?&nbsp; And on immigration issue, gi=
ving them NATO assets?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; So with=
 respect to Libya, we&#8217;ve been concerned about the ISIL presence.&nbsp=
; We don&#8217;t see it on the scale that we have in Iraq and Syria.&nbsp; =
But we do believe that the most important effort right now is to
 support the Government of National Accord so that there can be some govern=
ing authority in Libya that&#8217;s been missing over the last recent years=
, even as we&#8217;re also going to have targeted counterterrorism efforts =
when we see an ISIL target that needs to be
 taken off the battlefield.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I do think Libya has been=
 a feature of the discussion that the President has had with each of the le=
aders along this trip.&nbsp; At the Gulf summit, with Prime Minister Camero=
n, yesterday with Chancellor Merkel.&nbsp; I&#8217;d
 expect Libya to be one area of focus of the Quint meeting today.&nbsp; I t=
hink that there will be discussions about how to support that Government of=
 National Accord, what are the different resources that can be brought to b=
ear from Europe and the United States.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">There will be discussion =
of what are the counterterrorism concerns regarding ISIL in Libya.&nbsp; Bu=
t also, there will be a discussion of the refugee flows and what are the be=
st ways that we can work together to manage
 and deal with those refugee flows. We&#8217;re certainly doing that, of co=
urse, in the Aegean.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think more broadly, we =
will want to be making the point, as the President has done in his meetings=
, that as we get to the NATO summit in July, we&#8217;ll be wanting to look=
 at how we are reinforcing NATO&#8217;s eastern
 flank through our reassurance effort in the face of Russia&#8217;s aggress=
ion.&nbsp; We also want to make sure that we&#8217;re reinforcing our south=
ern flank.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s something, of course, that Prime Minister=
 Renzi has raised repeatedly, and President Obama certainly
 agrees that NATO has to make sure that it has a strategy and resources tha=
t are dedicated to supporting all of our allies, including our southern all=
ies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two q=
uestions, one on Syria.&nbsp; Obviously, the President has talked a lot abo=
ut wanting to have less of a footprint in terms of a military presence in g=
eneral.&nbsp; I wonder if you could just offer a little more
 insight about how he weighs that against the decision to send more personn=
el into Syria.&nbsp; And more broadly, he talked on Saturday a little bit a=
bout his legacy, and I wonder how he would assess his foreign policy legacy=
 at this point, just whether he&#8217;s been
 able to kind of effect the change around the world he thought he would be =
able to in his presidency.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Those q=
uestions are somewhat related.&nbsp; I think, to your first question, it&#8=
217;s important to remember when he spoke in Berlin in 2008, the United Sta=
tes had 180,000 troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp;
 We were, for all intents and purposes, providing the security in those cou=
ntries.&nbsp; We were losing troops at a tragic and regular pace in both of=
 those countries.&nbsp; And the war in Iraq had dominated American foreign =
policy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We have significantly cha=
nged the nature of American foreign policy over the course of these last se=
ven years so that it is not overwhelmingly focused on a project like the wa=
r in Iraq that we believe had distracted
 us from the fight against terrorism and many other global priorities, and =
it is now addressing a much broader set of issues in regions.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Specifically on the footp=
rint issue, again, we are fighting terrorism because we always said -- and =
we said back in 2008 -- that we would be relentless in pursuing strategies =
to root out terrorist networks.&nbsp; But
 we&#8217;re doing it in a different way.&nbsp; As I said, we have just ove=
r 4,000 U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got just under 10,=
000 in Afghanistan.&nbsp; That&#8217;s significantly lower; that&#8217;s a =
fraction of the 180,000 that were there when the President took office.&nbs=
p;
 And, importantly, their mission is very different.&nbsp; They are in a sup=
port role.&nbsp; They are conducting airstrikes through our air campaign.&n=
bsp; They&#8217;re supporting local forces who are doing the fighting on th=
e ground and who are on the front lines.&nbsp; And that is
 a different model from what we were pursuing when the President took offic=
e.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So even as we are still e=
ngaged in these conflicts, and even as we are relentless against terrorist =
networks, we have been able to significantly reduce the number of American =
troops in harm&#8217;s way, the resources
 that we have to dedicate to those projects.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been able to=
 build a large coalition to go against ISIL, which I think brings together =
well over 60 countries in a demonstration that this is not simply an Americ=
an effort.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we&#8217;ve changed th=
e way that we fight terrorism, and we&#8217;ve been able to do so in a way =
that reduces the risks and the resource allocation for the United States wh=
ile still being able to take terrorists off the
 battlefield.&nbsp; And, frankly, we think it&#8217;s more effective in the=
 long run, because the only way you&#8217;re going to get lasting security =
in these places is if local forces take the initiative, because even when w=
e did have these large ground forces deployed, we
 were still seeing a continued sectarian violence fighting in the presence =
of terrorist networks.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">To your second question, =
I think if you look at the Berlin speech and you look at what the President=
 wanted to get done when he came into office, we have been able to effect a=
 significant amount of change around
 the world.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">First of all, the United =
States has been able to resolve the most pressing nuclear nonproliferation =
concern that we had when we came into office.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been able t=
o prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.&nbsp;
 And we&#8217;ve been able to do so without going to war, because we&#8217;=
ve reprioritized diplomacy, just like the President said that he would.&nbs=
p; It took nearly seven years, but we were able to peacefully get Iran to s=
ignificantly roll back its nuclear program.&nbsp; That
 makes us safer; it makes the world safer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We reengaged on internati=
onal climate negotiations, where the United States had been absent when the=
 President took office. He committed to do that when he came to Berlin in 2=
008, and here we are today with the
 most ambitious international climate accord that has ever been agreed to.&=
nbsp; And that to do very much to U.S. leadership in bringing along China a=
nd other nations behind an ambitious set of targets.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We&#8217;ve also, even as=
 we&#8217;ve maintained a significant focus on the Middle East -- as you&#8=
217;ve seen during this trip -- and on terrorism, been able to rebalance ou=
r focus to other regions of the world.&nbsp; So in the Asia
 Pacific, we&#8217;ve been able to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership =
agreement, and we&#8217;ve been able to significantly increase our diplomat=
ic engagement and presence and what we believe is one of the most important=
 emerging regions of the world.&nbsp; In Latin America,
 we&#8217;ve been able to transform our position through the opening to Cub=
a.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So what the President tal=
ked about when he came into office -- prioritizing diplomacy, working with =
allies, building collective action to deal with the challenges of our time,=
 and addressing issues like climate
 change that had not been on our foreign policy agenda -- I think we&#8217;=
ve been able to follow through on those commitments.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The fact of the matter is=
, it&#8217;s a dangerous world, and so there are always going to be challen=
ges.&nbsp; And we continue to face challenges from terrorism, from migratio=
n, from Russia, as I mentioned.&nbsp; But the approaches
 that worked the last seven years are the approaches that need to be applie=
d to those issues and, again, building coalitions, doing our fair share but=
 making sure that we&#8217;re working with others to see that they&#8217;re=
 bearing their share of the burden as well,
 and staying true to the values that the U.S.-German and U.S.-European alli=
ance has stood for for decades.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Thanks=
