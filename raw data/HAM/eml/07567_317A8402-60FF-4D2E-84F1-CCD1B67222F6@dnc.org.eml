DNC Chair, Jewish Community Leaders Denounce Anti-Semitic Vitriol Against J=
ewish Reporters in 2016 campaign

Today, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz joined with Jewish community=
 leaders from the Anti-Defamation League, the National Jewish Democratic Co=
uncil, and Bend the Arc to denounce anti-Semitic vitriol against Jewish rep=
orters in the 2016 campaign.

Throughout the 2016 campaign, journalists reporting on Donald Trump=92s can=
didacy have been met with hatred and vitriol inspired by the Republican nom=
inee.  In fact, the Wall Street Journal recently reported on Trump=92s insp=
iring of white supremacists in a story titled: =93White Nationalists See Ad=
vancement Through Donald Trump=92s Candidacy<http://www.wsj.com/articles/wh=
ite-nationalists-see-advancement-through-donald-trumps-candidacy-1463523858=
>.=94 Whether it=92s Trump=92s campaign manager assaulting a female reporte=
r, or Donald Trump commanding the crowd to direct their anger towards the p=
ress during his rallies, it=92s clear Trump=92s supporters derive this kind=
 of violent behavior and extreme rhetoric towards the press from the man st=
anding behind the podium.

Furthermore, the Trump camp has shown no remorse or sympathy for reporters =
who are subjected to abuse by Trump supporters. When GQ reporter Julia Ioff=
e received<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/28/julia-ioffe-journ=
alist-melania-trump-antisemitic-abuse?CMP=3Dshare_btn_fb> hateful messages =
in response to a profile she penned about Melania Trump, Ms. Trump blamed t=
he reporter, saying she =93provoked<http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/17/politics/=
melania-trump-dujour/>=94 the anti-Semitic abuse. Mr. Trump declined<http:/=
/www.jta.org/2016/05/05/news-opinion/politics/trump-no-message-for-follower=
s-who-flooded-reporter-with-anti-semitic-abuse> to denounce the followers w=
ho flooded that reporter with invective, saying he had =93no message,=94 fo=
r them. According to Politico, Jewish leaders on both sides of the aisle we=
re dismayed by Trump=92s refusal to combat

Yesterday, Robert Kagan wrote this in the Washington Post about the fascist=
 threat posed by Trump=92s candidacy<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinion=
s/this-is-how-fascism-comes-to-america/2016/05/17/c4e32c58-1c47-11e6-8c7b-6=
931e66333e7_story.html>: =93A mass political movement is thus a powerful an=
d, to those who would oppose it, frightening weapon. When controlled and di=
rected by a single leader, it can be aimed at whomever the leader chooses.=
=94

Predictably, when Jonathan Weisman of the New York Times, tweeted out a pas=
sage from that op-ed, he was treated to similar anti-Semitic abuse<https://=
www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/05/19/new-york-times-staff=
er-tweets-out-op-ed-critical-of-trump-faces-anti-semitic-avalanche/?utm_sou=
rce=3Dtwitterfeed&utm_medium=3Dtwitter> from Trump supporters.

This is unacceptable. Until Trump makes a forceful denouncement of the anti=
-Semitic vitriol his supporters have directed at Jews and Jewish reporters,=
 he is condoning his followers=92 comments.
