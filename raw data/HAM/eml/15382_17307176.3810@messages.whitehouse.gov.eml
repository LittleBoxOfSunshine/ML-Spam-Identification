For Immediate Release May 23, 2016





TOAST REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA

AND PRESIDENT TRN I QUANG OF VIETNAM

AT STATE LUNCHEON



Presidential Palace

Hanoi, Vietnam







2:02 P.M. ICT



PRESIDENT QUANG: (As interpreted.) The Honorable Barack Obama, President =
of the United States of America, distinguished American guests, ladies an=
d gentlemen, on behalf of the Vietnamese leaders and people, once again I=
 have the great honor to extend a warm welcome to Mr. President and his h=
igh-level delegation. Mr. President, thank you very much for traveling su=
ch a long way, across the globe, to visit Vietnam. I'm sure that during y=
our stay here, you'll be able to see for yourself the hospitality and fri=
endship that the Vietnamese people extend to you and to the American peop=
le.



With a deepened mutual understanding between the two countries, and impre=
ssive talks between the two sides, your visit marks another crucial miles=
tone in our bilateral relationship and creates a strong momentum for our =
comprehensive partnership to endure with greater substance in the future,=
 both bilaterally and within the regional and global frameworks.



To become comprehensive partners, as we are today, both countries have ha=
d to traverse many ups and downs of history, and overcome the profound gr=
ievances left behind by the war syndromes, and prevail over seemingly ins=
urmountable obstacles. Even during those days, the pioneers in promoting =
the Vietnam-U.S. friendly ties never wavered in the conviction of a brigh=
ter future for the bilateral relations. The reversed development of the V=
ietnam-U.S. relations in the past years is clear evidence of President Ho=
 Chi Minh's statement, "Bear the cold winter, and we shall be welcomed by=
 warm spring."



Proceeding from the tradition of peace and friendship, the Vietnamese peo=
ple always wish to cultivate the friendship with peoples around the world=
, including the American people. We will always remember and are grateful=
 to American people's contributions to putting an end to an unhappy chapt=
er in the two countries' history. While the wounds of the war have not be=
en fully healed in both countries and differences remain in the bilateral=
 relations, as time goes by we have become more deeply aware of the past =
and present, and have conviction that a friendly and cooperative relation=
ship between our two nations will be in the best interest of both peoples=
, as well as that of peace, stability, cooperation and development in the=
 Asia Pacific and the world.



Mr. President, as you once said -- and allow me to quote -- "If you're wa=
lking down the right path, and you're willing to keep walking, eventually=
 you will make progress." And I would like to recall a historical event i=
n February 1946. In his letter to President Harry Truman, President Ho Ch=
i Minh expressed his wish that Vietnam and the United States of America w=
ould develop a full cooperation. With the establishment of the Comprehens=
ive Partnership, we're taking the path that President Ho Chi Minh had cho=
sen. We're confident that relations on the basis of friendship, equality,=
 cooperation and respect for each other's political regimes and legitimat=
e interests is the only path leading to a brighter and more prosperous fu=
ture for our next generations. Our nations have a bright future. And toge=
ther, we can write new chapters of our relationship.=20



 With that, I would like to kindly invite Mr. President, distinguished Am=
erican guests and you all, to join me in a toast. To the friendship and c=
omprehensive cooperation between Vietnam and the United States of America=
. To the good health of Mr. President and to you all. Thank you. (Applaus=
e.)=20



 (A toast is given.)



PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good afternoon. President Quang, General Secretary Trng,=
 Prime Minister Phc, Chairwoman Kim Ngan, distinguished guests, ladies an=
d gentlemen. To you and to the government and the people of Vietnam, I wa=
nt to thank you for your kind welcome and hospitality that youve extended=
 to me and my delegation today. Xin cm n. (Applause.)=20



Im told there is a saying here in Vietnam -- which I will not say in Viet=
namese -- but it says, When you eat the fruit, think about the one who pl=
anted the tree. And today, we pay our respects to all who came before us =
-- Vietnamese and Americans -- who planted and tended the tree that has b=
ecome our comprehensive partnership.



I especially want to thank all those who served both our countries decade=
s ago and then took on one last mission -- and that was the mission to he=
lp our nations reconcile. For you, that conflict was a bitter memory. But=
 today, Vietnam and America show the world that hearts can change and pea=
ce is possible. And we thank Secretary Kerry and all our veterans here to=
day, both Vietnamese and American, who had the courage not only to fight,=
 but, more importantly, had the courage to make peace. ""



I think oftentimes our veterans can show us the way. One American veteran=
 came here and described meeting a former North Vietnamese soldier. He ca=
me up and shook my hand, and now were friends, this veteran said. Without=
 the high-powered politicians, people can just get along as human beings.=




The Vietnamese and Americans are now following that advice -- getting alo=
ng as human beings -- as students and scholars. As entrepreneurs and inno=
vators. As doctors and as scientists. As sailors and peacekeepers on beha=
lf of the security and peace that we seek around the world.=20



I know that here in Vietnam, you draw inspiration from the lotus flower -=
- hoa sen. It takes root in the mud and thus is a symbol of hope amid har=
dship. It survives where other flowers cannot, and thus is a symbol of st=
rength and endurance. It radiates color, and is thus a symbol of beauty.



So I'd like to propose a toast -- to the spirit of the lotus -- in the pe=
rseverance and the hopes of the Vietnamese people; in the strength and en=
durance of the partnership between our two nations; and in the beauty of =
both of our peoples and the desire to live in peace, dignity and justice.=
 Chc sc khoe! (Applause.)



(A toast is given.)



 END 2:16 P.M. ICT

dship, the Vietnamese people always wish to cultivate the friendship with p=
eoples around the world, including the American
 people.&nbsp; We will always remember and are grateful to American people'=
s contributions to putting an end to an unhappy chapter in the two countrie=
s' history.&nbsp; While the wounds of the war have not been fully healed in=
 both countries and differences remain in
 the bilateral relations, as time goes by we have become more deeply aware =
of the past and present, and have conviction that a friendly and cooperativ=
e relationship between our two nations will be in the best interest of both=
 peoples, as well as that of peace,
 stability, cooperation and development in the Asia Pacific and the world.<=

y:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Mr. President, as you once said -- and allow me =
to quote -- &quot;If you're walking down the right path, and you're willing=
 to keep walking, eventually you will make progress.&quot;&nbsp;
 And I would like to recall a historical event in February 1946.&nbsp; In h=
is letter to President Harry Truman, President Ho Chi Minh expressed his wi=
sh that Vietnam and the United States of America would develop a full coope=
ration.&nbsp; With the establishment of the
 Comprehensive Partnership, we're taking the path that President Ho Chi Min=
h had chosen.&nbsp; We're confident that relations on the basis of friendsh=
ip, equality, cooperation and respect for each other's political regimes an=
d legitimate interests is the only path
 leading to a brighter and more prosperous future for our next generations.=
&nbsp; Our nations have a bright future.&nbsp; And together, we can write n=
ew chapters of our relationship.&nbsp;
