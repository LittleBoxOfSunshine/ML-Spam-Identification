PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY ERIC SCHULTZ



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20





1:33 P.M. EDT





 MR. SCHULTZ: Good afternoon. I apologize for the delay. One quick announ=
cement, and then we'll go ahead and move to your questions.



 I wanted to let you all know that as of Sunday, it will have been 67 day=
s since the President fulfilled his constitutional responsibility and pre=
sented the American people with an exceptional nominee for our nations hi=
ghest court, Chief Judge Merrick Garland.



 Since 1975, the average period of time from nomination by the President =
to confirmation by the United States Senate for a Supreme Court nominee h=
as been 67 days. In that time, Chief Judge Garland has met with 58 senato=
rs, has sent a detailed questionnaire to the members of the Senate Judici=
ary Committee, including over 2,200 pages of information. And today he st=
ands ready to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on camera, un=
der oath, to answer any questions those senators may have about his nomin=
ation to the highest court.=20



 You may have seen last week, Senator McConnell said on the floor of the =
Senate that we are going to give the Senate every opportunity to do the b=
asic work of government this year. He said the elections are not an excus=
e for people *not to do their work. And you know what, we couldn't agree =
more. We believe very strongly that the Senate ought to do its job and fu=
lfill its constitutional duty to advise and consent on this nominee.=20



 By nominating a highly qualified individual, someone with more federal j=
udicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history, the P=
resident has done his job, and Chief Judge Merrick Garland continues to d=
o his. As of Sunday, it will be past time for Republicans to do theirs.



 With that, Kathleen, I'm happy to take your questions.



 Q I'm going to start with the EgyptAir crash. Do you have any update on =
U.S. assistance, and any update on who is responsible?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Kathleen, as Josh mentioned yesterday, our thoughts and pra=
yers of everyone here at the White House are with the families of those w=
ho were onboard Egypt Flight 804. Obviously the uncertainty and impending=
 sense of loss that the loved ones of those who were on that plane must b=
e experiencing is unthinkable for us here.=20



 The President continues to receive updates on this. He was first informe=
d yesterday morning by his Homeland Security Advisor and Counterterrorism=
 Advisor, Lisa Monaco. He was updated throughout the day yesterday on thi=
s. And then, this morning, as you saw, the President received his Preside=
ntial Daily Briefing.

Without violating the confidences of that briefing, I think it's a safe b=
et to say that this topic came up.



 I can tell you that the President has directed his staff to make sure th=
at administration officials are reaching out to their counterparts in bot=
h Egypt and France, and to stand up resources should they be requested. A=
lready, the Navy has sent a P-3 Orion aircraft. That aircraft is above th=
e Mediterranean right now, assisting in the search.



 Q And do you have any new information on who you think -- whether or not=
 it was a terrorist attack?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Well, for us, it's too early to definitively say what may h=
ave caused this. We continue to pursue all potential factors that have co=
ntributed. Obviously the Egyptian authorities are in the lead here, but w=
e stand ready to assist in any way we can.



 Q Okay. I also wanted to move on to the Russian defense ministers claim =
that -- is proposing joint airstrikes with Russia against al-Nusra. Are t=
hose negotiations or discussions going on with the U.S. --



 MR. SCHULTZ: Well, Kathleen, as you know, this is not the first time Rus=
sia has proposed enhancing their military cooperation with the United Sta=
tes. Right now, that cooperation is basically in de-confliction talks thr=
ough a very specific channel at the Department of Defense, based on both =
countries activities in Syria. But we believe that if Russia wants to do =
something to take on al-Nusra and ISIL, the first thing on their to-do li=
st is to make sure that the Assad regime is abiding by the Cessation of H=
ostilities in Syria. Clearly, the turmoil and chaos there is what provide=
s a fertile breeding ground for ISIL to conduct its operations.=20



So our goal is for Russia to urge its patron, Assad, to abide by the Cess=
ation of Hostilities. But we're not going to comment on any further steps=
 at this point.



 Q That's not something -- you're not ruling out the possibility that you=
 would conduct joint strikes?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, we have two priorities. One is to make sure th=
at the United States -- Counter-ISIL Coalition is doing everything we can=
 to apply maximum pressure against the threat posed by ISIL. Second, when=
 it comes to Russias involvement, they have an opportunity to help provid=
e a political solution in Syria. That is a political solution -- it's goi=
ng to be the only resolution to the crisis in Syria as we know it. And in=
 order to get to that political solution there needs to be much more stab=
ility on the ground. That stability on the ground can only be achieved if=
 the Assad regime abides by the cessation of hostilities.



 One of the main levers on the Assad regime is Russia. And so if they wan=
t to play a role in increasing pressure against Nusra and against ISIL, t=
hat's how to do it.



 Q Thanks. One last one on the Presidents upcoming trip. Do you know if h=
e plans to, or the White House plans to announce any additional assistanc=
e to Vietnam with regard to Agent Orange or exploded mines, landmines?=20=




 MR. SCHULTZ: Kathleen, I think as you know, the President is very excite=
d for this trip. We leave tomorrow afternoon. We have a whole lot on the =
agenda. We'll be spending three days in Vietnam. This is the first-ever t=
rip of its kind. As you know, President Clinton visited Vietnam to announ=
ce normalization of relations. President Bush went to Vietnam for an inte=
rnational forum. But President Obama will be spending three days on the g=
round to deepen and strengthen our partnership with that country. We'll b=
e focusing on expanding economic cooperation, security cooperation. We'll=
 be focused on people-to--people engagement.=20



As you know, Vietnam has a rapidly expanding middle class, and for us, th=
at's important for a couple of different reasons. But at the top of the l=
ist is that provides a marketplace for U.S. goods and services. So the Pr=
esident is going to use this as an opportunity to advance U.S. interests =
abroad, including our economic interests. Thats why the President worked =
so hard to gain agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Thats why he=
 is pushing that so hard domestically as well.



So I believe we will have a few more announcements along the road over th=
e next week. And those of you who are joining us, well keep you updated.



Jeff.



Q Eric, following up on the Russia question, do you or does the White Hou=
se have any sense of the motivation behind Russias proposal?=20



MR. SCHULTZ: I dont. Im not going to sit here and speculate on what our c=
ounterparts in Russia are saying. I think that youve seen Russia show an =
eagerness to cooperate with us militarily. This is not something thats ne=
w. But for us, again, we principally keep in a very specific lane about d=
e-conflicting our activities within Syria, and we dont have any new plans=
 to change that.=20



Again, our view is that if they want to do something about ISIL and Nusra=
, which is their stated goal, then the best thing they can do is help pro=
vide for a stable Iraq -- a stable Syria, and make sure that Assad abides=
 by the cessation of hostilities.



Q Speaking of Iraq, is there* a reaction to the violence in the Green Zon=
e today?



MR. SCHULTZ: We have seen those reports, and clearly our first priority i=
s the safety and security of our personnel on the ground there. We are in=
 close contact with the Iraqis regarding the current situation, and we ar=
e standing by to support them as necessary. Obviously, the situation is d=
ynamic and evolving. I was briefed just minutes ago before coming out her=
e. So the Iraqi government will have the latest information, but were goi=
ng to stay in touch with them and monitor it closely.



Q And lastly, Donald Trump today said that Prime Minister Cameron had inv=
ited him for a visit. Number 10 Downing Street said maybe not so fast, al=
though they also said it was standard for the Prime Minister to meet with=
 the candidates of both parties. Any reaction to that?



MR. SCHULTZ: I dont. Obviously, the President was just in London with som=
e of you. We had a great visit there. The partnership between the United =
Kingdom and the United States is one thats special and unique. We deeply =
value our relationship. The President had a great visit with Prime Minist=
er Cameron.=20



If I was feeling looser, Id recall a 2012 visit by a different Republican=
 presidential candidate, but I dont do that right now.



Q Shows remarkable restraint. (Laughter.) You say that the United States =
government stands ready to assist, which sounds like the posture we were =
in yesterday. Has Egypt requested assistance? Have they accepted it?



MR. SCHULTZ: So I dont have specific conversations to read out to you. Ty=
pically these are conversations and discussions that happen with my colle=
agues at the Department of Defense and Department of State, and, to the e=
xtent appropriate, Department of Homeland Security. So I can tell you tha=
t the Navy has already deployed an Orion P-3 aircraft. That plane is over=
 the Mediterranean right now, assisting in the investigation. And if ther=
e are other assets that are deployed, well let you know.



Q But the government hasnt asked for it yet?



MR. SCHULTZ: Again, I dont want to read out private conversations, but we=
 stand ready to assist. And thats a directive directly from the President=
.



Q Egypt is sending the message that this crash was not their fault becaus=
e the plane originated in Paris. The last time -- we had Metrojet -- the =
focus I think was on Egypt, and they were reluctant to say that they had =
a little bit of culpability in it. Do you buy the Egypt argument that the=
yre not responsible because this plane originated in Paris?



MR. SCHULTZ: I understand the inclination to sort of speculate. I think o=
ur first priority is helping the authorities find a plane. And so until t=
hat happens, its going to be hard for us to reach any definitive conclusi=
on on what happened. So Im going to reserve judgment.



Q Just a couple other questions. General Dunford has been quoted as predi=
cting a long mission to Libya in the fight against ISIS. Can you give us =
some idea of what that mission might look like?



MR. SCHULTZ: I can. Joe, as you know, this administration is focused on s=
upporting the Government of National Accord in Tripoli as it strives to r=
estore stability and security to Libya and to serve the Libyan people. We=
 commend the Prime Minister there and the leadership of the new governmen=
t for taking steps in the process of restoring a unified governance to th=
at country.



The United States -- and I think this goes to your question -- would welc=
ome a request from the Libyan government to strengthen the capabilities o=
f the presidential guard there, embedded forces supporting and aligned wi=
th the Government of National Accord.



We will work with members of the international community on such a reques=
t. And, as General Dunford indicated today, it is possible that NATO coul=
d have a supportive role to help build Libyan capacity to provide securit=
y and combat ISIL. Clearly, thats a goal shared by the Prime Minister the=
re, by the government there, and thats something we stand ready to assist=
 with.



Q Are we talking about a lead role here?=20



MR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think obviously combatting the threat posed by ISIL =
is something that the United States has led on throughout the world. Weve=
 assembled a coalition of countries around the world. And so the Presiden=
t has asserted that this is a priority for us. So were happy to entertain=
 a request from the Libyan government, but I dont know if its gotten to t=
hat level of detail yet.



Q And last question. The President is going to be promoting TPP in Asia. =
When you think about it, Sanders, Clinton, even Trump have also been oppo=
sed to TPP. Whats the calculation over here as far as the likelihood of i=
t getting anywhere, given the fact that all three of the presidential can=
didates appear to be opposed?



MR. SCHULTZ: Well, only one of them has a vote in Congress right now. And=
 we continue to work with our partners in Congress and the leadership in =
both the House and the Senate, and we believe that this is something that=
 should pass because its good for American workers.



As I mentioned, Vietnam has a rapidly growing middle class. We want to ma=
ke sure that American goods and services and American companies can servi=
ce that middle class with the products made in the U.S. of A. So we belie=
ve that this is a good deal for Americas workers. We also believe that it=
 -- well, we know, because it's in the text, that it will reduce tariffs =
for American exports.=20



It's important that American exports are able to get into those markets. =
And above all else, if we don't set the rules of the road in the economie=
s in this region, China is going to. So we believe that it's in American =
interest for TPP to pass. We believe that theres a reason that Trade Prom=
otion Authority passed the House and the Senate with bipartisan support. =
And we're going to continue to push for that.



 I'll just give you a few more statistics in case it's helpful. In Vietna=
m, currently U.S. auto exports face a 70 percent tariff. Construction equ=
ipment faces tariffs as high as 59 percent. And auto parts face a 32 perc=
ent tariff. In Japan, currently U.S. beef exports face tariffs of nearly =
40 percent, and leather footwear faces tariffs of up to 189 percent.



 So we believe this is a deal that represents not only the future of the =
interconnected global economy but also a potential for American goods and=
 services to be sold and purchased around the world.



 Chris.



 Q Eric, this week, after approving a defense bill that would allow feder=
al contractors to discriminate against LGBT workers, the House yesterday =
defeated an amendment from Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney that would ha=
ve voided that language. At first it looked as though the amendment would=
 have passed, but then seven House Republicans changed their votes and th=
e amendment failed 213-212. Does the White House think House leadership s=
trong-armed those seven lawmakers to change their votes?



 MR. SCHULTZ: I saw that episode yesterday, Chris, and I read the reports=
 afterwards. As you know, earlier this week we put out a very detailed St=
atement of Administration Policy explaining our objections to this piece =
of legislation. I'm happy to walk you through a few of them now. But the =
broadest way to put this is that this bill inserts obstacles in the way o=
f our Defense Department trying to modernize our military forces. We ofte=
n hear Republican rhetoric, especially on the campaign trail, talking abo=
ut how our military has been eviscerated. And what's going to eviscerate =
them is if the Defense Department doesnt have the resources and equipment=
 and capabilities they need to modernize and make sure that we have the m=
ilitary needed to face down 21st century threats.



 This bill also includes what we've called a funding gimmick called the O=
verseas Contingency Operation. This is something Secretary Carter himself=
 has called "gambling with war-fighting money" at a time of war. We think=
 that's an illegitimate way to fund our government, and does a disservice=
 to our troops.



 Second, this is a piece of legislation that restricts our ability to clo=
se the prison at Guantanamo Bay. That is a facility that Democrats and Re=
publicans purportedly share the goal of closing for a whole host of reaso=
ns -- namely, it's a recruiting tool for those who wish to do us harm. We=
've seen the prison at Guantanamo Bay repeatedly used in propaganda mater=
ials from terrorist organizations. We also know the prison at Guantanamo =
Bay is exorbitantly expensive. It costs about $445 million a year to oper=
ate. We can do this -- we can keep our country secure in a much more fisc=
ally responsible way.=20



 And the least reason is it's inconsistent with our values. This is somet=
hing that this President has spoken out on for many years now, and it's a=
lso something that, again, Democrats and Republicans have echoed as well.=
=20



And as you point out, one of the other objectionable pieces of this legis=
lation is that it would make it easier to discriminate on the basis of se=
xual orientation. That has nothing to do with our national defense. I can=
't for the life of me figure out why Republicans would want to insert an =
ideological rider into a defense bill, let alone one that is mean-spirite=
d like that.



 So I did see what happened on the floor of the House of Representatives =
yesterday. I know that the measure by Congressman Maloney was on track to=
 pass and then it failed. We believe that overriding the President's work=
 to make sure that defense contractors don't discriminate based on sexual=
 orientation -- trying to override that is misguided and ill-advised. It'=
s also mean-spirited. It's also inconsistent with American values of equa=
lity and tolerance.



 Q But do you believe that House leadership instigated the spectacle that=
 took place on the House floor yesterday?



 MR. SCHULTZ: I can't speak to the machinations of the House floor yester=
day.=20



 Cheryl.



 Q Thanks, Eric. On Zika funding, the President was fairly critical just =
now, or this morning, of both the House and the Senate bill as not being =
enough. I guess do you have a veto threat to give us today?



 MR. SCHULTZ: I came out here just with a ballpoint pen. (Laughter.)



 Look, as we have said, we believe -- we have issued a veto threat on the=
 House bill. We believe that's woefully inadequate. It not only underfund=
s this urgent priority dramatically, but it also, as we say, robs Peter t=
o pay Paul. It takes away crucial funding from our fight against Ebola --=
 a fight and an effort that you all remember vividly -- because I do, sit=
ting in that chair, as you all asked questions -- you all asked very legi=
timate questions about what we were doing to combat it.



 So we believe we shouldn't take our eye off that ball just because a new=
 public health threat is emerging. We can do both. And there are U.S. gov=
ernment personnel on the ground in Africa, still working on that, very ea=
rnestly, and there is now a new threat that we should be combatting at th=
e same time.=20



 As you know, the President asked three months ago, now, for $1.9 billion=
 for Congress to allocate that. The House has fallen woefully short. The =
Senate made a little bit more progress. It's not often that we invoke the=
 junior Senator from Florida, who recently ran for President, but he put =
it better than I could. He said, admittedly, this is a request that comes=
 from the President, but it's grounded in reality from our public health =
officials.=20



 So we believe that if members of Congress want to make decisions on the =
merits, they should look at the facts and they should look at science. Th=
ey have a week left before they take another week-long recess. They shoul=
d get to work and fund this request. There's no reason for delay.



 Q I hear you and the White House has sent that message many times before=
. So would the President veto $1.1 billion Senate bill as not being enoug=
h?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Well, Cheryl, obviously that is short of what the President=
's request is. And the President didn't just pick a number out of the air=
 -- the President sent up a detailed package -- again, not just a press r=
elease, not just a letter, not just a set of talking points, but a detail=
ed analysis grounded in facts and the latest information from our public =
health officials, laying out this request.



 And this isn't something that can be subject to partisan bickering, and =
it shouldn't be something where Congress just passes the buck. We're talk=
ing about the health and public safety of pregnant women and children. An=
d Congress need to get a bill to the President's desk for a signature as =
soon as possible.



 Q You didn't answer her question.



 MR. SCHULTZ: Again, the Senate bill is something that falls short of the=
 President's funding request. They made more progress in the Senate than =
they did in the House. I'll remind you that the Senate bill is bipartisan=
.



 Q Would he veto it?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, the Senate bill is more progress -- allocated =
more funding, doesn't rob Peter to pay Paul, so we're more encouraged by =
what the Senate did. But there's a long way to go, because clearly the Ho=
use and the Senate are in vastly different places. I would also note that=
 the junior Senator from Florida felt strongly that the $1.9 billion shou=
ld be fully funded, so I'm curious why the House members who represent th=
at great state, the "Sunshine State," aren't also in sync with their Sena=
te leadership, their Senate colleagues, because it seems like if I was a =
member of Congress from Florida, then I would be doing everything I could=
 to make sure that my constituents are protected from this.



 James.



 Q A few different subjects, but just staying with Zika funding for the m=
oment. I guess a simple way to ask this question is, why is there no veto=
 threat against the Senate measure?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Well, we should be clear here that the Senate passed a bill=
 that's $1.1 billion. That is quite a bit short of the $1.9 billion that =
our public health professionals tell us we need. So we believe it's a ste=
p in the right direction. We are encouraged by bipartisan support on that=
 front. It's rare in Washington these days we get bipartisan support, so =
we are encouraged by the steps they took. But we still continue to urge C=
ongress to fund the President's request. We feel like anything short of t=
hat will be insufficient.=20



And I am happy to walk you through some of the actions that we could be t=
aking as soon as that money is allocated. For example, without the fundin=
g, vaccine development is getting delayed, diagnostic testing is getting =
delayed, funding for mosquito control could slow or even halt, and states=
 don't have the funding they need to fight Zika. This is a request that c=
omes from governors, James, and that is why we want to make sure that tho=
se states are getting the resources they need to combat this.



 I'll say one more thing -- that we know that at some point there's going=
 to be a media -- let's say a heightened level of interest in this and wh=
at is the federal government doing to respond. And when that day comes, I=
 want you to remember the preceding three months of Congresss inaction on=
 this.



 Q So, to that point, listening to the President this morning, there seem=
ed to be kind of a passivity in the sense that he was saying Congress nee=
ds to get something to my desk. And he was urging members of the public t=
o contact their lawmakers to exert that kind of pressure on them for that=
 purpose. But I just wonder, where is the President's own outreach on thi=
s? Why isnt he bringing people into the Oval Office for serious conferenc=
e sessions with himself? And if it's so urgent, why isnt he finding $1.9 =
billion somewhere within his discretionary funds in order to meet this em=
ergency?



 MR. SCHULTZ: I'll take the last part of your question, first, which is t=
he President was able to retrieve some funds that had been previously all=
ocated to fight Ebola. We maxed out on that. We scraped the bottom of the=
 barrel. So that money has been reallocated to fight Zika, but we can't t=
ake any more of those funds without endangering our effort to combat Ebol=
a.=20

=20

 To the first part of your question, I would just point you to this Febru=
ary 22nd proposal that we sent to Congress, outlining our plan. This wasn=
t a haphazard package that we put together in a few minutes or a few hour=
s. This was a detailed proposal. It includes guidance from the Office of =
Management and Budget. It also includes guidance from our public health o=
fficials at the CDC and NIH, and goes into detail about why we need these=
 funds.



 Q But why isnt he working Congress in the manner of a Lyndon Johnson? Wh=
y isnt he getting people in the Oval Office, saying, you're not going any=
where until we have this money for what he himself called an emergency ba=
ck in February?



 MR. SCHULTZ: I wouldnt stipulate to those facts. I can tell you that we =
dont always read out every conversation the President has, but I can assu=
re you there is not a member of Congress who is not aware of the request =
that we have before them. And I can also tell you that White House offici=
als continue to remain engaged with members of Congress to get this done.=




 Q Very quickly -- the Green Zone issue raised earlier -- should the fact=
 of this violence in that particular area lead people to conclude the cen=
tral government in Iraq is in very serious trouble?



 MR. SCHULTZ: I'm not sure that's the conclusion that we would draw. Our =
conclusion is that Iraq does need a stable and functional government, and=
 we need that for a couple of different reasons. First and foremost is, o=
nly with a functional government can we have active partners on the groun=
d to pursue the fight against ISIL. So our first priority is making sure =
that Prime Minister Abadi has a functional government. Sometimes that's g=
oing to include dissent and peaceful protests. But as I talked about, thi=
s situation is dynamic and ongoing, so we're going to continue to monitor=
 it closely. But we stand ready to provide any support and assistance we =
can.



 Q Last question. In advance of the President's trip to Vietnam -- Mr. Ob=
ama was, if my math is correct, 14 at the time of the United States' fina=
l withdrawal from Saigon. And I just wonder if you could speak, to the ex=
tent possible for you, how the Vietnam War and the post-Vietnam period sh=
aped this President's view of America and the world.



 MR. SCHULTZ: James, I think that's a very good question, and I think you=
're going to hear the President talk about that over the next couple of d=
ays, so I dont want to get ahead of him. I will say the President is very=
 much focused on this trip. This is one that has been in the works for a =
while and it's a trip that he wanted to make. He felt very strongly about=
 this. And we're spending three days -- we're spending three days on the =
ground. That's a lot for one country, normally, on these trips.=20

The President is not only looking forward to speaking with the leadership=
 in Vietnam and government leaders, but he's also going to be speaking wi=
th young people. He's going to have a town hall where he takes questions =
from young people. He's going to meet with business leaders and civic lea=
ders. And he's going to talk about how far we've come since those days in=
 the decades since the time you mentioned to now, and how far our relatio=
nship has come.=20



 As I mentioned, it was President Clinton who decided to begin the normal=
ization process with Vietnam. Since then, Presidents of both parties have=
 worked to deepen that relationship. But the President sees this as a piv=
otal opportunity to expand that partnership, expand collaboration on secu=
rity and economic cooperation.=20



And I want to be clear that he's also going to make a push for human righ=
ts. Vietnam has made some progress on this front, but they have a long wa=
y to go. So I'd expect the President to speak about that not only in his =
public remarks but also in private when he meets with the leadership.



 Q But in your own time around this President, has that been something th=
at you've been able to observe, this idea that he was very much shaped by=
 the post-Vietnam experience in some ways?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Again, I dont want to get ahead of how the President is goi=
ng to talk about this. I believe he wrote some about this in his book, an=
d so I'd refer you that. But I also think this was a consequential time f=
or the President, but it was a consequential time for the United States o=
f America. And this will harken back to a very emotional time for the Uni=
ted States and a time where our leaders were tested and tried and challen=
ged. And I think the President is going to -- that will all be included i=
n the President's reflections over the next few days. And I want to make =
sure you know that Secretary Kerry, who obviously has his own unique stor=
y, will be joining us in Vietnam for those three days. So we look forward=
 to hearing from him as well.



 Yes, Mark.



 Q Eric, do you know if the update that President Obama got on the Zika v=
irus, whether it included discussion of the risks to U.S. athletes planni=
ng on going to the Summer Games in Brazil?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Mark, I dont know if the discussion this morning included t=
hat piece. I can tell you the President was updated on both where things =
stand and sort of the status of what we know from our latest public healt=
h information, but also the latest on our response to this effort. As I m=
entioned, we were able to allocate some funds from the Ebola effort to th=
is, but we're also being stymied because Congress refuses to act for ways=
 that escape my comprehension.



 Q And yesterday, the U.S. swimming team announced it was moving its trai=
ning camp from Puerto Rico to Atlanta because of the Zika virus. Is that =
something that came up in the briefing?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Again, I dont know if the Olympics came up. I understand th=
e interest in this, but as we have said, we defer to people's personal de=
cisions made with their doctors.



 Thanks, Mark.=20



Karen.



 Q Does the White House have confidence that the Egyptians can handle thi=
s -- taking the lead in the recovery effort with the plane and the invest=
igation?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Well, Karen, as we've said, the Egyptians are in the lead o=
n this. We stand ready to support. I know they're working closely with ou=
r French counterparts. And so we want to make sure that that investigatio=
n is as comprehensive and as fast as possible. So that's why the Presiden=
t directed his team to make resources available. But I dont know have upd=
ates for you on the sort of status of that investigation.



 Q Would the White House rather see France take the lead on this?=20



 MR. SCHULTZ: I havent heard that determination made. Obviously, the Egyp=
tian authorities right now are in the lead of this investigation, and we =
want it to proceed without delay.



 Q Two more. I think you had said yesterday -- Josh had said there hadnt =
been conversations yet with the Presidents of Egypt and France. Is there =
any update on that?



 MR. SCHULTZ: I dont have any new calls to read out to you, but if that w=
ere to happen, we'll let you know.



 Q And one more quick one. The TSA Administrator said today -- he alluded=
 that there could be potential changes coming to the TSA, that there migh=
t even be an increase in staff or increase in funding to handle any chang=
es that would be made in the wake of this plane incident. Is the TSA prep=
ared with staffing and funding? And what did he mean? What would that loo=
k like?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Well, it was the TSA Administrator, so you should check in =
with the TSA. They're best prepared to sort of answer the details of thei=
r operational decisions. I can tell you that, last week, Secretary Johnso=
n, our Secretary of Homeland Security -- which TSA is a component of -- d=
irected TSA to take several steps to address the long security lines. And=
 so we are always making sure that we're constantly balancing to make sur=
e that people's air travel remains unfettered while keeping them safe. So=
 you should check in with them on that.=20



 Obviously, our first priority is making sure that people are safe. TSA m=
ust continue its rigorous security screenings and we're not going to lowe=
r our standards for the sake of convenience.



 Chip.



 Q Can I follow up on Mark's questions? More generally, was there -- I do=
nt know if you were in the room, but was there discussion in there of peo=
ple restricting their travel to certain areas, generally?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Chip, I was not in the room. I know the President spoke at =
the bottom of the meeting, so I'm not sure we're going to have any more o=
f an expanded readout on that. Those travel warnings are typically issued=
 by the CDC, so if they have any updates on what they're advising the Ame=
rican people, you might want to check with them.=20



But our belief is that federal, state and local partners should be workin=
g together to limit the impact of this virus. But right now they don't ha=
ve the resources they need, and that's a real shame. And that's why the P=
resident is going to continue to make the public case that Congress shoul=
d pass this bill. And it's also why White House officials remain engaged =
with members of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate=
 so that Congress can get its act together and get this bill to the Presi=
dents desk.



 Q I asked Josh yesterday about Puerto Rico and the bill that just passed=
, and specifically the minimum wage requirement in the bill that would al=
low a reduction in the minimum wage in Puerto Rico. To sort of follow up =
on that, why did the White House not fight harder to not have that be a p=
art of the final package? Especially since the White House made such a bi=
g deal out of increasing the minimum wage, why not fight harder on that?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Just want to take it -- I don't think the bill passed. I th=
ink it was just introduced, right? So we actually believe that, given tha=
t it hasnt passed -- I don't even think it's passed committee yet -- we b=
elieve there is still time for those provisions to come out and we would =
strongly urge members of the House of Representatives and the United Stat=
es Senate to do just that.=20



 Again, Josh laid out the scenario yesterday of the 18- or 19-year-old Pu=
erto Rican making minimum wage. It doesnt seem to make much sense that, A=
, they bear the brunt of poor fiscal decisions that were made by people t=
hey don't even know. And it also doesnt make a lot of sense that if we're=
 trying to grow the economy and stabilize the economy in Puerto Rico that=
 they can't even make a livable wage.=20



So we do believe those provisions are misguided. We are disappointed the =
bill includes those unhelpful measures. I will say theyre better than the=
 original proposal, which I believe theyre now temporary. But we ultimate=
ly believe they should come out.



Q Does this run the risk if this overall package is successful in sort of=
 turning around and helping the Puerto Ricans get out of their economic t=
roubles that people who say that the minimum wage should not be raised wi=
ll have a new piece of evidence, pointing at Puerto Rico saying we reduce=
d the minimum wage there and it worked, and we could do that in the case =
of the entire nation?=20



MR. SCHULTZ: Well, lets just separate out those two issues. First, on Pue=
rto Rico, we absolutely would have preferred a bill without the minimum w=
age and the overtime protections that you mentioned, but we do believe th=
is is a bill that both Democrats and Republicans can support. This is not=
 a bailout. We're encouraged to see the House introduce this legislation =
that ultimately provides Puerto Rico with the tools they need to address =
the crisis, harming 3.5 million Americans in Puerto Rico.



The administration made clear I believe almost a year ago that any legisl=
ation to address the crisis in Puerto Rico must provide a workable and co=
mprehensive restructuring authority with appropriate oversight that respe=
cts Puerto Ricos self-governance. And we also said at the time that only =
bipartisan congressional action can end this crisis. So that's why we urg=
ed members to stand firm against the special interests attempting to unde=
rmine this essential legislation and act without delay.



In terms of the issue of the minimum wage across this country, clearly th=
e American workers need and deserve a raise. We've talked frequently abou=
t how to give American workers more money in their pocket, earn a livable=
 wage and earn a wage that is commensurate with what theyre working. The =
President announced recently new rules to make sure that Americans were p=
aid fairly for the work they were putting in.



But there is probably nothing else on the table that would have more of a=
n impact than if Congress were to raise the minimum wage. This would help=
 middle-class families around the country. The President believes -- and =
I think his record for the past seven or eight years affirms -- that when=
 we grow the economy from the middle class out, everyone wins. Raising th=
e minimum wage is not just something that we believe, but I believe we're=
 up to about 17 or 18 different states that have taken action on their ow=
n, and we've seen private companies take action on their own. They believ=
e -- those companies -- and you should check with them -- have said that =
when they pay their workers a better wage then that increases productivit=
y in their own bottom lines.=20



So we don't really understand why Congress is so dug in on this, why Cong=
ress doesnt want to lift wages for American workers. So you should ask th=
em what their rationale is. But we we're going to continue to press hard =
and do everything we can, even while Congress is dug in. And that's why I=
 think youve seen a number of states push this with our support and a num=
ber of private companies. And cities, too, actually.



Q On the Nigerian schoolgirls, the Nigerian government just announced tha=
t they have conducted an operation that rescued several women, including =
a second one of the Nigerian schoolgirls, in the last week. Was the U.S. =
involved at all in the operation? And do you have any reaction to it?



MR. SCHULTZ: I can tell you that we are aware of the reports and we do aw=
ait official confirmation from the Nigerian government. Unfortunately, Bo=
ko Harams impact goes well beyond the Chibok girls. We are equally concer=
ned about the thousands of other kidnapping victims of Boko Haram and the=
 more than 2 million who have been forced to flee their homes.



The United States supports the Nigerian efforts to bring about the safe r=
ecovery of all of those kidnapped, and we call for all hostages held by B=
oko Haram to be immediately released without preconditions.



In terms of the United States role, we are a strategic partner with Niger=
ia and we continue to work closely on all security matters. And we offere=
d our assistance and resources to bring about the safe recovery of all of=
 those kidnapped by Boko Haram.



Goyal.



Q Thank you. Two questions. One, President said that if you harm the U.S.=
 sooner or later you will regret it. And he was referring to Osama bin La=
dens after five years. Now, has anything changed in the last five years a=
fter the President got Osama bin Laden? And those who were protecting him=
 and keeping him for the last 10 years -- have they brought to justice, o=
r anything changed between the U.S. and the 10 years in that country and =
five years --



MR. SCHULTZ: Goyal, I think what the President was talking about was terr=
orists who either aim to do us harm or who commit acts of violence or ter=
rorism against us. And you're right, the President has a strong record th=
at if you commit an act of violence or terrorism against us, we will stop=
 at nothing to find you. Osama bin Laden is one example, but I believe th=
e Defense Department briefed yesterday the latest in our fight against IS=
IL, and I believe the Defense Department laid out that over 120 mid-to-hi=
gh-value leaders of that organization have been taken off the battlefield=
. So I think thats what the President had in mind.



Q Mr. Fareed Zakaria also, CNN, in his show, he said that -- why do they =
hate us? If the President had been ever asked this, why they hate us. It =
means he was -- harming the U.S. but they still hate the U.S. Why?



MR. SCHULTZ: Well, I did not see Mr. Zakarias show. I try and catch that =
when I can, but I must have missed that particular segment. I believe tha=
t the President has worked hard to build relationships around the world. =
That was a priority for him over the past seven, eight years.=20



And look at this trip. Were going to go to Vietnam. Its the first-ever tr=
ip of its kind -- where the President is going to spend three days on the=
 ground, both meeting with the government, the leaders of that country, b=
ut also with young people, with entrepreneurs, with business leaders in o=
rder to deepen the ties between the two countries. And then hes going to =
travel to Japan.



Both of those countries we have a difficult past with, but if you look at=
 the preceding decades, weve built strong relationships. Japan is now one=
 of our closest allies in that region. We do a whole lot of business with=
 them, both in military cooperation, maritime security, economic cooperat=
ion.=20



And so the President is absolutely looking forward to deepening those rel=
ationships. Those are the fundamental goals of this trip, alongside advan=
cing U.S. national security interests.



Q Fareed Zakaria was talking about ISIL and terrorists and why they hate =
the U.S., why they hate --



MR. SCHULTZ: Youll have to ask them why they say what they do.



Q And if I may, quickly, as far as Prime Minister Modis visit to the Whit=
e House is concerned, Indian American community and the Congress both are=
 waiting for an address to the Congress. Anything new from the White Hous=
e as far as the visit is concerned?



MR. SCHULTZ: No. As you saw, this morning we were pleased to announce tha=
t Prime Minister Modi of India will visit the White House on Tuesday, Jun=
e 7. This is going to be a visit that highlights the deepening of the U.S=
.-India relationship in key areas since the Presidents visit to New Delhi=
 in January of 2015. The President looks forward to discussing progress m=
ade on climate change, on our clean energy partnership, on security and d=
efense cooperation, and, of course, our economic growth proposals -- prio=
rities.



So I think well have more to talk about on that visit in the coming weeks=
. But the President is absolutely looking forward to this visit.



Q Is this a state visit?



MR. SCHULTZ: I dont believe so, no.=20



John, do you have a question?



Q Back on Zika. I want to try this a different way. Given the bipartisan =
support for the Senate bill, would the President sign something -- would =
he sign the Senate bill or something very similar?



MR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, we sent up a proposal about three months ago, F=
ebruary 22nd -- so in two days it will be -- maybe thats the anniversary =
for both the 67 days, which is the average time that a Supreme Court just=
ice should be confirmed and the anniversary of our proposal to fund Zika.=




Q -- for numerology. (Laughter.)=20



MR. SCHULTZ: It will be a busy day for journalists trying to mark where w=
e are.=20



So the President sent that up on February 22nd. Thats not a proposal that=
 we sort of put together haphazardly. That was a proposal based on guidan=
ce from our public health officials in terms of making sure the governmen=
t had the resources they need. We didnt insert a lot of wiggle room in th=
at proposal. We actually laid out in very detailed ways what that money w=
ould be used for.=20



So I know that the Senate made a lot more progress than the House did. It=
s unclear how those two packages would be reconciled if even thats their =
plan. But I think thats why you heard the President call on Congress to w=
ork together, both Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate,=
 in order to get this done.



I dont know why this became a partisan issue. As, again, the junior Senat=
or from Florida has said, this is an issue of public health. And we belie=
ve Senator Rubios House colleagues should follow suit.



Q And on Hiroshima, its pretty clear theres no apology coming. But would =
the President express something like remorse or something similar?



MR. SCHULTZ: John, the President is not going to revisit the decision to =
bomb Hiroshima. What he will do is he will lay a wreath at the Peace Memo=
rial. Hes going to briefly tour the memorial grounds and deliver brief re=
marks reflecting on his impressions there. Hell be joined by Prime Minist=
er Abe. And I do expect him to recognize the human toll of war, the speci=
al responsibility that the United States carries as the only country in t=
he world to use a nuclear weapon. And of course, he will reaffirm the Uni=
ted States commitment to working towards a world with no nuclear weapons.=




Greg.



Q You say theres no wiggle room -- what the President sent up on February=
 22nd was a multi-year, no-year appropriation with broad transferability.=
 And if you look at the history of how Congress actually approves these e=
mergency supplementals, they almost always put a year appropriation on th=
em. So my question to you is, what number does this administration need i=
n fiscal year 2016 for Zika funding?



 MR. SCHULTZ: That number is $1.9 billion. And let me -- thank you for th=
e opportunity to address this. What I meant by wiggle room is that number=
, the proposal that we developed wasn't done willy-nilly. It was done bas=
ed on the advice and guidance of our public health professionals. And so =
that is the number that they have determined is what is needed to fight t=
his possible threat.



 Q Okay, so if you need $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2016, are you going t=
o come back with another request for an appropriation in 2017? 2018?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think first steps first, right? Congress can't even=
 get this done. So our belief is -- and I appreciate you going back to lo=
ok at the history here because what the House of Representatives has done=
 is tried to find offsets, which we believe is misguided, which is incons=
istent with how these requests have been allocated in the past. So we do =
want Congress to look at history. They rose to the occasion on Ebola and =
they actually allocated a sufficient amount of money in order for the Uni=
ted States government to do its job to combat this threat. And now we're =
looking for the same thing on this.



 Q So $1.9 billion or bust?



 MR. SCHULTZ: Our request has been $1.9 billion, and we hope that's fulfi=
lled with some urgency.



 Yes.



 Q One of the criticism that Republicans have leveled against that $1.9 b=
illion request is that there are long-term projects included in it, like =
new construction. How is that part of the emergency funding that the Pres=
ident speaks to with such urgency? I guess to follow up, the $1.1 billion=
 is not a number that Republicans say they came up with haphazardly.

=20

 MR. SCHULTZ: Well, you'll have to ask them why -- what they see is the f=
oundation for their numbers.



 Q Like I said, it takes out things that aren't emergency, like new const=
ruction.



 MR. SCHULTZ: Well, I urge you to take a look at our proposal because wha=
t we do is we detail exactly what these funds would be used. And what I c=
an do for you is lay out exactly what's not happening because Congress ha=
sn't done its job. And let me just walk you through a few examples.=20



By Congress stymying this request, they have delayed the development of v=
accines. We're asked frequently in this room what the status of that deve=
lopment is. Unfortunately, we are unable to accelerate that because of Co=
ngress not doing its job. Diagnostics tests to make sure that manufacture=
rs can develop faster and more accurate tests are needed to ensure sort o=
f a frontline diagnostics and expand laboratory capacity -- that's not ge=
tting done because Congress isn't doing its job. Funding for mosquito con=
trol has slowed and even halted in some areas. We have states and partner=
s on the ground that are starting to do mosquito surveillance control act=
ivities, but they need funding. That stuff doesn't pay for itself.=20



 And so, again, I cannot for the life of me figure out why Congress wants=
 to pass the buck on this instead of rolling up their sleeves and doing t=
heir job.



 Thanks. I will do the week ahead, and then Mark can get started on his w=
eekend. (Laughter.) New spokesman, same joke.



 I know we've already laid out the schedule so I might have to hunt -- oh=
, I think I have it.



 Great. Go as you know, the President will depart Sunday afternoon -- I'm=
 sorry, Saturday afternoon, and Monday morning arrive in Hanoi, Vietnam. =
While in Hanoi, the President will participate in a bilateral meeting wit=
h President Quang. Following this meeting, the President will meet with t=
he Chairwoman of the National Assembly. And afterwards, the President wil=
l participate in a press conference with the President, and attend the st=
ate luncheon.=20



Later in the afternoon, the President will participate in a bilateral mee=
ting with the Prime Minister of Vietnam. In the evening, the President wi=
ll participate in a bilateral meeting with General Secretary of the Commu=
nity Party of Vietnam.=20



 On Tuesday, the President will meet with embassy personnel and families.=
 Later in the morning, the President will meet with members of civil soci=
ety -- that's something that the President likes to do in these countries=
. In the afternoon, the President will deliver remarks on U.S.-Vietnam re=
lations, where I think he'll reflect on a lot of the themes we spoke of h=
ere today.



 The President will then travel to Ho Chi Minh City. He will tour the Jad=
e Pagoda, and following his visit, he'll make remarks.



 On Wednesday, the President will meet with U.S. consulate staff and fami=
ly members, and then the President will participate in a town hall with y=
oung people in Ho Chi Minh City. In the afternoon, the President will dep=
art Vietnam en route to Japan.



 On Thursday, he'll make a cultural stop, and then in the afternoon, he'l=
l attend meetings at the G7 Summit.



 On Friday, the President will attend G7 meetings on energy, climate -- i=
n particular the implementation of the Paris agreement -- and the prosper=
ity of Asia and the United States.=20



In the afternoon, the President will depart en route to Hiroshima. While =
in Hiroshima, the President, as we discussed, will deliver remarks, and p=
articipate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. T=
he President will also meet with servicemembers. And in the evening, the =
President will depart for Washington, D.C.



 With that, have a great weekend.=20



 Thank you.

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Good aft=
ernoon.&nbsp; I apologize for the delay.&nbsp; One quick announcement, and =
then we'll go ahead and move to your questions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to let you all kno=
w that as of Sunday, it will have been 67 days since the President fulfille=
d his constitutional responsibility and presented the American people with =
an exceptional nominee for our nation&#8217;s highest court,
 Chief Judge Merrick Garland.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1975, the average per=
iod of time from nomination by the President to confirmation by the United =
States Senate for a Supreme Court nominee has been 67 days.&nbsp; In that t=
ime, Chief Judge Garland has met with 58 senators, has sent
 a detailed questionnaire to the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee,=
 including over 2,200 pages of information.&nbsp; And today he stands ready=
 to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on camera, under oath, to=
 answer any questions those senators
 may have about his nomination to the highest court. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may have seen last week=
, Senator McConnell said on the floor of the Senate that &#8220;we are goin=
g to give the Senate every opportunity to do the basic work of government t=
his year.&#8221;&nbsp; He said the elections are not an excuse for people
 *not to do their work. And you know what, we couldn't agree more.&nbsp; We=
 believe very strongly that the Senate ought to do its job and fulfill its =
constitutional duty to advise and consent on this nominee.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By nominating a highly qual=
ified individual, someone with more federal judicial experience than any ot=
her Supreme Court nominee in history, the President has done his job, and C=
hief Judge Merrick Garland continues to do his.&nbsp; As of
 Sunday, it will be past time for Republicans to do theirs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Kathleen, I'm ha=
ppy to take your questions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm goi=
ng to start with the EgyptAir crash.&nbsp; Do you have any update on U.S. a=
ssistance, and any update on who is responsible?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Kathleen=
, as Josh mentioned yesterday, our thoughts and prayers of everyone here at=
 the White House are with the families of those who were onboard Egypt Flig=
ht 804.&nbsp; Obviously the uncertainty and impending sense of loss
 that the loved ones of those who were on that plane must be experiencing i=
s unthinkable for us here.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President continues to =
receive updates on this.&nbsp; He was first informed yesterday morning by h=
is Homeland Security Advisor and Counterterrorism Advisor, Lisa Monaco.&nbs=
p; He was updated throughout the day yesterday on this.&nbsp; And then,
 this morning, as you saw, the President received his Presidential Daily Br=
iefing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">Without violating the confidences of that briefing, =
I think it's a safe bet to say that this topic came up.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can tell you that the Pre=
sident has directed his staff to make sure that administration officials ar=
e reaching out to their counterparts in both Egypt and France, and to stand=
 up resources should they be requested.&nbsp; Already, the
 Navy has sent a P-3 Orion aircraft.&nbsp; That aircraft is above the Medit=
erranean right now, assisting in the search.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do =
you have any new information on who you think -- whether or not it was a te=
rrorist attack?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, fo=
r us, it's too early to definitively say what may have caused this.&nbsp; W=
e continue to pursue all potential factors that have contributed.&nbsp; Obv=
iously the Egyptian authorities are in the lead here, but we stand ready
 to assist in any way we can.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&n=
bsp; I also wanted to move on to the Russian defense minister&#8217;s claim=
 that -- is proposing joint airstrikes with Russia against al-Nusra.&nbsp; =
Are those negotiations or discussions going on with the U.S. --<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, Ka=
thleen, as you know, this is not the first time Russia has proposed enhanci=
ng their military cooperation with the United States.&nbsp; Right now, that=
 cooperation is basically in de-confliction talks through a very
 specific channel at the Department of Defense, based on both countries&#82=
17; activities in Syria.&nbsp; But we believe that if Russia wants to do so=
mething to take on al-Nusra and ISIL, the first thing on their to-do list i=
s to make sure that the Assad regime is abiding
 by the Cessation of Hostilities in Syria.&nbsp; Clearly, the turmoil and c=
haos there is what provides a fertile breeding ground for ISIL to conduct i=
ts operations.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So our goal is for Russia=
 to urge its patron, Assad, to abide by the Cessation of Hostilities.&nbsp;=
 But we're not going to comment on any further steps at this point.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's =
not something -- you're not ruling out the possibility that you would condu=
ct joint strikes?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, we have two priorities.&nbsp; One is to make sure that the United Stat=
es -- Counter-ISIL Coalition is doing everything we can to apply maximum pr=
essure against the threat posed by ISIL.&nbsp; Second, when it comes
 to Russia&#8217;s involvement, they have an opportunity to help provide a =
political solution in Syria.&nbsp; That is a political solution -- it's goi=
ng to be the only resolution to the crisis in Syria as we know it.&nbsp; An=
d in order to get to that political solution there
 needs to be much more stability on the ground.&nbsp; That stability on the=
 ground can only be achieved if the Assad regime abides by the cessation of=
 hostilities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the main levers on t=
he Assad regime is Russia.&nbsp; And so if they want to play a role in incr=
easing pressure against Nusra and against ISIL, that's how to do it.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.=
&nbsp; One last one on the President&#8217;s upcoming trip. Do you know if =
he plans to, or the White House plans to announce any additional assistance=
 to Vietnam with regard to Agent Orange or exploded mines, landmines?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Kathleen=
, I think as you know, the President is very excited for this trip.&nbsp; W=
e leave tomorrow afternoon.&nbsp; We have a whole lot on the agenda.&nbsp; =
We'll be spending three days in Vietnam.&nbsp; This is the first-ever trip =
of its
 kind.&nbsp; As you know, President Clinton visited Vietnam to announce nor=
malization of relations.&nbsp; President Bush went to Vietnam for an intern=
ational forum.&nbsp; But President Obama will be spending three days on the=
 ground to deepen and strengthen our partnership
 with that country.&nbsp; We'll be focusing on expanding economic cooperati=
on, security cooperation.&nbsp; We'll be focused on people-to--people engag=
ement.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As you know, Vietnam has =
a rapidly expanding middle class, and for us, that's important for a couple=
 of different reasons.&nbsp; But at the top of the list is that provides a =
marketplace for U.S. goods and services.&nbsp;
 So the President is going to use this as an opportunity to advance U.S. in=
terests abroad, including our economic interests.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why th=
e President worked so hard to gain agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partners=
hip.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why he is pushing that so hard
 domestically as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I believe we will have=
 a few more announcements along the road over the next week.&nbsp; And thos=
e of you who are joining us, we&#8217;ll keep you updated.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Jeff.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eric,=
 following up on the Russia question, do you or does the White House have a=
ny sense of the motivation behind Russia&#8217;s proposal?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I don&=
#8217;t.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to sit here and speculate on what our co=
unterparts in Russia are saying.&nbsp; I think that you&#8217;ve seen Russi=
a show an eagerness to cooperate with us militarily.&nbsp; This is not some=
thing
 that&#8217;s new.&nbsp; But for us, again, we principally keep in a very s=
pecific lane about de-conflicting our activities within Syria, and we don&#=
8217;t have any new plans to change that.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Again, our view is that i=
f they want to do something about ISIL and Nusra, which is their stated goa=
l, then the best thing they can do is help provide for a stable Iraq -- a s=
table Syria, and make sure that Assad
 abides by the cessation of hostilities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak=
ing of Iraq, is there* a reaction to the violence in the Green Zone today?<=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; We hav=

th the Iraqis regarding the current situation,
 and we are standing by to support them as necessary.&nbsp; Obviously, the =
situation is dynamic and evolving.&nbsp; I was briefed just minutes ago bef=

 them and monitor it closely.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And l=
astly, Donald Trump today said that Prime Minister Cameron had invited him =
for a visit.&nbsp; Number 10 Downing Street said maybe not so fast, althoug=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I don&=
#8217;t.&nbsp; Obviously, the President was just in London with some of you=
.&nbsp; We had a great visit there.&nbsp; The partnership between the Unite=

 We deeply value our relationship. The President had a great visit with Pri=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">If I was feeling looser, =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shows=
 remarkable restraint.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You say that the United Stat=

 in yesterday.&nbsp; Has Egypt requested assistance?&nbsp; Have they accept=

 it?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; So I d=
on&#8217;t have specific conversations to read out to you.&nbsp; Typically =
these are conversations and discussions that happen with my colleagues at t=
he Department of Defense and Department of State, and,
 to the extent appropriate, Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp; So I can=
 tell you that the Navy has already deployed an Orion P-3 aircraft.&nbsp; T=
hat plane is over the Mediterranean right now, assisting in the investigati=

 deployed, we&#8217;ll let you know.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Again,=
 I don&#8217;t want to read out private conversations, but we stand ready t=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Egypt=
 is sending the message that this crash was not their fault because the pla=
ne originated in Paris.&nbsp; The last time -- we had Metrojet -- the focus=
 I think was on Egypt, and they were reluctant to say that
 they had a little bit of culpability in it.&nbsp; Do you buy the Egypt arg=
ument that they&#8217;re not responsible because this plane originated in P=
aris?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I unde=
rstand the inclination to sort of speculate.&nbsp; I think our first priori=
ty is helping the authorities find a plane.&nbsp; And so until that happens=
, it&#8217;s going to be hard for us to reach any definitive
 conclusion on what happened.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m going to reserve judgment.=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just =
a couple other questions.&nbsp; General Dunford has been quoted as predicti=

an you give us some idea of what that mission might look like?<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I can.=
&nbsp; Joe, as you know, this administration is focused on supporting the G=
overnment of National Accord in Tripoli as it strives to restore stability =
and security to Libya and to serve the Libyan
 people.&nbsp; We commend the Prime Minister there and the leadership of th=
e new government for taking steps in the process of restoring a unified gov=
ernance to that country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The United States -- and =
I think this goes to your question -- would welcome a request from the Liby=
an government to strengthen the capabilities of the presidential guard ther=
e, embedded forces supporting and aligned
 with the Government of National Accord.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We will work with members=
 of the international community on such a request.&nbsp; And, as General Du=
nford indicated today, it is possible that NATO could have a supportive rol=
e to help build Libyan capacity to provide
 security and combat ISIL.&nbsp; Clearly, that&#8217;s a goal shared by the=
 Prime Minister there, by the government there, and that&#8217;s something =
we stand ready to assist with.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are w=
e talking about a lead role here?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, =
I think obviously combatting the threat posed by ISIL is something that the=
 United States has led on throughout the world.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve assembled=
 a coalition of countries around the world.&nbsp; And so
 the President has asserted that this is a priority for us.&nbsp; So we&#82=
17;re happy to entertain a request from the Libyan government, but I don&#8=
217;t know if it&#8217;s gotten to that level of detail yet.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And l=
ast question.&nbsp; The President is going to be promoting TPP in Asia.&nbs=
p; When you think about it, Sanders, Clinton, even Trump have also been opp=
osed to TPP.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the calculation over here as far as the
 likelihood of it getting anywhere, given the fact that all three of the pr=
esidential candidates appear to be opposed?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, =
only one of them has a vote in Congress right now.&nbsp; And we continue to=
 work with our partners in Congress and the leadership in both the House an=
d the Senate, and we believe that this is something
 that should pass because it&#8217;s good for American workers.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As I mentioned, Vietnam h=
as a rapidly growing middle class. We want to make sure that American goods=
 and services and American companies can service that middle class with the=
 products made in the U.S. of A.&nbsp; So
 we believe that this is a good deal for America&#8217;s workers.&nbsp; <a =
name=3D"_GoBack"></a>We also believe that it -- well, we know, because it's=
 in the text, that it will reduce tariffs for American exports.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">It's important that Ameri=
can exports are able to get into those markets.&nbsp; And above all else, i=
f we don't set the rules of the road in the economies in this region, China=
 is going to.&nbsp; So we believe that it's in
 American interest for TPP to pass.&nbsp; We believe that there&#8217;s a r=
eason that Trade Promotion Authority passed the House and the Senate with b=
ipartisan support.&nbsp; And we're going to continue to push for that.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll just give you a few mo=
re statistics in case it's helpful.&nbsp; In Vietnam, currently U.S. auto e=
xports face a 70 percent tariff.&nbsp; Construction equipment faces tariffs=
 as high as 59 percent.&nbsp; And auto parts face a 32 percent tariff.&nbsp=
;
 In Japan, currently U.S. beef exports face tariffs of nearly 40 percent, a=
nd leather footwear faces tariffs of up to 189 percent.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we believe this is a dea=
l that represents not only the future of the interconnected global economy =
but also a potential for American goods and services to be sold and purchas=
ed around the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eric, t=
his week, after approving a defense bill that would allow federal contracto=
rs to discriminate against LGBT workers, the House yesterday defeated an am=
endment from Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney that would have voided
 that language.&nbsp; At first it looked as though the amendment would have=
 passed, but then seven House Republicans changed their votes and the amend=
ment failed 213-212.&nbsp; Does the White House think House leadership stro=
ng-armed those seven lawmakers to change their
 votes?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I saw th=
at episode yesterday, Chris, and I read the reports afterwards.&nbsp; As yo=
u know, earlier this week we put out a very detailed Statement of Administr=
ation Policy explaining our objections to this piece of legislation.&nbsp;
 I'm happy to walk you through a few of them now.&nbsp; But the broadest wa=
y to put this is that this bill inserts obstacles in the way of our Defense=
 Department trying to modernize our military forces.&nbsp; We often hear Re=
publican rhetoric, especially on the campaign
 trail, talking about how our military has been eviscerated.&nbsp; And what=
's going to eviscerate them is if the Defense Department doesn&#8217;t have=
 the resources and equipment and capabilities they need to modernize and ma=
ke sure that we have the military needed to
 face down 21st century threats.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill also includes wha=
t we've called a funding gimmick called the Overseas Contingency Operation.=
&nbsp; This is something Secretary Carter himself has called &quot;gambling=
 with war-fighting money&quot; at a time of war.&nbsp; We think that's an
 illegitimate way to fund our government, and does a disservice to our troo=
ps.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, this is a piece of =
legislation that restricts our ability to close the prison at Guantanamo Ba=
y.&nbsp; That is a facility that Democrats and Republicans purportedly shar=
e the goal of closing for a whole host of reasons -- namely,
 it's a recruiting tool for those who wish to do us harm.&nbsp; We've seen =
the prison at Guantanamo Bay repeatedly used in propaganda materials from t=
errorist organizations.&nbsp; We also know the prison at Guantanamo Bay is =
exorbitantly expensive.&nbsp; It costs about $445
 million a year to operate.&nbsp; We can do this -- we can keep our country=
 secure in a much more fiscally responsible way.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the least reason is it'=
s inconsistent with our values.&nbsp; This is something that this President=
 has spoken out on for many years now, and it's also something that, again,=
 Democrats and Republicans have echoed as well.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And as you point out, one=
 of the other objectionable pieces of this legislation is that it would mak=
e it easier to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.&nbsp; That =
has nothing to do with our national defense.&nbsp;
 I can't for the life of me figure out why Republicans would want to insert=
 an ideological rider into a defense bill, let alone one that is mean-spiri=
ted like that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I did see what happened =
on the floor of the House of Representatives yesterday.&nbsp; I know that t=
he measure by Congressman Maloney was on track to pass and then it failed.&=
nbsp; We believe that overriding the President's work to make sure
 that defense contractors don't discriminate based on sexual orientation --=
 trying to override that is misguided and ill-advised.&nbsp; It's also mean=
-spirited.&nbsp; It's also inconsistent with American values of equality an=
d tolerance.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But do =
you believe that House leadership instigated the spectacle that took place =
on the House floor yesterday?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I can't =
speak to the machinations of the House floor yesterday.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheryl.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Eric.&nbsp; On Zika funding, the President was fairly critical just now, o=
r this morning, of both the House and the Senate bill as not being enough.&=
nbsp; I guess do you have a veto threat to give us today?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I came o=
ut here just with a ballpoint pen.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, as we have said, we b=
elieve -- we have issued a veto threat on the House bill.&nbsp; We believe =
that's woefully inadequate. It not only underfunds this urgent priority dra=
matically, but it also, as we say, robs Peter to pay Paul.&nbsp;
 It takes away crucial funding from our fight against Ebola -- a fight and =
an effort that you all remember vividly -- because I do, sitting in that ch=
air, as you all asked questions -- you all asked very legitimate questions =
about what we were doing to combat
 it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we believe we shouldn't =
take our eye off that ball just because a new public health threat is emerg=
ing.&nbsp; We can do both. And there are U.S. government personnel on the g=
round in Africa, still working on that, very earnestly, and
 there is now a new threat that we should be combatting at the same time.&n=
bsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you know, the President =
asked three months ago, now, for $1.9 billion for Congress to allocate that=
.&nbsp; The House has fallen woefully short.&nbsp; The Senate made a little=
 bit more progress.&nbsp; It's not often that we invoke the junior Senator
 from Florida, who recently ran for President, but he put it better than I =
could.&nbsp; He said, admittedly, this is a request that comes from the Pre=
sident, but it's grounded in reality from our public health officials.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we believe that if membe=
rs of Congress want to make decisions on the merits, they should look at th=
e facts and they should look at science.&nbsp; They have a week left before=
 they take another week-long recess.&nbsp; They should get to work
 and fund this request.&nbsp; There's no reason for delay.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear =
you and the White House has sent that message many times before.&nbsp; So w=
ould the President veto $1.1 billion Senate bill as not being enough?<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, Ch=
eryl, obviously that is short of what the President's request is.&nbsp; And=
 the President didn't just pick a number out of the air -- the President se=
nt up a detailed package -- again, not just a press release, not
 just a letter, not just a set of talking points, but a detailed analysis g=
rounded in facts and the latest information from our public health official=
s, laying out this request.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this isn't something th=
at can be subject to partisan bickering, and it shouldn't be something wher=
e Congress just passes the buck.&nbsp; We're talking about the health and p=
ublic safety of pregnant women and children.&nbsp; And Congress
 need to get a bill to the President's desk for a signature as soon as poss=
ible.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You did=
n't answer her question.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Again, t=
he Senate bill is something that falls short of the President's funding req=
uest.&nbsp; They made more progress in the Senate than they did in the Hous=
e.&nbsp; I'll remind you that the Senate bill is bipartisan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would h=
e veto it?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, the Senate bill is more progress -- allocated more funding, doesn't ro=
b Peter to pay Paul, so we're more encouraged by what the Senate did.&nbsp;=
 But there's a long way to go, because clearly the House and the
 Senate are in vastly different places.&nbsp; I would also note that the ju=
nior Senator from Florida felt strongly that the $1.9 billion should be ful=
ly funded, so I'm curious why the House members who represent that great st=
ate, the &quot;Sunshine State,&quot; aren't also
 in sync with their Senate leadership, their Senate colleagues, because it =
seems like if I was a member of Congress from Florida, then I would be doin=
g everything I could to make sure that my constituents are protected from t=
his.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few d=
ifferent subjects, but just staying with Zika funding for the moment.&nbsp;=
 I guess a simple way to ask this question is, why is there no veto threat =
against the Senate measure?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, we=
 should be clear here that the Senate passed a bill that's $1.1 billion.&nb=
sp; That is quite a bit short of the $1.9 billion that our public health pr=
ofessionals tell us we need.&nbsp; So we believe it's a step in the right
 direction.&nbsp; We are encouraged by bipartisan support on that front.&nb=
sp; It's rare in Washington these days we get bipartisan support, so we are=
 encouraged by the steps they took.&nbsp; But we still continue to urge Con=
gress to fund the President's request.&nbsp; We feel
 like anything short of that will be insufficient.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I am happy to walk yo=
u through some of the actions that we could be taking as soon as that money=
 is allocated.&nbsp; For example, without the funding, vaccine development =
is getting delayed, diagnostic testing is
 getting delayed, funding for mosquito control could slow or even halt, and=
 states don't have the funding they need to fight Zika.&nbsp; This is a req=
uest that comes from governors, James, and that is why we want to make sure=
 that those states are getting the resources
 they need to combat this.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll say one more thing -- =
that we know that at some point there's going to be a media -- let's say a =
heightened level of interest in this and what is the federal government doi=
ng to respond.&nbsp; And when that day comes, I want you to
 remember the preceding three months of Congress&#8217;s inaction on this.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, to =
that point, listening to the President this morning, there seemed to be kin=
d of a passivity in the sense that he was saying Congress needs to get some=
thing to my desk.&nbsp; And he was urging members of the public to contact
 their lawmakers to exert that kind of pressure on them for that purpose.&n=
bsp; But I just wonder, where is the President's own outreach on this?&nbsp=
; Why isn&#8217;t he bringing people into the Oval Office for serious confe=
rence sessions with himself?&nbsp; And if it's so urgent,
 why isn&#8217;t he finding $1.9 billion somewhere within his discretionary=
 funds in order to meet this emergency?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I'll tak=
e the last part of your question, first, which is the President was able to=
 retrieve some funds that had been previously allocated to fight Ebola.&nbs=
p; We maxed out on that.&nbsp; We scraped the bottom of the barrel.&nbsp;
 So that money has been reallocated to fight Zika, but we can't take any mo=
re of those funds without endangering our effort to combat Ebola.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the first part of your q=
uestion, I would just point you to this February 22nd proposal that we sent=
 to Congress, outlining our plan.&nbsp; This wasn&#8217;t a haphazard packa=
ge that we put together in a few minutes or a few hours.&nbsp; This was
 a detailed proposal.&nbsp; It includes guidance from the Office of Managem=
ent and Budget.&nbsp; It also includes guidance from our public health offi=
cials at the CDC and NIH, and goes into detail about why we need these fund=
s.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why=
 isn&#8217;t he working Congress in the manner of a Lyndon Johnson?&nbsp; W=
hy isn&#8217;t he getting people in the Oval Office, saying, you're not goi=
ng anywhere until we have this money for what he himself called an emergenc=
y back in February?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I wouldn=
&#8217;t stipulate to those facts.&nbsp; I can tell you that we don&#8217;t=
 always read out every conversation the President has, but I can assure you=
 there is not a member of Congress who is not aware of the request that we =
have
 before them.&nbsp; And I can also tell you that White House officials cont=
inue to remain engaged with members of Congress to get this done.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very qu=
ickly -- the Green Zone issue raised earlier -- should the fact of this vio=
lence in that particular area lead people to conclude the central governmen=
t in Iraq is in very serious trouble?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I'm not =
sure that's the conclusion that we would draw.&nbsp; Our conclusion is that=
 Iraq does need a stable and functional government, and we need that for a =
couple of different reasons.&nbsp; First and foremost is, only with a
 functional government can we have active partners on the ground to pursue =
the fight against ISIL.&nbsp; So our first priority is making sure that Pri=
me Minister Abadi has a functional government.&nbsp; Sometimes that's going=
 to include dissent and peaceful protests.&nbsp;
 But as I talked about, this situation is dynamic and ongoing, so we're goi=
ng to continue to monitor it closely.&nbsp; But we stand ready to provide a=
ny support and assistance we can.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last qu=
estion.&nbsp; In advance of the President's trip to Vietnam -- Mr. Obama wa=
s, if my math is correct, 14 at the time of the United States' final withdr=
awal from Saigon.&nbsp; And I just wonder if you could speak, to the extent=
 possible
 for you, how the Vietnam War and the post-Vietnam period shaped this Presi=
dent's view of America and the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; James, I=
 think that's a very good question, and I think you're going to hear the Pr=
esident talk about that over the next couple of days, so I don&#8217;t want=
 to get ahead of him.&nbsp; I will say the President is very much focused
 on this trip. This is one that has been in the works for a while and it's =
a trip that he wanted to make.&nbsp; He felt very strongly about this.&nbsp=
; And we're spending three days -- we're spending three days on the ground.=
&nbsp; That's a lot for one country, normally,
 on these trips.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The President is not only=
 looking forward to speaking with the leadership in Vietnam and government =
leaders, but he's also going to be speaking with young people.&nbsp; He's g=
oing to have a town hall where he takes questions
 from young people.&nbsp; He's going to meet with business leaders and civi=
c leaders.&nbsp; And he's going to talk about how far we've come since thos=
e days in the decades since the time you mentioned to now, and how far our =
relationship has come.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned, it was Pres=
ident Clinton who decided to begin the normalization process with Vietnam.&=
nbsp; Since then, Presidents of both parties have worked to deepen that rel=
ationship.&nbsp; But the President sees this as a pivotal opportunity
 to expand that partnership, expand collaboration on security and economic =
cooperation.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I want to be clear th=
at he's also going to make a push for human rights.&nbsp; Vietnam has made =
some progress on this front, but they have a long way to go.&nbsp; So I'd e=
xpect the President to speak about that not only
 in his public remarks but also in private when he meets with the leadershi=
p.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in =
your own time around this President, has that been something that you've be=
en able to observe, this idea that he was very much shaped by the post-Viet=
nam experience in some ways?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Again, I=
 don&#8217;t want to get ahead of how the President is going to talk about =
this.&nbsp; I believe he wrote some about this in his book, and so I'd refe=
r you that.&nbsp; But I also think this was a consequential time for the Pr=
esident,
 but it was a consequential time for the United States of America.&nbsp; An=
d this will harken back to a very emotional time for the United States and =
a time where our leaders were tested and tried and challenged.&nbsp; And I =
think the President is going to -- that will
 all be included in the President's reflections over the next few days.&nbs=
p; And I want to make sure you know that Secretary Kerry, who obviously has=
 his own unique story, will be joining us in Vietnam for those three days.&=
nbsp; So we look forward to hearing from him
 as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, Mark.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eric, d=
o you know if the update that President Obama got on the Zika virus, whethe=
r it included discussion of the risks to U.S. athletes planning on going to=
 the Summer Games in Brazil?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Mark, I =
don&#8217;t know if the discussion this morning included that piece.&nbsp; =
I can tell you the President was updated on both where things stand and sor=
t of the status of what we know from our latest public health information,
 but also the latest on our response to this effort.&nbsp; As I mentioned, =
we were able to allocate some funds from the Ebola effort to this, but we'r=
e also being stymied because Congress refuses to act for ways that escape m=
y comprehension.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yes=
terday, the U.S. swimming team announced it was moving its training camp fr=
om Puerto Rico to Atlanta because of the Zika virus.&nbsp; Is that somethin=
g that came up in the briefing?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Again, I=
 don&#8217;t know if the Olympics came up.&nbsp; I understand the interest =
in this, but as we have said, we defer to people's personal decisions made =
with their doctors.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Mark.&nbsp; <o:p></=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does th=
e White House have confidence that the Egyptians can handle this -- taking =
the lead in the recovery effort with the plane and the investigation?<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, Ka=
ren, as we've said, the Egyptians are in the lead on this.&nbsp; We stand r=
eady to support.&nbsp; I know they're working closely with our French count=
erparts.&nbsp; And so we want to make sure that that investigation is as co=
mprehensive
 and as fast as possible.&nbsp; So that's why the President directed his te=
am to make resources available.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t know have updates f=
or you on the sort of status of that investigation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would t=
he White House rather see France take the lead on this?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I haven&=
#8217;t heard that determination made.&nbsp; Obviously, the Egyptian author=
ities right now are in the lead of this investigation, and we want it to pr=
oceed without delay.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two mor=
e.&nbsp; I think you had said yesterday -- Josh had said there hadn&#8217;t=
 been conversations yet with the Presidents of Egypt and France.&nbsp; Is t=
here any update on that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t have any new calls to read out to you, but if that were to happen, we=
'll let you know.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one=
 more quick one.&nbsp; The TSA Administrator said today -- he alluded that =
there could be potential changes coming to the TSA, that there might even b=
e an increase in staff or increase in funding to handle any changes that wo=
uld
 be made in the wake of this plane incident.&nbsp; Is the TSA prepared with=
 staffing and funding?&nbsp; And what did he mean?&nbsp; What would that lo=
ok like?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, it=
 was the TSA Administrator, so you should check in with the TSA.&nbsp; They=
're best prepared to sort of answer the details of their operational decisi=
ons.&nbsp; I can tell you that, last week, Secretary Johnson, our Secretary
 of Homeland Security -- which TSA is a component of -- directed TSA to tak=
e several steps to address the long security lines.&nbsp; And so we are alw=
ays making sure that we're constantly balancing to make sure that people's =
air travel remains unfettered while keeping
 them safe.&nbsp; So you should check in with them on that.&nbsp; <o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, our first priori=
ty is making sure that people are safe.&nbsp; TSA must continue its rigorou=
s security screenings and we're not going to lower our standards for the sa=
ke of convenience.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chip.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I f=
ollow up on Mark's questions?&nbsp; More generally, was there -- I don&#821=
7;t know if you were in the room, but was there discussion in there of peop=
le restricting their travel to certain areas, generally?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Chip, I =
was not in the room.&nbsp; I know the President spoke at the bottom of the =
meeting, so I'm not sure we're going to have any more of an expanded readou=
t on that.&nbsp; Those travel warnings are typically issued by the CDC,
 so if they have any updates on what they're advising the American people, =
you might want to check with them.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But our belief is that fe=
deral, state and local partners should be working together to limit the imp=
act of this virus.&nbsp; But right now they don't have the resources they n=
eed, and that's a real shame.&nbsp; And that's
 why the President is going to continue to make the public case that Congre=
ss should pass this bill.&nbsp; And it's also why White House officials rem=
ain engaged with members of the House of Representatives and the United Sta=
tes Senate so that Congress can get its
 act together and get this bill to the President&#8217;s desk.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked=
 Josh yesterday about Puerto Rico and the bill that just passed, and specif=
ically the minimum wage requirement in the bill that would allow a reductio=
n in the minimum wage in Puerto Rico.&nbsp; To sort of follow up on that,
 why did the White House not fight harder to not have that be a part of the=
 final package?&nbsp; Especially since the White House made such a big deal=
 out of increasing the minimum wage, why not fight harder on that?<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Just wan=
t to take it -- I don't think the bill passed.&nbsp; I think it was just in=
troduced, right?&nbsp; So we actually believe that, given that it hasn&#821=
7;t passed -- I don't even think it's passed committee yet -- we believe th=
ere
 is still time for those provisions to come out and we would strongly urge =
members of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate to do =
just that.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, Josh laid out the sc=
enario yesterday of the 18- or 19-year-old Puerto Rican making minimum wage=
.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t seem to make much sense that, A, they bear the bru=
nt of poor fiscal decisions that were made by people they don't even
 know.&nbsp; And it also doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense that if we're tr=
ying to grow the economy and stabilize the economy in Puerto Rico that they=
 can't even make a livable wage.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we do believe those pr=
ovisions are misguided.&nbsp; We are disappointed the bill includes those u=
nhelpful measures.&nbsp; I will say they&#8217;re better than the original =
proposal, which I believe they&#8217;re now temporary.&nbsp; But
 we ultimately believe they should come out.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does =
this run the risk if this overall package is successful in sort of turning =
around and helping the Puerto Ricans get out of their economic troubles tha=
t people who say that the minimum wage should not be
 raised will have a new piece of evidence, pointing at Puerto Rico saying w=
e reduced the minimum wage there and it worked, and we could do that in the=
 case of the entire nation?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, =
let&#8217;s just separate out those two issues.&nbsp; First, on Puerto Rico=
, we absolutely would have preferred a bill without the minimum wage and th=
e overtime protections that you mentioned, but we do
 believe this is a bill that both Democrats and Republicans can support.&nb=
sp; This is not a bailout.&nbsp; We're encouraged to see the House introduc=
e this legislation that ultimately provides Puerto Rico with the tools they=
 need to address the crisis, harming 3.5 million
 Americans in Puerto Rico.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The administration made c=
lear I believe almost a year ago that any legislation to address the crisis=
 in Puerto Rico must provide a workable and comprehensive restructuring aut=
hority with appropriate oversight that
 respects Puerto Rico&#8217;s self-governance.&nbsp; And we also said at th=
e time that only bipartisan congressional action can end this crisis.&nbsp;=
 So that's why we urged members to stand firm against the special interests=
 attempting to undermine this essential legislation
 and act without delay.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In terms of the issue of =
the minimum wage across this country, clearly the American workers need and=
 deserve a raise.&nbsp; We've talked frequently about how to give American =
workers more money in their pocket, earn
 a livable wage and earn a wage that is commensurate with what they&#8217;r=
e working.&nbsp; The President announced recently new rules to make sure th=
at Americans were paid fairly for the work they were putting in.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But there is probably not=
hing else on the table that would have more of an impact than if Congress w=
ere to raise the minimum wage.&nbsp; This would help middle-class families =
around the country. The President believes
 -- and I think his record for the past seven or eight years affirms -- tha=
t when we grow the economy from the middle class out, everyone wins.&nbsp; =
Raising the minimum wage is not just something that we believe, but I belie=
ve we're up to about 17 or 18 different
 states that have taken action on their own, and we've seen private compani=
es take action on their own.&nbsp; They believe -- those companies -- and y=
ou should check with them -- have said that when they pay their workers a b=
etter wage then that increases productivity
 in their own bottom lines. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we don't really unders=
tand why Congress is so dug in on this, why Congress doesn&#8217;t want to =
lift wages for American workers.&nbsp; So you should ask them what their ra=
tionale is.&nbsp; But we we're going to continue to
 press hard and do everything we can, even while Congress is dug in.&nbsp; =
And that's why I think you&#8217;ve seen a number of states push this with =
our support and a number of private companies.&nbsp; And cities, too, actua=
lly.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On th=
e Nigerian schoolgirls, the Nigerian government just announced that they ha=
ve conducted an operation that rescued several women, including a second on=
e of the Nigerian schoolgirls, in the last week.&nbsp; Was
 the U.S. involved at all in the operation?&nbsp; And do you have any react=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I can =
tell you that we are aware of the reports and we do await official confirma=

 I think what the President was talking about was terrorists who either aim=
 to do us harm or who commit acts of violence or terrorism against us.&nbsp=
; And you're right, the President has a strong
 record that if you commit an act of violence or terrorism against us, we w=
ill stop at nothing to find you.&nbsp; Osama bin Laden is one example, but =
I believe the Defense Department briefed yesterday the latest in our fight =
against ISIL, and I believe the Defense
 Department laid out that over 120 mid-to-high-value leaders of that organi=

I did not see Mr. Zakaria&#8217;s show.&nbsp; I try and catch that when I c=
an, but I must have missed that particular segment.&nbsp; I believe that th=

 the world.&nbsp; That was a priority for him over the past seven, eight ye=
ars.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And look at this trip.&nb=
sp; We&#8217;re going to go to Vietnam.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the first-ever tri=
p of its kind -- where the President is going to spend three days on the gr=
ound, both meeting with the government, the leaders of that
 country, but also with young people, with entrepreneurs, with business lea=
ders in order to deepen the ties between the two countries.&nbsp; And then =
he&#8217;s going to travel to Japan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Both of those countries w=
e have a difficult past with, but if you look at the preceding decades, we&=
#8217;ve built strong relationships.&nbsp; Japan is now one of our closest =
allies in that region.&nbsp; We do a whole lot of business
 with them, both in military cooperation, maritime security, economic coope=
ration.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so the President is a=
bsolutely looking forward to deepening those relationships.&nbsp; Those are=
 the fundamental goals of this trip, alongside advancing U.S. national secu=
rity interests.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faree=
d Zakaria was talking about ISIL and terrorists and why they hate the U.S.,=
 why they hate --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; You&#8=
217;ll have to ask them why they say what they do.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And i=
f I may, quickly, as far as Prime Minister Modi&#8217;s visit to the White =
House is concerned, Indian American community and the Congress both are wai=
ting for an address to the Congress. Anything new from the
 White House as far as the visit is concerned?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; No.&nb=
sp; As you saw, this morning we were pleased to announce that Prime Ministe=
r Modi of India will visit the White House on Tuesday, June 7.&nbsp; This i=
s going to be a visit that highlights the deepening
 of the U.S.-India relationship in key areas since the President&#8217;s vi=
sit to New Delhi in January of 2015.&nbsp; The President looks forward to d=
iscussing progress made on climate change, on our clean energy partnership,=
 on security and defense cooperation, and,
 of course, our economic growth proposals -- priorities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I think we&#8217;ll ha=
ve more to talk about on that visit in the coming weeks.&nbsp; But the Pres=
ident is absolutely looking forward to this visit.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is th=
is a state visit?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; I don&=
#8217;t believe so, no.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">John, do you have a quest=
ion?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back =
on Zika.&nbsp; I want to try this a different way.&nbsp; Given the bipartis=
an support for the Senate bill, would the President sign something -- would=
 he sign the Senate bill or something very similar?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, =
again, we sent up a proposal about three months ago, February 22nd -- so in=
 two days it will be -- maybe that&#8217;s the anniversary for both the 67 =
days, which is the average time that a Supreme
 Court justice should be confirmed and the anniversary of our proposal to f=
und Zika.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- fo=
r numerology.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; It wil=
l be a busy day for journalists trying to mark where we are.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the President sent tha=
t up on February 22nd.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not a proposal that we sort of pu=
t together haphazardly.&nbsp; That was a proposal based on guidance from ou=
r public health officials in terms of making sure the
 government had the resources they need. We didn&#8217;t insert a lot of wi=
ggle room in that proposal.&nbsp; We actually laid out in very detailed way=
s what that money would be used for.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I know that the Senate=
 made a lot more progress than the House did.&nbsp; It&#8217;s unclear how =
those two packages would be reconciled if even that&#8217;s their plan.&nbs=
p; But I think that&#8217;s why you heard the President call on
 Congress to work together, both Democrats and Republicans in the House and=
 the Senate, in order to get this done.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I don&#8217;t know why th=
is became a partisan issue.&nbsp; As, again, the junior Senator from Florid=
a has said, this is an issue of public health.&nbsp; And we believe Senator=
 Rubio&#8217;s House colleagues should follow suit.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And o=
n Hiroshima, it&#8217;s pretty clear there&#8217;s no apology coming.&nbsp;=
 But would the President express something like remorse or something simila=
r?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; John, =
the President is not going to revisit the decision to bomb Hiroshima.&nbsp;=
 What he will do is he will lay a wreath at the Peace Memorial.&nbsp; He&#8=
217;s going to briefly tour the memorial grounds and deliver
 brief remarks reflecting on his impressions there.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll be jo=
ined by Prime Minister Abe.&nbsp; And I do expect him to recognize the huma=
n toll of war, the special responsibility that the United States carries as=
 the only country in the world to use a nuclear
 weapon.&nbsp; And of course, he will reaffirm the United States&#8217; com=
mitment to working towards a world with no nuclear weapons.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Greg.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You s=
ay there&#8217;s no wiggle room -- what the President sent up on February 2=
2nd was a multi-year, no-year appropriation with broad transferability.&nbs=
p; And if you look at the history of how Congress actually approves
 these emergency supplementals, they almost always put a year appropriation=
 on them.&nbsp; So my question to you is, what number does this administrat=
ion need in fiscal year 2016 for Zika funding?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; That num=
ber is $1.9 billion.&nbsp; And let me -- thank you for the opportunity to a=
ddress this.&nbsp; What I meant by wiggle room is that number, the proposal=
 that we developed wasn't done willy-nilly.&nbsp; It was done based on the
 advice and guidance of our public health professionals.&nbsp; And so that =
is the number that they have determined is what is needed to fight this pos=
sible threat.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, s=
o if you need $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2016, are you going to come back =
with another request for an appropriation in 2017?&nbsp; 2018?<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, I =
think first steps first, right?&nbsp; Congress can't even get this done.&nb=
sp; So our belief is -- and I appreciate you going back to look at the hist=
ory here because what the House of Representatives has done is tried
 to find offsets, which we believe is misguided, which is inconsistent with=
 how these requests have been allocated in the past.&nbsp; So we do want Co=
ngress to look at history.&nbsp; They rose to the occasion on Ebola and the=
y actually allocated a sufficient amount of
 money in order for the United States government to do its job to combat th=
is threat.&nbsp; And now we're looking for the same thing on this.<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So $1.9=
 billion or bust?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Our requ=
est has been $1.9 billion, and we hope that's fulfilled with some urgency.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of =
the criticism that Republicans have leveled against that $1.9 billion reque=
st is that there are long-term projects included in it, like new constructi=
on.&nbsp; How is that part of the emergency funding that the President spea=
ks
 to with such urgency?&nbsp; I guess to follow up, the $1.1 billion is not =
a number that Republicans say they came up with haphazardly.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, yo=
u'll have to ask them why -- what they see is the foundation for their numb=
ers.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I =
said, it takes out things that aren't emergency, like new construction.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. SCHULTZ:&nbsp; Well, I =
urge you to take a look at our proposal because what we do is we detail exa=
ctly what these funds would be used.&nbsp; And what I can do for you is lay=
 out exactly what's not happening because Congress hasn't done its
 job.&nbsp; And let me just walk you through a few examples.&nbsp; <o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">By Congress stymying this=
 request, they have delayed the development of vaccines.&nbsp; We're asked =
frequently in this room what the status of that development is.&nbsp; Unfor=
tunately, we are unable to accelerate that because
 of Congress not doing its job. Diagnostics tests to make sure that manufac=
turers can develop faster and more accurate tests are needed to ensure sort=
 of a frontline diagnostics and expand laboratory capacity -- that's not ge=
tting done because Congress isn't
 doing its job.&nbsp; Funding for mosquito control has slowed and even halt=
ed in some areas.&nbsp; We have states and partners on the ground that are =
starting to do mosquito surveillance control activities, but they need fund=
ing. That stuff doesn't pay for itself.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, again, I cannot for=
 the life of me figure out why Congress wants to pass the buck on this inst=
ead of rolling up their sleeves and doing their job.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I will do the=
 week ahead, and then Mark can get started on his weekend.&nbsp; (Laughter.=
)&nbsp; New spokesman, same joke.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know we've already laid o=
ut the schedule so I might have to hunt -- oh, I think I have it.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Go as you know=
, the President will depart Sunday afternoon -- I'm sorry, Saturday afterno=
on, and Monday morning arrive in Hanoi, Vietnam.&nbsp; While in Hanoi, the =
President will participate in a bilateral meeting with President
 Quang.&nbsp; Following this meeting, the President will meet with the Chai=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Later in the afternoon, t=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Tuesday, the President w=

 the President will deliver remarks on U.S.-Vietnam relations, where I thin=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President will then tra=
