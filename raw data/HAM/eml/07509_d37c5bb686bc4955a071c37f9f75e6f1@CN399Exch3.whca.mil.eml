Yes and we are hosing them down from here as well.  Lots of spin (from CNN)=
 re: whether there is any change of strategy or anything like that.

Josh is also addressing this in the gaggle right now.

Hi gang, want us to be assertive on this one? In the past I've said somethi=
ng like:

"We're not going to get into specifics beyond telling you that the Presiden=
t's voice will be particularly powerful in light of the progress we've made=
 over the last seven years. He's an effective messenger to remind voters of=
 how far we've come, of where we were when George W. Bush left office losin=
g 800,000 jobs a month, with too many Americans losing their homes and savi=
ngs."

Hey Luis -- hope you're well. Wanted to touch base again to see what more y=
ou can say on President Obama's role going forward in the presidential race=
 -- even though the nomination process is still ongoing, are there places/a=
reas you guys see him playing a major role? How eager are Democrats to get =
him out on the trail?

Thanks
