Subject: Foreign pool report # 4 state dinner toast .=20

Pool was taken into a beautifully decorated huge tent with Chiffon like m=
aterial ceiling lined up with little lights resembling stars .  It was at=
 the end of the White House garden opposite the Fontaine .=20

Guests were already seated . Spotted , Victoria Nuland , Assistant Secret=
ary for European Affairs in a blue gown . =20

The tables looked stunning with cubed ice and different colored flowers o=
f pink and mauve and light red . Beeswax candles adorned each table . Gue=
sts of 6 sat opposite each other's .  They were also beautiful white long=
er stem bushy flowers on each side of the tent but not on the tables in t=
he middle .

POTUS welcomed the Nordic leaders making jokes bout the Viking and their =
table manners and their outfit . He said that hopes that his guests "will=
 behave better tonight ".He joked about the most popular TV show in Norwa=
y which is about nonstop wild fire burning . He said that the Nordic coun=
tries compete about who the happiest among them . He also mentioned a Dan=
ish philosopher who influenced the civil rights movement in the US .=20

POTUS said that he values the friendship and alliances of the Nordic coun=
tries.

The president invited the Prime Minister of Iceland to speak first , then=
 the Prime Minister of Denmark . Both made jokes about punching above hei=
r weight .=20

The Danish PM talked about heritage and contribution to the US . He remin=
ded the guests that Scarlet Johsnson was of Danish origin but "Norway gav=
e you Carl Rove ." The audiences laughed .=20

The funny lines of the Danish PM promoted POTUS to come back to stage and=
 suggest that he should be the next comedian at the next White House Corr=
espondents dinner .=20

 The Prime Minister of Denmark called Obama " the best President you have=
 ever had ",  addressing the US citizens I guess  . He also made a joke a=
bout Donald but it turned out it was about Donald Tusk  the President of =
the EU  Commission . He gave POTUS an advice " take up cooking " once he =
leaves the White House .=20
