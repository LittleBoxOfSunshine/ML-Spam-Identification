Indicted Democratic Rep. Chaka Fattah lost a four-way primary to state Rep. Dwight Evans Tuesday, making Fattah the first House member of 2016 to lose his seat.

Evans had 43 percent of the vote to 36 percent for Fattah, with 88 percent of precincts reporting, when the Associated Press called the race. Two other candidates split the remainder of the vote. (See results here.)

Fattah was indicted on federal corruption charges last year, and his trial is set to begin in May. Evans heavily outspent Fattah in the deep-blue, majority-minority Philadelphia seat, and Evans also won endorsements from Gov. Tom Wolf and Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney. The primary win practically assures Evans of a seat in Congress.
