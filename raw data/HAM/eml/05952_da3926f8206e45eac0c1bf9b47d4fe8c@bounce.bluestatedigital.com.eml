Luis --

I was elected to Congress in 1972. Now, in 2016, I marvel at how far=20

I know I don't have to tell you, Luis. The progress we've made in=20
women's rights, civil rights, and environmental safety has been=20
monumental. But we've got so much more work to do because the=20
fact is, there are folks in this country who want to turn back all the=20
progress we've made that's made our country more just, fair, and=20
prosperous.

Luis, we can't let that happen. We've come too far and made a=20
difference in too many people's lives to go back now. We've got to=20
keep going forward.

Today, I'm asking you to join the fight to move forward. Pitch in $3=20

Democrats who share our values:
