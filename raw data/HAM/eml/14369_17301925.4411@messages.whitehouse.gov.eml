Subject: Out of Town Pool Report #2 --White House Background on USO/Joini=
ng Forces Event

Colleagues

Here is some  background from WH official on the USO/Joining Forces Event=


Tonight's USO-Joining Forces comedy show is part of the 5th Anniversary o=
f the First Lady and Dr. Biden's Joining Forces initiative. Joining Force=
s was launched in 2011 to support our servicemembers, veterans, and their=
 families through concrete opportunities in employment, education, and we=
llness. The First Lady and Dr. Biden kicked off the anniversary on Monday=
 with an appearance on The Voice. On Tuesday, they visited Fort Leonard W=
ood, one of the largest Army training facilities and bases in the country=
. At the base, they met with the Army's newest recruits and observed a po=
rtion of basic training. They were also joined for story time with milita=
ry kids by astronaut Mark Kelly and Reading Rainbow host LeVar Burton. Th=
at evening, Mrs. Obama made a guest appearance on an episode of NCIS. Ear=
lier today, the First Lady and Dr. Biden were joined by Amazon CEO Jeff B=
ezos to announce the latest employment numbers coming out of Joining Forc=
es. In the last 5 years, through Joining Forces efforts, companies have h=
ired or trained over 1.2 million veterans and military spouses. On Sunday=
, the First Lady will join Prince Harry to kick off the Invictus Games in=
 Orlando. Later in the week, Dr. Biden will close the games.
