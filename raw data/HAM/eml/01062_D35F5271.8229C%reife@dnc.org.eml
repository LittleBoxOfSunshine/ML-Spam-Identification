Hi all =97 A few emails from the President to send later this week. Let me =
know if you have any flags, and thanks!

=97v1(EJB)--
Sender: Barack Obama
Subject:

Election Day is now less than six months away, NAME.

Republicans have their presumptive nominee and are going to have to start a=
sking themselves some hard questions. Whether this nominee really speaks fo=
r them and represents their values. Whether this nominee is really someone =
who can lead a country that is only growing more diverse.

Let me be clear =97 we live in serious times and this is a serious job. Ove=
r the next few months, it is imperative that we remember =97 and remind our=
 friends and neighbors =97 that this is not entertainment, this is not a re=
ality show. This is a contest for President of the United States and all of=
 the responsibilities of that office.

That=92s why I=92m going to do everything I can between today and November =
8th to make sure a Democrat succeeds me in office. Too much is at stake not=
 to take this race as seriously as we ever have, and I hope you=92re as com=
mitted as I am to making sure we win this:

LINK

We can=92t do this without you, NAME. I really mean that. Thank you for sta=
nding with us.

Barack Obama


=97v2(RAE)=97

Sender: Barack Obama
Subject:

Friend =96

One of the things I=92ll be proudest of when I leave this office is that we=
 didn=92t limit ourselves to addressing only the problems that affect us pe=
rsonally. Whether it was ensuring that young people could graduate from col=
lege without the burden of debt, to protecting health care for those with s=
erious medical conditions, to setting the wheels in motion to protect our p=
lanet for generations to come, we rallied together not just for ourselves b=
ut for our fellow Americans. And we know that that our country is stronger =
because of it.

So at this particular time in this election, I look to folks like you, NAME=
, and want to say two things: Thank you for everything you=92ve done so far=
, and let=92s do everything we can to ensure that our next president will c=
ontinue to fight for every American:

LINK

Thank you, NAME.

Barack Obama


--v3(SK)--
Sender: Barack Obama
Subject:

Friend --

For the past four decades, Democratic leadership in the White Hosue has mad=
e our country great by strengthening our economy, producing jobs, and reduc=
ing our deficit. Meanwhile, Republican administrations have been marked by =
lowering taxes for the wealthiest among us and cutting vital government pro=
grams and services that hardworking American families rely on. That's just =
history.

So, yes -- the Republicans now have a presumptive nominee. But the truth is=
, there really is nothing new about what the Republican Party believes. The=
y still deny that climate change is real. They still want to take away a wo=
man's right to choose. And they still seek to repeal Obamacare and reverse =
all of the progress we've made together.

So really, NAME, our decision in this election is pretty easy: We can do ev=
erything we can to make sure our next president is a Democrat who will keep=
 our country moving forward -- or, we can let the Republicans put someone i=
n office who won't.

You can count on me to do whatever I can to help elect Democrats up and dow=
n the ballot in November, NAME. Add your name if I can count on you to do t=
he same:

LINK

Thanks for your help, NAME.

Barack Obama
