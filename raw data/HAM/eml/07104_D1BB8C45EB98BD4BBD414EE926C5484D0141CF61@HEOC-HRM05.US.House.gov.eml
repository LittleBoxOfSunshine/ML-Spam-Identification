Subject: Hello--Questions from Univision on Bernie Sanders' effect on the D=
emocratic party and the divisions within it
Importance: High

Hello Geoff,

My name is Juliana Jim?nez, I'm a reporter for Univision News, I called you=
r office earlier and spoke with Sam, who gave me your email. I'm working on=
 a story about the effect Bernie Sanders is having on the Democratic Party,=
 and in what ways he is dividing it--and in turn the effect that could have=
 on Hillary Clinton's chances at the general election. I'd love to know a b=
it about the Democratic party's sense of the current landscape, their conce=
rns with Sanders' voters, the democratic base's alienation, among other thi=
ngs.

My number is 305-487-5513, or 352-792-2410. I would love to ask you a few s=
hort questions whenever you have a chance as soon as possible, my deadline =
is ASAP.

Thank you so much,
Juliana
