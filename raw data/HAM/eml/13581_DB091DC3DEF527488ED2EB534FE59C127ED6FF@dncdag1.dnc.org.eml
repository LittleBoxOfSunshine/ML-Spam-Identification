Donald Trump=92s Foes Fear Indiana Primary Could Be Decisive Blow

By ALEXANDER BURNS<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/peop=
le/b/alexander_burns/index.html>

NEW YORK TIMES

MAY 2, 2016

The coalition of Republicans opposed to Donald J. Trump<http://www.nytimes.=
com/interactive/2016/us/elections/donald-trump-on-the-issues.html?inline=3D=
nyt-per>=92s candidacy braced Monday for a debilitating setback as he appea=
red poised for a victory in Indiana that would put him on track to seal the=
 Republican nomination by the time primary voting ends next month.

The Indiana vote has emerged as a decisive and perhaps final test for Senat=
or Ted Cruz<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/ted-cruz-o=
n-the-issues.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>, who has abandoned hope of overtaking M=
r. Trump in the race but still aims to throw the Republican nominating figh=
t to a contested convention in July. Mr. Cruz, of Texas, has pleaded with I=
ndiana voters in recent days not to anoint Mr. Trump as the party=92s stand=
ard-bearer, and has devised a series of long-shot tactics to derail him in =
the state.



On Monday, that mission of persuasion took on a vividly literal form for Mr=
. Cruz during a campaign stop in Marion, Ind. Confronted there by <http://w=
ww.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/02/ted-cruz-confronts-donald-tr=
ump-supporters-in-indiana/> determined hecklers<http://www.nytimes.com/poli=
tics/first-draft/2016/05/02/ted-cruz-confronts-donald-trump-supporters-in-i=
ndiana/> bearing Trump campaign signs, Mr. Cruz insisted to one that he was=
 making a mistake.



=93Donald Trump is deceiving you,=94 he said. =93He is playing you for a ch=
ump.=94



Polls now show that Mr. Trump has a clear advantage in Indiana, where 57 de=
legates are at stake. A survey conducted by Marist College for NBC News and=
 The Wall Street Journal found Mr. Trump leading Mr. Cruz by 15 points ther=
e, and close to capturing an outright majority of the vote. Gov. John Kasic=
h<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/john-kasich-on-the-i=
ssues.html?inline=3Dnyt-per> of Ohio was in a distant third place.



Mr. Cruz has signaled that he intends to forge ahead irrespective of the ou=
tcome in Indiana in a bid to block Mr. Trump from winning the 1,237 delegat=
es required to claim the nomination. He spent part of the weekend campaigni=
ng in California, which is among the last states to vote, on June 7, and co=
llected the endorsement of former Gov. Pete Wilson, who warned that Mr. Tru=
mp would doom the party as its nominee.


But Mr. Wilson conceded in an interview on Monday that a defeat in Indiana =
would imperil Mr. Cruz=92s path forward. To win California, Mr. Wilson said=
, =93the first thing he needs to do is win in Indiana.=94



Without such a victory, Mr. Wilson said, =93I think it=92s much more diffic=
ult. The nearer that Trump gets to having the magic number, the more diffic=
ult it is.=94

Republican strategists opposed to Mr. Trump acknowledge that losing Indiana=
 could break the back of the organized resistance to his candidacy and rele=
gate Mr. Cruz to the role of a symbolic dissenter on the right. Mr.



Trump has said that a victory in Indiana on Tuesday would effectively resol=
ve the race in his favor.



At a concert hall in Carmel, near Indianapolis, on Monday, Mr. Trump again =
said that winning the state would end the Republican race, and interspersed=
 his mockery of Mr. Cruz with harsh attacks on Hillary Clinton. =93I=92m go=
ing to start focusing on Hillary,=94 he said. =93That=92s going to be so ea=
sy. It=92s going to be so great.=94



Paul Manafort, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, said the Indiana vote would c=
onfirm Mr. Trump=92s status as =93the inevitable and presumptive nominee.=
=94 After Tuesday, Mr. Manafort said, the Trump campaign will increasingly =
turn its attention to preparing for the July convention in Cleveland and la=
ying the organizational groundwork for the general election.



Mr. Manafort said it was past time for Mr. Trump=92s rivals to bow to reali=
ty. =93Cruz and Kasich should be doing what, historically, all losing candi=
dates do,=94 he said. =93Drop out.=94



On the Democratic side, polls suggest that Mrs. Clinton is in a close fight=
 for Indiana with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Sanders=92s populi=
st message has broken through in several other states in the industrial hea=
rtland, including neighboring Michigan, and he could score an upset that wo=
uld reinvigorate his demoralized supporters.



Campaigning Monday in Evansville, Ind., Mr. Sanders said he needed to recor=
d some big wins to become the nominee. Addressing a riled-up crowd, Mr. San=
ders took aim at =93the billionaire class,=94 prompting a supporter to cry =
out that the superrich should get lost, in earthier language.


Laughing, Mr. Sanders replied that he was =93constrained=94 from using such=
 language. =93I can=92t quite phrase it like that, but that=92s not bad,=94=
 he said. =93You get to the point very succinctly. I like it.=94



If some voters remain passionately supportive of Mr. Sanders, the delegate =
math, however, is firmly against him. Mrs. Clinton has more than 90 percent=
 of the 2,383 delegates needed for the nomination, including unpledged supe=
rdelegates who can change their affiliation. She has nearly 300 more pledge=
d delegates than Mr. Sanders.

Still, Mrs. Clinton faces some tricky political terrain. After Indiana, the=
 race moves to several states seen as friendly to Mr. Sanders, including We=
st Virginia and Oregon.



Protesters greeted Mrs. Clinton in West Virginia on Monday and criticized h=
er for a recent statement seeming to cheer the decline of the coal industry=
. Mrs. Clinton told a crowd there that she regretted her remark, but that i=
t had been misinterpreted and had most likely harmed her in the coal-rich s=
tate.



=93Because of the misstatement that I made, which I apologized for when I s=
aw how it was being used,=94 she said, =93I know that my chances are pretty=
 difficult, to be honest.=94



For Republicans trying to stop Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton=92s command of the D=
emocratic race has further raised the stakes. Mr. Trump trails Mrs. Clinton=
 in general election polls, and party leaders fear that his unpopularity wo=
uld drag down their candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives.



But as Mr. Trump has gained strength in the nominating fight, winning prima=
ries by widening margins, some Republicans have grown apprehensive about mo=
unting an all-out war against him, given the growing likelihood that he wil=
l be nominated.



Mr. Trump=92s adversaries have pursued a range of unlikely strategies again=
st him as the odds of defeating him have faded almost to the point of evapo=
ration. The forces arrayed against Mr. Trump staked their hopes first on Wi=
sconsin, where Mr. Cruz soundly defeated him<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04=
/06/us/politics/republican-primary-results.html>, and then on Indiana, anot=
her Midwestern state where Mr. Trump was seen as vulnerable.



Mr. Cruz, a hard-line conservative who has struggled to rally the Republica=
n establishment to his side, has seemed to deploy every available tactic to=
 block Mr. Trump in the state, including forming a brief alliance with Mr. =
Kasich and naming Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive, as h=
is running mate.



Groups opposed to Mr. Trump have spent $2 million on television ads attacki=
ng him in Indiana, and on Friday, Mr. Cruz collected an endorsement from Go=
v. Mike Pence, a Republican who is popular among conservative voters there.



If the anti-Trump effort in Indiana falls short, said Robert Blizzard, a Re=
publican pollster, =93it will be increasingly difficult for either Senator =
Cruz or Governor Kasich to make an argument in upcoming primary contests th=
ey can stop Trump.=94



Mr. Blizzard, who worked for a =93super PAC<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/r=
eference/timestopics/subjects/c/campaign_finance/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-cl=
assifier>=94 supporting Jeb Bush=92s campaign, said an Indiana defeat for t=
he anti-Trump forces would prompt Republicans to turn their attention to sh=
oring up the rest of the party for a fall campaign.



=93There=92s no doubt we=92re going to face an uphill general election cont=
est with Trump at the top of the ticket,=94 he said, =93and it=92s time to =
figure out how our candidates, from U.S. Senate to Congress to state legisl=
ature, compete on that battlefield.=94

ders took aim at =93the billionaire class,=94 prompting a supporter to cry =
out that the superrich should get lost,
 in earthier language.</p>

<font style=3D"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">If some voters remain passionatel=

him. Mrs. Clinton has more than 90 percent of the 2,383 delegates needed fo=

 superdelegates who can change their affiliation. She has nearly 300 more p=

Protesters greeted Mrs. Clinton in West Virginia on Monday and criticized h=

. Mrs. Clinton told a crowd there that she regretted her remark, but that i=

 most likely harmed her in the coal-rich state.</p>

For Republicans trying to stop Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton=92s command of the D=
emocratic race has further raised the stakes. Mr. Trump trails Mrs. Clinton=
 in general election polls, and party leaders fear that his unpopularity wo=

 the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>

Mr. Trump=92s adversaries have pursued a range of unlikely strategies again=
st him as the odds of defeating him have faded almost to the point of evapo=

sconsin, where
