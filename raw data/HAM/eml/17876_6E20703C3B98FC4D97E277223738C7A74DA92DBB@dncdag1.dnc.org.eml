We're fortunate to be living in the most peaceful era in human history, President Obama said in Germany on Monday before announcing that he was sending 250 more American special operations forces troops to Syria<http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/syria/>.

"I want to begin with an observation that, given the challenges that we face in the world and the headlines we see every day, may seem improbable, but it's true," Mr. Obama said<https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/25/remarks-president-obama-address-people-europe> in Hanover on the final day of his tour of Europe and the Middle East.

High school seniors on their way to college were feted by U.S. first ladyMichelle Obama<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/michelle-obama.htm> and a host of celebrities on Tuesday as she encouraged them to make the most of their college experiences, get involved in campus life and ask for help when they need it. "We are so proud of everything you've achieved, and we don't take the struggle for granted," Obama told a roaring crowd of young people in attendance at an event in Harlem.

Obama was marking her third and last College Signing Day, part of the Reach Higher initiative she started to encourage young people to extend their educations past high school. The events were in Detroit and San Antonio the first two years.



John F. Kerry and the Vietnam War continue to be intertwined<https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/john-f-kerry-and-the-vietnam-war-continue-to-be-intertwined/2016/04/26/cedadee2-0890-11e6-a12f-ea5aed7958dc_story.html>

WASHINGTON POST // CAROL MORELLO

Secretary of State John F. Kerry's career has long been intertwined with Vietnam, and the devastating, divisive war he fought in and against. After a tour in Vietnam as a young Navy officer, Kerry burst onto the public stage as an antiwar protester in the 1970s. As a senator, he helped create conditions for the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations in the 1990s. Next month, he will accompany President Obama to Hanoi, no longer Washington's foe but an important strategic and economic partner. Kerry's past and present will merge once again Wednesday at a Vietnam symposium at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin. He will preview the Obama trip, and chat onstage with filmmaker Ken Burns about Burns's upcoming documentary on the Vietnam War.

House Democrats question if Valeant is withholding records<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-house-valeant-idUSKCN0XN28Z>

REUTERS // SARAH LYNCH

Democrats on a powerful U.S. congressional panel are questioning whether Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals may be wrongfully withholding documents in connection with its ongoing probe into sky-rocketing drug prices, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday. The memo, which was sent to Democratic members of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform from the staff of its top Democrat Elijah Cummings, reveals that Valeant previously withheld readily available analyst reports prepared by banks such as Goldman Sachs, saying they were protected by attorney-client privilege. The memo says it also raises questions about other documents that are still being withheld, saying some of these "were not drafted by attorneys and do not include communications with attorneys."



Senate Nears Deal for at Least $1.1 Billion to Fight Zika Virus<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/us/politics/zika-virus-senate-emergency-funding.html>

NEW YORK TIMES // DAVID HENDERSON

Senate negotiators on Tuesday moved closer to an agreement to provide at least $1.1 billion in emergency financing to combat the rapidly spreading Zika virus, which public health officials warn poses an imminent threat in the United States, but House Republicans said they were still not ready to approve additional funds. The White House bluntly warned that Republicans were not acting quickly enough and that the needed money might not arrive before mosquitoes carrying the disease, which causes birth defects, reach the United States. "This is an emergency," said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. "The American people are counting on Congress to act. And instead, we've gotten bureaucratic excuses."

WALL STREET JOURNAL // SOIBHAN HUGHES

Senate Republicans said Tuesday they were close to an agreement with Democrats on new funding to combat the Zika virus, but conservative House Republicans remained skeptical about the need for an emergency appropriation. Proponents of the funding say the onset of warmer weather is creating an urgent need for the funding, which would be used to control mosquito populations, develop vaccines and increase laboratory capacity for research into the virus, which has been linked to birth defects. Budget Director Shaun Donovan said earlier this month that the U.S. shouldn't take the risk of having the outbreak spread and get out of control before Congress acts.

THE HUFFINGTON POST // LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ

As lawmakers prepare to leave for a weeklong recess, Democrats are calling for a vote on emergency funding to combat the spreading Zika virus. Republicans indicated last week they planned to work with Democrats, after weeks of ignoring the administration's request to direct emergency money toward the epidemic. The virus, according to the World Health Organization, causes microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. There have been 388 travel-related Zika cases reported in the U.S. since the start of 2015. On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) urged Republicans to move now, ahead of the brief recess that begins for both chambers on Friday. "There's been talk about some kind of arrangement, but there is no deal," Reid said, adding that the amount Republicans are eyeing (over $1 billion) isn't enough.



Senate Democrats Expand Scope of #DoYourJob Barbs<https://morningconsult.com/2016/04/senate-democrats-criticize-republican-inaction/>

MORNING CONSULT // WILL DOBBS-ALLSOPP

It started as the mantra Senate Democrats used to urge their GOP colleagues to grant Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a hearing and floor vote: "Do your job." For weeks, every Democratic tweet urging Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to take up Garland's nomination ended with #DoYourJob. At press conferences and in video releases, Senate Democrats brought forward doctors, nurses, and municipal employees to explain what would happen if they refused to do their jobs. Their point, though a tad heavy-handed, was clear: Republican senators are skipping out on work. But with little prospect of a Garland hearing and a number of other pressing issues dominating the news cycle, the #DoYourJob campaign has evolved. Once a movement with the sole purpose of getting Garland a confirmation hearing and vote, the tagline has become a bicameral effort to paint congressional Republicans as generally obstructionist on a host of items.

THE HILL // MIKE LILLIS

Democratic voters in Maryland head to the polls on Tuesday to decide the fate of two of the party's most promising stars. Reps. Chris Van Hollen and Donna Edwards are vying to replace outgoing Sen. Barbara Mikulski in the Free State, and the stakes are enormous. One lawmaker will see a fruitful congressional career come to a screeching halt with a primary loss and be left to face an uncertain political future. The other will be a big favorite to win a November promotion and become a fixture in the upper chamber, where Maryland hasn't been represented by a Republican in three decades.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that Bernie Sanders can't win the Democratic nomination, but he won't call on the Vermont senator to quit the race. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, the Nevada senator was asked if he thought Sanders had a path to the presidential nomination. "No, I don't," Reid replied. Reid said he was comfortable with Sanders' vow to take the campaign to the convention in July, saying he "should do what he has to do."

Addiction Recovery Groups Warn House Republicans Are Prolonging Opioid Crisis<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/addiction-recovery-groups-house-republicans-opioid-crisis_us_571fce6ee4b0b49df6a97419>

HUFFINGTON POST // RYAN GRIM

Addiction recovery groups are opening up a full-throated campaign against legislation that House Republicans will propose as the chamber's response to the opioid epidemic. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have been promising swift action following the March passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in the Senate by a vote of 94-1. On Wednesday, House Republicans will introduce the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, an advance copy of which was obtained by The Huffington Post. If the House had been hoping its parallel effort would win the support of the drug policy and addiction community, though, a barrage of letters has been unleashed to set them straight.



House set to limit paid time off for federal employees under investigation<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/04/26/house-set-to-limit-paid-time-off-for-federal-employees-under-investigation/>

WASHINGTON POST// ERIC YODER

Federal agencies could no longer put employees on indefinite paid leave while investigating them for misconduct or poor performance under a bill set for a House floor vote as soon as Tuesday. The measure is one of many seeking to limit "administrative leave" following investigations finding that agencies had used that form of leave routinely to keep employees off the job, although with full pay and benefits, for months - and in some cases a year or more. The bill would limit such leave to 14 days; if an investigation were not finished by then, the employee generally would have to return to work. If the agency decided that the employee would pose certain risks, even if assigned to different duties or to telecommuting, the leave could be extended for additional 30-day periods, with reports to Congress required each time.



Fed Up With the Senate<http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-04-26/senate-republicans-are-blocking-appointments-at-the-federal-reserve-too>

US NEWS AND WORLD REPORTS // DJUAN WASH

Right now, there are key vacancies at a vital government institution. President Barack Obama has fulfilled his duty and put forward eminently qualified nominees to fill the vacancies. Yet despite the nominees' strong credentials, Republicans in the Senate have dragged their feet, and the chair of the committee whose job it is to consider the nominees has refused to even schedule hearings. No, this isn't the high-profile battle to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. While the fight over Scalia's replacement may be stealing headlines, Republican obstructionism is actually preventing another important government body from functioning as it should: the Federal Reserve. Two vacant spots on the seven-person Federal Reserve Board of Governors have sat unfilled since 2014. Obama nominated former community banking CEO Allan Landon to be a Federal Reserve governor in January 2015, yet Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby has let Landon's appointment languish for over a year.



Zika Fight Starts to Bite Republicans Ahead of Mosquito Season<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-04-26/zika-fight-starts-to-bite-republicans-ahead-of-mosquito-season>

BLOOMBERG POLITICS // STEVEN DENNIS

Senate Republican leaders entered this week hoping to act quickly to fight the Zika virus, but ran into internal feuding and now face the prospect of political fallout in election battleground states like Florida. Talks with Democrats on an emergency spending package stalled and lawmakers now anticipate doing nothing before they leave on a one-week recess at the end of the week. Republican leaders say they will bring a bill to the Senate floor at some point as they continue to negotiate on the details, but it remains unclear when and how such a measure would advance. Republicans had been slow to address an Obama administration request in February for $1.9 billion to prevent a Zika outbreak, but evidence that the virus is spreading faster than originally feared has injected new urgency into the debate.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that the upper chamber will wait for the House to pass legislation on Puerto Rico's growing debt crisis as lawmakers struggle to reach a deal. "We're going to let the House go first on Puerto Rico. We know it needs to be dealt with, and we're in discussions with them about what ought to be done," he told reporters. His comments came after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters earlier Tuesday that he doesn't think Congress will be able to pass legislation before a crucial deadline. The island territory is at risk of defaulting on a $422 million payment due May 1. Lawmakers are scheduled to leave town at the end of the week and won't return until May 9.

Hillary Clinton all but secured the Democratic nomination Tuesday after a long and bruising primary fight against rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, scoring decisive victories in four of five East Coast states to cast ballots.

In the last big day of multiple contests before Democrats conclude their primary voting in June, Clinton won Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Delaware, and Sanders won in tiny Rhode Island, the only state where independents could vote in the Democratic contest. Overall, Sanders picked up a fraction of the delegates awarded to Clinton.



Pulling Away From Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton Is Turning to the Fall<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/us/politics/democratic-race-sanders-clinton.html>

NEW YORK TIMES // AMY CHOZICK

After months of trying to sideline an unexpectedly deft and well-financed liberal opponent, Hillary Clinton on Tuesday won a series of primaries that freed her to present herself as the de facto victor of the Democratic nomination fight and gave her the impetus to shift focus decisively toward the November election. Now all but certain to clinch the Democratic nomination, Mrs. Clinton will continue to face Mr. Sanders's criticism, but is expected to move swiftly to claim an early advantage against the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump. Her advisers and allies say she will spend the coming weeks honing her message for the general election, and ramping up fund-raising efforts that have lagged in the face of Mr. Sanders's challenge. "With your help, we're going to come back to Philadelphia for the Democratic National Committee, with the most votes and the most pledged delegates," Mrs. Clinton told a crowd of 1,300 here after she took the stage to "Eye of the Tiger." "And we will unify our party to win this election and build an America where we can all rise together."



Hillary Clinton projected to win Democratic primaries in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware<http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-mid-atlantic-democratic-primaries-20160426-story.html>

LOS ANGELES TIMES // EVAN HALPER

Hillary Clinton was projected to win primaries in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware, three of the five states voting Tuesday, as the Democratic front-runner seeks to build an insurmountable lead over rival Bernie Sanders. Clinton is expected to expand her lead of 275 pledged delegates when ballots are counted in the five Eastern states at stake. Sanders was the winner in Rhode Island, according to the Associated Press. Results were still pending in Connecticut. But the delegate haul from Pennsylvania and Maryland, the two largest states voting, could make it close to impossible for Sanders to catch up, even with voting on June 7 in the biggest prize of the campaign, California. Polls show he faces an uphill race there as well.

WALL STREET JOURNAL // PETER NICHOLAS

Hillary Clinton swept to primary victories over rival Sen. Bernie Sanders in Pennsylvania and Maryland Tuesday night, winning the two largest prizes of the evening and also capturing Delaware in a showing that makes her the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee. Mrs. Clinton's chief task now shifts from winning more states to unifying a fractured party and persuading Sanders supporters to coalesce behind her. A likely first step is turning down the rhetorical temperature, giving Mr. Sanders's supporters space to move in her direction. Meanwhile, Mr. Sanders pulled off a win in Rhode Island, and results in Connecticut were still being tallied into the evening, with preliminary results there suggesting a close race.

THE GUARDIAN // DAVID SMITH

Hillary Clinton appears to be within touching distance of the Democratic nomination after three victories in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware set her up for a dominant night in Tuesday's primary elections. Maryland, called by the Associated Press moments after polls closed at 8pm eastern time, was the first of a convincing night. And 38 minutes later, Delaware followed - Clinton's margin there was a comprehensive 59%-39%. Pennsylvania was also called for Clinton at 9.01pm - with one third of the votes counted, she was 57%-42% ahead of Bernie Sanders. In Connecticut, with 48% of the votes in, Sanders led by 49% to 48%.



An Obama-friendly electorate delivers a big win for Hillary Clinton in Maryland<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/26/exit-polls-in-maryland-show-an-obama-friendly-and-clinton-friendly-electorate/>

WASHINGTON POST // EMILY GUSKIN

More than six in 10 Maryland Democratic voters on Tuesday said they wanted the next president to continue President Obama's policies, according to preliminary exit polling. That's far more than the 54 percent average across contests so far this year. Meanwhile, just 23 percent said they preferred more liberal policies -- less than the 30 percent average so far. The numbers suggest a friendly electorate for Hillary Clinton, whose campaign has stressed that she will fight to maintain Obama's policies - whereas Sanders has pressed a more liberal agenda and criticized Obama at times for not pushing things far enough to the left.

THE GUARDIAN // LUCIA GRAVES

Bernie Sanders said something he wasn't supposed to say: that poor people don't vote. Although it's true that voter turnout is inversely correlated with income, all anyone wanted to comment on was that Sanders looked defensive and deflated on Meet the Press, where he made the statement on Sunday. Lost was the fact that this is a truth we should be struck by, ashamed of even, and should do more about. The impolitic remark came in response to a question about why the candidate had been losing so much in the places he should have been winning (he's lost 16 of the 17 states with the highest levels of income inequality). The most straightforward thing for him to say would be to acknowledge that he hasn't performed well with minority voters who tend to be less affluent. But he didn't want to say that on television. Instead, he decided to talk about something else that's actually more important than where he, personally, is up or down. He said: "Poor people don't vote. I mean, that's just a fact. That's a sad reality of American society". He also noted that "80% of poor people did not vote" in the 2014 election.

POLITICO // KYLE CHENEY AND KATIE GLUECK
Donald Trump has earned more than 9 million votes in the Republican primary and amassed a lead that puts him on the brink of clinching the GOP nomination. But in the shadow contest for the delegates to a contested national convention, he's getting obliterated by Ted Cruz. It's halftime in the hustle for loyal convention delegates. By the weekend, more than 1,300 will have been elected in county, state or congressional district elections or selected by local Republican leaders. So far, Cruz has consistently dominated these contests, securing slots for hundreds of loyalists to the convention in Cleveland in July. Trump, on the other hand, has consistently flopped.

WASHINGTON POST // PHILIP RUCKER AND JOSE A. DELREAL

Donald Trump rolled to crushing victories Tuesday in primaries across the Eastern Seaboard, substantially expanding the divisive mogul's delegate lead and narrowing the chances for his opponents to stop his march to the Republican presidential nomination. Trump was projected to win all five of the states holding contests - Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island - by decisive, double-digit margins.

Tuesday's rout was an embarrassing and potentially debilitating blow for Trump's nearest rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Cruz finished a distant third in at least three of the states, behind Ohio Gov. John Kasich as well as Trump.

Donald Trump swept primaries in five Northeastern states on Tuesday, moving closer to winning the Republican presidential nomination as he easily defeated rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich. Trump scored victories in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware, U.S. television networks projected. His margin of victory in each state appeared to be even larger than in his home state of New York a week ago, a major show of strength that sets the stage for a potentially pivotal battle next week in Indiana. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, already in control of the Democratic race, defeated challenger Bernie Sanders in Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania. But in a surprise, Sanders was projected to have won Rhode Island. Connecticut's Democratic vote was too close to call.

Presidential campaigns are about media, math and momentum. But in the wake of Donald Trump's five-state sweep in the Northeast yesterday, it's time to add another measure. And that is psychology. Which may be his biggest advantage. By adding Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island to his New York landslide, Trump is clearly riding a wave of momentum and positive media coverage.

MSNBC // HANNAH HARTIG

Donald Trump has reached 50 percent support from Republicans and Republican-leaners nationally for the first time since the beginning of the NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking Poll in late December. This milestone is significant as the 2016 primary heads into its final few weeks of contests, as there has been intense speculation that Trump's support has a ceiling. Though his support has hovered in the high 40s since mid-March, the front-runner had yet to secure half of Republican voters. These results are according to the latest NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking poll conducted online from April 18 to April 24 of 10,707 adults aged 18 and over, including 9,405 registered voters.

TIME 100 honoree Donald Trump said fellow Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich "should drop out" of the race, shortly before it was announced that he'd swept the primaries in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island. "They should drop out, because frankly they have no path to victory," Trump said on the red carpet at the TIME 100 gala on Tuesday night. His comments come after Cruz and Kasich announced that they are teaming up to stop the real estate mogul from reaching the 1,237 delegates necessary to cinch the GOP nomination.

WALL STREET JOURNAL // REID EPSTEIN

For Ted Cruz to stop Donald Trump from seizing the Republican presidential nomination, he must replicate his Wisconsin victory in Indiana, another Midwestern state with similar demographics and population. But even with Ohio Gov. John Kasich's ceding Indiana to him as part of a nonaggression pact, it's a tall hurdle. Mr. Cruz has none of the structural advantages he enjoyed in Wisconsin, where the GOP governor and conservative talk-radio hosts backed him to block Mr. Trump. Indiana's most respected Republican voices have stayed neutral, and local conservative media haven't picked sides ahead of the May 3 vote.

WASHINGTON POST // PETER STEVENSON

Basketball is a big deal in Indiana. It's the state where Larry Bird grew up shooting jump shots into a basket mounted on his garage. Where cornfields are broken up only by county roads, farmhouses and the occasional worn-down hoop. It's home to some of the country's largest high school gyms - the New Castle Fieldhouse seats almost 10,000 people -- more than Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium. And the state university's basketball team is tied for fourth on the list of most NCAA men's basketball championships. (That's IU, not Purdue. Sorry, Boilermakers.) So perhaps it's not a huge surprise that two Republican presidential contenders who really want to win the Hoosier state's winner-take-most primary on May 3 are going all-in on basketball-related pandering.



Cruz braces for another tough primary night, tries likening Trump to Clinton<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/26/cruz-braces-for-another-tough-primary-night-tries-likening-trump-to-clinton/>

WASHINGTON POST // SEAN SULLIVAN

Ted Cruz delivered a speech here Tuesday night dedicated to turning the page on what was expected to be another very difficult primary day for him and looking ahead to his colossal showdown with Donald Trump here next Tuesday. In a speech timed to get ahead of voting results in five Eastern states where Trump was expected to add to his delegate lead, the Texas senator took sharp aim at his Republican presidential rival, tying him repeatedly to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Cruz accused Trump of standing with Clinton on a litany of policy and political fronts and said in jest that Clinton has tapped Trump as his running mate.

Voting Rights Lose in North Carolina<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/opinion/voting-rights-lose-in-north-carolina.html?ref=topics>

NEW YORK TIMES // EDITORIAL BOARD

Late Monday, a federal district judge upheld<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/us/politics/federal-judge-upholds-north-carolina-voter-id-law.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news> one of the most regressive and restrictive voting laws in the country - a 2013 North Carolina law<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/08/12/north-carolina-governor-signs-extensive-voter-id-law/> that eliminated same-day voter registration and preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds; cut back on early voting by a week; barred counting votes cast outside voters' home precincts; and required voters to show identification at the polls. State lawmakers said these changes were necessary to reduce fraud and inefficiency in elections - though there is no evidence of voter fraud to combat or inefficiency to cure. The Justice Department, the American Civil Liberties Union, the N.A.A.C.P. and the Advancement Project, among others, sued on the grounds that the law illegally discriminates against minority voters.



Donald Trump's Success Carries Lessons for Democrats, Too<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/opinion/donald-trumps-success-carries-lessons-for-democrats-too.html>

NEW YORK TIMES // EDITORIAL BOARD

As primary voters went to the polls in five Northeastern states today, it seems long ago that Mitt Romney went on TV to say, "If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished." In that March 3 speech, Mr. Romney advanced a plan to deprive Mr. Trump of the votes he needs to win the Republican presidential nomination without a convention fight in July. Mr. Romney proposed that the candidate in the best position to beat Mr. Trump in each state should run unimpeded by other contenders. After losing in New York, Senator Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich seemed ready to embrace this idea. Late Sunday they announced that Mr. Cruz would run hard in Indiana's May 3 primary, and Mr. Kasich, though he was favored in suburbs surrounding Indianapolis, would stand down in that state. Mr. Kasich, in turn, would focus on beating Mr. Trump in New Mexico and Oregon, unimpeded by Mr. Cruz. But within hours, they backed away, as Mr. Cruz's campaign quietly told supporters not to engage in "tactical voting," and Mr. Kasich said that although he wouldn't hold rallies, he'd still attend a fund-raiser and meetings with Republican leaders in Indiana.

"I DIDN'T ask to be this way. All I want to do is be a normal child and use the restroom in peace." That's what 16-year-old Grimm told<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/opinion/for-transgender-americans-legal-battles-over-restrooms.html?_r=0>the Gloucester County (Va.) School Board last year as it debated whether to bar the transgender student from using the boys' restrooms. His appeal for personal dignity didn't seem to matter. Nor did the fact that he had been using the boys' bathrooms without incident until some adults in the community got riled up about the issue. So a federal appellate ruling<https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/federal-appeals-court-sides-with-trangender-teen-says-bathroom-case-can-go-forward/2016/04/19/6a873b88-f76b-11e5-9804-537defcc3cf6_story.html> in his favor was a welcome development that will help to advance protections for the rights of transgender people.

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Secretary of State John F. Kerry&#8217;s career has long been intertwined with Vietnam, and the devastating, divisive war he fought in and against. After a tour in Vietnam as a young Navy
 officer, Kerry burst onto the public stage as an antiwar protester in the 1970s. As a senator, he helped create conditions for the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations in the 1990s. Next month, he will accompany President Obama to Hanoi, no longer Washington&#8217;s
 foe but an important strategic and economic partner. Kerry&#8217;s past and present will merge once again Wednesday at a Vietnam symposium at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin. He will preview the Obama trip, and chat onstage with filmmaker Ken Burns about
 Burns&#8217;s upcoming documentary on the Vietnam War.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 probe into sky-rocketing drug prices, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday. The memo, which was sent to Democratic members of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform from the staff of its top Democrat Elijah
 Cummings, reveals that Valeant previously withheld readily available analyst reports prepared by banks such as Goldman Sachs, saying they were protected by attorney-client privilege. The memo says it also raises questions about other documents that are still
 being withheld, saying some of these &quot;were not drafted by attorneys and do not include communications with attorneys.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Senate negotiators on Tuesday moved closer to an agreement to provide at least $1.1 billion in emergency financing to combat the rapidly spreading Zika virus, which public health officials
 warn poses an imminent threat in the United States, but House Republicans said they were still not ready to approve additional funds. The White House bluntly warned that Republicans were not acting quickly enough and that the needed money might not arrive
 before mosquitoes carrying the disease, which causes birth defects, reach the United States. &#8220;This is an emergency,&#8221; said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. &#8220;The American people are counting on Congress to act. And instead, we&#8217;ve gotten bureaucratic

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Senate Republicans said Tuesday they were close to an agreement with Democrats on new funding to combat the Zika virus, but conservative House Republicans remained skeptical about the
 need for an emergency appropriation. Proponents of the funding say the onset of warmer weather is creating an urgent need for the funding, which would be used to control mosquito populations, develop vaccines and increase laboratory capacity for research into
 the virus, which has been linked to birth defects. Budget Director Shaun Donovan said earlier this month that the U.S. shouldn&#8217;t take the risk of having the outbreak spread and get out of control before Congress acts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">As lawmakers prepare to leave for a weeklong recess, Democrats are calling for a vote on emergency funding to combat the spreading Zika virus. Republicans indicated last week they planned
 to work with Democrats, after weeks of ignoring the administration&#8217;s request to direct emergency money toward the epidemic. The virus, according to the World Health Organization, causes microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. There have been 388
 travel-related Zika cases reported in the U.S. since the start of 2015. On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) urged Republicans to move now, ahead of the brief recess that begins for both chambers on Friday. &#8220;There&#8217;s been talk about some kind
 of arrangement, but there is no deal,&#8221; Reid said, adding that the amount Republicans are eyeing (over $1 billion) isn&#8217;t enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">It started as the mantra Senate Democrats used to urge their GOP colleagues to grant Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a hearing and floor vote: &#8220;Do your job.&#8221; For weeks, every
 Democratic tweet urging Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to take up Garland&#8217;s nomination ended with #DoYourJob. At press conferences and in video releases, Senate Democrats brought forward
 doctors, nurses, and municipal employees to explain what would happen if they refused to do their jobs. Their point, though a tad heavy-handed, was clear: Republican senators are skipping out on work. But with little prospect of a Garland hearing and a number
 of other pressing issues dominating the news cycle, the #DoYourJob campaign has evolved. Once a movement with the sole purpose of getting Garland a confirmation hearing and vote, the tagline has become a bicameral effort to paint congressional Republicans
 as generally obstructionist on a host of items.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Democratic voters in Maryland head to the polls on Tuesday to decide the fate of two of the party&#8217;s most promising stars. Reps. Chris Van Hollen and Donna Edwards are vying to replace
 outgoing Sen. Barbara Mikulski in the Free State, and the stakes are enormous. One lawmaker will see a fruitful congressional career come to a screeching halt with a primary loss and be left to face an uncertain political future. The other will be a big favorite

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that Bernie Sanders can't win the Democratic nomination, but he won't call on the Vermont senator to quit the race. Speaking to reporters
 on Capitol Hill, the Nevada senator was asked if he thought Sanders had a path to the presidential nomination. &quot;No, I don't,&quot; Reid replied. Reid said he was comfortable with Sanders' vow to take the campaign to the convention in July, saying he &quot;should do
 what he has to do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Addiction recovery groups are opening up a full-throated campaign against legislation that House Republicans will propose as the chamber&#8217;s response to the opioid epidemic. House Speaker
 Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have been promising swift action following the March passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in the Senate by a vote of 94-1. On Wednesday, House Republicans will introduce the
 Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, an advance copy of which was obtained by The Huffington Post. If the House had been hoping its parallel effort would win the support of the drug policy and addiction community, though, a barrage of letters has been
 unleashed to set them straight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Federal agencies could no longer put employees on indefinite paid leave while investigating them for misconduct or poor performance under a bill set for a House floor vote as soon as
 Tuesday. The measure is one of many seeking to limit &#8220;administrative leave&#8221; following investigations finding that agencies had used that form of leave routinely to keep employees off the job, although with full pay and benefits, for months &#8212; and in some cases
 a year or more. The bill would limit such leave to 14 days; if an investigation were not finished by then, the employee generally would have to return to work. If the agency decided that the employee would pose certain risks, even if assigned to different
 duties or to telecommuting, the leave could be extended for additional 30-day periods, with reports to Congress required each time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Right now, there are key vacancies at a vital government institution. President Barack Obama has fulfilled his duty and put forward eminently qualified nominees to fill the vacancies.
 Yet despite the nominees' strong credentials, Republicans in the Senate have dragged their feet, and the chair of the committee whose job it is to consider the nominees has refused to even schedule hearings. No, this isn't the high-profile battle to fill the
 seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. While the fight over Scalia's replacement may be stealing headlines, Republican obstructionism is actually preventing another important government body from functioning as it should: the Federal Reserve.
 Two vacant spots on the seven-person Federal Reserve Board of Governors have sat unfilled since 2014. Obama nominated former community banking CEO Allan Landon to be a Federal Reserve governor in January 2015, yet Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard
 Shelby has let Landon's appointment languish for over a year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Senate Republican leaders entered this week hoping to act quickly to fight the Zika virus, but ran into internal feuding and now face the prospect of political fallout in election battleground
 states like Florida. Talks with Democrats on an emergency spending package stalled and lawmakers now anticipate doing nothing before they leave on a one-week recess at the end of the week. Republican leaders say they will bring a bill to the Senate floor at
 some point as they continue to negotiate on the details, but it remains unclear when and how such a measure would advance. Republicans had been slow to address an Obama administration request in February for $1.9 billion to prevent a Zika outbreak, but evidence
 that the virus is spreading faster than originally feared has injected new urgency into the debate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that the upper chamber will wait for the House to pass legislation on Puerto Rico's growing debt crisis as lawmakers struggle
 to reach a deal. &quot;We're going to let the House go first on Puerto Rico. We know it needs to be dealt with, and we're in discussions with them about what ought to be done,&quot; he told reporters. His comments came after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)
 told reporters earlier Tuesday that he doesn't think Congress will be able to pass legislation before a crucial deadline. The island territory is at risk of defaulting on a $422 million payment due May 1. Lawmakers are scheduled to leave town at the end of

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">After months of trying to sideline an unexpectedly deft and well-financed liberal opponent, Hillary Clinton on Tuesday won a series of primaries that freed her to present herself as
 the de facto victor of the Democratic nomination fight and gave her the impetus to shift focus decisively toward the November election. Now all but certain to clinch the Democratic nomination, Mrs. Clinton will continue to face Mr. Sanders&#8217;s criticism, but
 is expected to move swiftly to claim an early advantage against the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump. Her advisers and allies say she will spend the coming weeks honing her message for the general election, and ramping up fund-raising efforts
 that have lagged in the face of Mr. Sanders&#8217;s challenge. &#8220;With your help, we&#8217;re going to come back to Philadelphia for the Democratic National Committee, with the most votes and the most pledged delegates,&#8221; Mrs. Clinton told a crowd of 1,300 here after she

 also called for Clinton at 9.01pm - with one third of the votes counted, she was 57%-42% ahead of Bernie Sanders. In Connecticut, with 48% of the votes in, Sanders led by 49% to 48%.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 more than the 54 percent average across contests so far this year. Meanwhile, just 23 percent said they preferred more liberal policies -- less than the 30 percent average so far. The numbers suggest a friendly electorate for Hillary Clinton, whose campaign
 has stressed that she will fight to maintain Obama&#8217;s policies &#8212; whereas Sanders has pressed a more liberal agenda and criticized Obama at times for not pushing things far enough to the left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 comment on was that Sanders looked defensive and deflated on Meet the Press, where he made the statement on Sunday. Lost was the fact that this is a truth we should be struck by, ashamed of even, and should do more about. The impolitic remark came in response
 to a question about why the candidate had been losing so much in the places he should have been winning (he&#8217;s lost 16 of the 17 states with the highest levels of income inequality). The most straightforward thing for him to say would be to acknowledge that
 he hasn&#8217;t performed well with minority voters who tend to be less affluent. But he didn&#8217;t want to say that on television. Instead, he decided to talk about something else that&#8217;s actually more important than where he, personally, is up or down. He said: &#8220;Poor
 people don&#8217;t vote. I mean, that&#8217;s just a fact. That&#8217;s a sad reality of American society&#8221;. He also noted that &#8220;80% of poor people did not vote&#8221; in the 2014 election.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Donald Trump has earned more than 9 million votes in the Republican primary and amassed a lead that puts him on the brink of clinching the GOP nomination. But in the shadow contest for the delegates to a contested national convention, he&#8217;s getting obliterated

 these contests, securing slots for hundreds of loyalists to the convention in Cleveland in July. Trump, on the other hand, has consistently flopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Donald Trump swept primaries in five Northeastern states on Tuesday, moving closer to winning the Republican presidential nomination as he easily defeated rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich.
 Trump scored victories in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware, U.S. television networks projected. His margin of victory in each state appeared to be even larger than in his home state of New York a week ago, a major show of strength
 that sets the stage for a potentially pivotal battle next week in Indiana. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, already in control of the Democratic race, defeated challenger Bernie Sanders in Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania. But in a surprise, Sanders
 was projected to have won Rhode Island. Connecticut's Democratic vote was too close to call.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Presidential campaigns are about media, math and momentum. But in the wake of Donald Trump&#8217;s five-state sweep in the Northeast yesterday, it&#8217;s time to add another measure. And that
 is psychology. Which may be his biggest advantage. By adding Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island to his New York landslide, Trump is clearly riding a wave of momentum and positive media coverage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Donald Trump has reached 50 percent support from Republicans and Republican-leaners nationally for the first time since the beginning of the NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking
 Poll in late December. This milestone is significant as the 2016 primary heads into its final few weeks of contests, as there has been intense speculation that Trump's support has a ceiling. Though his support has hovered in the high 40s since mid-March, the
 front-runner had yet to secure half of Republican voters. These results are according to the latest NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking poll conducted online from April 18 to April 24 of 10,707 adults aged 18 and over, including 9,405 registered
 voters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">TIME 100 honoree Donald Trump said fellow Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich &#8220;should drop out&#8221; of the race, shortly before it was announced that he&#8217;d swept
 the primaries in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island. &#8220;They should drop out, because frankly they have no path to victory,&#8221; Trump said on the red carpet at the TIME 100 gala on Tuesday night. His comments come after Cruz and Kasich
 announced that they are teaming up to stop the real estate mogul from reaching the 1,237 delegates necessary to cinch the GOP nomination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">For Ted Cruz to stop Donald Trump from seizing the Republican presidential nomination, he must replicate his Wisconsin victory in Indiana, another Midwestern state with similar demographics
 and population. But even with Ohio Gov. John Kasich&#8217;s ceding Indiana to him as part of a nonaggression pact, it&#8217;s a tall hurdle. Mr. Cruz has none of the structural advantages he enjoyed in Wisconsin, where the GOP governor and conservative talk-radio hosts
 backed him to block Mr. Trump. Indiana&#8217;s most respected Republican voices have stayed neutral, and local conservative media haven&#8217;t picked sides ahead of the May 3 vote.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Despite landslide victories on Tuesday,<b>&nbsp;</b>Donald Trump still needs to win Indiana &#8212; and he&#8217;s starting to act like it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The frugal Manhattan mogul has begun opening his wallet for the air war, spending more than $900,000 on TV and radio ads. He&#8217;s working the inside game, wooing Gov.

 what multiple Indiana insiders said appears to have been a successful effort to keep the governor on the endorsement sidelines. And Trump&#8217;s new campaign strategist Paul Manafort has been telling Republican officials, multiple people told POLITICO, that Trump
 is in the midst of doubling the ground team there, with plans to balloon his in-state operation to 40 people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Basketball is a big deal in Indiana. It&#8217;s the state where Larry Bird grew up shooting jump shots into a basket mounted on his garage. Where cornfields are broken up only by county roads,
 farmhouses and the occasional worn-down hoop. It&#8217;s home to some of the country&#8217;s largest high school gyms &#8211; the New Castle Fieldhouse seats almost 10,000 people -- more than Duke&#8217;s Cameron Indoor Stadium. And the state university&#8217;s basketball team is tied
 for fourth on the list of most NCAA men&#8217;s basketball championships. (That's IU, not Purdue. Sorry, Boilermakers.) So perhaps it&#8217;s not a huge surprise that two Republican presidential contenders who really want to win the Hoosier state&#8217;s winner-take-most primary
 on May 3 are going all-in on basketball-related pandering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Ted Cruz delivered a speech here Tuesday night dedicated to turning the page on what was expected to be another very difficult primary day for him and looking ahead to his colossal
 showdown with Donald Trump here next Tuesday. In a speech timed to get ahead of voting results in five Eastern states where Trump was expected to add to his delegate lead, the Texas senator took sharp aim at his Republican presidential rival, tying him repeatedly
 to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Cruz accused Trump of standing with Clinton on a litany of policy and political fronts and said in jest that Clinton has tapped Trump as his running mate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 that eliminated same-day voter registration and preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds; cut back on early voting by a week; barred counting votes cast outside voters&#8217; home precincts; and required voters to show identification at the polls. State lawmakers
 said these changes were necessary to reduce fraud and inefficiency in elections &#8212; though there is no evidence of voter fraud to combat or inefficiency to cure. The Justice Department, the American Civil Liberties Union, the N.A.A.C.P. and the Advancement Project,
 among others, sued on the grounds that the law illegally discriminates against minority voters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">As primary voters went to the polls in five Northeastern states today, it seems long ago that Mitt Romney went on TV to say, &#8220;If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the
 prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.&#8221; In that March 3 speech, Mr. Romney advanced a plan to deprive Mr. Trump of the votes he needs to win the Republican presidential nomination without a convention fight in July. Mr. Romney proposed
 that the candidate in the best position to beat Mr. Trump in each state should run unimpeded by other contenders. After losing in New York, Senator Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich seemed ready to embrace this idea. Late Sunday they announced that Mr. Cruz would
 run hard in Indiana&#8217;s May 3 primary, and Mr. Kasich, though he was favored in suburbs surrounding Indianapolis, would stand down in that state. Mr. Kasich, in turn, would focus on beating Mr. Trump in New Mexico and Oregon, unimpeded by Mr. Cruz. But within
 hours, they backed away, as Mr. Cruz&#8217;s campaign quietly told supporters not to engage in &#8220;tactical voting,&#8221; and Mr. Kasich said that although he wouldn&#8217;t hold rallies, he&#8217;d still attend a fund-raiser and meetings with Republican leaders in Indiana.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
