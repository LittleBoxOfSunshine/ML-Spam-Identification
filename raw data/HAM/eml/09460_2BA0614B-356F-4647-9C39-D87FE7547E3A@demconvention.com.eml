DNC Holds Executive Committee Conference Call
WASHINGTON - Due to today's inclement weather throughout the country, the D=
emocratic National Committee's (DNC) Executive Committee held their Executi=
ve Committee meeting via conference call today, hearing from special guests=
 such as Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chai=
r Marcel Groen, and Democratic National Convention Committee CEO Leah Daugh=
try on preparations for the Democratic Convention to be held in the City of=
 Brotherly and Sisterly Love in July. The previously-scheduled in-person me=
eting in Philadelphia, including a tour of the convention sites, was cancel=
led due to expected inclement weather.
Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz also deli=
vered remarks during today's call. In addition, the DNC Executive Committee=
 voted to ratify the Chair's 2016 Party Leader and Elected Official Member =
appointments to the Convention Standing Committees: Credentials, Platform, =
and Rules. The slate of the Chair's appointments is attached in PDF format.
DNC rules provide for the Chair to appoint 75 Party Leader and Elected Offi=
cial Members to the three Convention Standing Committees.  These Party Lead=
er Members serve in addition to and together with the over 160 members that=
 are elected in each and every state to those same committees.
"I am extremely proud of the experienced group of individuals who are ready=
 and dedicated to serving our Party on the Convention Committees," said DNC=
 Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. "This slate represents the great vari=
ety of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences that make up our Party. W=
e wanted to make sure that the diversity of our party was reflected to the =
highest levels in terms of race, gender, age, and geography and feel confid=
ent that these individuals will do a tremendous job in this capacity."
The bulk of the Standing Committee members will be elected from the states =
and territories during the delegate selection process.
The Chair also appointed Committee Co-Chairs as follows:

*         Credentials Committee: Lorraine Miller and Jim Roosevelt

*         Rules Committee: Former State Senator Leticia Van de Putte and fo=
rmer U.S. Congressman Barney Frank

*         Platform Committee: Governor Dan Malloy and former Atlanta Mayor =
Shirley Franklin
