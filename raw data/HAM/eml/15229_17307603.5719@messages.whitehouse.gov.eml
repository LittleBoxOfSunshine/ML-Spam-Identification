Subject: Travel pool 6/Dreamplex enterpreneur event

Potus entered Dreamplex and toured a series of three high-tech displays i=
n an open work space. Young people wearing blue shirts gave him a tour of=
 each. The first was a laptop computer and potus later said it was a remo=
te controlled laser cutter. The young man giving the demonstration handed=
 potus what appeared to be a pink and blue paper flower. Later, Potus mov=
ed to the second display which involved a large TV monitor and Potus pick=
ing up an ipad and appearing to take a selfie while some cartoon figures =
on the screen moved. "Look at this guys," obama said to the pool and he f=
iddled with the ipad. Pool was then ushered out and into a larger room wh=
ere dozens of people in suits were waiting for Potus to give a talk on en=
trepreneurship.
Obama took the stage to applause. Three people - two women and a man - we=
re seated on stage as he delivered opening remarks from behind a lectern =
with the presidential seal. Some highlights but please check against the =
transcript:
Potus: "I had the opportunity to visit jade pagoda. Going from a 100 year=
 old sacred temple to this 21st century Dreamplex is a wonderful expressi=
on evolution take place here in Vietnam, a country that honors its histor=
y but is also boldly racing to the future. That's the story of this city,=
 a city on the move. When we were coming in from the airport we would see=
 all the activity that's taking place, and I'm not just talking about the=
 traffic. It might be easier to be on a motorbike than a motorcade."
"Some of this energy may be from your Caf? Troung. That stuff is strong."=

"I see it everywhere I travel-I meet people, especially young people, eag=
er strike out on their own, start something new and shape their own desti=
nies, contribute to their communities and live better lives. That what en=
trepreneurship is all about."
"Entrepreneurship is also the fuel for prosperity, putting people on a pa=
th to success. It's hard to get started, hard to access capital, hard to =
get skills you need. It can be especially difficult for women."
"He said a company called 500 Startups has launched a $10 venture capital=
 million fund in HCMC."
"I'll welcome 8 Vietnamese entrepreneurs to Silicon Valley next month."
"Your success sends message to global investors this country's incredible=
 potential for innovation."
(He said the US will help open a women's entrepreneur center in Vietnam, =
then he put in a plug for the Trans-Pacific Partnershpi trade deal.}
"The TPP not only will allow to us sell more goods to each other and brin=
g our economies closer... but it will also accelerate economic reforms, b=
oost competitiveness open up new markets."
"My message to all the entrepreneurs here is: I believe in you, America b=
elieves in you."
Then Potus moderated a discussion with the other three on entrepreneurshi=
p...
One woman grad gtown mba. She makes fashion jewelry and sells it on amazo=
n.com<http://amazon.com> (a terrific company, your Washington Post pooler=
 notes)... the man used to work in the US for Microsoft.
