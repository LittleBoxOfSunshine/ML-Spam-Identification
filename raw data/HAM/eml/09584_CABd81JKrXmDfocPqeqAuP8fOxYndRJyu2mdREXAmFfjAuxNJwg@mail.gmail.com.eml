*Donald Trump: Not Playing Well in States*



Donald Trump has been the presumptive nominee of the Republican party for
just over two weeks. All across the country, headlines and editorials are
telling the story of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee: he=E2=80=99s a=
 loose
cannon whose hateful language and reckless policies show he=E2=80=99s simpl=
y too
big a risk for the country.

See below for local coverage of Donald Trump=E2=80=99s campaign thus far:



*Iowa*



*Des Moines Register:* Trump's refusal to share his tax returns raises
questions
<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/05/18/edito=
rial-trumps-refusal-share-his-tax-returns-raises-questions/84501638/>

Nixon was right: The people have got to know whether or not their president
is a crook. The people also have a right to know whether a billionaire
running for president has paid his fair share of taxes.



*Muscatine Journal: *What doesn't Donald Trump want you to know about his
wealth?
<http://muscatinejournal.com/news/opinion/what-doesn-t-donald-trump-want-yo=
u-to-know-about/article_9cfaf892-7b2a-5a67-84b5-119304413099.html>

For one thing, if we were able to see how Trump's fortune is structured and
how much tax he pays on it, we would also be able to compute his liability
under his proposed changes to the tax code. In other words, we would be
able to approximate how much Trump stands to earn for himself and his heirs
by pulling the strings of power. Is it any surprise he won't go there?



*Minnesota*



*Minneapolis Star Tribune:* Trump strains the U.S.-U.K. 'special
relationship'
<http://www.startribune.com/trump-strains-the-u-s-u-k-special-relationship/=
379717571/>

Should he be elected, Trump would quickly learn just how much he =E2=80=94 =
and
America =E2=80=94 needs the U.S.-U.K. special relationship and how essentia=
l it is
to further tighten transatlantic bonds. Principled conservatives, who can
rightly take pride in Republicans=E2=80=99 role in building and maintaining=
 these
ties in the postwar era, should reflect carefully about whether they dare
trust them to such an undisciplined, unwise brawler.



*Bemidji Pioneer:* Shifting focus from Trump: Some state Republicans want
party to emphasize local candidates, separate from presumptive nominee
<http://www.bemidjipioneer.com/news/local/4034958-election-shifting-focus-t=
rump-some-state-republicans-want-party-emphasize-local>

"There are a lot of varying opinions about how our party should proceed,=E2=
=80=9D
said Beltrami County Republicans Chair Ken Cobb. =E2=80=9CI think one thing=
 has
been evident through the entire process and that is we're all committed to
our down ballot candidates, legislative and locally. We're trying to work
through how to proceed because we do have differences in how much support
we can give the nominee."



*Missouri*



*Springfield News-Leader:* Mr. Trump, release your tax returns
<http://www.news-leader.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/05/18/mr-trump-re=
lease-tax-returns/84527096/>

Whatever the reasons, Trump=E2=80=99s constantly changing positions about h=
is
returns =E2=80=94 gonna release them, can't release them, want to release t=
hem,
might release them =E2=80=94 raise suspicions that he=E2=80=99s concealing =
something. On
Friday, he went so far as to tell ABC's Good Morning America that his tax
rates are "none of your business." Well, actually, they are because
Americans have the right to know whether someone who wants to lead the
nation pays what he owes, is free of financial conflicts of interest and
gives generously to worthy causes.



*Nevada*



*Las Vegas Review Journal: *The Donald sits on his returns
<http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-the-donald-sits-=
his-returns>

While every major party nominee for president in the past 40 years has
released his or her tax returns before the election, Donald Trump continues
to hold out, saying that he=E2=80=99s waiting until the completion of an on=
going
audit.



*New Hampshire*



*New Hampshire Union Leader:* Shaheen hits Trump on minimum wage views
<http://www.unionleader.com/article/20160511/NEWS0605/160519905/-1/mobile?t=
emplate=3Dmobileart>

=E2=80=9CThis is one of the many reckless proposals that Donald Trump has m=
ade that
would send our country in the wrong direction,=E2=80=9D Shaheen said in a
conference call with reporters on Tuesday.



*WMUR:* Shaheen hits Trump=E2=80=99s call to eliminate federal minimum wage
<http://www.wmur.com/politics/shaheen-hits-trumps-call-to-eliminate-federal=
-minimum-wage/39477344>

Veteran state Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, D-Concord, echoed Shaheen, and former
state Commissioner of Resources and Economic Development Sean O=E2=80=99Kan=
e said
elimination of the minimum wage could be =E2=80=9Cuniquely devastating=E2=
=80=9D to New
Hampshire because a large number of minimum wage workers are employed in
the tourism industry.



*Laconia Daily Sun:* Horn: Top of GOP ticket spells trouble
<http://www.laconiadailysun.com/newsx/local-news/94637-horn-top-of-gop-tick=
et-spells-trouble>

Leery of the impact of Donald Trump's candidacy on the remainder of the
Republican ticket, Jennifer Horn, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican
Party, told Belknap County Republicans this week that the state party will
direct its resources to maintaining its majorities in the New Hampshire
Legislature and capturing the governorship.



*New Jersey*



*Newark Star Ledger: *What's Trump hiding? A political liability, probably
<http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2016/05/whats_trump_hiding_a_political=
_liability_probably.html>

But mostly, releasing a tax return is a commitment to transparency, and
it's more relevant for candidates who cannot be judged on a record of
government service. In either case, someone running for president should be
willing to demonstrate that he has lived up to his tax obligations.



*New York*



*Buffalo News:* Trump should end the subterfuge and give voters access to
tax returns
<http://www.buffalonews.com/opinion/buffalo-news-editorials/trump-should-en=
d-the-subterfuge-and-give-voters-access-to-tax-returns-20160517>

One of the ways in which Americans can truly examine a presidential
candidate is through the candidate=E2=80=99s tax returns, which is why many=
 more
people should be upset over Donald J. Trump=E2=80=99s refusal to release hi=
s tax
filings.



*North Carolina*



*Raleigh News-Observer:* Republican financier Art Pope says he won=E2=80=99=
t
support Donald Trump
<http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/articl=
e77212692.html>

Art Pope, a North Carolina businessman and major financial backer of
Republican candidates, said Thursday he won=E2=80=99t support Donald Trump =
for
president.



*Charlotte Observer: *Share those tax returns, Donald Trump
<http://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/op-ed/article78447127.html>

Only, they are the public=E2=80=99s business, which even Richard Nixon reco=
gnized
despite his tendency to underpay. As for Trump=E2=80=99s audit defense, Nix=
on
released his tax returns while they were under audit. Trump has no excuse
for not releasing the returns other than his own hubris.



*Ohio*



*Cleveland Plain Dealer: *Break with Trump, or be stuck with him forever
<http://www.cleveland.com/obrien/index.ssf/2016/05/break_with_trump_or_be_s=
tuck_w.html>

Republican officeholders can either spend the next six months explaining
why they're going down with a ship they never even intended to board, or
save themselves a lot of heartache by publicly throwing Trump overboard and
pouring their efforts into down-the-ballot races.



*Pennsylvania*



*The Express Times:* =E2=80=99Lot of fence mending to do': Kasich backer Ch=
arlie
Dent not sold on Trump
<http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/elections/index.ssf/2016/05/lot_of_fence_m=
ending_to_do_kas.html>

"With the Republican nomination now secured for Donald Trump, he has a
great deal of work to do to convince many Americans, myself included, that
he is prepared and able to lead this great nation."


*Philadelphia Inquirer: *Former Pa. Gov. Ridge says he won't vote for Trump
<http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/big_tent/Former-PA-Gov-Ridge-says-he-wo=
nt-vote-for-Trump.html#2HP0xH5KpCRA2fyD.99>
Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge (R) has made no secret of his disdain
for the man his party seems about to nominate for president over the past
few months. Unlike some GOP leaders who are now making peace with the idea
of Donald J. Trump at the head of the ticket, however, Ridge is sticking
with his =E2=80=9CNever Trump=E2=80=9D position.



*Rhode Island*



*Providence Journal:* Donald Trump's taxes
<http://www.providencejournal.com/opinion/20160517/editorial-donald-trumps-=
taxes>

A tax return shows your income, for one thing. It shows your exemptions. It
shows your charitable donations. It provides information about your
business activities. It provides information about whether and how you=E2=
=80=99ve
sheltered your income offshore. It provides clues about your wealth, a
subject about which Mr. Trump is remarkably touchy, claiming to be worth
more than $10 billion, while Forbes and Fortune magazines have estimated
his worth at less than half that amount.
