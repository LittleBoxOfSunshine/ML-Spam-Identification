We can honestly make any time that evening work. I'm currently holding noon onwards for travel/the event. It would be great if we could do it a little on the earlier side so I can have her back at a decent hour, but can be flexible with what works for you guys. Thanks for checking.

Fantastic!  If Tina has a preferred time slot that evening, let me know.  Otherwise, I'll confer with Robbie and Gloria to see what works best for them.  Thank you!

Does Tina have preferred timing?  It is an evening event, but we are flexible on the time.

Jordan- just got approval from counsel! 

Counsel will need to review and approve the invite and any other materials with her name on it.  Her name should not be on the same page as anything asking for donations (including lists of prices to attend).

Once you have a more firm idea about timing, I am happy to send you flight times that would work. Thanks you!  

Thanks!
Sri

	   Hi Jordan- thanks for reaching out. What time is the event? It looks like, timing-wise, it would be possible for her to do the 31st but before I can commit her, I need some traps on it.
	   
	   Is there any more info you can give me about the event? Thanks so much!

	   Hey Sri,
	   
	   We are putting together a Democratic Lawyers Council reception in NYC with Robbie Kaplan hosting and Gloria Allred featured as the special guest. The ever would take place the evening of Tuesday, May 31st. Per Tina and Kaplan's conversation below, Tina is happy to join if we can work out the timing.
	   
	   Happy to put her on a flight out of NYC the evening of the 31st or first thing on the 1st. Please let us know at your earliest convenience if this is feasible. It is a women's issues and civil rights focused event, so Tina's participation would be pivotal to the event's success.
	   
	   Thanks and we Look forwarding to hearing from you.
