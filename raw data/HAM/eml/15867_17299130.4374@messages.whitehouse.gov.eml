THE WHITE HOUSE
Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

April 28, 2016

**

*FACT SHEET: Taking Action to Help More Americans Manage Student Debt*

**

"Im only here because this country gave me a chance through education. We=
 are here today because we believe that in America, no hardworking young =
person should be priced out of a higher education. This country has alway=
s made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of young peo=
ple willing to work for it."

" ""President Barack Obama, Remarks on College Affordability, June 9, 201=
4"



Higher education is one of the most important investment individuals can =
make for themselves and for our country.Today, 11 of the 15 fastest-growi=
ng occupations require a postsecondary education. Thats why the President=
 has made historic investments to help millions of Americans afford colle=
ge by doubling investments in grant and scholarship aid through Pell gran=
ts and tax credits, keeping interest rates low on federal student loans, =
and creating better options to help borrowers manage debt after college l=
ike the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plan.=20



As detailed in a new post on student debt trends [ https://www.whitehouse=
.gov/blog/2016/04/28/six-recent-trends-student-debt ] and state-by-state =
data being released by the Council of Economic Advisers, we are seeing th=
ese efforts pay off. More students are graduating college than ever befor=
e. More than four of five Direct Loan recipients with loans in repayment =
are current on their loans. Delinquencies, defaults, and hardship deferme=
nts are all trending downward, with nearly three million borrowers succes=
sfully accessing a pathway out of default through loan rehabilitation sin=
ce 2010. And more students are taking action on their student debt when t=
hey need support, with nearly five million Direct Loan borrowers taking a=
dvantage of repayment options like the Presidents PAYE plan, which caps m=
onthly student loan payments at 10 percent of income, up from 700,000 enr=
olled in 2011.=20



Many students access student loans to help finance their education; typic=
ally, that investment pays off, with bachelors degree recipients earning =
$1 million more in their lifetime and associates degree recipients earnin=
g $360,000 more, compared to their high school counterparts.But for some,=
 burdensome student loan debt can present a challenge as they seek to sta=
rt a career, raise a family, purchase a home, start a business, or save f=
or retirement.=20



Guaranteeing strong consumer protections and building a system of high-qu=
ality customer service are important components of a federal student loan=
 system that expands college opportunity and provides reassurance to Amer=
ican families that pursuing a college degree and responsibly borrowing to=
 pay for college will not threaten their future financial security.=20



Today, the White House is announcing new actions and highlighting the pro=
gress already made to help ensure the more than 40 million Americans with=
 student loan debt understand their repayment options and access high-qua=
lity customer service, strong consumer protections, and targeted support =
to repay their student debt successfully.=20



*"_New Actions on Student Debt_"*

*"__"*

Over the past few years, the Administration has stepped up efforts to ens=
ure that flexible repayment options are available to support Americans wi=
th federal student debt. Todays actions build on that progress and provid=
e a roadmap to guide and support borrowers as they seek to manage and rep=
ay their debt successfully:



 *New Goal to Enroll 2 million More Borrowers in Plans like Pay As You Ea=
rn (PAYE).* The Presidents PAYE and related income-driven repayment plans=
 are available to help borrowers who may be struggling to manage their de=
bt effectively.Yet, too many borrowers still do not know about this impor=
tant option.Leveraging key improvements in loan servicing and customer se=
rvice, better tools and resources, targeted outreach to borrowers, and pa=
rtnerships with key external organizations under the Student Debt Challen=
ge, the Administration is announcing a new goal to enroll two million mor=
e borrowers in plans like PAYE by this time next year. **

**

 *Launch of StudentLoans.gov/Repay. *To help borrowers easily navigate th=
e complexity of student loan repayment options, the U.S. Digital Service =
and the Department of Educations Office of Federal Student Aid have launc=
hed *StudentLoans.gov/Repay* to help drive students to their best repayme=
nt option in five steps or less. Built mobile-first, and using human-cent=
ered design, *StudentLoans.gov/Repay* was designed to make repayment info=
rmation as easy to understand as possible.**

**

 *Strengthening Consumer Protections through New Standards for Student Lo=
an Servicing [ http://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/04282016-prote=
cting-borrowers.doc ]. *The Department of Education and Department of the=
 Treasury - after consulting with the Consumer Financial Protection Burea=
u (CFPB) and their work with Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan and o=
ther state attorneys general - have developed clear student loan borrower=
 rights and protections in three key areas: (1) providing accurate and ac=
tionable information about account features, borrower protections, and lo=
an terms; (2) establishing a clear set of expectations for minimum requir=
ements for communication and services provided by student loan servicers,=
 including adequate and timely customer service; and (3) holding servicer=
s accountable for fixing errors, being responsive to borrowers, and resol=
ving problems by ensuring that borrowers, federal and state agencies and =
regulators, and law enforcement officials have access to appropriate chan=
nels of recourse when violations of federal or state consumer financial l=
aws occur. The Department of Education will ensure all borrowers with fed=
eral Direct Loans can rely on high-quality service in line with these sta=
ndards and protections.The Department of Education will implement this ef=
fort as part of its new vision for servicing student loans [ http://blog.=
ed.gov/2016/04/a-new-vision-for-serving-student-loan-borrowers/ ]. **

**

 *Better Information to Help Borrowers Take Action on their Debt: CFPB Pr=
ototype Student Loan Payback Playbook. *The CFPB is seeking comment on a =
new set of student loan servicing disclosuresa student loan "Payback Play=
book " that provides borrowers personalized information to better underst=
and their repayment options and find a monthly payment they can afford. T=
o help borrowers choose the best repayment plan with the most up-to-date =
information based on their circumstances, borrowers would see a plain lan=
guage Playbook on their monthly bill, in regular email communications fro=
m their student loan servicer, or when they log into their student loan a=
ccount. The Department of Education, working with the CFPB, will be final=
izing and implementing these disclosures for federal loans borrowers.

**

 *Ensuring Effective Student Loan Counseling. *The Department of Educatio=
n will work to improve the timing and content of current loan counseling =
efforts, including statutorily required entrance and exit counseling, to =
help students make better borrowing decisions, increase college completio=
n, promote successful loan repayment, and reduce delinquencies and defaul=
ts. Specifically, the Department will upgrade and redesign its Entrance a=
nd Exit Counseling tools on StudentLoans.gov  which serves 6.5 million st=
udents a year  based on user analytics and direct input from more than 50=
0 borrowers, financial aid administrators, policymakers, and higher educa=
tion organizations. The Department is also developing a loan counseling e=
xperiment to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of different counselin=
g tools and the impact of offering borrowers more frequent information an=
d guidance beyond the statutorily required one-time entrance and one-time=
 exit counseling. **

**

 *Leveraging Research to Drive Better Student Outcomes. *The Department o=
f Education will pilot Advancing Insights through Data (AID), a research =
partnership program that will offer other federal agencies and affiliated=
 researchers data access to conduct research that can inform and advance =
policies and practices that support students postsecondary success and st=
rengthen repayment outcomes for borrowers. Starting with Federal Reserve =
Board researchers this fall, the program will allow experts to apply to s=
ecurely access and match administrative student aid data files with other=
 survey and administrative data, while ensuring safeguards are in place t=
o protect the privacy of students and families. AID builds on the Adminis=
trations recent efforts to leverage government data in ways that can impr=
ove service delivery, promote transparency, and strengthen accountability=
, particularly through the College Scorecard, which includes the most com=
prehensive, reliable data ever published on students post-college earning=
s and repayment outcomes. The Department is also exploring future opportu=
nities for new research partnerships.**

**

 *Modernizing Credit Reporting for Student Loans To Ensure Fair Treatment=
 Of Borrowers [ http://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/04282016-cred=
it-reporting.doc ]. *The Department of Education and the Department of th=
e Treasury, in consultation with the CFPB, are working collaboratively wi=
th the credit reporting industry to develop guidance for servicers, lende=
rs, and others who furnish data to the credit bureaus to determine how be=
st to report student loan data so that it is fair, consistent, and accura=
tely reflects repayment activity. This effort is another critical part of=
 the Departments new vision for servicing student loans [ http://blog.ed.=
gov/2016/04/a-new-vision-for-serving-student-loan-borrowers/ ].=20

**

 *Over 40 new student debt challenge takers.* Earlier this month, the Whi=
te House issued a call to action for colleges, universities, non-profits,=
 businesses, state and local governments, and other employers to help mor=
e borrowers better understand their options, and to take action to enroll=
 those borrowers in PAYE and related plans so they can manage their month=
ly payments and avoid delinquency and default. Today, we are highlighting=
 a growing list of commitments from organizations working to inform their=
 employees and members about PAYE and related plans, train human resource=
s (HR) staff on theimportance of helping borrowers understand their stude=
nt loan repayment options and the steps individuals must take to enroll, =
and use digital platforms to highlight PAYE and related plans. In the few=
 short weeks since the Debt Challenge was launched, there have been over =
40 commitment makers, and we are encouraging more colleges, businesses, n=
on-profits to take action [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/03/30/ta=

In the coming weeks and months, the White House will continue to encourag=
e organizations to take the Student Debt Challenge, and will announce add=
itional challenge-takers. New Federal Commitments to Tackle Student Debt =
include:



 *The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS)* will share i=
nformation with current AmeriCorps members, AmeriCorps alums, and grantee=
s about income-based repayment options, such PAYE. CNCS will also ensure =
that more members and grantees have information about other ways to reduc=
e their student loan burden, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness.CN=
CS will also continue to encourage colleges and universities to match the=
 Segal AmeriCorps Education Award that members receive at the end of thei=
r term of service. This year, approximately 75,000 AmeriCorps members are=
 serving with thousands of organizations across the country, and more tha=
n 980,000 AmeriCorps members have served over the last 20 years. Since th=
e inception of AmeriCorps in 1994, AmeriCorps members have earned more th=
an $3.1 billion in education awards to pursue further education or pay of=
f their student debt.In addition, CNCS has made more than $93 million in =
interest forbearance payments covering the interest cost of students loan=
s for AmeriCorps members during their terms of service.=20

 *Honoring Our Federal Workforce. The US Office of Personnel Management (=
OPM)* will coordinate an interagency effort to provide the federal workfo=
rce access to the information necessary to use one of the four income-bas=
ed student loan programs and Public Service Loan Forgiveness options in o=
rder to reduce their familys student loan debt. Through the remainder of =
the Administration, OPM will collaborate with human capital professionals=
 and senior leaders across agencies to develop effective strategies for c=
ommunicating the options available to the federal workforce. These strate=
gies will be woven through OPMs existing efforts to encourage and advance=
 Hiring Excellence and enhance employee engagement in order to recruit an=
d retain a first class federal workforce.

 *Streamlining Systems So More Students Can Access Financial Aid Resource=
s. *The United States Digital Service (USDS), working with the U.S. Depar=
tment of Education Federal Student Aid Office (FSA) will review and strea=
mline the process of creating an FSA ID  which is the new financial aid u=
sername and password  so students can complete the FAFSAs and so borrower=
s can log to manage their student loans, through a more secure and protec=
ted system. USDS and FSA will also simplify the income-driven repayment p=
lan application process so that it is simple for borrowers to enroll to m=
anage their debt using an income-driven repayment plan. Part of this work=
 will be to establish a centralized point of access for all federal stude=
nt loan borrowers, starting with the needs of the borrower. Finally, USDS=
 and FSA will digitize the process of applying for Public Service Loan Fo=
rgiveness so that teachers, firefighters, people serving their communitie=
s through non-profits, and others who are eligible for Public Service Loa=
n Forgiveness do not struggle with paper processes to have their loans fo=
rgiven.**

*"_Building on a Record of Progress_"*

*"__"*

Americans with student loan debt deserve high-quality customer service an=
d the consumer protections necessary to ensure they can effectively take =
action on their student debt.Over the past few years the Administration h=
as stepped up efforts to ensure that there are options available to suppo=
rt Americans who may be struggling with student loan debt.



 *_Making College More Affordable and Keeping Student Debt Manageable._* =
Since the President took office, the Administration has increased the max=
imum Pell [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/25/fact-s=
heet-how-recovery-act-helped-save-us-second-great-depression-and ] award =
by over $1,000, and for the first time, tied aid to inflation to maintain=
 its value. These efforts have cut the cost of college [ https://www.whit=
ehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/150507_final_-_state-by-state_progres=
s_report_on_college_affordability.pdf ] by about $3,700 on average for ov=
er eight million students last year. This Administration also established=
 the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), which provides up to $10,000=
 over four years of college, which will help nearly 10 million families c=
over the costs of tuition and other educational expenses, saving on avera=
ge $1,800 in 2016. To ensure student loans are manageable, the Administra=
tion has cut student loan interest rates, saving a typical student $1,000=
 over the life of loans borrowed this year, and began implementing the St=
udent Aid Bill of Rights [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/20=
15/03/10/fact-sheet-student-aid-bill-rights-taking-action-ensure-strong-c=
onsumer- ] to strengthen loan servicing and make it easier for students t=
o access the information they need to choose repayment plans. Meanwhile, =
defaults, delinquencies, and forbearances are trending downwards.=20


  * *_Accomplishments on the Student Aid Bill of Rights._* Since the Pres=
idents announcement of the Student Aid Bill of Rights in March 2015, the =
Department of Education, in collaboration with other federal agencies, ha=
s worked to:=20
  * "Identify Best Practices in Performance-Based Contracting "including =
identifying a strong performance-based compensation structure focused on =
supporting borrowers with the greatest risk of default; setting performan=
ce metrics and allocation methodology to drive strong borrower outcomes; =
requiring standardized service-level minimums including standardized comm=
unications focused on risky borrowers; creating robust borrower protectio=
n and complaint resolution processes to ensure strong accountability; and=
 establishing strong oversight processes and enforcement mechanisms inclu=
ding penalties for noncompliance or contract violations.""
  * "Protect Social Security Benefits for Borrowers with Disabilities "th=
rough a new process to proactively identify and assist federal student lo=
an borrowers with disabilities who may be eligible for Total and Permanen=
t Disability (TPD) loan discharge [ http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases=
/us-department-education-acts-protect-social-security-benefits-borrowers-=
disabilities ]. Approximately 387,000 borrowers were positively identifie=
d in the first set of matches, which were conducted in December 2015 and =
March 2016.In total, these borrowers have a combined loan balance of over=
 $7.7 billion, and roughly 179,000 are currently in default. As required =
by federal law, over 100,000 of those borrowers with defaulted loans have=
 been certified for the Treasury Offset Program, and are therefore at ris=
k of losing federal tax refunds, and of having their Social Security bene=
fits offset. This month, borrowers who were positively identified in the =
match will receive a customized letter explaining that the borrower is el=
igible for loan forgiveness and the simple steps needed to receive a disc=
harge. Unlike other borrowers, those identified through the data match wi=
ll not be required to submit additional documentation of their eligibilit=
y. Instead, they are eligible for a streamlined process by which they sim=
ply sign and return the completed application.=20

o "Find New and Better Ways to Communicate With Borrowers "by conducting =
five pilots to test the most effective ways to share information about lo=
an repayment options with borrowers. These pilots reached over four milli=
on borrowers this past year and will reach an additional three million by=
 the end of the summer. The Department of Education collaborated with the=
 White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team to utilize research and =
behavioral insights about how borrowers consume information, consider the=
ir options, and make decisions about repayment. Randomized-controlled tri=
als were used to test the effects of how choices are framed and the impor=
tance of personalized information. These insights are being used to infor=
m a new repayment campaign to reach over a million borrowers in their gra=
ce period that are about to enter repayment. Building on these successful=
 pilots, the Department of Education is making plans to standardize commu=
nications about loan servicing so that information received is accurate, =
personalized and consistent, ensuring that borrowers receive the informat=
ion that they need to successfully repay their loans.


  * "Create a Responsive Student Feedback System" to give students and bo=
rrowers a simple and straightforward way to file complaints and provide f=
eedback about federal loan lenders, servicers, collections agencies, and =
institutions of higher education. Beginning on July 1, 2016, the Enterpri=
se Complaint System (ECS) will enable customers to submit complaints, pos=
itive feedback, and allegations of suspicious activity regarding their Fe=
deral aid experience directly to the Department of Education and receive =
responsive, meaningful resolutions.Customers will be able to view, track,=
 and manage their cases through an easy-to-use online portal or by callin=
g a dedicated support center.In addition, the data collected by the Depar=
tment will be analyzed and used to drive enhancements to internal student=
 aid operations and inform policy discussion on relevant topics.
  * "Strengthen the Student Loan System to Better Protect All Borrowers "=
through a report [ http://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/strengthen=
ing-student-loan-system.pdf ] released last October,in consultation with =
the Department of the Treasury and CFPB, the report outlined a series of =
statutory, regulatory and administrative recommendations to safeguard stu=
dent borrowers including calling on Congress to simplify income-driven re=
payment plans; ensuring service members dont lose their interest rate pro=
tections under the Servicemember Civil Relief Act when consolidating thei=
r loans; strengthening protections against predatory third parties that c=
harge borrowers exorbitant fees for services that are available for free =
at studentaid.gov and enhancing federal data-sharing to improve borrower =
experiences and simplify the application process for borrowers to re-cert=
ify eligibility for income-driven repayment over multiple years.=20
