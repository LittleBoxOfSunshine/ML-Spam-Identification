Introducing POLITICO's 2016 Nerdcast
By Kristin Roberts, Charlie Mahtesian, Kenneth P. Vogel, Eli Stokols and Scott Bland
05/06/2016 05:19 AM EDT


POLITICO has officially launched the "2016 Nerdcast," our new podcast on the race for the White House. Tune in each week to geek out with us as we dive deep into this amazing presidential race, the latest numbers that actually matter, plus backstage dope on how politics really works. We're the kind of folks who like to spend our Friday nights pouring over poll numbers or the latest Federal Election Commission reports - so if you want to understand how the modern politics game is played, this is the podcast for you.


(Subscribe to the 2016 Nerdcast on iTunes or download from Soundcloud here.)

In this week's kickoff episode, national editor Kristin Roberts, senior investigative reporter Ken Vogel, senior political correspondent Eli Stokols, senior politics editor Charlie Mahtesian, and campaigns editor Scott Bland discuss Donald Trump locking up the Republican nomination and the pitfalls ahead, Hillary Clinton's big-money dilemma, and the Republican Party's crisis with Hispanic voters. Also: Why everyone hates both candidates.

Stories mentioned in this week's show:
McCain on tape: Trump damages my reelection hopes, by Burgess Everett and Seung-min KimClinton fundraising leaves little for state parties, by Ken VogelHillary forces target Bush donors, by Ben WhiteWhat the Kochs think about Trump now, by Alex IsenstadtTrump begins in a massive hole, by Steve Shepard
Feedback? What should we talk about next? Email us at nerdcast@politico.com.

Podcast produced by Bridget Mulcahy.
