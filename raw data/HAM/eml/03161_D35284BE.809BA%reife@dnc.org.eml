Some bad news this week: Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee=
 for President of the United States. And that=92s a little unsettling.

Because there were at one point 17 different candidates vying for the nomin=
ations and he trumped them all one by one. Now there=92s no one to stop him=
 but us.

https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/728286628461039616

 the mat to get it done:

But we need your help. Forward this email to everyone you know and ask them=
 to join you as a Factivist so that together we can make sure Donald Trump =
never becomes president:
