Remarks from DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz Press Call on the Stat=
e of the Presidential Race

Today, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz hosted a press call to discu=
ss the state of the race and preview Donald Trump's meetings with Republica=
n leadership tomorrow. From the party's senior leaders to the voters of Neb=
raska and West Virginia yesterday, Republicans have started to fret about t=
heir own deepening divide, and are now embracing their divisive and dangero=
us standard bearer. Democrats, on the other hand, have shown in state after=
 state that our voters are excited about our primary, and optimistic about =
both of our candidates. Despite the historic chaos among Republicans, it's =
now clear that Donald Trump is the Republican Party.
Please find remarks below as prepared for delivery:

DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz

Of course we now know that Donald Trump is the Republican presumptive nomin=
ee, but we wanted to take a moment to discuss the historic and unprecedente=
d division taking place on the Republican side --- especially visible this =
week as Donald Trump prepares to sit down tomorrow with Senate Leader Mitch=
 McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan. The irony is that Trump's impending=
 nomination is the result of years of the Republican Party elevating extrem=
e voices, and using divisive campaigns that sought to exploit unfounded fea=
rs for political gain. They've made their bed, and now they're lying in it.=
 With his lock on the Republican nomination, Donald Trump has ensured that =
his party's problems won't be limited to convention chaos -- he's going to =
force GOP races big and small across the country to own his ugly, divisive =
and dangerous rhetoric all the way to the general election.
...
There has never been a situation in which the sitting Speaker of the House =
of Representatives simply doesn't want to support his party's nominee. It's=
 stunning that Paul Ryan had to say he was willing to step down as the Chai=
r of his party's convention. The distress amongst party leaders is palpable=
. The list of Republican leaders who refuse to support Donald Trump got lon=
ger this week, with Ted Cruz joining Ryan, and a slew of former GOP preside=
ntial candidates and Republican presidents who are equally dismayed at his =
divisive and dangerous rhetoric. In exit polls yesterday, just ten percent =
of Republican voters in West Virginia and three percent in Nebraska said th=
ey think their party is united. Majorities of Republican primary voters in =
recent weeks have expressed concern about their party's division. When you =
look at the trend lines nationally on our side, In contest after contest, D=
emocratic voters are reporting their enthusiasm for both of our candidates.
The national polls favor Democrats who have seen week after week that our v=
oters are excited about our primaries and enthusiastic about our candidates=
. Democrats are building the infrastructure for the general election, and w=
e're doing it with enthusiastic voters because they see our candidates have=
 the right ideas to build on the progress of the last seven years. So we're=
 very confident that we're well positioned heading into the general electio=
n and that we'll have the strongest candidate. But we're not taking anythin=
g for granted, we're going to hold Trump and Republicans up and down the ba=
llot accountable for their repeated promises to drag our country right back=
 to the reckless policies that were in place in 2009 when the last Republic=
an president left office; when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month; and, wh=
en countless Americans lost their homes and savings.

So that's another reason that this Trump - Ryan - McConnell meeting matters=
. It's a reminder that what the Republican presumptive nominee is promising=
 is the same brand of trickle-down economic policies that help those at the=
 top while costing hardworking Americans. Despite their fretting over his d=
ivisive and dangerous rhetoric, when you look under the hood, Trump doesn't=
 look much different from Ryan or McConnell, and certainly like many of the=
 down ballot Republicans. Despite his attempts at slight-of-hand, for examp=
le, it's clear that Trump's reckless tax plan is modeled on what the Republ=
ican Party has done for years, built on the same failed foundation of rewar=
ding those at the top<http://www.npr.org/2015/12/22/460743371/analysis-trum=
p-tax-plan-boosts-the-rich-could-be-a-drag-on-the-economy> by slashing the =
top income tax rate. Trump's plan would bring that tax rate to 25 percent f=
rom 39.6 percent. That would give<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-rea=
d/first-read-why-trump-s-flip-flop-taxes-matters-n570431> the "top 0.1% of =
income earners like himself an average tax cut of more than $1.3 million." =
Republicans in Congress also want to lower<http://www.taxjusticeblog.org/ar=
chive/2015/10/paul_ryan_wants_to_cut_taxes_f.php#.VzJmBoSDGkp> the individu=
al tax rate for the wealthiest Americans to 25 percent. Trump also plans to=
 substantially<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform> reduce th=
e corporate tax rate, instead of fixing loopholes that allow some large com=
panies to pay no federal income tax at all. Paul Ryan and his colleagues ha=
ve also proposed cutting corporate taxes down to 25 percent - making Trump'=
s 15 percent plan even more extreme than the Ryan Budget.

It's the same old Republican playbook. And it's consistent with Trump's his=
tory of making money off the backs of hardworking people. Trump's Republica=
n bona fides go further. He actually said at one of the Republican Party's =
debates that wages were "too high". He not only opposes raising the federal=
 minimum wage but thinks there shouldn't be a federal minimum wage at all. =
Now he tries to play sleight of hand, but that's what he promised. And Trum=
p's statement this past week that the United States of America, as a countr=
y, shouldn't honor its debt and just print more money is flat out dangerous=
. But it's consistent with McConnell and Ryan, who have allowed their colle=
agues in Congress to bring our country to the brink of default by playing g=
ames with the debt ceiling, and threatening our credit rating. Put simply, =
Trump and the Republicans he's meeting with cannot be trusted on the econom=
y, they have already proven that. When they win, the American people lose. =
Trump is divisive and dangerous, and he lacks the judgment and temperament =
to be president. The contrast couldn't be clearer with our candidates, who =
I'm proud of, who have run substantive and spirited campaigns.
