For Immediate Release April 28, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20





1:18 P.M. EDT



MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I do not hav=
e any announcements at the top so we can go straight to your questions. K=
evin, would you like to start?



Q Sure, thank you, Josh. Can you talk a bit about the Vice Presidents sur=
prise trip to Baghdad today? What message is he delivering on the Preside=
nts behalf to Iraqi leaders? And what does the administration hope hell b=
e able to accomplish?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I think this is a good indication of the United=
 States continued support for Prime Minister Abadis efforts to unify the =
nation of Iraq to confront ISIL. And there are two critical priorities th=
at Prime Minister Abadi has identified.



The first is obviously the fight on the ground that Iraqi forces are wagi=
ng against ISIL inside of Iraq. That effort on the ground is strongly sup=
ported by the United States and our coalition partners. The support that =
we provide comes in a variety of forms. It includes airstrikes. It includ=
es training. It includes equipment. It includes advice and assistance fro=
m U.S. Special Operations forces.



The second priority that Prime Minister Abadi has identified is pursuing =
a set of political reforms to fight corruption. And building confidence i=
n the ability of Iraqs central government to lead that country is critica=
l. And the United States and our coalition partners are strongly supporti=
ve of Prime Ministers Abadis efforts to build a government that is capabl=
e, thats honest, and that, most importantly, has the confidence of all of=
 Iraqs diverse population.



So the vice presidential visit is an effort to underscore our support for=
 Prime Minister Abadis commitment to those priorities.



Q Todays GDP report indicates the economy grew by 0.5 percent the first q=
uarter. The President has been quite vocal about how well the economy is =
doing. Does this report undercut those arguments? And what does he think =
the federal government should be doing differently to rev up the economy =
during the remainder of his tenure?



MR. EARNEST: Kevin, the strength of the U.S. economy I think speaks for i=
tself when you take a look at the numbers. Obviously, the numbers that we=
re most attuned to are the jobs numbers. And the U.S. economy is currentl=
y on the longest streak of private sector job growth in our nations histo=
ry -- 73 consecutive months, for a total of 14.4 million private sector j=
obs. Thats a remarkable streak, and demonstrate the resilience of the U.S=
. economy.



The durability of the U.S. economy is the envy of the world. And theres n=
o denying the important progress that weve made in digging out of the hol=
e created by the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.=20



But of course theres more that we believe should be done. The President h=
as spent years making the case to Republicans in Congress that there is m=
ore that could be done that would strengthen our economy, expand economic=
 opportunity for the middle class, and lay a foundation for our nations l=
ong-term strength for the decades ahead. And that includes investments in=
 infrastructure. The President is quoted in a story today talking about h=
ow, frankly, the United States missed an opportunity over the last couple=
 of years to make critical investments in infrastructure while interest r=
ates were low, while the construction sector was not as strong as it prev=
iously was.=20



And its unfortunate that years have gone by where that opportunity has be=
en missed. But the President -- they werent missed because the President =
wasnt encouraging Congress to take that action. Frankly, the reason that =
opportunity was missed was because of Republicans stubborn refusal to con=
sider any priority that President Obama has identified. Thats unfortunate=
.



And the President has also been a strong advocate of raising the minimum =
wage. That certainly would bring more fairness to our economy, particular=
ly for hardworking Americans. At the current level of the minimum wage, t=
he average person whos working full time being paid minimum wage and rais=
ing a family of four is doing so below the poverty line. Thats not fair. =
Its not good for our economy. And its inconsistent with the strategy that=
 the President has laid out to grow our economy from the middle out.



Making investments in the middle class and those who are trying to get in=
to the middle class is the surest way to have a strong economy in the Uni=
ted States in the near term, but also to enhance our prospects for preser=
ving our economic strength over the long term.



Q So is the 0.5 percent growth something the administration feels good ab=
out?



MR. EARNEST: I think what we feel good about are the longer-term trends a=
s they relate to the most effective measures of our economy. And even tak=
ing a look at the most persistent components of output, which are consump=
tion and fixed investment, those rose by 2.6 percent over the last four q=
uarters. That an indication of a durable economy demonstrating some resil=
ience.=20



There surely is more. We would like to see those numbers be even better. =
But our proposals for improving those numbers have fallen upon deaf ears =
when it comes to the Republicans who are in charge of Congress right now.=




Q And are you saying that the growth rate as it stood in the first quarte=
r is an indirect result of Republicans failing to go along with increased=
 spending for infrastructure, minimum wage increases?



MR. EARNEST: Well, there is no denying that there are a wide variety of e=
conomic indicators that would be stronger if Republicans in Congress had =
seized the initiative three or four years ago and made critical investmen=
ts in our infrastructure.=20



As the Vice President himself often says, we know we need it. Its not as =
if this would be funding that wouldnt have direct benefits for the Americ=
an people. Theres plenty of critical investment projects that would impro=
ve our economy and improve quality of life here in the United States. A w=
hole host of road and bridge projects, airport upgrades, even laying new =
rail lines that would improve the economy and improve the quality of life=
 in communities all across the country. So that's money that would be wel=
l spent in this projects. It also would stimulate economic growth and cre=
ate jobs.



 So I would hesitate to draw a line between one spending proposal and one=
 economic indicator, but there's no denying that the longer-term trends w=
ould be even better than they already are if Republicans had followed the=
 President's advice.



 Fortunately, there are some things that we were able to do without stron=
g Republican support -- things like the Recovery Act and the Affordable C=
are Act and Wall Street reform, all of which did have positive benefits f=
or our economy that we continue to enjoy. The vast majority -- those thin=
gs were passed even though the vast majority of Republicans who were in o=
ffice at the time opposed them. And we continue to look for additional wa=
ys to strengthen our economy, even in the face of unprecedented Republica=
n obstruction in Congress.



 Q House Speaker Paul Ryan says he's invited Prime Minister Modi to addre=
ss a joint meeting of Congress on June 8th. Will the Prime Minister be co=
ming to the White House as well?



 MR. EARNEST: The White House has been in close touch with a range of Ind=
ian officials to discuss a potential visit by Prime Minister Modi to Wash=
ington. We're still engaged in those discussions. Obviously the President=
 has a strong working relationship with Prime Minister Modi. President Ob=
ama has complimented the important role that Prime Minister Modi played i=
n Paris, in ensuring the successful completion of the Paris climate talks=
. The President had a long meeting with Prime Minister Modi in the contex=
t of that international meeting. Prime Minister Modi attended and partici=
pated in the Nuclear Security Summit that was convened here in Washington=
 just last month. And, of course, President Obama at the beginning of las=
t year had an opportunity to be the guest of honor at India's Republic Da=
y celebration. That obviously was a memorable visit for the President and=
 he was the first President to be so honored, and he accepted an invitati=
on that had been extended by Prime Minister Modi.



 So they obviously have a strong working relationship, and we're in conve=
rsations with them about scheduling a visit.



 Tim.



 Q There was an airstrike in Aleppo, Syria, on a hospital -- dozens of pa=
tients and doctors killed. Can you tell us anything about that, and who m=
ight have been responsible, and what it means for the pause?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, we strongly condemn the wave of airstrikes and s=
helling that have killed more than 60 people in Aleppo in just the last 2=
4 hours. We're particularly appalled by an airstrike on an MSF-supported =
hospital in Aleppo that killed at least 14 patients and three doctors, in=
cluding, reportedly, one of the last pediatricians in the city.=20



 This particular airstrike on the MSF-supported facility follows multiple=
 airstrikes over the course of this week that were reportedly carried out=
 by the Assad regime. In particular, we saw the Assad regime carry out a =
strike against a Syrian civil defense station in the town of Al-Atareb in=
 Aleppo Province. It's believed that five members of the civil defense ha=
ve been killed, and many more innocent people were injured.=20



 This attack fits the Assad regime's abhorrent pattern of striking first-=
responders. More than 100 first-responders have been killed in action, an=
d many are killed in what are often referred to as double-tap strikes, an=
d this is where after a strike has been carried out on a location, forces=
, including airplanes, will sometimes return to that location after first=
-responders have arrived to try to treat the injured and another strike i=
s carried out that results in first-responders themselves being victims.



 These tactics are abhorrent, they're immoral, but unfortunately they're =
entirely consistent with the actions that we've seen from the Assad regim=
e for quite some time. This does place even more pressure on an already f=
ragile cessation of hostilities. And it's the continued violation of that=
 cessation of hostilities by the Assad regime and supporting forces that =
is also having a negative impact on the political talks.=20



 The other concern that the United States and the international community=
 continues to have is how the violations of the cessation of hostilities =
are affecting the ability of the international community to provide much-=
needed humanitarian assistance to innocent Syrians who are caught in the =
crossfire there. When we initially brokered the cessation of hostilities =
a couple of months ago, we discussed how one of the potential important b=
enefits of implementing the cessation of hostilities was creating the spa=
ce for humanitarian relief and supplies to be delivered to these communit=
ies that have been under so much pressure for years now.



 So our concerns remain significant, and you'll recall that President Oba=
ma had an opportunity to speak with President Putin I guess a couple of w=
eeks ago now to reinforce our view that the Russian President should use =
his influence with the Assad regime to encourage them to live up to the c=
ommitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities.=
 And we certainly believe that there is more the Russians can do to affec=
t that result.



 Q Just to be clear, you're saying it's consistent with what the regime h=
as done, so this attack was likely the regime?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, this is an attack that just occurred overnight=
, so I can't offer up a full assessment. But it certainly is consistent w=
ith the kinds of tactics we've seen the Assad regime use all across the c=
ountry.



 Q And the U.N. has said that if the talks deteriorate, that President Pu=
tin and Obama should intervene. Is there any move towards them talking ag=
ain about that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any upcoming conversations to tell you a=
bout at this point. Obviously the United States is deeply engaged in enco=
uraging all parties to the cessation of hostilities to return to the nego=
tiating table. And President Obama talked about this at some length with =
the GCC partners, GCC countries that the President met with last week in =
Saudi Arabia. And the United States continues to use our influence to enc=
ourage the parties to participate in the talks constructively. And we bel=
ieve that there is more that the Russians can do to use their influence t=
o convince the Assad regime to abide by the cessation of hostilities and =
to facilitate constructive political negotiations.



 Q Just on the Trump speech yesterday, you don't have to watch the whole =
thing to determine that the allies are becoming a little bit less forthco=
ming with criticism of Trump. Is this a worry to the administration? As h=
e becomes more likely to become the nominee, our allies are becoming less=
 likely -- less vocal in criticizing him.



 MR. EARNEST: No, I don't know that there are many allies that have spent=
 a lot of time weighing in on the U.S. presidential race. I think they un=
derstand that certainly their opinion matters, but ultimately, the opinio=
n that matters the most is that of the voters. And as I mentioned before,=
 the voters across the country will consider the actions and policies and=
 priorities of all of the candidates as they decide who they want to supp=
ort to succeed President Obama. But, ultimately, that will be a decision =
for the American people to make.



 Michelle.



 Q While the President was traveling, I mean, just on that same subject, =
so he's in Britain, delivering his incredibly lengthy, detailed opinion o=
n a referendum that the British people will undertake. But when Cameron w=
as asked directly about Donald Trump and then later Merkel was asked, the=
y wouldn't say anything. And this was kind of in the spirit of let's all =
share our opinions with our allies. Is the administration disappointed th=
at they would say nothing to weigh in on the election in that way?



 MR. EARNEST: No, not at all. I think the President answered this pretty =
directly when he noted that when he was traveling to London, the supporte=
rs of the Brexit campaign were describing all sorts of views to the U.S. =
government about how we would react to the U.K. leaving the EU. And the P=
resident felt like it was appropriate, since the critics are offering up =
their view about what the United States should do, it only seems appropri=
ate that the President of the United States, while he's in the U.K., expl=
ain what the United States would do and how we would react to that partic=
ular situation.



 So I think that is what gives the President important credibility in exp=
laining to the British people as they consider this important decision ex=
actly how the United States would be affected. And the President did not =
somehow suggest that the British people should decide based on the U.S. v=
iew. In fact, the President made clear that this is a decision that Briti=
sh voters should make based on their own calculations about what's in the=
 best interest of their country. And that obvious acknowledgement -- or t=
he acknowledgement of the obvious sovereignty of the British government a=
nd the British people is something that the President pointed out on a nu=
mber of occasions.

 Q So when world leaders weigh in on the American election, is that helpf=
ul, harmful, or neither, do you think?

 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think ultimately it's up to them to decide what vie=
ws they want to share and what impact they expect those views will have. =
I think ultimately the American people will carefully consider the option=
s they have before them and express a preference.

 Q So if they had taken that -- in this big spirit of sharing our opinion=
s -- if they had taken that opportunity to slam Donald Trump, which was o=
bviously kind of the point of the question, would you have seen that as h=
elpful? Would you have preferred that they took that opportunity?

 MR. EARNEST: I think it would have depended entirely on what they had ch=
osen to say.

 Q And in his interview with The New York Times, the President said that =
he regretted not promoting better the country's economic recovery. If it =
had been promoted better, what exactly would that have looked like? In wh=
at ways would that have happened? And so is the administration doing that=
 now, and in what way?

 MR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, I think what the President was referring to=
 is something that he's observed before, which is that, in the earliest d=
ays of his presidency, the country was facing a historically dire economi=
c environment. And there were a variety of crises that were coming to a h=
ead all at the same time. You didnt just have the financial markets spira=
ling out of control; you had the U.S. housing market poised to fall off a=
 cliff. In some communities, I think it probably did; it could be describ=
ed as having fallen off a cliff.

 You had the U.S. auto industry on the verge of bankruptcy, potentially c=
osting a million jobs, and a variety of other measures related to job cre=
ation and economic growth were all moving rapidly in the wrong direction.=
 And the President and his team were rapidly responding to these crises a=
nd making difficult policy decisions that ultimately, seven years later, =
have yielded tremendous progress. At the time, there frankly wasnt the ti=
me and space to spend a whole lot of time selling publicly the wisdom of =
those policies. The President instead -- rather than being focused and co=
ncerned about the press coverage, 24 hours after the policy was announced=
 -- was much more focused on the economic impact of those policies over t=
he next several years. And by that measure, there is no denying the treme=
ndous success of this administration in responding to the largest economi=
c crisis in America in several generations.

 Q So is that selling of it happening now, as we lead up to an election?

 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I dont think I would describe it as selling, n=
o. I think that there is a desire on the part of the President and the re=
st of the administration to help the American people understand exactly w=
hat's happened over the last six or seven years. And the reason for that =
is simply we've seen what works. We understand that an economic approach =
that focuses on expanding economic opportunity for the middle class is th=
e best way to strengthen our economy and to ensure the strength of our ec=
onomy for future generations.=20

 And the President does want to make a powerful case to the American peop=
le that the strategy and approach that he took is the right one and, fran=
kly, is the strategy that future Presidents should follow, or at least sh=
ould be the basis of their approach as well. The reason I say that is, lo=
ok, the economy is a dynamic thing, so it's always going to change, and i=
t means that different Presidents are going to face different economic ch=
allenges. But in an approach that's rooted in growing our economy from th=
e middle out, focused on making investments in our workforce and not focu=
sed on retreating from the international community, looking for ways to b=
e good stewards of taxpayer dollars, reduce the deficit, but also invest =
in infrastructure and in clean energy -- that's a smart approach and one =
that has laid the groundwork for a strong recovery.=20

 And it's important for people to understand the linkage between those po=
licies and our recovery, because that's the best way for people to unders=
tand how future Presidents should approach these issues.

 Q And just very quickly, on the Aleppo bombing, is it too early to rule =
out that a U.S. plane was in the vicinity yesterday as Russia is saying, =
or can you rule that out?

 MR. EARNEST: I'd encourage you to check with the Department of Defense o=
n that. They can give you some updated information. I certainly have not =
heard anything to lend any credibility to that kind of a statement, but c=
heck with DOD.

 Q Okay. And former Speaker Boehner is saying that Ted Cruz is "Lucifer i=
n the flesh." (Laughter.) Is that helpful, harmful? Does the President ag=
ree with that? What's your reaction to it?

 MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously Speaker Boehner was speaking based on his o=
wn experience. (Laughter.) And Im not sure that he was trying to do -- I =
dont know that he was looking to be helpful or harmful; I think he was ju=
st looking to be honest about his own view.

Q Just being honest. But when words like that are used and phrases and de=
scriptions are thrown out there, as they have been in this election, do y=
ou consider that crossing a line?



MR. EARNEST: Look, I think if youre looking for somebody to come to the d=
efense of one Republican whos being attacked by another, you should proba=
bly ask somebody else.



Olivier.



Q I have a couple for you. One is, a doctor recently reported that CENTCO=
Ms new report on the bombing in Kunduz is going to come out tomorrow nigh=
t. Has the President been briefed on the new CENTCOM report? Has it alter=
ed his understanding of what happened in that incident?



MR. EARNEST: Olivier, as you know, there has been a long-running investig=
ation that was conducted by the Department of Defense I believe out of Ce=
ntral Command to investigate this terrible tragedy in Kunduz. I dont know=
 at this point whether or not the President has been recently updated on =
that ongoing investigation, but it obviously has been going on for some t=
ime no. And when the results are made available, theyll be made available=
 to the public by the Department of Defense. And Im confident that the Pr=
esident will at least be briefed on the findings, if not actually read th=
e report himself.



Q Okay. And then the second one is back in 2013 at the National Defense U=
niversity, the President talked about refining and ultimately repealing t=
he 2001 AUMF. Im wondering, under what circumstances could that actually =
happen now in the remaining months that he has in office? What series of =
steps do you see as necessary in order to be able to do that?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, this was part of the strategy that we laid ou=
t -- I guess it was at the beginning of last year -- for congressional pa=
ssage of a new authorization to use military force against ISIL.=20



What we had suggested that Congress should do is pass a new authorization=
 to use military force that would cover our actions against ISIL. That wo=
uld allow Congress to then take the step of repealing the 2002 AUMF, and =
further refine the 2001 AUMF in a way that would more narrowly tailor the=
 authorization that had been given to the executive branch. So thats the =
approach that we took. We actually sent up legislative language that woul=
d have effected all of these changes. But the President also asked senior=
 members of his national security team to travel up to Capitol Hill and t=
estify under oath on camera, before Congress, to encourage them to take t=
hese steps. But unfortunately, like so many other things we think that Co=
ngress should so obviously do, Republicans have failed to act.



Q But just to be totally clear, unless theres a new ISIL AUMF you cant do=
 away with 2001, right? Thats your current understanding of the --



MR. EARNEST: Well, what we have said, Olivier, is that the actions that t=
he President has already ordered against ISIL -- and these are the action=
s that weve taken in both Iraq and in Syria -- and I believe even some of=
 the actions that weve taken in other places, including, like, Libya -- a=
re covered by the 2001 AUMF. The 2001 AUMF does refer to al Qaeda, and th=
ere still are places around the world where there are al Qaeda networks t=
hat -- where the United States is taking action to limit their threat to =
the United States.=20



So we do believe that we still need to have the authority to degrade and =
ultimately destroy ISIL, and, where necessary, continue to apply pressure=
 to al Qaeda affiliates around the globe. So we do believe that authoriza=
tion is necessary. We believe that authorization could be given in a way =
thats much more narrowly tailored than it currently is under the 2001 aut=
horization to use military force.



Pam.



Q Josh, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley was on Capitol Hill this morn=
ing testifying against bringing in Guantanamo inmates to South Carolina, =
saying it would harm the business climate and tourism, and make South Car=
olina a target for terrorists. And also, in Colorado, there was a bill de=
feated that would have gone on record opposing any inmates going there, b=
ut even some Democrats there dont want inmates transferred. So what are t=
he chances that the President can follow through on his plan to close tha=
t prison?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Pam, were going to continue to make a forceful case to=
 Congress that the most effective way to deal with the prison at Guantana=
mo Bay is to seek to transfer those individuals who can be safely transfe=
rred under the right security constraints to other countries, and bring t=
he remaining number of inmates to a secure facility in the United States =
where they can be prevented from harming the American people, and where, =
in many cases, they can be brought to justice.



The truth is there are dozens of dangerous, convicted terrorists who are =
on American soil in American prisons right now. That doesnt pose an undue=
 threat to the American people. It doesnt make any state a target. What i=
t does demonstrate is that the United States of America can live up to ou=
r values that we seek to advance all around the world even as we protect =
the American homeland. And that consistency is powerful.=20



Whats also powerful is the inconsistency of the situation at the prison a=
t Guantanamo Bay right now. And we know that there are extremist organiza=
tions that use the continued operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay as=
 a recruiting tool.



 We also know that continuing to operate the prison at Guantanamo Bay is =
a waste of money. We could detain those individuals in a much more cost-e=
ffective, efficient fashion in the United States than we currently do at =
Guantanamo Bay. So both for reasons related to taxpayer dollars and to na=
tional security, it's not just the President who is making this argument;=
 it's his predecessor, a Republican President made this argument. The for=
eign policy experts on both sides of the aisle have made this argument. R=
etired military leaders who devoted a significant portion of their career=
 to keeping the American people safe agree with this argument. So we're g=
oing to continue to make our case to Congress and we're still pressing ah=
ead because this is a top priority.



 Q Given the fact that Congress has banned transferring prisoners back he=
re, does the President believe he has an executive authority to somehow m=
ove them to a military base?



 MR. EARNEST: What we're focused on right now, Pam, is pursuing an option=
 that doesn't really require a whole lot of congressional approval or coo=
rdination, it just requires Congress to get out of the way. Congress has =
erected barriers that have prevented the administration from taking commo=
n-sense steps that would achieve this goal, and we're just asking Congres=
s to take them away.



 Kevin.



 Q Can I take that a step farther? What would happen, then -- were you su=
ccessful in emptying the prison -- to the facility there, the land there?=




 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think at that point, you'd have to talk to the Depa=
rtment of Defense about how to most effectively make use of that facility=
. We obviously would not transfer prisoners or detainees there, but this =
is military land that's controlled by the United States.



 Q And there would be no interest in ceding it back to the Cuban governme=
nt?



 MR. EARNEST: No, we've ruled that out.



 Q Okay, good. I want to ask you about home-ownership rates. They're down=
 near a 48-year lows. Does the President view that in a positive light, i=
nsomuch as there's more stabilization, there's less risk, perhaps, in the=
 marketplace, or is it a negative that fewer Americans are participating =
in the so-called American Dream of home ownership?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen those latest statistics. I can tell yo=
u that, obviously, we have seen home prices rise significantly over the l=
ast few years. That has obviously enhanced the wealth of a lot of America=
ns who have their household wealth tied up in the value of their home.



 Q Or in some cases replenished the wealth that they lost.



 MR. EARNEST: That's true, in some cases, there were homeowners who saw t=
he value of their home plunge under water, which is to say the value of t=
heir home was less than the value of their mortgage. But we have seen the=
 housing market recover quite strongly in a number of communities across =
the country, and that's been a good thing. That's good for the local econ=
omy precisely because there are so many middle-class families who have th=
eir wealth tied up in their homes.



 Q But does the President think lower home-ownership rates is, in general=
, a good thing, or not a good thing?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously families themselves have to make these deci=
sions. I just can't give you a specific analysis of the numbers because I=
 haven't seen them.



 Q Okay, cool. Puerto Rico, I want to ask you about the so-called super b=
ailout, super Chapter 9, super bankruptcy, whatever the latest descriptor=
 is. What is the President's plan to advance the football on this? Becaus=
e the clock is ticking.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think this will give me a good opportunity to make =
clear it's not a bailout. So people who say that that's the case are wron=
g. And I suspect in many cases they have an ulterior financial motive tha=
t is not consistent with the best interest of the United States.



 The fact of the matter is the administration put forward a very specific=
 plan back on October 21st of last year -- 190 days ago -- laying out exa=
ctly what we believe should be done to address the situation in Puerto Ri=
co. Again, it was not a proposed bailout, it actually was a proposal to g=
ive the Puerto Rican government exactly the same kind of restructuring au=
thority that local cities across the country have.=20



 What it also would do, it would also bring some accountability to ensure=
 that the Puerto Rican government was also implementing the kinds of fisc=
al reforms that would be taken in the context of this kind of restructuri=
ng. There are other things that would improve the economic situation in P=
uerto Rico that we have proposed that would have a corresponding positive=
 impact on their fiscal situation, so we have also suggested that we shou=
ld reform Puerto Rico's Medicaid program and that we should give Puerto R=
ico access to the earned-income tax credit. The earned-income tax credit,=
 of course, is something that many Republicans have acknowledged can be e=
ffective in stimulating economic growth and fighting poverty. It sounds l=
ike a pretty good recipe for addressing the tough situation in Puerto Ric=
o.



 Look, we're talking about 3 million Americans that live in Puerto Rico, =
and right now you've got Republicans who have essentially turned a blind =
eye to their plight. And the longer that Republicans put off finding this=
 solution, the more likely it becomes that they'll have to resort to a ba=
ilout. Those are just the facts. And that's why the administration contin=
ues to make a strong case that Congress should act now. In fact, they sho=
uld have acted months ago to address this situation so that Puerto Rico c=
ould get their finances under control, so that we could make sure that th=
e situation in Puerto Rico doesn't deteriorate even further.=20



Here's one other thing that we know, just to make this even more complica=
ted. We know that there are a lot of Americans who travel regularly to Pu=
erto Rico because they have family there or they're going to vacation the=
re, and we know that the Zika virus is in Puerto Rico. And because of the=
 fiscal challenges that the government is having there, that it's having =
a negative impact on the public health system in Puerto Rico.=20



 So we need to address this -- there are a variety of reasons that we nee=
d to address this situation, and the problem only gets worse as Republica=
ns in Congress drag their feet.



 Q Is the President in conversation with Speaker Ryan, for example, on th=
is?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont have any recent presidential-level conversations to =
tell you about. But the White House has been in touch with, on a regular =
basis over the last 190 days, with members of Congress in both parties to=
 try to advance a solution here.

 Q Just a couple more. On the Vice President's trip to Iraq, this follows=
 visit by your Defense Secretary, your Secretary of State, as well. I thi=
nk there might be some who would look at that and say, well, it must be p=
retty bad if all these high-level people are going over there. How concer=
ned is the President at the deterioration of Iraq? Or am I over-reading t=
hat?

 MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, you heard the President in Riyadh talk about h=
is concern about the tough political situation inside of Iraq right now. =
The good news is, just in the last 24 or 36 hours, we did see the Iraqi p=
arliament move to confirm a majority of appointees that Prime Minister Ab=
adi had made to his cabinet. That's good news. And that is sort of a welc=
ome -- that's welcome progress when it comes to pursuing the kinds of pol=
itical reforms that Prime Minister Abadi has identified as critical to ef=
fectively governing the country.

 What's also true, Kevin, is we've also seen some important progress over=
 the last several months in rolling back ISIL from territory in Iraq that=
 they previously controlled. And that progress was the result of intensiv=
e coordination between Iraqi forces and coalition forces. And the Preside=
nt has rolled out some ideas in just the last couple of weeks about how t=
o further intensify that coordination and that cooperation. And that Pres=
ident is hopeful that Iraqi forces will continue to make progress in layi=
ng the groundwork to eventually drive ISIL out of the second-largest city=
 in Iraq.

 Q Last one. What does the President believe about this idea of the bison=
 becoming the de facto mammal of the United States of America? (Laughter.=
)=20

 MR. EARNEST: I've seen some of the reporting on this, but I have not see=
n --

 Q (Inaudible) Buffalo -- this is important to me.=20

 MR. EARNEST: Oh, I can imagine that that would be the case. But I havent=
 heard the President weigh in with a view. But maybe somebody will have a=
n opportunity to ask him at some point.

 John.

 Q The House Armed Services Committee voted yesterday to approve an amend=
ment -- a very tight vote, 32-30 -- that would require women to register =
for the selective service. Does the Commander-in-Chief believe that he wo=
uld sign that legislation if it reaches his desk?

 MR. EARNEST: Well, John, that's a good question. Obviously this is an is=
sue that is going to attract a lot of attention, and understandably so. T=
here's not much that I can say about it, however, because this is the sub=
ject of some ongoing litigation. You've seen recent announcements from th=
e Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, that would give more women who are in=
 the military the opportunity to defend their country in more roles. And =
the President obviously has welcomed that progress. He certainly believes=
 that makes our fighting forces even stronger.

 And the other thing that we know to be true is that men and women have s=
erved in our all-volunteer force, in both Iraq and in Afghanistan, with d=
istinction and with courage and with bravery. And it's because of their s=
ervice and their sacrifice -- both men and women -- that we're safer, and=
 that we enjoy so many of the freedoms that are easy to take for granted.=
 The President certainly does not take them for granted. And the Presiden=
t has often talked about how serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the Uni=
ted States military is the greatest honor. And that certainly is true bec=
ause of the service and sacrifice that American men and women have made i=
n our military.

 Q Has it given him any pause to think that perhaps his daughters would h=
ave to sign up for selective service?

 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, at this point I can't weigh in on the specific=
 proposal just because it is a subject of litigation.

 Q More generally then, Charlie Rangel, pretty much every year that he's =
been in Congress, has called to reinstitute the draft vote. Does the Pres=
ident support that?

 MR. EARNEST: Well, I havent heard the President articulate his support f=
or that. Obviously, we do have a system. Currently, the U.S. military fun=
ctions at a high level, even though it is an all-volunteer force. And lik=
e I said, the President is quite proud of the service and bravery and pro=
fessionalism of our all-volunteer force. And even in some very difficult =
situations, men and women of the United States military have demonstrated=
 their mettle. But at this point, I have not heard the President express =
support for that proposal.

 Q And then a small follow-up on the 2001 AUMF. We talked about the autho=
rity to fight al Qaeda wherever it may be, whether it's Libya or Afghanis=
tan.

 MR. EARNEST: Yemen.

 Q Yemen. What about Bangladesh? There was that horrific killing over the=
 last weekend that we spoke about a few days ago. Al Qaeda claimed respon=
sibility for that. Does the President feel that he's got the authority to=
 go there and maybe approve an airstrike or something?



MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously Im not going to talk about any operations th=
at may be contemplated by the President or his national security team. I =
can just tell you that the President takes very seriously the responsibil=
ity that he has as the Commander-in-Chief to order the United States mili=
tary to take action and protect the American people. And the President ha=
s not hesitated to do that.



There are a variety of circumstances in a variety of countries where he h=
as asked our men and women to go into harms way to protect us. And were c=
oming up on the fifth anniversary of the President ordering the operation=
 to take Osama bin Laden off the battlefield. Obviously, that mission was=
 successful, again, because of the courage and bravery and enormous skill=
 of our men and women in uniform.=20



And the President wont hesitate. And I think thats as clear an example as=
 you could ask for of the President not hesitating to take the steps that=
 he believes are necessary as Commander-in-Chief to protect the American =
people.



Tara.



Q I have a question about Aleppo. You talked about what the Russians can =
do or should be doing. And in the past, U.S. officials have talked about =
the presence of al-Nusra Front, and about how Russians have gone after th=
em. And since they fall outside of the ceasefire, it makes the situation =
more complicated. So Im wondering what message the U.S. is sending to Rus=
sians in terms of the bombings and what should be done.



MR. EARNEST: Well, the message that were sending to the Russians is a dir=
ect one, and that is that they need to abide by the cessation of hostilit=
ies that they signed onto, and they need to use their influence with the =
Assad regime to do the same.=20



The United States has certainly fulfilled our commitment to doing that, b=
oth in terms of our own actions, but also in terms of using our leverage =
with other parties to abide by the cessation of hostilities. The reason t=
hat we have done that is because it is critical for these political talks=
 to progress. And one of the goals of the cessation of hostilities was to=
 reduce the violence so that the political conversations could move forwa=
rd. And we have seen the political talks waver because a cessation of hos=
tilities has been increasingly fragile.



So we continue to be quite concerned about the situation, and we continue=
 to impress upon the Russians the priority that we believe they should pl=
ace on the successful implementation of the cessation of hostilities.



Let me also say that we acknowledge that the situation on the ground in S=
yria is chaotic. Its complicated. And there are situations where there ar=
e forces like Nusra who are not part of the cessation of hostilities wher=
e their forces get comingled with forces that are part of the cessation o=
f hostilities.



So that is what is going to prevent the clean implementation of the cessa=
tion of hostilities. We acknowledge that there are going to be some compl=
ications. And even in the run-up to the implementation of the cessation o=
f hostilities, we acknowledged that there would be some bumps in the road=
. We acknowledged that there were likely to be some violations. We acknow=
ledged there would likely be some ambiguity. In fact, the cessation inclu=
des a mechanism for evaluating potential violations to try to remove the =
ambiguity of the situation and get to the bottom of what exactly is happe=
ning.



So as with everything in Syria, its complicated. But whats not complicate=
d is the way that the United States has prioritized the successful implem=
entation of the cessation of hostilities. And whats not complicated is th=
e message that we have delivered to the Russians that they should use the=
ir influence with the Assad regime and communicate the same message.



Christi.



Q Thanks, Josh.



MR. EARNEST: Looks like you have some help today. (Laughter.)=20



Q I do. Its Take Your Reporter To Work Day, or "Child Reporter To Work Da=
y."=20



MR. EARNEST: Excellent.



Q She has a burning question for you about equal pay in soccer. (Laughter=
.) You can think about that for a minute.=20



MR. EARNEST: Yes, I think the President has spoken pretty powerfully toda=
y.



Q He did. He sounded like he was kind of outraged on behalf of the women.=
=20



MR. EARNEST: Yes.



Q All right. A quick follow-up on the draft. You said the President hasnt=
 expressed support, but has he ruled it out? You sounded a little more op=
en to it than I expected.



MR. EARNEST: Well, I just meant to convey that I havent heard him weigh i=
n publicly on this. And so I think -- I was just trying answer the questi=
on in the spirit in which John offered it, which was does the President s=
upport it, and I havent heard him say that he supports it. But Im not try=
ing to signal any new openness to a proposal like that.



Q Okay. On the accidental bombing at the MSF hospital in Afghanistan, wou=
ld the President be satisfied to learn that that had resulted only in one=
 suspension and a few reprimands by letter? Would that send a strong enou=
gh message about how seriously the U.S. takes this incident?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Christi, Im not going to prejudge the outcome at this =
point. There obviously is an independent investigation thats been conduct=
ed. And over the last several months that this investigation has been con=
ducted, weve gone to great lengths to try to protect the independence of =
the investigation.=20



So Im reluctant to comment in much detail on it until the results have be=
en produced. But the President was direct in the immediate aftermath of t=
his incident that accountability is important. And that is something that=
 was communicated to the military leadership, and they have undertaken th=
is independent investigation because they recognize that accountability i=
s important as well. But Im not going to prejudge the outcome of the inve=
stigation at this point.



Q Many international aid organizations had specifically asked that crimin=
al charges be seriously considered. Do you know if the President specific=
ally asked the Pentagon to look at that?



MR. EARNEST: The President has also respected the independent nature of t=
he investigation and has not insisted upon one course or the other when i=
t comes to conducting the investigation.=20



Q But the President hasnt been informed of an outcome, is that right?



MR. EARNEST: Thats my understanding. Im certainly not aware that he has b=
een at this point.



Ron.



Q Just on that issue, the main concern of MSF when that happened was that=
 they alleged it was a war crime, specifically a war crime. Is that claim=
 going to be addressed, do you think?



MR. EARNEST: I dont know what will be included in the findings of the rep=
ort. But once a report has been issued, I know that the Department of Def=
ense is planning to make as much of that report public as they can. And s=
o well have an opportunity to evaluate what they considered.



Q And again, do you know specifically if the issue of a war crime was com=
municated to the military by the President or anybody else as a matter of=
 investigation? I guess the question essentially -- was it taken that ser=
iously by the Pentagon whether or not a war crime was committed?



MR. EARNEST: Well, what I know is that this is an investigation that the =
Department of Defense did take very seriously. And I know the President i=
s interested in understanding the results of the investigation. But in te=
rms of how the investigation was conducted, I'd refer you to the Departme=
nt of Defense. And I suspect it will be a little easier for them to have =
that conversation with you once a report has been issued.



 Q So one thing. Tomorrow there's a smart gun technology issue, there's a=
 proposal. There's what exactly tomorrow?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously we'll have more that we can talk about tomo=
rrow. The President announced earlier this year a whole set of executive =
actions to try to make our communities safer from gun violence. And under=
 discussion was exploring what kind of technology could be effectively us=
ed to make guns safer. And so this is something that a variety of federal=
 agencies have reviewed, and they'll have some findings to share.



 Q So this is going to be a report of findings, not necessarily an admini=
strative requirement to do something, or an order?



 MR. EARNEST: Once we've made an announcement, we can evaluate exactly wh=
at the request is.



 Q Is there anything else from the gun smart -- the common-sense, as you =
call it, gun control front that we can expect any time soon?



 MR. EARNEST: Nothing that I have to give you a head's up on right now.



 Cheryl.



 Q Thanks, Josh. Congress is about to take a week recess, and there's bee=
n little process on the Zika funding supplemental. Is there a particular =
timeline? Do you have to have a certain amount of funding by a certain ti=
me?



 MR. EARNEST: Cheryl, the thing that we know is that as we get closer to =
the summer, the risk from the Zika virus only increases. And it's a shame=
 that Republicans in Congress have refused to move the ball forward in gi=
ving our public health professionals the resources that they need to prot=
ect the American people from Zika. This is a public health emergency -- t=
hat's what our public health experts have told us. They don't have a poli=
tical agenda; they're just trying to keep people safe and healthy. And fo=
r some reason, that doesn't appear to be high on the agenda of congressio=
nal Republicans. If it were, this is the kind of supplemental funding pac=
kage that should be able to pass pretty quickly.



 Let me give you a -- there's a relevant example that I would cite for yo=
u. In 2009, there were significant concerns about an H1-N1 flu pandemic h=
aving a significant impact on the United States. When Democrats were in c=
harge of the Congress, they acted rather quickly to appropriate more than=
 $7 billion to ensure that the country could prepare for that kind of pan=
demic. I would point out that this was something that was referred to as =
a no-year spending request that we put forward; there were not constraint=
s about which fiscal year it would apply to.



 And I know this is just the latest excuse that we've heard from Republic=
ans about why they haven't acted. They've suggested that they need a more=
 detailed breakdown of which fiscal year the funding would be used. The t=
ruth is, we can't fund the fight against Zika a few months at a time. In =
order to effectively, for example, develop and test and manufacture a vac=
cine that can be used to protect more than 300 million American citizens,=
 that's a multiyear effort that we're talking about. And that's an undert=
aking that the private sector will have to commit to.



 So if we're going to ask the private sector to commit to a multiyear eff=
ort to develop a vaccine, then Congress needs to make a commitment to a m=
ultiyear effort to fund it. That's the way that we're going to protect th=
e American people, and there's no reason that this should get bogged down=
 in the kind of political gamesmanship that Republicans, for some reason,=
 seem to delight in, even in the face of a public health emergency.



 Q I'm just wondering if there's any sort of deadline.



 MR. EARNEST: Look, I think in many ways you could say that the deadline =
for this funding has passed, because you had the director of the National=
 Institutes of Health standing at this podium three weeks ago, saying tha=
t he didn't have all of the resources that he felt like he needed to do e=
verything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. So=
 I think by that standard, which is an entirely reasonable one, Republica=
ns have missed the deadline, and that puts the American people at risk. A=
nd I don't know how they're going to explain it when they go on recess ne=
xt week.



 Chris.



 Q Josh, yesterday the governor of Tennessee signed into law a bill that =
would allow therapists to deny services based on s sincerely held belief =
that seemed to enable LGBT discrimination in the name of religious freedo=
m. You've spoken out against measures like this before. Do you have a rea=
ction to this one?



 MR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the details of this particular piece of legi=
slation. I can just tell you as a general matter, Chris, as you've heard =
me say on a number of occasions in the last few weeks, the administration=
 believes strongly in fairness, in equality, and justice. And we believe =
in bills that promote fairness, equality, and justice, and we are strongl=
y opposed to any legislative effort to undermine protections for any Amer=
ican. And I will acknowledge I'm not familiar with the intricacies of thi=
s particular legislation, but that principle is one that the President be=
lieves strongly in. And it's not just the way he evaluates federal measur=
es, but when we choose to weigh in on state and local matters, it's an im=
portant criteria.



 Q Coming off of the President's trip overseas last week, do these laws s=
eem to enable anti-LGBT discrimination in these states? Have they undermi=
ned U.S. efforts -- U.S. advocacy for LGBT and human rights overseas in p=
laces like Saudi Arabia?



 MR. EARNEST: Not when it comes to the President. The President continues=
 to be a forceful advocate for human rights everywhere he goes. He views =
that as part of the job description. And he also has his own personal con=
viction about a lot of these issues, and he's eager to use the platform o=
f the presidency of the United States to try to influence other countries=
 and to persuade them that respect for basic, universal human rights shou=
ld be a priority. And he certainly did make that case when he was in Saud=
i Arabia, and not for the first time, I would point out.



 Q Well, I just bring that up because during the news conference in Londo=
n, the President was asked to address the North Carolina and Mississippi =
laws, in response to the travel advisory that Britain has placed on North=
 Carolina and Mississippi as a result of those laws. And I'm just wonderi=
ng, in addition to that news conference, did these laws come up privately=
 at all with discussions with any of the leaders overseas?



 MR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of.



 Q And finally, are having these laws in place undermining efforts at the=
 domestic level, at the federal level to further advance LGBT rights such=
 as lifting the ban on transgender military service?



 MR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware of any impact that these state laws have =
had on those policies. So, no, I'm not aware of any impact it had.



 Q And just to be clear, you're not aware of any obstacles stopping, bloc=
king the change at the Pentagon to allow transgender military service, ot=
her than the process itself at the Pentagon?



 MR. EARNEST: That's right. There is this ongoing process, and I'm not aw=
are that the state law -- that any state law that's been passed has had a=
ny impact on it.



 Francesca. Nice to see you.



 Q Nice to see you as well. It's the White House Correspondents Dinner th=
is weekend. It's the President's last one.



 MR. EARNEST: So I've heard. (Laughter.)



 Q Yes, so you've heard. It's amazing how many people are in town all of =
a sudden. And it's the President's last one. And last year, at the dinner=
, he came up with a bucket list. And I was wondering how you think that t=
he President is doing on that bucket list -- and if you'd like, I can rem=
ind you of some of the things that were on it -- but also, what he might =
plan to add to that in his final year.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President has certainly enjoyed taking things off=
 his bucket list. I'm not aware of any recent additions to that list, but=
 we're always open to suggestions. So if you have any suggestions, send t=
hem my way. I'll make sure that they get into the proper hands.=20



 Q I'll come prepared tomorrow.



 MR. EARNEST: There you go. But look, the President is looking forward to=
 the dinner. He always enjoys the opportunity to spend some time deliveri=
ng a light-hearted speech for a change. And I know he's looking forward t=
o Saturday.



 Q Can you give us a preview? Any jokes?



 MR. EARNEST: Not at this point. That would spoil the surprise.=20



 Mike.



 Q On the Aleppo situation, as you noted, this hospital bombing, the late=
st atrocity committed apparently by the Assad regime, killed the last ped=
iatrician or one of the last pediatricians in Aleppo. It sort of raises t=
he question, once again, under what circumstances would the administratio=
n respond against the Assad regime for civilian casualties? Syrian civili=
an casualties? This is not like the U.S. bombing of the hospital in Kabul=
. There's a long history of the Assad regime not only disregarding civili=
an safety, but directly targeting civilians. So it's not like this might =
be a one-time accident. Under what circumstances would the U.S. consider =
making some sort of military response to a civilian atrocity committed by=
 the Assad regime? And are you developing options along those lines?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of consideration of any military respon=
se at this point as a result of this particular incident. I do think it u=
nderscores what you are noting, which is that the Assad regime, tragicall=
y, has a long history of using that country's military might to attack in=
nocent civilians. And it's why we have made a strong case that President =
Assad has lost the legitimacy to lead that country. How could you possibl=
y lead and unite a country whose citizens you've spent the better part of=
 five years attacking?=20



 So this actually reflects the failure of President Assad's political lea=
dership, because he's had to resort to using the military might of the co=
untry to attack his own constituents. So that's why we've made a strong c=
ase that President Assad needs to go, and Syrian leadership that actually=
 reflects the will of the Syrian people with the capacity to actually uni=
te the country to face down the threat that is posed by ISIL -- that's wh=
at's required. And that's what we are trying to bring about.



 But the process has been difficult, in part because we have seen countri=
es like Russia that have made a tragic decision to prop him up. And that =
has prolonged this conflict. And we have -- that's why we have continued =
to urge the Russians to pursue a different approach and to try to persuad=
e the Assad regime to, first of all, live up to the cessation of hostilit=
ies and stop targeting innocent people, but second of all, engage in the =
kind of political talks that are necessary to resolve the political turmo=
il inside of Syria. And thats the only way were going to be able to get a=
t the root of all that plagues Syria and all of the consequences that has=
 yielded.



Q Are there atrocities against civilians that would cause us to intervene=
 against the Assad regime directly?



MR. EARNEST: Its hard to entertain a hypothetical like that. But our prof=
ound concern about the humanitarian situation inside of Syria is well doc=
umented. And thats why the United States has been the largest bilateral d=
onor of humanitarian assistance. Because of assistance provided by the Un=
ited States, some humanitarian relief has been provided to people in Syri=
a who need it.=20



Its why the United States has been a strong advocate of the U.N.-facilita=
ted political talks to try to bring about the kind of political solution =
that would bring an end to the violence inside of Syria. Its why we have =
regularly been in touch with the Russians to encourage them to use their =
influence with the Assad regime to live up to the cessation of hostilitie=
s and engage in the political talks.



So the United States has been at the forefront of this effort to bring an=
 end to the violence for years. But whats happening in Syria is a genuine=
 tragedy, and millions of lives have been affected. And the United States=
 is well aware of that, and is playing a leading role in trying to resolv=
e the situation.



Goyal, Ill give you the last one.



Q Thank you. Two questions. One, let me go back to Prime Minister Modis v=
isit to the White House. So much has been going on and happening between =
the two countries, U.S. and India, so many high-level visits, including t=
he finance minister of India met with the Secretary of Treasury. And also=
, yesterday, foreign secretary of India met with the National Security Ad=
visor, Madam Rice. Did that meeting include the state visit of Prime Mini=
ster Modi to the White House?



MR. EARNEST: Well, we have been in discussions with our Indian counterpar=
ts about a potential visit of Prime Minister Modi to Washington. Those di=
scussions continue. I dont have any updates on them at this point. But ob=
viously the President values the working relationship he has with Prime M=
inister Modi, and I wouldnt rule out a potential visit.



Q And last time, when the President visited India, his goal to visit Agra=
, Taj Mahal. The people of Agra are still waiting for his visit, that if =
hes going to take the First Family to the Taj Mahal that he couldnt make =
last time because of Saudi Kings death.



MR. EARNEST: The President was quite disappointed to not have an opportun=
ity to visit the Taj Mahal on his last visit to India. As you point out, =
that had originally been part of the itinerary, but the President had to =
cut short his visit to India because of the untimely death of the King of=
 Saudi Arabia. So the President traveled to Saudi Arabia to pay his respe=
cts at that point.=20



I wish I could promise -- I think the President wishes I could promise th=
at he would have an opportunity to visit Taj Mahal before the end of his =
presidency, but Im not sure that will happen.



Q And second, last week at the Council on Foreign Affairs, they had a sum=
mit -- held a summit on diversity. And that was diverse panel and diverse=
 audience, and it was by the George Washington University's Elliott Schoo=
l. My question is, here -- that they had all these questions that -- how =
President Obama will put this diversity, because this is the most diverse=
 administration and diverse President. After he leaves office, what is th=
e future of diversity in America?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I will just say that one of the priorities that the Pr=
esident has identified for staffing the U.S. government is to do more to =
make sure that we have a government that reflects the diversity of our co=
untry. And by and large, the administration has been quite successful in =
that effort. And the President is proud of that record, both because of t=
he way it reflects the diversity of our country right now, but in some wa=
ys its even more important that the pipeline for talent has also been now=
 diversified; that so often, as people get promoted or considered for hig=
her-level openings, theres careful consideration of their experience. I t=
hink thats certainly an understandable thing for an employer to do.=20



Now you have a much more diversified workforce that has a much more diver=
sified set of experiences. And thats a good thing. And that means that ou=
r government has been diverse over the last eight years, but it means tha=
t our government is more likely to be diverse at higher levels for the ne=
xt generation because of those steps.



And the President would certainly be pleased if part of his legacy is tha=
t the higher levels of the U.S. government are more diverse 10, 15, 20 ye=
ars from now because of important early hiring decisions that were made d=
uring his presidency.



Q By the way, the Prime Minister Modi has a very high level of this admin=
istration of the President.



MR. EARNEST: The President certainly welcomes that affection.=20



Thanks, everybody. Well see you tomorrow.

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; Nice to see you all.&nb=

Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, thank you, Josh.&nbsp; Can you talk a bit about t=
he Vice President&#8217;s surprise trip to Baghdad today?&nbsp; What messag=
e is he delivering on the President&#8217;s behalf to Iraqi leaders?&nbsp; =
And what does the administration hope he&#8217;ll be able to accomplish?<o:=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Kevin, I think this is a good indication of the Un=
ited States&#8217; continued support for Prime Minister Abadi&#8217;s effor=
ts to unify the nation of Iraq to confront ISIL.&nbsp; And there are two cr=
itical priorities that Prime Minister Abadi has identified.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
The first is obviously the fight on the ground that Iraqi forces are waging=
 against ISIL inside of Iraq.&nbsp; That effort on the ground is strongly s=
upported by the United States and our coalition partners.&nbsp; The support=
 that we provide comes in a variety of forms.&nbsp;
 It includes airstrikes.&nbsp; It includes training.&nbsp; It includes equi=
pment.&nbsp; It includes advice and assistance from U.S. Special Operations=
 forces.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
The second priority that Prime Minister Abadi has identified is pursuing a =
set of political reforms to fight corruption.&nbsp; And building confidence=
 in the ability of Iraq&#8217;s central government to lead that country is =
critical.&nbsp; And the United States and our coalition
 partners are strongly supportive of Prime Minister&#8217;s Abadi&#8217;s e=
fforts to build a government that is capable, that&#8217;s honest, and that=
, most importantly, has the confidence of all of Iraq&#8217;s diverse popul=
ation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

So the vice presidential visit is an effort to underscore our support for P=
rime Minister Abadi&#8217;s commitment to those priorities.<o:p></o:p></p>

Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today&#8217;s GDP report indicates the economy grew by =
0.5 percent the first quarter.&nbsp; The President has been quite vocal abo=
ut how well the economy is doing.&nbsp; Does this report undercut those arg=
uments?&nbsp; And what does he think the federal government should be
 doing differently to rev up the economy during the remainder of his tenure=
?<o:p></o:p></p>

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Kevin, the strength of the U.S. economy I think speaks f=
or itself when you take a look at the numbers.&nbsp; Obviously, the numbers=
 that we&#8217;re most attuned to are the jobs numbers.&nbsp; And the U.S. =
economy is currently on the longest streak of private
 sector job growth in our nation&#8217;s history -- 73 consecutive months, =
for a total of 14.4 million private sector jobs.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a remar=
kable streak, and demonstrate the resilience of the U.S. economy.<o:p></o:p=

The durability of the U.S. economy is the envy of the world.&nbsp; And ther=
e&#8217;s no denying the important progress that we&#8217;ve made in diggin=
g out of the hole created by the worst economic downturn since the Great De=
pression.&nbsp;

But of course there&#8217;s more that we believe should be done.&nbsp; The =
President has spent years making the case to Republicans in Congress that t=
here is more that could be done that would strengthen our economy, expand e=
conomic opportunity for the middle class, and
 lay a foundation for our nation&#8217;s long-term strength for the decades=
 ahead.&nbsp; And that includes investments in infrastructure.&nbsp; The Pr=
esident is quoted in a story today talking about how, frankly, the United S=
tates missed an opportunity over the last couple
 of years to make critical investments in infrastructure while interest rat=
es were low, while the construction sector was not as strong as it previous=
ly was.&nbsp;

And it&#8217;s unfortunate that years have gone by where that opportunity h=
as been missed.&nbsp; But the President -- they weren&#8217;t missed becaus=
e the President wasn&#8217;t encouraging Congress to take that action.&nbsp=
; Frankly, the reason that opportunity was missed was because
 of Republicans&#8217; stubborn refusal to consider any priority that Presi=
dent Obama has identified.&nbsp; That&#8217;s unfortunate.<o:p></o:p></p>

And the President has also been a strong advocate of raising the minimum wa=
ge.&nbsp; That certainly would bring more fairness to our economy, particul=
arly for hardworking Americans.&nbsp; At the current level of the minimum w=
age, the average person who&#8217;s working full
 time being paid minimum wage and raising a family of four is doing so belo=
w the poverty line.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not fair.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not good =
for our economy.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s inconsistent with the strategy that t=
he President has laid out to grow our economy from the middle out.<o:p></o:=

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think what we feel good about are the longer-term tren=

even taking a look at the most persistent components of output, which are c=

 by 2.6 percent over the last four quarters.&nbsp; That an indication of a =
durable economy demonstrating some resilience.&nbsp;

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, there is no denying that there are a wide variety =
of economic indicators that would be stronger if Republicans in Congress ha=

As the Vice President himself often says, we know we need it.&nbsp; It&#821=

t projects that would improve our economy and improve quality
 of life here in the United States.&nbsp; A whole host of road and bridge p=
rojects, airport upgrades, even laying new rail lines that would improve th=
e economy and improve the quality of life in communities all across the cou=

 well spent in this projects.&nbsp; It also would stimulate economic growth=

 The President had a long meeting with Prime Minister Modi in the context o=

just last month.&nbsp; And, of course, President
 Obama at the beginning of last year had an opportunity to be the guest of =

bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Tim, we strongly condemn th=
e wave of airstrikes and shelling that have killed more than 60 people in A=
leppo in just the last 24 hours.&nbsp; We're particularly appalled
 by an airstrike on an MSF-supported hospital in Aleppo that killed at leas=
t 14 patients and three doctors, including, reportedly, one of the last ped=
iatricians in the city.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This particular airstrike on the MSF-supported facil=
ity follows multiple airstrikes over the course of this week that were repo=
rtedly carried out by the Assad regime.&nbsp; In particular,
 we saw the Assad regime carry out a strike against a Syrian civil defense =
station in the town of Al-Atareb in Aleppo Province.&nbsp; It's believed th=
at five members of the civil defense have been killed, and many more innoce=
nt people were injured.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This attack fits the Assad regime's abhorrent patter=
n of striking first-responders.&nbsp; More than 100 first-responders have b=
een killed in action, and many are killed in what are often referred
 to as double-tap strikes, and this is where after a strike has been carrie=
d out on a location, forces, including airplanes, will sometimes return to =
that location after first-responders have arrived to try to treat the injur=
ed and another strike is carried
 out that results in first-responders themselves being victims.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These tactics are abhorrent, they're immoral, but un=
fortunately they're entirely consistent with the actions that we've seen fr=
om the Assad regime for quite some time.&nbsp; This does place
 even more pressure on an already fragile cessation of hostilities.&nbsp; A=
nd it's the continued violation of that cessation of hostilities by the Ass=
ad regime and supporting forces that is also having a negative impact on th=
e political talks.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other concern that the United States and the int=
ernational community continues to have is how the violations of the cessati=
on of hostilities are affecting the ability of the international
 community to provide much-needed humanitarian assistance to innocent Syria=
ns who are caught in the crossfire there.&nbsp; When we initially brokered =
the cessation of hostilities a couple of months ago, we discussed how one o=
f the potential important benefits of
 implementing the cessation of hostilities was creating the space for human=
itarian relief and supplies to be delivered to these communities that have =
been under so much pressure for years now.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So our concerns remain significant, and you'll recal=
l that President Obama had an opportunity to speak with President Putin I g=
uess a couple of weeks ago now to reinforce our view that
 the Russian President should use his influence with the Assad regime to en=
courage them to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of=
 the cessation of hostilities.&nbsp; And we certainly believe that there is=
 more the Russians can do to affect that
 result.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to be clear, you're saying =
it's consistent with what the regime has done, so this attack was likely th=
e regime?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, again, this is an attack th=
at just occurred overnight, so I can't offer up a full assessment.&nbsp; Bu=
t it certainly is consistent with the kinds of tactics we've seen
 the Assad regime use all across the country.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the U.N. has said that if th=
e talks deteriorate, that President Putin and Obama should intervene.&nbsp;=
 Is there any move towards them talking again about that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I don't have any upcoming c=
onversations to tell you about at this point.&nbsp; Obviously the United St=
ates is deeply engaged in encouraging all parties to the cessation
 of hostilities to return to the negotiating table.&nbsp; And President Oba=
ma talked about this at some length with the GCC partners, GCC countries th=
at the President met with last week in Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; And the United S=
tates continues to use our influence to encourage
 the parties to participate in the talks constructively.&nbsp; And we belie=
ve that there is more that the Russians can do to use their influence to co=
nvince the Assad regime to abide by the cessation of hostilities and to fac=
ilitate constructive political negotiations.<o:p></o:p></p>

bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on the Trump speech yesterd=
ay, you don't have to watch the whole thing to determine that the allies ar=
e becoming a little bit less forthcoming with criticism of Trump.&nbsp; Is =
this
 a worry to the administration?&nbsp; As he becomes more likely to become t=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, I don't know that there are m=
any allies that have spent a lot of time weighing in on the U.S. presidenti=
al race.&nbsp; I think they understand that certainly their opinion
 matters, but ultimately, the opinion that matters the most is that of the =
voters.&nbsp; And as I mentioned before, the voters across the country will=
 consider the actions and policies and priorities of all of the candidates =
as they decide who they want to support
 to succeed President Obama.&nbsp; But, ultimately, that will be a decision=
 for the American people to make.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the President was travelin=
g, I mean, just on that same subject, so he's in Britain, delivering his in=
credibly lengthy, detailed opinion on a referendum that the British people
 will undertake.&nbsp; But when Cameron was asked directly about Donald Tru=
mp and then later Merkel was asked, they wouldn't say anything.&nbsp; And t=
his was kind of in the spirit of let's all share our opinions with our alli=
es.&nbsp; Is the administration disappointed that
 they would say nothing to weigh in on the election in that way?<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, not at all.&nbsp; I think the=
 President answered this pretty directly when he noted that when he was tra=
veling to London, the supporters of the Brexit campaign were describing
 all sorts of views to the U.S. government about how we would react to the =
U.K. leaving the EU.&nbsp; And the President felt like it was appropriate, =
since the critics are offering up their view about what the United States s=
hould do, it only seems appropriate that
 the President of the United States, while he's in the U.K., explain what t=
he United States would do and how we would react to that particular situati=
on.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think that is what gives the President importan=
t credibility in explaining to the British people as they consider this imp=
ortant decision exactly how the United States would be affected.&nbsp;
 And the President did not somehow suggest that the British people should d=
ecide based on the U.S. view.&nbsp; In fact, the President made clear that =
this is a decision that British voters should make based on their own calcu=
lations about what's in the best interest
 of their country.&nbsp; And that obvious acknowledgement -- or the acknowl=
edgement of the obvious sovereignty of the British government and the Briti=
sh people is something that the President pointed out on a number of occasi=
ons.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when world leaders weigh in o=
n the American election, is that helpful, harmful, or neither, do you think=
?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I think ultimately it's up =
to them to decide what views they want to share and what impact they expect=
 those views will have.&nbsp; I think ultimately the American people
 will carefully consider the options they have before them and express a pr=
eference.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if they had taken that -- in =
this big spirit of sharing our opinions -- if they had taken that opportuni=
ty to slam Donald Trump, which was obviously kind of the point of the quest=
ion,
 would you have seen that as helpful?&nbsp; Would you have preferred that t=
hey took that opportunity?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think it would have depended en=
tirely on what they had chosen to say.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in his interview with The Ne=
w York Times, the President said that he regretted not promoting better the=
 country's economic recovery.&nbsp; If it had been promoted better, what ex=
actly
 would that have looked like?&nbsp; In what ways would that have happened?&=
nbsp; And so is the administration doing that now, and in what way?<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Michelle, I think what the =
President was referring to is something that he's observed before, which is=
 that, in the earliest days of his presidency, the country was
 facing a historically dire economic environment.&nbsp; And there were a va=
riety of crises that were coming to a head all at the same time.&nbsp; You =
didn&#8217;t just have the financial markets spiraling out of control; you =
had the U.S. housing market poised to fall off a
 cliff.&nbsp; In some communities, I think it probably did; it could be des=
cribed as having fallen off a cliff.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had the U.S. auto industry on the verge of bankr=
uptcy, potentially costing a million jobs, and a variety of other measures =
related to job creation and economic growth were all moving
 rapidly in the wrong direction.&nbsp; And the President and his team were =
rapidly responding to these crises and making difficult policy decisions th=
at ultimately, seven years later, have yielded tremendous progress.&nbsp; A=
t the time, there frankly wasn&#8217;t the time
 and space to spend a whole lot of time selling publicly the wisdom of thos=
e policies.&nbsp; The President instead -- rather than being focused and co=
ncerned about the press coverage, 24 hours after the policy was announced -=
- was much more focused on the economic
 impact of those policies over the next several years.&nbsp; And by that me=
asure, there is no denying the tremendous success of this administration in=
 responding to the largest economic crisis in America in several generation=
s.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is that selling of it happeni=
ng now, as we lead up to an election?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, again, I don&#8217;t think =
I would describe it as selling, no.&nbsp; I think that there is a desire on=
 the part of the President and the rest of the administration to help the
 American people understand exactly what's happened over the last six or se=
ven years.&nbsp; And the reason for that is simply we've seen what works.&n=
bsp; We understand that an economic approach that focuses on expanding econ=
omic opportunity for the middle class is the
 best way to strengthen our economy and to ensure the strength of our econo=
my for future generations.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the President does want to make a powerful case =
to the American people that the strategy and approach that he took is the r=
ight one and, frankly, is the strategy that future Presidents
 should follow, or at least should be the basis of their approach as well.&=
nbsp; The reason I say that is, look, the economy is a dynamic thing, so it=
's always going to change, and it means that different Presidents are going=
 to face different economic challenges.&nbsp;
 But in an approach that's rooted in growing our economy from the middle ou=
t, focused on making investments in our workforce and not focused on retrea=
ting from the international community, looking for ways to be good stewards=
 of taxpayer dollars, reduce the
 deficit, but also invest in infrastructure and in clean energy -- that's a=
 smart approach and one that has laid the groundwork for a strong recovery.=
&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it's important for people to understand the link=
age between those policies and our recovery, because that's the best way fo=
r people to understand how future Presidents should approach
 these issues.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just very quickly, on the Al=
eppo bombing, is it too early to rule out that a U.S. plane was in the vici=
nity yesterday as Russia is saying, or can you rule that out?<o:p></o:p></p=

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Olivier, as you know, there has been a long-running inve=

Central Command to investigate this terrible tragedy in Kunduz.&nbsp; I don=
&#8217;t know at this point whether or not the President
 has been recently updated on that ongoing investigation, but it obviously =
has been going on for some time no.&nbsp; And when the results are made ava=
ilable, they&#8217;ll be made available to the public by the Department of =
Defense.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m confident that the President
 will at least be briefed on the findings, if not actually read the report =

Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then the second one is back in 2013 at =
the National Defense University, the President talked about refining and ul=

cumstances could that actually happen now in the remaining months
 that he has in office?&nbsp; What series of steps do you see as necessary =
in order to be able to do that?<o:p></o:p></p>

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Olivier, this was part of the strategy that we lai=
d out -- I guess it was at the beginning of last year -- for congressional =
passage of a new authorization to use military force against ISIL.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
What we had suggested that Congress should do is pass a new authorization t=
o use military force that would cover our actions against ISIL.&nbsp; That =
would allow Congress to then take the step of repealing the 2002 AUMF, and =
further refine the 2001 AUMF in a way
 that would more narrowly tailor the authorization that had been given to t=
he executive branch.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s the approach that we took.&nbsp;=
 We actually sent up legislative language that would have effected all of t=
hese changes.&nbsp; But the President also asked senior
 members of his national security team to travel up to Capitol Hill and tes=
tify under oath on camera, before Congress, to encourage them to take these=
 steps.&nbsp; But unfortunately, like so many other things we think that Co=
ngress should so obviously do, Republicans
 have failed to act.<o:p></o:p></p>

Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just to be totally clear, unless there&#8217;s a ne=

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, what we have said, Olivier, is that the actions th=
at the President has already ordered against ISIL -- and these are the acti=
ons that we&#8217;ve taken in both Iraq and in Syria -- and I believe even =
some of the actions that we&#8217;ve taken in other
 places, including, like, Libya -- are covered by the 2001 AUMF.&nbsp; The =
2001 AUMF does refer to al Qaeda, and there still are places around the wor=
ld where there are al Qaeda networks that -- where the United States is tak=
ing action to limit their threat to the
 United States.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

So we do believe that we still need to have the authority to degrade and ul=
timately destroy ISIL, and, where necessary, continue to apply pressure to =
al Qaeda affiliates around the globe.&nbsp; So we do believe that authoriza=
tion is necessary.&nbsp; We believe that authorization
 could be given in a way that&#8217;s much more narrowly tailored than it c=

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Pam, we&#8217;re going to continue to make a force=

 Guantanamo Bay is to seek to transfer those individuals who can be safely =
transferred under the right security constraints
 to other countries, and bring the remaining number of inmates to a secure =
facility in the United States where they can be prevented from harming the =

The truth is there are dozens of dangerous, convicted terrorists who are on=
 American soil in American prisons right now.&nbsp; That doesn&#8217;t pose=

bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact of the matter is the administration put for=
ward a very specific plan back on October 21st of last year -- 190 days ago=
 -- laying out exactly what we believe should be done to
 address the situation in Puerto Rico.&nbsp; Again, it was not a proposed b=
ailout, it actually was a proposal to give the Puerto Rican government exac=
tly the same kind of restructuring authority that local cities across the c=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What it also would do, it would also bring some acco=
untability to ensure that the Puerto Rican government was also implementing=
 the kinds of fiscal reforms that would be taken in the
 context of this kind of restructuring.&nbsp; There are other things that w=
ould improve the economic situation in Puerto Rico that we have proposed th=
at would have a corresponding positive impact on their fiscal situation, so=
 we have also suggested that we should
 reform Puerto Rico's Medicaid program and that we should give Puerto Rico =
access to the earned-income tax credit.&nbsp; The earned-income tax credit,=
 of course, is something that many Republicans have acknowledged can be eff=
ective in stimulating economic growth
 and fighting poverty.&nbsp; It sounds like a pretty good recipe for addres=
sing the tough situation in Puerto Rico.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, we're talking about 3 million Americans that l=
ive in Puerto Rico, and right now you've got Republicans who have essential=
ly turned a blind eye to their plight.&nbsp; And the longer that
 Republicans put off finding this solution, the more likely it becomes that=
 they'll have to resort to a bailout.&nbsp; Those are just the facts.&nbsp;=
 And that's why the administration continues to make a strong case that Con=
gress should act now.&nbsp; In fact, they should
 have acted months ago to address this situation so that Puerto Rico could =
get their finances under control, so that we could make sure that the situa=
tion in Puerto Rico doesn't deteriorate even further.&nbsp;

Here's one other thing that we know, just to make this even more complicate=

Puerto Rico because they have family there or they're going to vacation the=

 in Puerto Rico.&nbsp; And because of the fiscal challenges that the govern=

 Vice President's trip to Iraq, this follows visit by your Defense Secretar=

would
 look at that and say, well, it must be pretty bad if all these high-level =
people are going over there.&nbsp; How concerned is the President at the de=
terioration of Iraq?&nbsp; Or am I over-reading that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Kevin, you heard the Presid=
ent in Riyadh talk about his concern about the tough political situation in=
side of Iraq right now.&nbsp; The good news is, just in the last 24
 or 36 hours, we did see the Iraqi parliament move to confirm a majority of=
 appointees that Prime Minister Abadi had made to his cabinet.&nbsp; That's=
 good news.&nbsp; And that is sort of a welcome -- that's welcome progress =
when it comes to pursuing the kinds of political
 reforms that Prime Minister Abadi has identified as critical to effectivel=
y governing the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's also true, Kevin, is we've also seen some imp=
ortant progress over the last several months in rolling back ISIL from terr=
itory in Iraq that they previously controlled.&nbsp; And that
 progress was the result of intensive coordination between Iraqi forces and=
 coalition forces.&nbsp; And the President has rolled out some ideas in jus=
t the last couple of weeks about how to further intensify that coordination=
 and that cooperation.&nbsp; And that President
 is hopeful that Iraqi forces will continue to make progress in laying the =
groundwork to eventually drive ISIL out of the second-largest city in Iraq.=

he
 Commander-in-Chief believe that he would sign that legislation if it reach=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, John, that's a good questio=
n.&nbsp; Obviously this is an issue that is going to attract a lot of atten=
tion, and understandably so.&nbsp; There's not much that I can say about
 it, however, because this is the subject of some ongoing litigation.&nbsp;=
 You've seen recent announcements from the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter=
, that would give more women who are in the military the opportunity to def=
end their country in more roles.&nbsp; And
 the President obviously has welcomed that progress.&nbsp; He certainly bel=
ieves that makes our fighting forces even stronger.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the other thing that we know to be true is that =
men and women have served in our all-volunteer force, in both Iraq and in A=
fghanistan, with distinction and with courage and with bravery.&nbsp;
 And it's because of their service and their sacrifice -- both men and wome=
n -- that we're safer, and that we enjoy so many of the freedoms that are e=
asy to take for granted.&nbsp; The President certainly does not take them f=
or granted.&nbsp; And the President has often
 talked about how serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the United States mi=
litary is the greatest honor.&nbsp; And that certainly is true because of t=
he service and sacrifice that American men and women have made in our milit=
ary.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has it given him any pause to th=
ink that perhaps his daughters would have to sign up for selective service?=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, again, at this point I can'=

ion.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More generally then, Charlie Ran=
gel, pretty much every year that he's been in Congress, has called to reins=
titute the draft vote.&nbsp; Does the President support that?<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I haven&#8217;t heard the P=
resident articulate his support for that.&nbsp; Obviously, we do have a sys=
tem.&nbsp; Currently, the U.S. military functions at a high level, even tho=
ugh
 it is an all-volunteer force.&nbsp; And like I said, the President is quit=
e proud of the service and bravery and professionalism of our all-volunteer=
 force.&nbsp; And even in some very difficult situations, men and women of =
the United States military have demonstrated
 their mettle.&nbsp; But at this point, I have not heard the President expr=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then a small follow-up on th=

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, obviously I&#8217;m not going to talk about any op=

 team.&nbsp; I can just tell you that the President takes very seriously th=

There are a variety of circumstances in a variety of countries where he has=

Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a question about Aleppo.&nbsp; You talked about =
what the Russians can do or should be doing.&nbsp; And in the past, U.S. of=
ficials have talked about the presence of al-Nusra Front, and about how Rus=
sians have gone after them.&nbsp; And since they fall outside
 of the ceasefire, it makes the situation more complicated.&nbsp; So I&#821=
7;m wondering what message the U.S. is sending to Russians in terms of the =
bombings and what should be done.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, the message that we&#8217;re sending to the Russia=
ns is a direct one, and that is that they need to abide by the cessation of=
 hostilities that they signed onto, and they need to use their influence wi=
th the Assad regime to do the same.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
The United States has certainly fulfilled our commitment to doing that, bot=
h in terms of our own actions, but also in terms of using our leverage with=
 other parties to abide by the cessation of hostilities.&nbsp; The reason t=
hat we have done that is because it is
 critical for these political talks to progress.&nbsp; And one of the goals=
 of the cessation of hostilities was to reduce the violence so that the pol=
itical conversations could move forward.&nbsp; And we have seen the politic=
al talks waver because a cessation of hostilities
 has been increasingly fragile.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

So we continue to be quite concerned about the situation, and we continue t=
o impress upon the Russians the priority that we believe they should place =
on the successful implementation of the cessation of hostilities.<o:p></o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
Let me also say that we acknowledge that the situation on the ground in Syr=
ia is chaotic.&nbsp; It&#8217;s complicated.&nbsp; And there are situations=
 where there are forces like Nusra who are not part of the cessation of hos=
tilities where their forces get comingled with forces
 that are part of the cessation of hostilities.<o:p></o:p></p>

&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

So that is what is going to prevent the clean implementation of the cessati=
on of hostilities.&nbsp; We acknowledge that there are going to be some com=
plications.&nbsp; And even in the run-up to the implementation of the cessa=
tion of hostilities, we acknowledged that
 there would be some bumps in the road.&nbsp; We acknowledged that there we=
re likely to be some violations.&nbsp; We acknowledged there would likely b=
e some ambiguity.&nbsp; In fact, the cessation includes a mechanism for eva=
luating potential violations to try to remove the
 ambiguity of the situation and get to the bottom of what exactly is happen=

217;s not complicated is the message that we have delivered
 to the Russians that they should use their influence with the Assad regime=

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Christi, I&#8217;m not going to prejudge the outco=

So I&#8217;m reluctant to comment in much detail on it until the results ha=

math of this incident that accountability is important.&nbsp; And that is s=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Cheryl, the thing that we know is=
 that as we get closer to the summer, the risk from the Zika virus only inc=
reases.&nbsp; And it's a shame that Republicans in Congress have refused
 to move the ball forward in giving our public health professionals the res=
ources that they need to protect the American people from Zika.&nbsp; This =
is a public health emergency -- that's what our public health experts have =
told us.&nbsp; They don't have a political
 agenda; they're just trying to keep people safe and healthy.&nbsp; And for=
 some reason, that doesn't appear to be high on the agenda of congressional=
 Republicans.&nbsp; If it were, this is the kind of supplemental funding pa=
ckage that should be able to pass pretty quickly.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you a -- there's a relevant example that=
 I would cite for you.&nbsp; In 2009, there were significant concerns about=
 an H1-N1 flu pandemic having a significant impact on the United
 States.&nbsp; When Democrats were in charge of the Congress, they acted ra=
ther quickly to appropriate more than $7 billion to ensure that the country=
 could prepare for that kind of pandemic.&nbsp; I would point out that this=
 was something that was referred to as a no-year
 spending request that we put forward; there were not constraints about whi=
ch fiscal year it would apply to.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I know this is just the latest excuse that we've=
 heard from Republicans about why they haven't acted.&nbsp; They've suggest=
ed that they need a more detailed breakdown of which fiscal year
 the funding would be used.&nbsp; The truth is, we can't fund the fight aga=
inst Zika a few months at a time.&nbsp; In order to effectively, for exampl=
e, develop and test and manufacture a vaccine that can be used to protect m=
ore than 300 million American citizens, that's
 a multiyear effort that we're talking about.&nbsp; And that's an undertaki=
ng that the private sector will have to commit to.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if we're going to ask the private sector to commi=
t to a multiyear effort to develop a vaccine, then Congress needs to make a=
 commitment to a multiyear effort to fund it.&nbsp; That's the
 way that we're going to protect the American people, and there's no reason=
 that this should get bogged down in the kind of political gamesmanship tha=
t Republicans, for some reason, seem to delight in, even in the face of a p=
ublic health emergency.<o:p></o:p></p>

bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Look, I think in many ways you co=
uld say that the deadline for this funding has passed, because you had the =
director of the National Institutes of Health standing at this
 podium three weeks ago, saying that he didn't have all of the resources th=
at he felt like he needed to do everything possible to protect the American=
 people from the Zika virus.&nbsp; So I think by that standard, which is an=
 entirely reasonable one, Republicans
 have missed the deadline, and that puts the American people at risk.&nbsp;=
 And I don't know how they're going to explain it when they go on recess ne=
xt week.<o:p></o:p></p>

s particular piece of legislation.&nbsp; I can just tell you as a general m=
atter, Chris, as you've heard me say on a number of occasions in the
 last few weeks, the administration believes strongly in fairness, in equal=
ity, and justice.&nbsp; And we believe in bills that promote fairness, equa=
lity, and justice, and we are strongly opposed to any legislative effort to=
 undermine protections for any American.&nbsp;
 And I will acknowledge I'm not familiar with the intricacies of this parti=
cular legislation, but that principle is one that the President believes st=
rongly in.&nbsp; And it's not just the way he evaluates federal measures, b=
ut when we choose to weigh in on state
 and local matters, it's an important criteria.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Aleppo situation, as you =
noted, this hospital bombing, the latest atrocity committed apparently by t=
he Assad regime, killed the last pediatrician or one of the last pediatrici=
ans
 in Aleppo.&nbsp; It sort of raises the question, once again, under what ci=
rcumstances would the administration respond against the Assad regime for c=
ivilian casualties?&nbsp; Syrian civilian casualties?&nbsp; This is not lik=
e the U.S. bombing of the hospital in Kabul.&nbsp; There's
 a long history of the Assad regime not only disregarding civilian safety, =
but directly targeting civilians.&nbsp; So it's not like this might be a on=
e-time accident.&nbsp; Under what circumstances would the U.S. consider mak=
ing some sort of military response to a civilian
 atrocity committed by the Assad regime?&nbsp; And are you developing optio=
ns along those lines?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'm not aware of considerat=
ion of any military response at this point as a result of this particular i=
ncident.&nbsp; I do think it underscores what you are noting, which
 is that the Assad regime, tragically, has a long history of using that cou=
ntry's military might to attack innocent civilians.&nbsp; And it's why we h=
ave made a strong case that President Assad has lost the legitimacy to lead=
 that country.&nbsp; How could you possibly
 lead and unite a country whose citizens you've spent the better part of fi=
ve years attacking?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this actually reflects the failure of President A=
ssad's political leadership, because he's had to resort to using the milita=
ry might of the country to attack his own constituents.&nbsp;
 So that's why we've made a strong case that President Assad needs to go, a=
nd Syrian leadership that actually reflects the will of the Syrian people w=
ith the capacity to actually unite the country to face down the threat that=
 is posed by ISIL -- that's what's
 required.&nbsp; And that's what we are trying to bring about.<o:p></o:p></=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the process has been difficult, in part because =
we have seen countries like Russia that have made a tragic decision to prop=
 him up.&nbsp; And that has prolonged this conflict.&nbsp; And we
 have -- that's why we have continued to urge the Russians to pursue a diff=
erent approach and to try to persuade the Assad regime to, first of all, li=
ve up to the cessation of hostilities and stop targeting innocent people, b=
ut second of all, engage in the
 kind of political talks that are necessary to resolve the political turmoi=
l inside of Syria.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the only way we&#8217;re going to=
 be able to get at the root of all that plagues Syria and all of the conseq=
uences that has yielded.<o:p></o:p></p>

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to entertain a hypothetical like that.&n=
bsp; But our profound concern about the humanitarian situation inside of Sy=
ria is well documented.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why the United States has be=
en the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance.&nbsp;
 Because of assistance provided by the United States, some humanitarian rel=
ief has been provided to people in Syria who need it.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

It&#8217;s why the United States has been a strong advocate of the U.N.-fac=
ilitated political talks to try to bring about the kind of political soluti=
on that would bring an end to the violence inside of Syria.&nbsp; It&#8217;=
s why we have regularly been in touch with the Russians
 to encourage them to use their influence with the Assad regime to live up =
to the cessation of hostilities and engage in the political talks.<o:p></o:=

MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I will just say that one of the priorities that th=
e President has identified for staffing the U.S. government is to do more t=
o make sure that we have a government that reflects the diversity of our co=
untry.&nbsp; And by and large, the administration
 has been quite successful in that effort.&nbsp; And the President is proud=
 of that record, both because of the way it reflects the diversity of our c=
ountry right now, but in some ways it&#8217;s even more important that the =
pipeline for talent has also been now diversified;
 that so often, as people get promoted or considered for higher-level openi=
ngs, there&#8217;s careful consideration of their experience.&nbsp; I think=
 that&#8217;s certainly an understandable thing for an employer to do.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
Now you have a much more diversified workforce that has a much more diversi=
fied set of experiences.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s a good thing.&nbsp; And tha=
t means that our government has been diverse over the last eight years, but=
 it means that our government is more likely to
 be diverse at higher levels for the next generation because of those steps=
.<o:p></o:p></p>

And the President would certainly be pleased if part of his legacy is that =
the higher levels of the U.S. government are more diverse 10, 15, 20 years =
from now because of important early hiring decisions that were made during =
his presidency.<o:p></o:p></p>
