Wow this is something

Donald Trump Wanted A White-Versus-Black Season Of =93The Apprentice=94<htt=
ps://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/donald-trump-wanted-a-white-versus-black=
-season-of-the-appre?utm_term=3D.ljObp1WQz#.ruL53nQa8>

=93Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our v=
ery vicious world,=94 Trump said in 2005.

A decade before he launched his presidential bid, Donald Trump was a realit=
y TV sensation in search of a new gimmick for the upcoming season of The Ap=
prentice. In the summer of 2005, he thought he had found it: pit black cont=
estants against white ones in the televised battle for boardroom supremacy.
Trump floated the prospect of racially segregated Apprentice teams during h=
is short-lived syndicated radio show on July 11, 2005.

Explaining to listeners that he =93wasn=92t particularly happy=94 with the =
show=92s most recent season, Trump said he was mulling =93an idea that is f=
airly controversial =97 creating a team of successful African-Americans ver=
sus a team of successful whites. Whether people like that idea or not, it i=
s somewhat reflective of our very vicious world.=94

The idea =97 which he had also raised on Howard Stern=92s show a couple mon=
ths earlier, according to a 2005 Entertainment Weekly article =97 drew an a=
valanche of coverage, commentary, and question-mark headlines at the time.

=93Will next Apprentice play race card?=94 asked UPI.

=93Will The Apprentice become a battle of the races?=94 mused MSNBC.com.

(In a bizarre bit of time-capsule trivia, multiple critics suggested Trump =
was inspired by a reality show that ABC had recently yanked before airing, =
Welcome to the Neighborhood, which would have allowed three white families =
in suburban Texas to choose their new neighbors from among a group of conte=
stants that included Koreans, African-Americans, pagans, and a same-sex cou=
ple with an adopted black child.)

Renee Graham, a black Boston Globe columnist, wrote that Trump=92s idea wou=
ld make for =93nothing short of revolutionary, must-see TV.=94

In dividing the =94Apprentice=94 teams by race, there would finally be a re=
ality show nervy enough to deal with one of the more difficult dilemmas of =
our own reality, and where the ultimate stakes would be far more important =
than just determining who gets to be the Donald=92s latest lackey.

But for the most part, Trump=92s proposal was panned by critics and comment=
ators, and a rep for the billionaire moved quickly to tamp down the uproar,=
 assuring reporters, =93it=92s just an idea.=94 Sure enough, Trump never we=
nt through with it.

Tara Dowdell, a black communications consultant who appeared on season 3 of=
 The Apprentice, recalled being =93floored=94 when she first heard Trump=92=
s casting idea in 2005. But in retrospect, she says, it seems like the whol=
e episode foreshadowed a 2016 campaign strategy that has cynically fanned t=
he flames of racial resentment and xenophobia.

=93Best-case scenario, it was huge blind spot. Worst-case scenario, it show=
ed [Trump=92s] willingness to exploit race and be divisive =97 to do anythi=
ng to promote himself,=94 Dowdell told BuzzFeed News. =93The presidency can=
=92t be one crazy, ill-advised publicity stunt after another.=94

She added that she is especially amused now by the presumptive GOP nominee=
=92s claims that he will bring the country together: =93He has the audacity=
 to say he=92s a uniter when he proposed Apprentice: The Race War?=94
