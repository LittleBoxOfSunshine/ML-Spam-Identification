Andrew --

Just a couple hours ago, I announced that I am running for Governor of New =
Jersey.

As some of my dearest friends and closest supporters, I want to take this =
opportunity to thank you for all the support you have given Tammy and me =
over the years. We would not be here without you, and we will continue to =
need your help with our campaign to grow New Jersey's middle class and =
take back our state from the political insiders.=20

With that in mind, I hope you will join us for a conference call with =
members of our senior campaign team this Wednesday, May 18 at 2:00 p.m. =
ET.

If you are able to join the call, please email Joe Kelley, my Deputy =
Campaign Manager for Finance, at jkelley@murphy4nj.com and he will provide =
the dial-in information.=20

I'll give you a personal update on the campaign and then hand the =
discussion over to Brendan Gill, our campaign manager, and Julie Roginsky, =
who is one of the media consultants on our team. Together, we'll discuss =
the campaign we plan to run -- including a sneak peak of the strategies we =
will employ over the next year.=20

As I said in my announcement earlier today, New Jersey's challenges can't =
wait. The only way we're going to win this race and deliver the future our =
state deserves is if we all step up to be a part of this campaign.=20

I look forward to discussing on the call how you can become more involved =
in this effort.=20

For more information, and to watch the announcement video, please visit =
https://www.Murphy4Nj.com.

Thank you again for all you do,=20

Phil and Tammy Murphy=20
