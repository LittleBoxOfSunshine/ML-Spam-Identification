Trump doesn=92t appear too interested in Paul Ryan=92s =91conservative prin=
ciples=92<https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/05/06/trum=
p-doesnt-appear-too-interested-in-paul-ryans-conservative-principles/>
By Greg Sargent<http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/greg-sargent> May 6 at=
 3:07 PM

Paul Ryan says he=92s not yet =93ready=94 to support Donald Trump, and want=
s him to show some support for =93conservative principles<http://time.com/4=
320476/paul-ryan-interview-transcript-donald-trump-endorsement/>=94 first. =
Given the House Speaker=92s role in crafting the GOP=92s chief fiscal and e=
conomic blueprint =97 the Ryan budget, which continues to function as the p=
arty=92s ideological lodestar =97 you=92d think he=92d want to hear Trump o=
ffer up paeans to the limited government conservatism at the core of that o=
verarching vision.

So this exchange between Trump and Bret Baier, in a Fox News appearance las=
t night<http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/special-report-bret-baier/videos#p/86=
927/v/4880295822001> (go to the 20 minute mark) may not inspire much confid=
ence in that regard:



BRET BAIER: You=92ve been very clear on the stump that you oppose any refor=
m of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. Yet you told the Washington Post =
you would eliminate $20 trillion in U.S. national debt in eight years.

TRUMP: No, no. I think what they really were referring to =97 I=92m very go=
od at understanding banking, debt, all of that. I=92m one of the all time p=
rofessionals. We can cut, we can discount, we can buy at discounts, we can =
see where interest rates=85

BAIER: Without changing those three things?

TRUMP: No, we can discount debt. For instance, we may refinance when intere=
st rates are so low. A lot of people think we should refinance, taking some=
 extra money and redo the infrastructure of our country. You know, we=92ve =
spent $4 trillion plus in the Middle East.

We have to look at our numbers=85.We owe $19 trillion. Soon it=92s going to=
 be $21 trillion. We=92re going to have to do something about our debt.

BAIER: Negotiating with Paul Ryan on his plan that every Republican =97 alm=
ost =97 has voted on, is one of the things you=92re=85

TRUMP: Well, I want to make our country rich again. I want to bring back ou=
r jobs. I want to make our economy soar. I want to do things that will make=
 us so rich that we won=92t have to hurt Social Security. We won=92t have t=
o hurt Medicare. We=92re going to make our country rich again.



It=92s not easy to make sense of this, absent more detail. But Trump seems =
to be speaking approvingly about rolling over Treasury debt into lower-inte=
rest-rate vehicles, and plowing the resulting savings back into spending on=
 our infrastructure. Trump has, of course, repeatedly talked about rebuildi=
ng the country=92s infrastructure =97 something that has already made some =
fiscal conservatives suspicious of him. But here he seems to be going a ste=
p further, speaking in positive terms about paying for that infrastructure =
spending with any debt savings that his fiscal wizardry produces, rather us=
ing those savings to bring down the debt.

Indeed, in this exchange, Trump also declines to endorse the Ryan plan, whi=
ch would cut government dramatically in order to address our long term fisc=
al outlook. Instead, he says that his policies will make the country so ric=
h that we won=92t need to cut entitlements. We can have it all =97 vastly r=
educed deficits; no entitlement cuts; and more spending on infrastructure.

And there=92s still more =97 we can also have lower taxes, especially on th=
e rich! According to the Tax Policy Center, here=92s what Trump=92s tax pla=
n would do<http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trum=
ps-tax-plan>:



His proposal would cut taxes at all income levels, although the largest ben=
efits, in dollar and percentage terms, would go to the highest-income house=
holds. The plan would reduce federal revenues by $9.5 trillion over its fir=
st decade before accounting for added interest costs or considering macroec=
onomic feedback effects.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has also concluded that Trump=92=
s tax cuts would require a dramatic downsizing of government<http://www.cbp=
p.org/research/federal-tax/trump-and-cruz-tax-cut-plans-would-shrink-govern=
ment-to-truman-era-levels>.



It=92s hard to see how all this math could be made to work. Trump=92s answe=
r appears to be that he=92d basically obliterate current fiscal and mathema=
tical realities by making the country richer than ever before.

Meanwhile, the New York Times reports on another way<http://www.nytimes.com=
/2016/05/07/us/politics/donald-trumps-idea-to-cut-national-debt-get-credito=
rs-to-accept-less.html?_r=3D0> that President Trump would get a handle on o=
ur fiscal problems:



Trump said in a television interview Thursday that he might seek to reduce =
the national debt by persuading creditors to accept something less than ful=
l payment=85. =93I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you c=
ould make a deal.=94 =85

Such remarks by a major presidential candidate have no modern precedent.



As Brian Beutler says<https://newrepublic.com/minutes/133348/lets-not-norma=
lize-trump-lets-not-otherize-either>, all this is not occurring in a vacuum=
: Republicans have been pursuing reckless and unlikely fiscal schemes for y=
ears, such as provoking debt ceiling crises and talking up the Balanced Bud=
get Amendment. Trump may be breaking exciting new ground when it comes to o=
utlandish policy proposals, but he=92s also relying on plenty of Republican=
 precedent.



Yet now Paul Ryan needs Trump to show very visible improvement. He needs Tr=
ump to give him cover to argue that the GOP nominee really is mellowing in =
terms of temperament and policy and is even embracing =93conservative princ=
iples<http://time.com/4320476/paul-ryan-interview-transcript-donald-trump-e=
ndorsement/>.=94 This might take the form of Trump toning down the xenophob=
ia and repudiating his Muslim ban; or it might take the form of Trump offer=
ing more convincing paeans to fiscal conservatism and limited government. B=
ut Trump has doubled down on his plans for immigrants and Muslims, and judg=
ing by his latest fiscal pronouncements, he is showing no signs of moving t=
owards Ryan on that front, either.
