jeopardizing his legacy, President Obama calls on Senate Republicans to fil=
l the Supreme Court vacancy in light of Donald Trump becoming the presumpti=
ve Republican nominee for president, Chief Judge Garland reflects on his li=
fetime of public service and, today's Supreme Court decisions showcase the =

Tomorrow, #WeNeedNine will host a press conference at Capitol Visitor Cente=
r - SVC 202, with Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Randi Weingarten, President of t=
he American Federation of Teachers, Lily Eskelsen Garc=EDa, President of th=
e National Education Association, Elizabeth A. Davis, President Washington =
Teachers Union, and Jim Leonard, U.S. government teacher at Wilson High Sch=
ool in DC to mark the 62 anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education rul=
ing. They will demand Senate Republicans move forward with hearings and an =
up-or-down vote on Chief Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme =
Court.  To RSVP for this event, please email Natalie Raps at nraps@skdknick=

Editorial: Grassley's court maneuver threatens his legacy, reputation.

The editorial board of the Des Moines Register<http://www.desmoinesregister=
.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/05/15/editorial-grassleys-court-maneuver=
-threatens-his-legacy-reputation/84306270/?from=3Dglobal&sessionKey=3D&auto=
login=3D> writes:



"After 57 years in elected office and countless legislative accomplishments=
 at both the state and federal level, Grassley seems destined to be remembe=
red largely for this single, petulant act of politically motivated obstruct=
ionism... Over the course of six terms in the U.S. Senate, three terms in t=
he U.S. House, and 16 years in the Iowa Legislature, Grassley cultivated a =
reputation for being a fair-minded, hard-working, bipartisan lawmaker. That=
 well-deserved reputation is now badly damaged - perhaps irretrievably so."



President Obama: Trump candidacy a key reason to confirm Garland now

Today, President Obama weighed in on Donald Trump becoming the presumptive =
Republican presidential nominee, saying it should incentivize Senate Republ=
icans to confirm Chief Judge Garland now. In a live interview with Chris Ge=
idner, Buzzfeed<https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/obama-supreme-court-n=
ominee-interview?utm_term=3D.poNw0VvGj#.ab8zvK70P> reports:



"The GOP is 'looking at a Republican nominee' - Donald Trump - 'who many of=
 them say isn't qualified to be president much less appoint someone' to the=
 Supreme Court.... But now, 'it seems to me [Republicans would] be better o=
ff going ahead and giving a hearing and a vote to somebody that they themse=
lves in the past have said is well-qualified, is fair, and to treat the Sup=
reme Court with the seriousness and the sense that it's beyond politics, th=
at it deserves,' Obama said. 'Precisely because this election year has been=
 so crazy, precisely because you have a number of Republicans who have said=
 that they're concerned about their nominee, it shows you why you don't wan=
t to politicize a Supreme Court appointment.'"



Supreme Court punts on major case, showing the importance of a full and fun=
ctioning high court.

In a memo, People for the American Way<http://blog.pfaw.org/content/supreme=
-court-punts-zubik-case-and-shows-again-crucial-importance-fully-staffed-su=
preme-cour> notes that the Supreme Court's decision to send Zubik v. Burwel=
l-a major case concerning the Affordable Care Act-back to the lower courts =
highlights the crucial importance of a fully functioning Supreme Court.



"The Supreme Court issued a brief unsigned opinion today in the Zubik case,=
 and vacated all the conflicting opinions...The result is to punt the issue=
 away until the Court again has nine justices...While both sides can theref=
ore claim some temporary victory from the Court's ruling, the clear loser i=
s our American justice system."



Chief Judge Garland: the committed tutor.

Teacher Charlene Wilburn reflects on the 18 years Chief Judge Garland spent=
 tutoring students at J.O. Wilson Elementary. Watch the video HERE<https://=
www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D1wSS4He6x7A>.



Charlene Wilburn, teacher at J.O. Wilson Elementary: "The fact that he woul=
d continue to come with his busy schedule and his big job to take the time =
to work with children, it just really touches my heart-and I really think i=
t speaks to him, what kind of person he is. For him to be a judge for the S=
upreme Court is perfect."



Senate Republicans can learn something from New Hampshire.

Former New Hampshire state representative and senator Debora B. Pignatelli =
writes in the New Hampshire Business Review<http://www.nhbr.com/May-13-2016=
/What-Washington-can-learn-from-New-Hampshire/> that the Senate GOP should =
take a lesson from a NH state law that requires all state judicial nominees=
 to receive a public hearing.



Former New Hampshire state representative and senator Debora B. Pignatelli:=
 "When I was a New Hampshire state senator, my colleagues, both Republican =
and Democratic, enacted a bill I co-sponsored that required all state judic=
ial nominees receive a public hearing. It has served our state well...Inste=
ad of continuing to obstruct, the Senate Republican leadership should give =
Chief Judge Garland a hearing and a vote... Our belonging to a political pa=
rty didn't make any difference. We did our jobs. The hearings were importan=
t to ensure the public had the opportunity to vet a nominee's qualification=
s and record. There were no political shenanigans."





A look ahead at a sampling of activity by our grassroots allies and Democra=
tic Senators:

 Chief Judge Garland now. In a live interview with Chris Geidner, <a href=
