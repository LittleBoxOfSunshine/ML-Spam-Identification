Republicans are losing the argument over Merrick Garland. And it=92s only g=
oing to get worse.
By Paul Waldman May 9 at 12:33 PM


The nomination of Merrick Garland to fill Antonin Scalia=92s seat on the Su=
preme Court may have slipped from the front page amid all the attention to =
Donald Trump=92s ascension, but the parties are still arguing about it, and=
 something interesting is going on. As Burgess Everett reports<http://www.p=
olitico.com/story/2016/05/gop-supreme-court-merrick-garland-222898>, conser=
vative groups are significantly outspending liberal groups in trying to pre=
ssure Republican senators to support Garland or at least allow a hearing an=
d vote on his nomination.



Nevertheless, Republican unity hasn=92t cracked =97 to date only two GOP se=
nators, Susan Collins and Mark Kirk, have said<https://www.washingtonpost.c=
om/graphics/politics/scotus-senate-gop-garland/> they support granting Garl=
and a hearing.



But what=92s notable is this: not only are Republicans losing on this issue=
, they can=92t even keep their own voters in line.

Two different liberal groups are out with polls today showing voters overwh=
elmingly supporting Garland=92s nomination: this national one<http://aufc.3=
cdn.net/b3f0af6ecdf090a89a_iim6bnlvy.pdf> conducted for Americans United fo=
r Change shows voters saying by 58-37 that the seat should be filled this y=
ear, and 65 percent saying that Garland should at least get a hearing. They=
 also trust Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama over Donald Trump to fill the s=
eat, by margins of 15 and 16 points respectively. This poll<https://www.ame=
ricanprogress.org/press/release/2016/05/09/137152/release-new-poll-shows-am=
ericans-overwhelmingly-support-a-hearing-and-vote-on-merrick-garlands-nomin=
ation/> from the Center for American Progress shows similar numbers, with 6=
9 percent saying the Senate should give Garland a hearing and an up-or-down=
 vote. And both show substantial numbers of voters saying they=92ll be less=
 likely to vote for a senator who opposes giving Garland a hearing. Though =
these are partisan polls, their results aren=92t too different from what me=
dia polls<http://www.pollingreport.com/court.htm> on the topic have shown.



These polls and others show that significant numbers of Republicans are con=
tradicting the position of their party, which is that we should wait until =
the next president is elected to fill this seat. Why is that?

Before we answer that question, some context. Under ordinary circumstances,=
 voters take their cues from the elites of their own party on what they sho=
uld think about new issues as they arise. If you suddenly see all the peopl=
e you admire and agree with =97 politicians, pundits, and so on =97 taking =
one side of an issue that you hadn=92t thought much about before, in short =
order you=92ll probably come to agree with them. This effect was laid out i=
n John Zaller=92s classic work The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion<http:=
//www.cambridge.org/US/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/c=
omparative-politics/nature-and-origins-mass-opinion>, in which he demonstra=
ted that on issues where the parties disagree, people with higher levels of=
 political awareness are more polarized, because they=92re more attuned to =
what their party=92s elites are, in effect, telling them to believe.



In fact, it would be odd if it didn=92t work that way. If you=92re, say, a =
Republican voter who might be open to the idea that the Affordable Care Act=
 has worked out pretty well, you=92re going to have to do a lot of work to =
arrive at that opinion, and overcome some serious cognitive dissonance. Eve=
ry time you hear anyone talk about it, it=92ll be either someone you dislik=
e intensely (e.g. Barack Obama) telling you that the ACA is working, or som=
eone you admire and respect (e.g. Paul Ryan or Rush Limbaugh) telling you i=
t=92s a disaster. And since you probably get more of your news from conserv=
ative sources, you=92re going to hear many more arguments for why it=92s ba=
d than arguments for why it=92s good.

But even if that=92s how things go much of the time, there are exceptions. =
There are times when a party=92s elite is unable to convince its rank-and-f=
ile to share its position, or at least unable to convince them all. For ins=
tance, polls regularly show that significant numbers of Republicans think t=
he wealthy don=92t pay enough taxes (45 percent in this Pew poll<http://www=
.people-press.org/2015/03/19/federal-tax-system-seen-in-need-of-overhaul/>)=
, despite the fact that the Republican Party=92s position is precisely the =
opposite, that the wealthy pay too much. You usually find this contradictio=
n on issues that are relatively easy to understand and where people are abl=
e to incorporate evidence from their own lives =97 or simple common sense =
=97 that might contradict what their party is telling them.


How does this relate to Garland? The bottom line is that Republicans just d=
on=92t have a good case to make, and you don=92t need to know a great deal =
about the topic to understand it. They aren=92t invoking any fundamental pr=
inciple that would rally fellow conservatives to their cause. They invented=
 something they called =93the Biden rule<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-=
meter/article/2016/mar/17/context-biden-rule-supreme-court-nominations/>=94=
 based on nothing but a suggestion Joe Biden made a couple of decades ago, =
which was never actually tested in reality<http://www.politifact.com/truth-=
o-meter/article/2016/mar/17/context-biden-rule-supreme-court-nominations/>,=
 to justify their position. So nobody can honestly say that there=92s anyth=
ing but naked partisanship at work here: they=92d just rather have one of t=
heir guys in that seat, and if obstructing the Garland nomination is what i=
t takes to make that possible, then that=92s what they=92ll do.



When you watch Republicans try to make the case that there=92s a more profo=
und justification than that for their position, you can tell even they don=
=92t believe it. That=92s why, for instance, Sen. Jeff Flake admitted<http:=
//www.mediaite.com/online/gop-senator-if-we-lose-election-we-should-confirm=
-merrick-garland-quickly/> yesterday that =93If we come to a point=96=96I=
=92ve said all along=96=96where we=92re going to lose the election in Novem=
ber, then we ought to approve him quickly, because I=92m certain he=92ll be=
 more conservative than a Hillary Clinton nomination.=94 But what about the=
 hallowed Biden Rule? Eh, whatever =97 you know we don=92t mean that.



I=92ve been arguing<https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/=
11/28/why-the-supreme-court-should-be-the-biggest-issue-of-the-2016-campaig=
n/> for some time that the Supreme Court should be the most important issue=
 in this presidential campaign, but it obviously won=92t be. Nevertheless, =
it could play an important role in Senate races, particularly for a few vul=
nerable Republicans. And it=92s even made at least one Republican who was t=
hought to have an easy ride to reelection =97 Chuck Grassley, whose positio=
n as chair of the Judiciary Committee makes him the obstructor-in-chief =97=
 suddenly vulnerable. Grassley=92s approval numbers are declining<http://ww=
w.politico.com/story/2016/05/senate-grassley-poll-222696>, and Democrats re=
cruited a strong challenger to oppose him. If there=92s a big turnout of vo=
ters going to the polls to stop Donald Trump, Grassley could lose.



Even if the Republican Party had nominated a mainstream figure for presiden=
t, the Garland nomination would have raised some difficult questions for Re=
publican senators running for re-election. But with Trump capturing the nom=
ination, it gets worse. Now, senators in tough campaigns, most of whom are =
saying some version of either =93Maybe I=92ll endorse Trump if he becomes l=
ess of a jerk=94 or =93I=92ll support my party=92s nominee even though I wo=
n=92t like it,=94 are now having to answer an uncomfortable question. Presi=
dent Obama nominated what most people would agree is a jurist meant to be a=
s acceptable as possible to Republicans, people will say to them. Yet you w=
on=92t even give him a hearing, let alone a vote, and you=92d rather let Do=
nald freaking Trump appoint someone to the Court?

One person we haven=92t heard from much on this topic is Hillary Clinton. W=
hile she hassaid<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/hillary-clinton-merr=
ick-garland-supreme-court-220875> Garland should get a vote, she hasn=92t s=
aid whether she=92ll resubmit his nomination if he doesn=92t and she wins i=
n November. Maybe she just wants to keep her options open, or maybe she kno=
ws that not saying what she=92ll do will drive the Republicans a little cra=
zy. Given everything else they=92re dealing with, it probably won=92t be th=
at hard to do.
