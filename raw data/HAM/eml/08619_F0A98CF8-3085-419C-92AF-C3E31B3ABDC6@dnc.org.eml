EXCLUSIVE-U.S. plans new wave of immigrant deportation raids-sources - Reut=

By Julia Edwards

WASHINGTON, May 12 (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials are planning a mo=
nth-long series of raids in May and June to deport hundreds of Central Amer=
ican mothers and children found to have entered the country illegally, acco=
rding to sources and an internal document seen by Reuters.

The operation would likely be the largest deportation sweep targeting immig=
rant families by the administration of President Barack Obama this year aft=
er a similar drive over two days in January that focused on Georgia, Texas,=
 and North Carolina.

Those raids, which resulted in the detention of 121 people, mostly women an=
d children, sparked an outcry from immigration advocates and criticism from=
 some Democrats, including the party's presidential election frontrunner Hi=
llary Clinton.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has now told field offices nation=
wide to launch a 30-day "surge" of arrests focused on mothers and children =
who have already been told to leave the United States, the document seen by=
 Reuters said. The operation would also cover minors who have entered the c=
ountry without a guardian and since turned 18 years of age, the document sa=
id. Two sources confirmed the details of the plan.

The exact dates of the latest series of raids were not known and the detail=
s of the operation could change.

The operation in January marked a departure for ICE, part of the Department=
 of Homeland Security, from one-off deportations to high-profile raids mean=
t to deter migrants from coming to the United States.

An ICE spokeswoman said the agency does not "confirm or deny the existence =
of specific ongoing or future law enforcement actions." The spokeswoman sai=
d immigrants who arrived illegally after Jan. 1, 2014 are priorities for re=
moval.

Federal resources were strained in 2014 under a wave of illegal migrants cr=
ossing the U.S.-Mexico border, especially women and children fleeing violen=
ce in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.

The planned new raids are in response to a renewed surge of illegal entries=
 by Central American women traveling with their children.

From October 2015 through March 2016, the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended mo=
re than 32,000 family "units", defined as mothers and children traveling to=
gether, for crossing illegally into the United States. Over the same period=
 in 2014-2015, there were about 14,000 such apprehensions; in 2013-2014, ab=
out 19,800.

t.rs/1qglGZG<javascript:void(0);>)

Many of those apprehended for unlawful entry are put into deportation proce=
edings in court but do not show up for their scheduled appearance before a =
judge or ignore court orders to leave the country.

The surge in illegal border crossings has put Obama in a tough spot in a pr=
esidential election year in which he wants to see a fellow Democrat elected=
 as his successor.

Obama has said criminal immigrants and those who have recently entered the =
country are priorities for deportation. He is regularly hammered by Republi=
cans over the presence of more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in t=
he country.

But Hispanic-Americans tend to vote for Democrats, who are more sympathetic=
 to the plight of the undocumented.

Clinton raised concerns about the January raids at the time, saying they ha=
d "sown fear and division in immigrant communities."

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pledged to=
 build a wall along the Mexican border to prevent illegal immigration.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told a U.S. Senate panel in March t=
hat the January raids had helped to deter Central Americans from migrating =
illegally. Border Patrol reported fewer illegal entries between January and=
 March 2016 compared to October and December 2015, but there were more appr=
ehended than over the same time period in early 2015.

A separate document seen by Reuters said Johnson was concerned about the mo=
st recent uptick in border crossings.

Immigration advocates say they have asked Johnson to abandon plans for futu=
re raids.

"Raids are not the answer," said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of =
the National Immigration Law Center, a legal aide and advocacy group for mi=
grants.

"This is a humanitarian challenge," she said.
