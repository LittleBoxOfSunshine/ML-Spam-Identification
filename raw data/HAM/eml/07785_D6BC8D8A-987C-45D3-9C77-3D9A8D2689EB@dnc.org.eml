Governor Inslee, Congressman Adam Smith, Hispanic, Muslim, and Community Le=
aders Denounce Donald Trump

Seattle =96 Today, on the eve of Donald Trump's visit to Washington state a=
nd on the same week Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee =
for President of the United States, Governor Jay Inslee and Congressman Ada=
m Smith joined with Hispanic, Muslim, and community leaders at El Centro de=
 la Raza to highlight how dangerous Donald Trump's hateful rhetoric has bee=
n to families across Washington state.

Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump has made sexist, Islamophobic, and xe=
nophobic statements and has put forward discriminatory policies that are de=
eply inconsistent with Washington state's values.

"In one of the first states in the nation to give women the right to vote, =
Donald Trump ought to be the last man to vote for," said Governor Jay Insle=
e. "In the state that respects the right of citizens to decide who to love =
and values empathy and compassion, we are going to reject a candidate whose=
 fundamental message is based on fear and hatred. Fear of people who look d=
ifferent than us, fear of people of different faith, and hatred of the conc=
ept of inclusion that has built such a successful economy in Washington sta=
te. We are better than that."

"Internationally, Donald Trump=92s reckless proposals play right into ISIS=
=92 playbook, which creates a more dangerous world for all people," said Co=
ngressman Adam Smith. "In Washington state, we have seen firsthand the dama=
ge that the presumptive Republican nominee=92s policy proposals have on our=
 communities and places of worship. Just recently, Curry Temple CME was att=
acked by vandals expressing hatred and vitriol. Washington state=92s values=
 encourage compassion, acceptance, and inclusion. We must stay true to thes=
e values, instead of allowing his message of hate to spread any further."

"Donald Trump is wrong for business, he=92s wrong for women, and he=92s wro=
ng for our country," said Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, MomsRising*. "And Washin=
gton moms, whether they work at home with their kids or work for pay, know =
that men like Trump are standing in the way of progress and prosperity for =
all. Most of all, Washington moms recognize a bully.  A bully is someone wh=
o divides people.  A bully is someone who prays on people=92s worst fears a=
nd offers false solutions that just spread more pain and anger.  And Washin=
gton moms know that's wrong for Washington state."

"Anti-Muslim hate crimes have never been as high in number or in severity a=
s they are now," said Varisha Khan. "In times like this, young Americans li=
ke me are counting on fair-minded leaders across our nation to realize they=
 have a duty to publicly and vocally affirm American values of religious fr=
eedom, and publicly and vocally tell the stories of the lives and contribut=
ions of American Muslims they know."
