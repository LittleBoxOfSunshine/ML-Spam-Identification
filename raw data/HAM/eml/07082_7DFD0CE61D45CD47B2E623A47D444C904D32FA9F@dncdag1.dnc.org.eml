Trump Greta Town Hall in Indianapolis

Fiorina VP?
- Waste of time
- He's picking a VP but has no path. Zero chance
- I want to get nomination first, then pick

Foreign policy speech?
- Big threat of global warming-- of the nuclear variety
- North Korea is "having a field day with us. It=92s a form of extortion."
- China can strangle North Korea

Helping small businesses?
- Repeal and replace Obamacare

Plan to combat rising college tuition?
- Colleges haven't kept costs down
- Using students as conduit to make money from the government
- We will be seriously looking into it
- Maybe a plan to repay loans after getting a job

Israel and Middle East?
- Everyone wants a deal between Israel-Palestine
- "I've never met a person in Israel who didn't want to make a deal"
- Tough deal to make
- Obama made bad deal with Iran
- Obama was the worst thing to happen to Israel


Bobby Knight joins
- Bobby Knight: Trump is the guy to bring the country back to where it was
- Trump claims Knight called him a while ago and said if he ran, Knight sai=
d he would endorse
- Knight says Trump keeps promises. Best man there is for the development o=
f the U.S.

Allies?
- We give a lot of money to countries that don't deserve it that aren't fri=
ends

Pakistan?
- The problem with Pakistan is they have nuclear weapons
- You currently have 9 countries with nuclear weapons
- Don't want to create instability, and it's a really small amount in the s=
cheme of things, I would like to keep that relationship

Aid for countries in severe need, humanitarian aid?
- Can't afford to keep giving
- Would try so hard to help them, but massive debt
- Hits omnibus budget
- Primary theme of my speech was "America First"

Donald Trump Jr. joins
- Trump Jr: Not surprised by results last night
- Donald Trump: I have great children
- Trump Jr.: Dad perhaps didn't run in 2008 or 2012 because of loyalty to t=
he people in his company

Debt?
- Cutting is so easy
- Military spending is tremendous and very important to me. But things cost=
 twice what they should
- Will save billions of dollars on waste, fraud, and abuse

Would you consider a smart, informed woman like Greta for your cabinet?
- Not a bad idea

Trump talks about GOP politicians who publicly criticized him that now want=
 to come on board
- Will announce names shortly
