Flagging question on violence in primary. Transcript below


Primaries are hard-fought. There seems to be a different flavor. There is violence, disenfranchisement, and one of the campaigns aren't addressing that. IS POTUS trying to mediate or resolve or will he wait until the candidates fight it out amongst themselves?



JE: The part of the primaries typically are, especially one that is as passionate as this one is. One of the lessons of the 2008 election is to not confuse the passion in the primary for disinterest in the general election. I think if anything the reason why people are so passionate about the current primary process is because they understand the stakes in the general election. That was true in 2008 and we will see if it is true in 2016. I am confident that POTUS's engagement in the general would be useful in sharpening up that case. He looks forward to the opportunity to do it. He also benefitted personally in the 2007 primary. Yes, things are different (like the debate process), but things are as intense form 2008. Good story to write about what was happening eight years ago.
