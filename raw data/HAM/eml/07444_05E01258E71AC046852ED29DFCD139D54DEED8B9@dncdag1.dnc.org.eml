Here's what's wrong with Jeb Bush saying Hillary Clinton is under FBI inves=
tigation

By Lauren Carroll<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/staff/lauren-carr=
oll/> on Thursday, January 14th, 2016 at 11:04 p.m.

If Hillary Clinton becomes president, she might find herself preoccupied wi=
th an FBI investigation, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said at a Republican =
presidential debate in South Carolina.

"She=92s under investigation with the FBI right now," Bush said Jan. 14. "I=
f she gets elected, her first 100 days =97 instead of setting an agenda, sh=
e might be going back and forth between the White House and the court house=
."

Actually, Clinton is not under FBI investigation. The inquiry to which Bush=
 refers revolves around the private email server Clinton used while serving=
 as secretary of state.  And it is not a criminal investigation.

Here are the facts.

In July 2015, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community sent what=
 is called a security referral to members of the executive branch. A securi=
ty referral is essentially a notification that classified information might=
 exist in a location outside of the government=92s possession. In this case=
, the location was Clinton=92s private email server.

Soon after, the New York Times<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/24/us/politic=
s/inquiry-is-sought-in-hillary-clinton-email-account.html> incorrectly<http=
://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/a-clinton-story-fraught-with-i=
naccuracies-how-it-happened-and-what-next/?smid=3Dtw-share&_r=3D1> reported=
 that the inspectors general requested a criminal investigation into Clinto=
n=92s email use =97 as opposed to a security referral. But the newspaper la=
ter issued two corrections. The referral was in connection with Clinton=92s=
 account, not whether Clinton herself mishandled information, and did not a=
llege criminal activity.

Officials told reporters<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-looks-=
into-security-of-clintons-private-e-mail-setup/2015/08/04/2bdd85ec-3aae-11e=
5-8e98-115a3cf7d7ae_story.html> at the time that the FBI was not targeting =
Clinton specifically.

As part of its inquiry<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-looks-in=
to-security-of-clintons-private-e-mail-setup/2015/08/04/2bdd85ec-3aae-11e5-=
8e98-115a3cf7d7ae_story.html>, the FBI has looked into the security setup f=
or Clinton=92s home server and a thumb drive that has copies of Clinton=92s=
 work emails. But most details of the investigation have remained secret. I=
t=92s even unclear at this point whether the FBI probe is just a preliminar=
y inquiry or if it has evolved into a true investigation, according to Poli=
tico<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/hillary-clinton-email-fbi-probe-=
215630>.

Describing the inquiry, FBI Director James Comey told Congress in October 2=
015, "The FBI is working on a referral given to us by inspectors general in=
 connection with former Sec. Clinton=92s use of a private email server."

He declined to give any more specifics.

Earlier this month, Fox News<http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/11/fbi=
s-clinton-probe-expands-to-public-corruption-track.html> reported that the =
FBI was broadening its investigation to look into whether any connection be=
tween the State Department under Clinton and the nonprofit Clinton Foundati=
on violated public corruption laws. Clinton denied that FBI was pursuing th=
is line of inquiry.

However, Fox bases its report on unnamed sources, so we cannot independentl=
y verify it, nor have any major media outlets.

Bush=92s campaign and the FBI did not respond to our requests for comment i=
n time for publication.

Our ruling

Bush said Clinton is "under investigation with the FBI right now."

Not quite. The FBI is conducting a general inquiry into the security of Cli=
nton=92s private email server. But law enforcement officials have said Clin=
ton herself is not the target of the inquiry, and it is not a full-blown cr=
iminal investigation.

Clinton=92s actions are clearly front-and-center in an FBI investigation. B=
ut Bush goes too far to claim Clinton herself is under investigation. We ra=
te his statement Half True.
