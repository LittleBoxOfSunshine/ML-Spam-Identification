 Forces Event

Out of Town Pool Report #3
POTUS Speaks at USO/Joining Forces Event

The USO/Joining Forces event is open press and being streamed on the Whit=
e House website, so this will not be a verbatim report.

Event is being held in a large hanger at JBA.  Crowd estimate is 1,300 pe=
r
Kristina M. Sawtelle, Capt USAF.  It is mostly military personnel in oliv=
e green fatigues and their families in civilian garb.   Two large screens=
 have been set up at the left and right of the podium.

J.D Crouch, USO CEO, opens the ceremonies shortly after 6:00 p.m. and not=
es the event is pegged to Military Spouse Appreciation Day which is tomor=
row.  "It has been the profound privilege of the USO to be the force behi=
nd the forces," Crouch says.  (Please check all quotes with official tran=
script.)

In noting the Joining Forces.Gov program spearheaded by Mrs. Obama and Mr=
s. Biden, Crouch says the effort springs from their desire to recognize t=
hat, "When one member of a family serves, everyone serves."

At 6:13 p.m., Crouch introduces Jon Stewart, the program host, wearing a =
blue hat with a USO logo.  "We need to get the whole country involved and=
 tell your story," Stewart says, adding "And it was so much easier to get=
 here than when I went to Kabul. "

At 6:18 p.m., Stewart introduces Vice President Biden saying "He is alway=
s a guy we have fun with because he is always unpredictable."  Biden is g=
reeted with a standing ovation.

"I was going to say something nice about Jon but the hell with it," Biden=
 says before thanking Stewart for his efforts on behalf of 9-11 workers. =
 Biden is dressed in blue, pin stripe sui, white shirt, and blue tie.  Th=
e Vice President talks about his son, Beau, returning to the US from Iraq=
 in the middle of the night and being greeted by USO workers.  'We also r=
emember how the USO embraced us when we lost Beau," VPOTUS said.  Biden t=
ells the troops on hand they are part of "an unbroken chain of patriotism=
."

At 6:24 p.m. Biden begins his introduction of POTUS.  "Every decision he =
makes, he makes with you and your families in mind," Biden says.  The Com=
mander in Chief gets a loud standing ovation.

POTUS is in a dark suit and what, from the screen, appears to be a white =
shirt and a dark blue tie.  "Any jokes they tell about me, you should not=
 laugh," POTUS quips.  He adds that this is his second comedy show of the=
 week, referring to the WHCA dinner, adding the "good news is there are n=
o tuxedos here."

POTUS thanks the Air Force unit that cares for Air Force Once. "We don't =
take you for granted," he says. Discussing the military generally POTUS s=
ays, "The work of doing right by you is never done."

At 6:33 p.m., POTUS begins introducing Dr. Jill Biden and the First Lady,=
 discussing their work on Joining Forces.  "I could not be prouder of two=
 people who are smart, and dedicated and charismatic," POTUS says.  A lou=
d standing ovation ensues.

Dr. Biden begins speaking at 6:38 p.m.  She begins with a tribute to the =
USO.  "Your work was one of the reasons Michelle and I started Joining Fo=
rces," Dr. Biden says.  "To all of the military and their families here t=
onight, you are our heroes," she says.

At 6:41 p.m., Dr Biden introduces FLOTUS who is greeted by a loud standin=
g ovation. Mrs. Obama says, "In order to get four of us on a stage is rea=
lly hard.....we all care, you mean so much to us."  She adds that,  "When=
 people hear about you, they want to step up."

The First Lady continues, "The courage, the honor, the boundless love of =
this country, that is what we have come to know....Serving you has been o=
ne of the greatest privileges of our lives."

More to come
