NV Convention Talking Points

Violence is Unacceptable


  *   First, let me be clear, at the DNC we are neutral in this primary.
  *   That said, violence and intimidation are absolutely unacceptable in o=
ur Democracy and in our primary process, and it is incumbent upon all of us=
 in positions of leadership to speak out against it.

  *   This was a State Democratic Party event, not a DNC event, so I was no=
t present for what happened.
     *   But I was immediately concerned when I saw the videos and read the=
 troubling details about the conduct on display by some participants in Nev=
ada on Saturday.
     *   We are reaching out to both campaigns and calling on every Democra=
t to denounce threats of violence and intimidation, they don=92t serve any =
of our candidates well.

Roberta Lange and Private Property

  *   It=92s especially troubling that the threats went beyond the hall. Ro=
berta Lang, the Nevada Democratic Chair, was simply performing her duty as =
Chair and has done nothing to deserve the disgusting attacks and death thre=
ats she has received over text, emails and over the phone.
     *   The individuals launching these attacks =96 as well as the vandali=
sm that took place over the weekend -- should be ashamed.

We=92re Better Than Trump

  *   Energy and passion for a candidate are absolutely welcome as part of =
this process.
     *   The vast majority of Democrats who have already participated in ou=
r primary have done so appropriately -- with  enthusiasm and civility.
     *   For those who let their passion turn to rage when things don=92t g=
o their way, well that=92s better left to the ugliness we=92ve seen at Dona=
ld Trump=92s rallies, it doesn=92t belong on the Democratic side.

The Rules of This Process are Not New


  *   The rules governing the Democratic Party delegate selection process h=
ave been in place for decades and the specific procedures for this cycle we=
re agreed upon in 2014.


  *   The system for determining these rules has been fair and transparent.
     *   It is the same process that ultimately led to the nomination of Ba=
rack Obama in 2008, for example.


  *   Shouting down any democratic process isn=92t just disruptive, it=92s =
unacceptable. We need to come together and be united.
     *   If there are legitimate concerns from the supporters of either Dem=
ocratic campaign, those concerns can, should and must be addressed in an or=
derly, civil and peaceful manner.

Alaska State Convention


  *   It is possible to show your passion and to disagree openly with our p=
arty leaders or the process in a meaningful and peaceful way.
  *   On Saturday, I was in Alaska for their state convention. This is a st=
ate that supported Senator Sanders in their primary by 82%.
     *   There was no shouting. No threats of violence. And I received a st=
anding ovation because the people in that room know we can=92t afford what =
a Trump presidency would do to our country.
  *   That=92s the example we should be following. And as long as we do, I=
=92m convinced we will absolutely be a unified party at our National Conven=
tion.

If Asked About the 64 Delegates


  *   Look I wasn=92t there but my understanding is that there was a proces=
s in place to address these concerns and both campaigns were equally repres=
ented in the credentials committee who was charged with resolving these dis=
putes.  that made decisions about those possible delegates.  But ultimately=
 no matter what happened, there is no need to resort to violence.  The Demo=
cratic Party is a party of ideas and substance and the last thing we would =
want is for these frustrations to overshadow the important and substantive =
ideas our candidates have to offer.
  *   Six were seated but the vast majority couldn=92t be, because as one o=
f Sanders=92 own organizers wrote on Facebook, their people didn=92t all sh=
ow up.
  *   Only 8 of the 64 individuals were even present at the convention.
  *   So the suggestion that there were 64 individuals who were marginalize=
d to tip the scales is simply not consistent with what happened. We need fo=
r both campaigns to understand that there is process in place and that rega=
rdless of the outcome violence should not be condoned. Period  and that rec=
ognize that they won=92t always get their way, and when that happens, it do=
esn=92t mean anyone rigged the system, it simply means they lost. Period.
