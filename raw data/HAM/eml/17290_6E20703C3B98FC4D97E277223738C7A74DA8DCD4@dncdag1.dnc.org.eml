Washington, D.C. - Today the New York Times' Editorial Board delivered<http=
://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/25/opinion/a-state-bucks-the-trend-on-voting-rig=
hts.html?_r=3D0> a forceful and important endorsement of Virginia Governor =
Terry McAuliffe's executive action restoring the voting rights of former co=
nvicted felons who have paid their dues to society. Reaffirming the Democra=
tic Party's commitment to protecting the right to vote, the DNC's Vice Chai=
r of Voter Registration and Participation, Donna Brazile, also applauded Vi=
rginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's actions today. Below is her statement, fo=
llowed by a link and the text of the New York Times' editorial:

Statement by DNC Vice Chair of Voter Registration and Participation Donna B=
razile:

"The Democratic Party applauds Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's decision=
 to restore the voting rights of over 200,000 citizens. Terry and I first s=
tarted working on voting rights together when he was the DNC Chair, and he =
helped established the Voting Rights Institute. Democrats across the nation=
 believe the right to vote is our most fundamental right - it is the right =
that protects and preserves all of our other rights and freedoms. Democrats=
 also know that we solve our nation's problems with more democracy, not les=
s.

"The contrast between our two national parties has never been more stark th=
an on the issue of our democracy.  Sadly, restricting access to the ballot =
box has become the political strategy for the Republican Party. We have wit=
nessed Republican-led legislatures in Arizona, North Carolina, Ohio, Wiscon=
sin and elsewhere make it harder to vote by eliminating same-day registrati=
on, reducing early voting, eliminating polling locations, and imposing stri=
ct Photo ID laws.  Democrats, however, are actively fighting to the expandi=
ng expand voter access in states like Virginia, California, Pennsylvania, W=
est Virginia, and Vermont and everywhere in between. We are fighting in sta=
te houses to pass automatic registration, implement online voter registrati=
on, expand early voting and same-day registration. Democrats in Congress ar=
e working to restore the full strength of the Voting Rights Act.

"When long lines form or citizens are unable to overcome election burdens, =
Republicans blame the problem on 'too many voters' and celebrate those burd=
ens as a key to their general election victory. Meanwhile, New York Democra=
ts are holding people accountable and actively seeking answers.  Because Re=
publicans don't hold themselves accountable for election failures, the Demo=
cratic National Committee and its partners are doing so for them by filing =
suit in Arizona to reverse the culture of discrimination and disenfranchise=
ment.

"Today's action is a reminder that elections matter. Our nation and our dem=
ocracy are stronger and healthier when we elect Democrats up and down the t=
icket."

New York Times Editorial:

A State Bucks the Trend on Voting Rights<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/25/=
opinion/a-state-bucks-the-trend-on-voting-rights.html?_r=3D1>
NEW YORK TIMES // EDITORIAL BOARD
In a major executive order, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia on Friday rest=
ored voting rights to more than 200,000 people<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/=
04/23/us/governor-terry-mcauliffe-virginia-voting-rights-convicted-felons.h=
tml?action=3DClick&contentCollection=3DBreakingNews&contentID=3D62547929&pg=
type=3DHomepage> who have completed their sentences for felony convictions.=
 Virginia was one of four states, along with Iowa, Kentucky and Florida, th=
at placed a lifetime bar on voting for anyone convicted of a felony. All ot=
her states except Maine and Vermont impose lesser restrictions on voting by=
 people with felony convictions.

To people who have served their time and finished parole, Mr. McAuliffe sai=
d in a statement: "I want you back in society. I want you feeling good abou=
t yourself. I want you voting, getting a job, paying taxes." It is the larg=
est restoration of voting rights by a governor, ever.

Felon disenfranchisement laws, which currently block nearly six million Ame=
ricans<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/opinion/6-million-americans-withou=
t-a-voice.html> from voting, were enacted during the Reconstruction era in =
a racist effort<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/opinion/the-racist-origin=
s-of-felon-disenfranchisement.html> to make it harder for newly freed Afric=
an-Americans to vote - a reality Mr. McAuliffe acknowledged on Friday. "The=
re's no question that we've had a horrible history in voting rights as rela=
tes to African-Americans - we should remedy it," he said. In Virginia, one =
in five blacks have until now been unable to vote because of a felony convi=
ction.

Mr. McAuliffe's historic act, which he took in the face of opposition by th=
e state's Republican-led General Assembly, is all the more notable against =
the backdrop of persistent attempts by conservative lawmakers and officials=
 around the country to make voting harder or impossible for minority voters=
, who tend to vote Democratic. (A similar executive order<http://takingnote=
.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/kentuckys-governor-lets-the-formerly-incarcer=
ated-people-vote/> issued last year by Steven Beshear, the Democratic gover=
nor of Kentucky, was quickly reversed<http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2=
015/12/28/kentuckys-new-governor-takes-back-the-vote/> by his successor, Ma=
tt Bevin, a Republican.)

Until 2013, it was much easier to block discriminatory voting laws. Under t=
he Voting Rights Act, all or parts of 16 states, most in the South, with a =
history of passing such laws were required to get permission from the Justi=
ce Department before making any voting changes. But in the case of Shelby C=
ounty v. Holder<http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-96_6k47.pdf>,=
 five Supreme Court justices disabled that requirement, known as preclearan=
ce.

Now that federal oversight is gone, officials in previously monitored juris=
dictions have rushed to impose a slew of new voting laws and regulations, a=
ccording to a running tally<http://www.naacpldf.org/files/case_issue/States=
%20and%20Localities%27%20Responses%20to%20Shelby%20County%2C%20Alabama%20v.=
%20Holder%20as%20of%204.15.2016.PDF> by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educati=
onal Fund. These changes have, among other things, moved or closed polling =
places, shortened or canceled early-voting periods, required proof of citiz=
enship or a photo identification to register to vote, erroneously purged vo=
ters from the rolls and gerrymandered districts to dilute the power of mino=
rity voters.

When the preclearance requirement, known as Section 5, was in place, change=
s like these were routinely blocked for being racially discriminatory. With=
out the requirement, it is impossible to know how many changes are being en=
acted or attempted, because most happen at the local level and are not broa=
dly reported. It is unlikely that there would be fewer changes than in the =
decade before the Shelby County ruling, when the Justice Department each ye=
ar received between 4,500 and 5,500 submissions, and reviewed between 14,00=
0 and 20,000 voting changes. <https://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/c=
hanges.php> While the vast majority were approved, the federal government b=
locked more than 700 between 1982 and 2006, when the law was last reauthori=
zed by Congress.

Now, in the absence of a strong pre-emptive tool like Section 5, the only m=
eaningful remedy to a discriminatory voting change is litigation, an expens=
ive and time-consuming process that often comes too late to help voters who=
 were harmed by new discriminatory laws.

Discrimination in voting, of course, is not limited to the previously cover=
ed states. Lawmakers in Ohio<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ohio-hit-lawsuit-ov=
er-gop-passed-voting-restrictions> and Wisconsin<http://www.nytimes.com/201=
4/10/13/opinion/the-big-lie-behind-voter-id-laws.html>, for example, have g=
one to great lengths to complicate voting for minorities in those states by=
, among other things, enacting voter-ID laws or reducing early-voting perio=
ds. Since the 2012 presidential election, 17 states<https://www.brennancent=
er.org/voting-restrictions-first-time-2016> have enacted new restrictions o=
n voting, many of which burden minority voters more heavily, according to t=
he Brennan Center for Justice.

Congress should amend the Voting Rights Act to restore preclearance and app=
ly it to all jurisdictions with a recent history of discriminatory voting p=
ractices. And state officials who are not busy trying to disenfranchise peo=
ple should be following Mr. McAuliffe's example, and working to make it eas=
ier for people to vote.
