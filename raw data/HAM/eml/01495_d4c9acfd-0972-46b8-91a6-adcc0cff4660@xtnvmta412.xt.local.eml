By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)

 

Good Wednesday morning. SNEAK PEEK - Ivanka Trump to Norah O'Donnell on "CBS This Morning," re the N.Y. Times article about her father and women: "I'm not in every interaction my father has. But he's not a groper. It's not who he is. And I've known my father obviously my whole life. And he has total respect for women. He was promoting women in development and construction at a time when it was unheard of. There was no trend towards equality in the real estate and construction industry back in the 1980s. And he was doing it because he believes ultimately in merit."

 

COMING ATTRACTIONS: Members of the conservative intelligentsia aching for a Republican to run independent against Trump have concluded that there is "a difficult but viable path" for an independent, based largely on the unusual unpopularity of the two nominees. A well-known conservative told us the final three possibilities are Sen. Ben Sasse, age 44, of Nebraska; Sen. Tom Coburn, 68, of Wyoming; and Mitt Romney, 69.

This conservative told us to expect renewed buzz around this possibility over the next week, and sees "a 50-50 chance that one of the three will do it."

 

TRUMP STRATEGERY - "Bucking trends, Trump sends teams to Democrat-leaning states," by AP's Steve Peoples, with Julie Bykowicz, Jill Colvin and Julie Pace: "Trump is rushing to install operatives in several states that traditionally favor Democrats, pointing to a general election plan consistent with the campaign he has run thus far: Defying conventional wisdom and political trends. The staffing expansion includes Maine, Minnesota and other places where Trump opens as the underdog, with the New York billionaire seeking to expand the electoral battlefield by drawing on his appeal among working class white voters ...

"[I]t is an unlikely path to the White House, through states that no Republican presidential candidate has carried since the 1980s. ... The Trump campaign has identified roughly 15 states where it plans to install state directors by the end of the month. They include traditional battlegrounds like Ohio, Florida and Virginia and more challenging terrain such as Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Maine - places Republican have lost for the last six presidential elections or longer.

"Target states also will likely include Republican-leaning Georgia, where demographic shifts benefit Democrats. ...

 

"Trump's team is scrambling to build a national organization essentially from scratch. 'Up until three weeks ago, there were 102 or 103 employees, which is fewer than Ben Carson had in January,' Trump aide Barry Bennett said. 'Today, that number is much bigger, and it's growing every day.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4e4d4d9f00ecfa7fea6e593194684e77eb5ff7ad6905ab72a403d38ac69e1128

 

SWEATING THE BERN: With 99% of the vote in (all but 4 of 3,696 precincts), AP left Kentucky's Democratic presidential primary "too close to call. ... The tight margin means that the two will split the state's delegates fairly evenly." Clinton has 46.8% to Sanders' 46.3%. That's 212,549 votes to 210,626 - a landslide margin of 1,923 out of 454,609 cast (Martin O'Malley got 1.3%, among other randos). Sanders won Oregon by 9 points.

--After Clinton and Sanders traded leads through the evening, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Clinton supporter, told CNN she was the "unofficial" winner.

--Paul Begala said on CNN that the victory was "tighter than a Speedo on Chris Christie."

--CNN's Eric Bradner: "Sanders won more delegates than Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night -- but not enough to slow Clinton's march to the ... nomination." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4e4d4d9f00ecfa7ff8aa9304f4aa87ebd26520dd8dc8f65da6b6e19dec9de9f9

--AP's Stephen Ohlemacher and Hope Yen: "Just 155 delegates short, Clinton is on a glide path to the number needed to win on June 7 when polls close in New Jersey at 8 p.m., ... even if she narrowly loses all the contests between now and then." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4e4d4d9f00ecfa7f8192ec14f0d9ed1e095762586f80e58f1880628ccd7da538

--@HillaryClinton celebrated by twice tweeting a donation link: "We just won Kentucky! Thanks to everyone who turned out. We're always stronger united. ... Hillary just won Kentucky, but this election is just getting started. Chip in now if you've got her back."

PULLING BACK THE CAMERA -- "Clinton's joyless victory: Her narrow Kentucky win is a temporary comfort in a week that exposed a deep Democratic rift," by Gabe Debenedetti: "Clinton's narrow Kentucky win - her lone state victory in the month of May, and one that ensured she wouldn't go five weeks without winning a state ... was paired with a loss in Oregon during a week when Sanders supporters appeared more emboldened and committed than ever, despite the senator's all-but-impossible path to the nomination. ...

"Now, eyeing a two-and-a-half week lull before the next Democratic contests, Clinton faces the task of erasing the perception that she is a wounded front-runner while at the same time competing with ... Trump for a bite of the news cycle. ... Sanders can point to 22 victories - with the possibility of a few more to come - providing him with more bargaining power than any runner-up in recent history as he looks to shape the party platform and reform the nominating process." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4e4d4d9f00ecfa7f0d7ec78ae9777ca45176fd97776de29fbe0ca7787921bae3

BUT, BUT, BUT ... One of our favorite Oregon Democrats writes from out West: "Gas coming out of the Bernie Balloon. Oregon built to feel the bern -- and he was all over and spent a ton here. ... [9] pts doesn't feel like much of a win. There's a sense that maybe Bernie is getting out of his depth ... Time for him to get on board and stop helping Trump trash her."

VEEP INTRIGUE -- "Can Tim Kaine be Hillary Clinton's attack dog? Democrats worry he lacks the bite to take on the ultimate alpha male: Donald J. Trump," by Isaac Dovere: "Lining up against Kaine is the boring factor - both that he doesn't come off as the most interesting person himself, and that at this point, his selection is so widely expected that the announcement wouldn't excite many in the political world or the political press corps. Being the white guy won't automatically excite the Obama coalition, and at 58 he's old enough not to be a young, fresh contrast to Clinton." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4e4d4d9f00ecfa7f8d37e2af4e51a17e19aad9c5a77c0d57082b03a54a192e0e

 

ROBERT DRAPER on the cover of the upcoming Sunday's N.Y. Times magazine, "Mr. Trump's Wild Ride: Down the homestretch with the impossible nominee": "On the more conventional presidential campaigns I have covered ... the candidate's mobile inner sanctum was a hive of activity, the advisers hovering constantly over their boss ... On Trump's plane, the aides spoke when spoken to and otherwise kept to their labors on their laptops. ... [F]or all his swagger, Trump ... was compulsively superstitious; twice on other plane trips I had seen him toss a few granules of salt over his left shoulder after eating. ...

"I asked Trump if he had ever been to Iraq. 'Never!' he said, sounding horrified by the thought. 'What's the most dangerous place in the world you've been to?' He contemplated this for a second. 'Brooklyn,' he said, laughing. 'No,' he went on, 'there are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously.' It was a stark reminder of what set Trump apart from every other politician in recent memory who had occupied his current position: how little of the world he had seen beyond the archipelago of boardrooms, golf courses and high-rise hotels he inhabited ...

"In his briefcase, [Corey] Lewandowski carried a bulky black binder. It contained virtually everything of significance in Trump's political universe: the daily, weekly and monthly master schedules; the full staff list with everyone's contact information; a similar list of the campaign's various contractors; daily talking points for staff and surrogates; a running tally of the delegate count; a list of Trump endorsers; a metrics chart of field activities in each state, including the daily number of calls made and doors knocked; position papers on each major issue; various documents requiring the candidate's signature; and drafts of coming speeches."

CLICKER - "Megyn Kelly Special: Trump defends tone, says bid will be 'complete waste' if he doesn't win" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4e4d4d9f00ecfa7f7a483da23ce5dc398bb412ecffc04d831038025bd684e88a ...

--L.A. Times A1 tease: "Kelly didn't ask Donald Trump to headline her special so she could get back at him or pin him down on policy issues. 'No, she invited him to co-star in an hourlong infomercial for her [forthcoming] book,' writes critic Mary McNamara." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4e4d4d9f00ecfa7f89548974a9b533fd396f9cdd12f6de615b1d4de8beda0e8c

--Bill Carter (@wjcarter): "Taped days ago, so nada re self impersonation or nyt piece. Great for DT tho. If it had been any softer, it would come on a cone w a swirl."

 

GABE SHERMAN in NYMag, "Why Rupert Murdoch Decided to Back Donald Trump": "Murdoch's embrace of Trump is a sharp reversal from the hostile view he held over much of the past year. In fact ... it was Murdoch himself who directed Kelly to hammer Trump during the debut GOP debate, in Cleveland, that sparked the feud in the first place. 'Rupert told her to do that,' [said a source] ... The Murdoch-Trump alliance is the result of at least two private meetings between the billionaires this spring as well as phone calls from Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Murdoch's view ... is that Trump is a winner whom the 'elites' failed to take seriously. ... If Trump gets into the White House, Murdoch
 will likely have an open line to the new administration (at least as open as anyone can have with Trump). And, if Trump loses to Hillary Clinton, then Murdoch's right-wing outlets have a ready-made enemy to beat up on for the next four years. That's a deal Trump can surely respect." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4e4d4d9f00ecfa7f2ce7a10182c9aa25fd33d78784e5172bb6c43089ce7cb3f2 

 

JASON ZENGERLE in GQ, "Bill Clinton's Big Moment: His Health, His Battle Plan for Trump, and What He'll Do if Hillary Wins": "Although they're rarely in the same state-or even the same time zone-at any given moment, they talk on the phone throughout the day. Those conversations can become even more frequent when the campaign hits a rough patch. 'In 2008, he was constantly psycho-dialing Hillary, just calling and calling until she'd pick up, to give advice,' says a veteran Democratic operative. 'You want to keep Hillary pretty Zen and calm, and he can obviously interfere with that. I think the campaign staff this time are doing a pretty good job of managing his access to her when she's on
 the road." ...

"Bill tends to blame any of Hillary's missteps on her campaign. 'He's not Hillary's Hillary,' says an old Clinton loyalist. 'He doesn't go to her and say, "You're screwing this up."' http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4e4d4d9f00ecfa7fe8640a9753446251008499d8b84868f16b649f6008932826

So I talked to someone smarter than me about it," by The Fix's Chris Cillizza: FIX: "Rubio insists he is not at all undecided about his future. What's your sense on where he's headed?" Caputo: "Rubio's headed to the private sector, but I don't know where. He said he doesn't want to be a lobbyist or work for Wall Street and that he wants to come home to Miami (he lives in West Miami, technically). The financial bottom line aside, the bottom line for his new job is that it will have to add to his private-sector experience and/or round out his r&eacute;sum&eacute;." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4e4d4d9f00ecfa7f72f7da96920afe5f01e89772b6984c5fd051f43f82a46519

MEDIAWATCH - "Fox News makes appeal to host last Democratic presidential primary debate," by WashPost's Erik Wemple: "The network [on Tuesday] sent letters to both Democratic presidential aspirants - Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton - requesting their participation in a debate to take place in California before the state's June 7 primary. 'Democrats have not debated on Fox News for the last 12 years,' reads the letter to Sanders. 'By ending that dry spell, perhaps the party can bring some sense of closure to this long and robust primary season. In the process, you and Secretary Clinton will reach a vast number of viewers - many of whom are certainly open to persuasion - just as we pivot
 to the general election.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4e4d4d9f00ecfa7f2d2b1cf32afc379ec6bc9195d37ce8acc5b967f213e08920

ENGAGED! Michelle Fields, ex-Breitbart reporter and a conservative commentator, to Jamie Weinstein, senior editor at The Daily Caller - Michelle emails us: "We met at the Daily Caller as reporters! Jamie had a helicopter take me to a mountain in Malibu next to Pepperdine (where I went to college) and there was a picnic with champagne and roses set up and he proposed to me. We met in 2011 when I started [at] the Caller. Tucker placed me in the same office as Jamie."

If Trump gets into the White House, Murdoch will likely have an open line to the new administration (at least as
 open as anyone can have with Trump). And, if Trump loses to Hillary Clinton, then Murdoch's right-wing outlets have a ready-made enemy to beat up on for the next four years.

<b>MEDIAWATCH - &quot;Fox News makes appeal to host last Democratic presidential primary debate,&quot; by WashPost's Erik Wemple: 
</b>&quot;The network [on Tuesday] sent letters to both Democratic presidential aspirants - Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton - requesting their participation in a debate to take place in California before the state's June 7 primary. 'Democrats have not debated on Fox News for the last 12 years,' reads the letter to Sanders. 'By ending that dry spell, perhaps the party can bring some sense of closure to this long and robust primary season. In the process, you and Secretary Clinton will reach a vast number of viewers - many of whom are certainly open to persuasion - just as we pivot to the general election.'&quot;
