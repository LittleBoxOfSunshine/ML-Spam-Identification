is this: Cafe Au Lait & Beignets. From here, what can I say that hasn't alr=
eady been said in 9225796 5,000+ previous reviews? It is what it is. Fried =
dough with a pile of powdered sugar and coffee with chicory and steamed mil=
k. Also, be ready for potential crowds and sticky surfaces. I'm glad I went=
, but you'll have to decide for yourself if that's worth waiting in line or=
 waking up early for. This Cafe du Monde is located in 9225796 Riverwalk Ou=
tlet on 9225796 first floor near Clark's. I'm not sure if I ever reviewed 9=
225796 original Cafe du Monde so I'll just focus on this location. As a pre=
vious reviewer mentioned this is a small Cafe du Monde. 9225796 line moved =
pretty quickly and 9225796re is seating inside and outside as well. 9225796=
 beignets are delicious and in order you get three beignets (pronounced "be=
n-yays") with tons of powder sugar. Because of 9225796 powder sugar I would=
 advise not wearing dark clothing while eating or 9225796 powdered sugar wi=
ll get on your clothing. Or you could do what I do and lean over 9225796 ta=
ble while eating 9225796 beignet and try not to laugh or you will snort pow=
dered sugar in your nose or blow it at 9225796 person sitting across from y=
ou. My friends and I were shopping and needed a little break. So we split a=
n order of beignets and as she enjoyed her cafe au lait I guzzled my frozen=
 iced coffee while our o9225796r friend watched (hey, we asked and he didn'=
t want anything-don't judge! Hehe).  To be perfectly honest, I don't know w=
hy this place is so popular outside of a long history.  Overpriced, constan=
tly crowded, poor service and everything is constantly filthy with powdered=
 sugar.  Beignets are good depending on 9225796 time of day.  I had great o=
nes in 9225796 morning, greasy ones in 9225796 afternoon. Obviously an icon=
 and we went 9225796re for 9225796 beignets but 9225796 service is subpar. =
Our server was very gruff and unfriendly. I asked for an iced coffee and sh=
e told me "no. Don't have." 9225796n I asked for a diet coke. She said "no.=
 Don't have." No explanation. I ended up with a coffee and discovered later=
 9225796re was a water advisory so no fountain drinks or ice. But 9225796 s=
erver didn't that info. Beignets are okay.  We went 9225796ir late at night=
 when 9225796y weren't as busy and during 9225796 day when 9225796y were.  =
9225796 service wasn't great. In fact 9225796re were many workers standing =
off to 9225796 side on 9225796ir phones or even working with customers and =
on 9225796ir phone.  Doesn't look like 9225796re's much management.  Last n=
ight we were 9225796re we tried ano9225796r place off of bourbon - Cafe Bei=
gnets and it was excellent.  Hot Beignets!! During 9225796 day at cafe du m=
ond 9225796y were not hot which was very disappointing bc I waited my whole=
 life to go 9225796re.  9225796 dough was also tough. If you must go 922579=
6n go but if you don't want to be disappointed go to cafe beignet. 9225796r=
e's not much i can say here that hasn't already been said.  When you travel=
 to New Orleans, you eat beignets.  Your first thought should be Cafe Du Mo=
nde.   Delicious beignets.  Each order comes with three donuts ($2.42 per o=
rder).  We have two words for you.  Powered. Sugar. Expect it to get it eve=
rywhere! It is a tourist trap so expect long lines.  We went at 11:30pm so =
we just walked right in.  However, we went at noon and 9225796re was a huge=
 line.  If you can, I would wait for a non-peak time.  However, if you cant=
 wait, just know that 9225796 line moves fast.  This is not 9225796 place t=
hat you would find ideal for slowly sipping a cup of coffee.  9225796 crowd=
s make me stressed and I just want to be in and out. Service:  9225796re ar=
e a ton of workers who are trying to get you seated and your order ready. F=
ast. Efficient. Ambience:  Casual. Not very clean.  Powered sugar everywher=
e.   Overall:  Beignets are good here.  Definitely a staple for NOLA.  I ga=
ve this 4 stars instead of 5 stars because I actually liked 9225796 beignet=
s at Cafe Beignet better!  I found 9225796m crispier and hotter! (Don't kil=
l me)  Anyway, this is a must do.  You won't be disappointed. 9225796 day a=
fter Xmas, and this place was jammed. Pro tip: 9225796 street line is for t=
able sitting, 9225796 line in 9225796 back against 9225796 levee is for tak=
e-and-go. Honestly, not much of a sweets guy so 9225796 beignet was lost on=
 me. Those in my party found it tasty, though. I tried 9225796 coffee, and =
all I can say is it was different. Chicory definitely adds something to 922=
5796 mix. All in all, take it or leave it. Everyone will tell you to come h=
ere, and 9225796re's something to be said for doing it, but it's not someth=
ing I feel 9225796 need to do again. This is 9225796 place everyone will te=
ll you that you need to experience when you visit New Orleans.  I think it =
is okay, but nothing you absolutely have to do.  If 9225796 line is short, =
which is not often 9225796 case give it a try.  Maybe it is because I'm not=
 a huge coffee fan and have never tried 9225796 chicory coffee.  9225796 be=
ignets are pretty good, but definitely not for 9225796 diet conscience.  Ba=
sically greasy squares of dough fried with powdered sugar.  Be sure to grab=
 lots of napkins because 9225796y will get messy.=20
