FACT CHECK: REPUBLICANS WILL NOT PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY



Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee are discussing various ways to roll back S=
ocial Security benefits.



Republicans want to take away benefits from Americans who are already worki=
ng longer hours right now.  They endorse plans to privatize Social Security=
, call it a "ponzi scheme" and believe that this crucial protection for Ame=
rica's seniors has "weakened us as a people."



This extreme conservative ideology won't improve the lives of America's sen=
iors.  It will fail them.



Jeb Bush Suggested The Social Security Retirement Age Should Be Increased F=
rom 65 To Up To 70. Bush: "People that already have this supplemental retir=
ement system, which is a contract -- I don't think we violate that. For peo=
ple that are about ready to be, be beneficiaries of their supplemental reti=
rement, I don't think we change that. But we need to look over the horizon =
and begin to phase in, over an extended period of time, going from 65 to 68=
 or 70." [CBS News, 5/31/15<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bush-promises-n=
o-coordination-with-super-pac-if-he-runs/>]



*         Jeb Bush Called For Introducing Private Retirement Accounts As On=
e Of The "Main Reforms" To Social Security. "GIBSON: Governor Bush, Alan Gr=
eenspan says you are going to have to cut Social Security benefits. What do=
es President Bush say? J. BUSH: I think what Alan Greenspan says is that yo=
u have to reform Social Security. And one of the main reforms is to allow f=
or younger workers, not for the people that are already on Social Security =
or the people that are about ready to get on it, to have the option of priv=
ate retirement accounts." [The Big Story with John Gibson, Fox News, 2/26/0=
4]



Yahoo: "Christie Would Also Raise The Normal Retirement Age For Social Secu=
rity -Quickly, By Actuarial Standards - To 69 (It's Currently Headed For 67=
) And The Early-Retirement Age From 62 To 64." [Yahoo, 4/14/15<https://www.=

Rubio On Social Security: "We Need To Increase The Retirement Age For Futur=
e Retirees."  RUBIO: "This is some progress in adjusting Social Security to=
 the modern era, but not enough to ensure that the program will be there fo=
r your kids and my kids. We need to increase the retirement age for future =
retirees to account for the rise in life expectancy." [Marco Rubio, America=
n Dreams, 1/13/15]



Ted Cruz On Whether Social Security Is A Ponzi Scheme: "There's No Doubt Th=
at's What It Is." "SMITH: So I'm going to take that as a yes. That you beli=
eve that social security is a Ponzi scheme. CRUZ: I think there is an effor=
t to treat that as rhetoric, but there's no doubt that's what it is." [Texa=
s Tribune Festival, 9/11/11]



*         Ted Cruz Supported Raising The Retirement Age And Means-Testing F=
or Social Security. CAVUTO: "So, what does that mean? Does that mean that y=
ou would eventually raise the retirement age? Would you means-test it? What=
?" CRUZ: "Well, it means you do both." [Your World With Neil Cavuto, Fox Ne=
ws, 6/4/15]


Walker Said He Would Support Raising The Age To Qualify For Social Security=
. "At a forum Monday featuring 14 of the 17 major Republican candidates, Go=
v. Scott Walker suggested he would support raising the age to qualify for S=
ocial Security." [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 8/3/15<http://www.jsonline.co=

rum-tonight-b99550000z1-320535602.html>]



Ben Carson Called For Raising The Retirement Age. Dr Ben Carson: "When Soci=
al Security was first enacted, the average age of death was about 63 years.=
 It is now approaching 80 years and rising. Obviously we have to adjust to =
a changing situation. The age at which benefits are distributed should be g=
radually raised." [Forbes, 1/29/15<http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2=
015/01/29/potential-presidential-candidate-dr-ben-carson-on-social-security=
-glass-steagall-and-taxes/>]



Kasich Praised Bush's Social Security Privatization Plan. "A more attentive=
 reception was given Rep. John R. Kasich of Ohio, who praised Bush for show=
ing 'real courage and real leadership' in proposing reforms that would allo=
w Americans to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in stocks or=
 other private investments. 'You and I know that through voluntary personal=
 retirement accounts we can create wealth and personal security for ourselv=
es and our families in our most important years,' said Kasich, who briefly =
challenged the Texas governor in the GOP primaries." [Los Angeles Times, 8/=
3/00]



Rand Paul Said He Wanted To Individualize Social Security And Create Privat=
e Accounts. RAND PAUL: "I believe in less involvement in your retirement ac=
count, not more. I'd like to let you have a private account. I'd like to in=
dividualize Social Security and let you put it in an account with a number =
on and you log on and it's your money. If you die, you could give it to you=
r family." [Lars Larson Radio Show, 4/15/15]



Rand Paul And Lindsey Graham Put Forth A Proposal That Would Raise The Qual=
ifying Age For Social Security From 67 To 70 By 2032. "Under a proposal unv=
eiled by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Mike Lee (R-=
Utah), the qualifying age for Social Security would rise from 67 to 70 by 2=
032, while benefits for everyone earning more than an average of $43,000 ov=
er their lifetime would be reduced." [Mother Jones, 4/14/11<http://www.moth=
erjones.com/politics/2011/04/republican-social-security-cuts>]



Huckabee Urged Republicans To Use Creativity To Cut Social Security By Offe=
ring A "Onetime Buy-Out" For People With Other Retirement Plans. Huckabee: =
"Rather than say we will cut Social Security, there are a lot of who are no=
t expecting to live off of Social Security. We have 401Ks or KEOH plans or =
annuities. The last thing we expect is a couple hundred dollars to hang ont=
o. Here's what I think the government could do. Offer a onetime buy-out -- =
For people who have other kinds of options. Let it be tax free. They can ke=
ep it. They can give it to a child, tax free. They can give it anywhere the=
y want. It is their money, tax-free, one time. Age 65, they are done." [Ame=
rican Nightly Scoreboard, Fox Business, 1/20/11]



Jindal Supported George W. Bush's Plan Of Personal Accounts For Social Secu=
rity. "Jindal was for entitlement reform when entitlement reform wasn't coo=
l. In fact, his introduction to Washington was as staff director of Senator=
 Phil Gramm's bipartisan commission on Medicare, which developed one of the=
 earliest premium-support plans for the program. Jindal was an enthusiastic=
 backer of George W. Bush's plan for personal accounts for Social Security.=
" [National Review, 2/11/15<http://www.nationalreview.com/article/398361/de=
bt-and-gop-michael-tanner>]



Perry Called Social Security A Ponzi Scheme And Suggested That Allowing Pri=
vate Accounts Should Be On The Table When Discussing Social Security Reform=
 . In an interview with Sean Hannity, Perry was asked about Social Security=
 and said, "Here's what we know - that the program as it is set-up today is=
 not going be viable in the future for our young people. And those kids kno=
w what a Ponzi scheme is. As you are paying into something and it is going =
to be the ones that pay in first, and there's not a pay-out for them when t=
heir time comes. Kids know that...So, are we going to raise the age at whic=
h people become eligible for it? Are we going to allow the young Americans =
out there that are working to have private sector account-type options? All=
 of those are appropriate conversations to have." [Fox News, Hannity, 9/21/=

Santorum Emphasized His Embrace Of Private Accounts For Social Security. "H=
e also has reiterated his embrace of private accounts for Social Security, =
a plan that has been largely dropped by the GOP since the financial-market =
upheavals of 2007 and 2008. His embrace of President George W. Bush's plan =
to partially privatize Social Security was in part to blame for his re-elec=
tion defeat in 2006, when he lost his Senate seat to Bob Casey Jr. by 18 pe=
rcentage points. [Wall Street Journal, 6/7/11<http://online.wsj.com/article=
