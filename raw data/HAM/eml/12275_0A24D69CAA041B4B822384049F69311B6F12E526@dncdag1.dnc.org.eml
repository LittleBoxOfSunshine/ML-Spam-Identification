NEW YORK -- Donald Trump vowed Monday that if elected president he would re=
scind the Obama administration's new directives aimed at protecting transge=
nder people against discrimination in schools and health-care coverage.

But even as Trump accused the administration of federal overreach and argue=
d that such matters should be addressed by the states, the Republican Party=
's presumptive nominee also sounded a more compassionate tone and offered a=
 more nuanced outlook than many of his party's elected leaders.

Trump said in an interview with The Washington Post that the government mus=
t act "to protect all people" and that he was eager to learn more about the=
 movement for transgender rights.

"It is a very, very small portion of the population, but as I said, you hav=
e to protect everybody, including small portions of the population," Trump =
said during the interview at his 26th-floor office at Trump Tower here in M=
anhattan.

Last Friday, the Obama administration both directed public schools nationwi=
de to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice and pr=
ohibited health insurance providers from denying coverage and services base=
d on gender identity to transgender Americans.

The landmark directives sparked an immediate backlash from conservatives, w=
ho called them a violation of states' rights, as did Trump. Some prominent =
Republican leaders suggested the new rules would endanger innocent children=
. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), who threatened to sue, said Obama =
was trying to "bully Texas schools into allowing men to have open access to=
 girls in bathrooms."

But Trump, in a lengthy discussion on the issue Monday, spoke in a markedly=
 different manner. He repeatedly said transgender people should be protecte=
d under the law and said he believed most states would "make the right deci=
sions."

Asked if he thought the issue had been overblown, Trump said, "I don't thin=
k so, because you've got to protect all people, even though it's a tiny per=
centage of 1 percent. I think from that standpoint, [states] should come up=
 with a policy that=92s going to work for everybody and protect people."

Obama sees transgender rights as a modern civil rights issue, but Trump off=
ered a different characterization: "I think it's a people thing."

"I think we have to help people," Trump said. "I don=92t view it as civil r=
ights or not civil rights. I think it=92s something where we have to help p=
eople -- and hopefully the states will make the right decisions.=94

Asked whether he has had any personal exposure to transgender people, perha=
ps as an employer or through social settings, Trump said he did not.

=93I have not had any exposure to it at all," Trump said. He added, "Now, I=
 may not know about it, but I do not think I have any exposure to it from t=
he standpoint of knowing people."

But Trump said he wants to learn more about the transgender experience in A=
merica.

"It's actually a very interesting subject to me," Trump said. "It's certain=
ly an issue that's getting a lot of play and it's an issue that I'm studyin=
g very closely."
