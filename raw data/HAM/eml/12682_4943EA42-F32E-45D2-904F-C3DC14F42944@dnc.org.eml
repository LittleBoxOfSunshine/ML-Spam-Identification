Obama directive on transgender students' use of bathrooms?
I think it should be a state's decision

So you're against it?
it should be state's rights, like many things

reports that GOP Senators in meeting suggested you tone down your rhetoric on immigration ?
I don't think I toned it down
I want to have strong immigration and borders
No, I didn't tone it down
border patrol endorsed me, first time ever
willing to listen to people

you won't modify your positions to get their support, they have to come to you?
no, there are things we can talk about
I'm not totally inflexible on anything

do voters have the right to see your tax returns?
I don't think so
I will gladly release them when audit ends, that should be before the election
I laugh when Mrs. Clinton says that: when will she give emails or Goldman transcripts?
I get audited every single year

The audit is no excuse, the IRS has made it clear it's your choice. Nixon released while under audit and you released returns while seeking casino license in PA
as soon as the audit is over, I'll release them
people aren't going to learn anything
I released financials that show everything

if you were willing to release your returns to get casino license, why not release them to be President?
at the time, it made no difference to me, now it does
my tax returns are complex
there have been many Presidents who haven't released

every nominee since 1976 has
yes, but before 1976, people didn't do it

you show that stack of returns, but there are actually many things people can learn: do you have any foreign sources of income or Swiss or offshore bank accounts?
I do not
I don't have offshore bank accounts
I have a very clean company, otherwise it would've been reported
there was a feeding frenzy when I released my financials, they all said I have a great company

financials don't show tax rate
I fight very hard to pay as little in taxes as possible
our country wastes our tax money

what is your tax rate?
It's none of your business, you'll see when I release

you said you'd release them when Obama released his birth certificate, then you said you'd do it when HRC released her emails, and she's released all the ones in her possession...
she didn't turn over her emails, there are plenty missing
I know she's a good friend of yours and you worked for them and you didn't reveal it, but she did not
the whole thing is a scam

you said you'd release them under those conditions, now you're throwing up the audit
I never said that at all
I said I'd release them after the audit
Greta van Susteren said she agreed with me
