On ISIL, rhetoric is biggest divide between Obama, GOP candidates<http://ww=
w.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/12/13/republicans-islamic=
-state-obama-2016/77057846/>

USA TODAY // Heidi M Przybyla

The rhetoric of Republican presidential candidates blasting President Obama=
's approach to combating Islamic State terrorism suggests a huge policy div=
ide.

Ted Cruz accuses Obama of "leading from behind" and Donald Trump says he's =
"losing the war on terrorism," part of a verbal lashing they've administere=
d to the president since the shootings in San Bernardino, Calif.

Yet they're mostly proposing things the administration is already doing.

In the wake of the Paris terror attacks - and along with the Russians, Fren=
ch and British -  the U.S. has stepped up airstrikes, including of oil fiel=
ds, and sent in more special operations forces in addition to the roughly 3=
,500 troops advising and assisting in Iraq. The U.S.-led coalition helping =
to provide assistance to the Free Syrian Army has grown to 65 member countr=
ies, including Arab nations.

Although candidates like Marco Rubio have blasted Obama for not directly ar=
ming the Kurds, this has been happening indirectly through ground deliverie=
s and air drops in Kurdish-controlled areas to avoid a diplomatic strain wi=
th Turkey.

None of the major candidates is pushing for a major U.S. troop presence alo=
ng the lines of the  2003 invasion of Iraq, which would be a clear distinct=
ion with Obama. Mostly, they've offered colorful language about dropping bo=
mbs. Cruz said he'd make sand "glow in the dark," for instance, and Trump v=
owed to "bomb the hell" out of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISI=
L.

"The same criticism of President Obama's strategy with respect to ISIS can =
be leveled against virtually all of his critics," said Christopher Preble, =
vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute=
, a libertarian policy group. "This debate is misleading," he said.

The biggest difference between the two parties is the approach to immigrati=
on challenges at home, with Trump calling for a ban on non-citizen Muslims =
from entering the country and others supporting an indefinite ban on Syrian=
 refugees - and not the Middle Eastern ground battle that's so fiercely deb=
ated. The candidates are likely to be pressed for more specificity about th=
eir approaches at the first debate since the Calif. shootings, which will b=
e Tuesday in Las Vegas.

It's only been recently that a number of candidates, including Trump and Cr=
uz, who's openly opposed ground troops, have taken a more aggressive stance=
 about the U.S. role in the region. Hillary Clinton has backed a no-fly zon=
e in Syria, putting her at odds with the president and in step with many Re=
publicans including Jeb Bush. Yet that would necessitate a large number of =
troops, something they aren't proposing.

"No Republican candidate has defined what they intend to do, except defeat =
ISIS in the most generic sense," said Tony Cordesman, a national security e=
xpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who consulted t=
he departments of State and Defense during the Afghan and Iraq wars.

"This is almost a campaign of slogans rather than plans or solutions at eve=
ry level," said Cordesman, who has also advised Arizona Sen. John McCain, t=
he 2008 GOP presidential nominee.

The administration is gradually increasing troops on the ground in the regi=
on. This includes a special force to assist Kurdish Peshmerga, Defense Secr=
etary Ash Carter told a Senate panel Wednesday. Other than South Carolina S=
en. Lindsey Graham, who's called for 20,000 troops split between Syria and =
Iraq, the candidates aren't offering specifics. Ohio Gov. John Kasich has a=
lso broadly called for "boots on the ground."

In October, Trump called those advocating for more direct military interven=
tion "fools" who "basically want to start World War III over Syria." Even t=
he field's biggest hawks, like Rubio and Bush, say the bulk of ground troop=
s should be Arab fighters, a theoretical 100,000-strong force the administr=
ation has struggled to encourage.

"This is a radical Sunni group, they need to be defeated by Sunnis themselv=
es on the ground," Rubio said in a Dec. 6 appearance on CNN's State of the =
Union. On Dec. 7 on MSNBC, Bush said "local forces" must lead the way. Many=
 have deflected the question about ground troops by saying they'd rely on m=
ilitary advisers..

The lack of distinction with the current strategy frustrates Republicans li=
ke James Jeffrey, who served as deputy national security adviser to Preside=
nt George W. Bush.

"Nobody wants to say 'ground forces,'" said Jeffrey. "If we really want to =
get a real coalition going forward, trying to do this without some American=
s on the front lines is ridiculous."

Neither the White House nor Republicans have realistic expectations, said P=
reble. "What Sunni Arabs? Do you think you have some magic formula for find=
ing them that the Obama administration hasn't tried?" he said.

Cruz and Trump have used the most aggressive language about the need for mo=
re intense bombing, with Cruz recently promising to "carpet bomb them into =
oblivion." Yet they've offered no specifics about targets or parameters or =
why their approach would be any more effective.

Carter testified, due to improved intelligence, that the U.S. has intensifi=
ed air strikes, destroying 400 of ISIL's oil tanker trucks and killing its =
leader in Libya.

The overwhelming criticism following Obama's Dec. 6 Oval Office address to =
the nation centered on his language.

In a foreign policy address on Thursday, Cruz devoted most of his time to c=
riticizing Obama. He and Trump have slammed the president for not using the=
 term "radical Islamic terrorism." They've also criticized his comments fro=
m early 2014 calling ISIS the "JV team." Prior to Paris, Obama also said IS=
IS has been geographically contained.

There's a good reason that the real policy battle right now is over rhetori=
c, said Cordesman.

"There really aren't good options" on the ground right now, he said. "Tryin=
g to be the defender of the least bad option presents obvious political pro=
blems."
