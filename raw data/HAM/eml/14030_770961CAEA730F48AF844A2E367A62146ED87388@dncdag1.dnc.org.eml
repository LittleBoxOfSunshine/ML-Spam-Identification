Donald Trump Adviser Signals Plan to Change Veterans=92 Health Care<http://=

ealth-care-1463064129>
Wall Street Journal =96 Ben Kesling

Donald Trump says the Department of Veterans Affairs=92 health-care system =
is badly broken, and this week his campaign released some guidelines that w=
ould steer changes he would implement if he wins the presidency.

While short on details, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee would like=
ly push VA health care toward privatization and might move for it to become=
 more of an insurance provider like Medicare rather than an integrated hosp=
ital system, said Sam Clovis, Mr. Trump=92s chief policy adviser, in an int=
erview.

=93We want quality care top to bottom,=94 Mr. Clovis said in an interview. =
=93If that means we have some form of privatization or some form of Medicar=
e, we don=92t see anything wrong with that.=94

Mr. Clovis, who is also Mr. Trump=92s national campaign co-chair, said the =
candidate=92s priority would be to give veterans timely health care close t=
o home.

That could mean restructuring the system in a way to more resemble an insur=
ance provider along the lines of the popular Tricare system used by 9.6 mil=
lion members of the Department of Defense, where civilian facilities routin=
ely augment department-run hospitals.


=93We=92ll certainly look at that model, we want to make it as comprehensiv=
e as possible,=94 said Mr. Clovis when asked about Tricare. =93The VA=92s a=
 broken system now. We can=92t continue down that road.=94

Mr. Clovis cautioned that Mr. Trump won=92t try to fix what is working.

=93There are a lot of VA facilities that are being run very well,=94 Mr. Cl=
ovis said, adding that Mr. Trump doesn=92t =93want to take away the veteran=
s hospitals and the things that are working well.=94

VA officials declined to comment on Mr. Trump=92s plans.

The campaign=92s proposal to move toward privatization isn=92t necessarily =
new, Mr. Trump=92s website has long said the businessman wants to =93ensure=
 our veterans get the care they need wherever and whenever they need it,=94=
 but he has yet to provide specifics about how he would do that.

Currently, 9 million of the nation=92s 22 million veterans are enrolled in =
the VA=92s health-care system, and 6 million use those benefits regularly. =

As with many of Mr. Trump=92s policy positions, some of which he has seemed=
 to reverse, the campaign has been reluctant to provide details. Mr. Clovis=
 declined to lay out specifics, saying, =93every time we put a detailed pla=
n out we just get eviscerated in the media.=94 He added that the campaign i=
s using broad guidelines on the matter and likely will hold back on releasi=
ng a comprehensive plan until Mr. Trump=92s first 100 days in office.

He also said that Mr. Trump will crack down on fraud, waste and abuse in th=
e system to keep the VA budget essentially flat or even bring costs down.

The Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, has said multiple times in ca=
mpaign appearances that while she wants to restructure the VA she opposes p=
rivatization, referring to it on her website as a =93misguided ideological =
crusade.=94

Jon Murray, veterans outreach director for Mrs. Clinton=92s campaign said i=
n a statement that the Democrat would =93make much-needed reforms to the VA=
 without forcing veterans into a private health-insurance market ill-suited=
 to handle their specialized needs.=94

Though Mr. Trump says such plans can work while keeping costs flat, the Con=
gressional Budget Office, which does nonpartisan analysis, said in a 2014 r=
eport, the most recent available, that moving the VA toward privatization c=
ould increase costs dramatically.

Currently, 9 million of the nation=92s 22 million veterans are enrolled in =
the VA=92s health-care system, and 6 million use those benefits regularly. =
The CBO report noted that of those veterans who use the benefits, 70% recei=
ve most of their care outside the VA, often using coverage like private ins=
urance or Medicare.

The CBO also estimated that services provided by the VA would cost about 20=
% more if obtained in the private sector and prescription drugs would likel=
y cost about 70% more under Medicare and Medicaid.

Expanded privatization could also flood the system with veterans who don=92=
t use the program now, the report said.

The VA=92s health-care system, though it has been under fire since revelati=
ons in 2014 that employees had been falsifying wait-time records, consisten=
tly rates highly with those using the system.

=93On really almost every measure, VA health care is as good and in many me=
asures is even better than the private sector,=94 said Carrie Farmer, a sen=
ior policy researcher focusing on veterans=92 issues at Rand Corp., a nonpa=
rtisan think tank. =93Relatedly, the VA is providing, not all the time, but=
 probably better than in the private sector, military cultural competent ca=
re.=94

In other words, the VA=92s doctors are trained to deal with the veteran com=
munity and the unique issues they face from post-traumatic stress disorder =
to traumatic brain injury, hallmarks of the most recent wars. And older vet=
erans are more likely to be sicker and have more total illnesses and injuri=
es than a civilian patient, which can be related to military-specific injur=
ies such as exposure to Agent Orange, a powerful chemical mixture used to d=
efoliate forest cover during the Vietnam War.

VA officials tout that it is the largest integrated health-care network in =
the U.S., where centralized systems ensure veterans=92 health records can b=
e seen by any doctor and veterans are treated holistically rather than each=
 injury or illness in isolation.

=93Cost is really only the tip of the iceberg here when you=92re talking ab=
out the potential effects,=94 Ms. Farmer said, noting that by her estimates=
 only about 20% of civilian doctors are properly trained and equipped to de=
al with veterans=92 issues.

Many veterans=92 organizations, including the Disabled American Veterans, h=
ave steadfastly maintained opposition to privatization of the VA, warning t=
hat as services slowly get outsourced to civilian doctors, veterans will st=
art to lose the comprehensive care they get at the VA.

Other organizations, such as the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, =
agree.

=93We are not for full choice,=94 said Elizabeth Welke, a political associa=
te at the organization, adding that the Iraq-Afghanistan group wants the VA=
 to remain the provider and coordinator of veterans care.

=93There are specific programs that VA offers that aren=92t in the private =
sector: poly-trauma and spinal cord injuries,=94 said Ms. Welke. And =93whe=
n you go to the VA everyone is a vet. Doctors who are out in the community =
don=92t necessarily understand that.=94
