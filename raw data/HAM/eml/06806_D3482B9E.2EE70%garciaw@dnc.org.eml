Roberta Jacobson confirmed as U.S. ambassador to Mexico<http://www.politico=

By Seung Min Kim<http://www.politico.com/staff/seung-min-kim>

The Senate finally confirmed Roberta Jacobson to be the U.S. ambassador to =
Mexico on Thursday, ending a months-long delay of her nomination that was u=
ltimately resolved by a complicated deal that drew in two Senate Republican=
s who had vied for president.

Jacobson, a top State Department official, had faced objections from senato=
rs related to her work on implementing the Obama administration=92s controv=
ersial policy normalizing relations with Cuba. In November, Sen. Marco Rubi=
o (R-Fla.), who at the time was deep into his presidential run, put a hold =
on her nomination while publicly criticizing her work at State.

But the wheels began to turn toward getting Jacobson installed this month, =
after Rubio returned to the Senate following his failed presidential bid. S=
enate GOP leaders and the White House approached Rubio, asking him what wou=
ld make him lift his Jacobson blockade, according to a Senate aide.

Rubio=92s ask: an extension of a 2014 law he wrote that imposed sanctions o=
n key officials in Venezuela, home to another regime that has been the targ=
et of Rubio=92s wrath.

That set up intricate maneuvering with Senate Foreign Relations Committee B=
ob Corker (R-Tenn.), who said he would block the extension Rubio wanted unl=
ess he could get Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to back off his nearly yearlong ho=
ld on a separate measure reauthorizing the State Department, according to t=
he Senate aide.

Cruz =97 who has also been busy campaigning for president =97 had put a bla=
nket hold on the legislation and all nominees to the State Department last =
summer because of the administration=92s nuclear deal with Iran. But Rubio =
asked Cruz to drop his hold, according to the Senate aide, in exchange for =
helping to push legislation Cruz has championed that would rename the stree=
t in front of the Chinese Embassy in Washington the Liu Xiaobo Plaza. That =
legislation was crucial<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/senate-confir=
ms-diplomatic-nominees-219213> for Cruz to lift his hold on the State Depar=
tment nominees in February, although the White House has warned<http://www.=
politico.com/story/2016/02/ted-cruz-china-bill-diplomat-nominees-219219> th=
at it would veto Cruz=92s legislation.

Alongside Jacobson=92s confirmation, the Senate also swiftly cleared the St=
ate Department authorization bill for the current fiscal year, as well as R=
ubio=92s bill that extended sanctions for three years, in rapid succession =
Thursday evening.

=93The Maduro regime=92s abuses of power and violations of human rights are=
 hurting innocent people in our hemisphere and threaten the national securi=
ty interests of the United States," Rubio said after the sanctions legislat=
ion passed Thursday night. "We have a responsibility to stand with the Vene=
zuelan people by extending these sanctions.=94

The moves ended a nearly yearlong saga over Jacobson=92s nomination, which =
had drawn an intraparty rift among Republicans, many of whom supported her =
despite objections from Cuban-American lawmakers such as Rubio who are voci=
ferously opposed to the administration=92s Cuba policy.

But other Republicans argued that it was unfair to hold Jacobson, whose nom=
ination passed the Foreign Relations Committee in November, hostage over Cu=
ba politics.

=93On issues ranging from trade to migration to security and the border, th=
e interests of the United States are served and Arizona benefits when our n=
ation is well-represented in Mexico,=94 Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, Jacobson=
=92s most vocal Republican supporter, said after she was confirmed. =93Thou=
gh long overdue, I=92m pleased that the Senate has confirmed an individual =
as qualified and capable as Roberta Jacobson to serve as U.S. ambassador to=
 Mexico.=94

Secretary of State John Kerry hailed the confirmation in a statement, prais=
ing Jacobson's "tremendous service record in the State Department."
