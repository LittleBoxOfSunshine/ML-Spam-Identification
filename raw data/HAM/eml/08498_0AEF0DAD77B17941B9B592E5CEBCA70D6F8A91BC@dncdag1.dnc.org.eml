Sent around on slack but this is pretty good. There weren=92t any big name =
donors in Trump=92s report yesterday and it looks like that might continue =
for next month=92s

Key G.O.P. Donors Still Deeply Resist Donald Trump=92s Candidacy<http://www=
.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/us/politics/donald-trump-republican-fundraising.htm=
l?_r=3D0>

A powerful array of the Republican Party=92s largest financial backers rema=
in deeply resistant to Donald J. Trump=92s presidential candidacy, forming =
a wall of opposition that could make it exceedingly difficult for him to me=
et his goal of raising $1 billion before the November election.

Interviews and emails with more than 50 of the Republican Party=92s largest=
 donors, or their representatives, revealed a measure of contempt and distr=
ust toward their own party=92s nominee that is unheard of in modern preside=
ntial politics.

More than a dozen of the party=92s most reliable individual contributors an=
d wealthy families indicated that they would not give to or raise money for=
 Mr. Trump. This group has contributed a combined $90 million to conservati=
ve candidates and causes in the last three federal elections, mainly to =93=
super PACs=94 dedicated to electing Republican candidates.

Up to this point, Mr. Trump has embraced the hostility of the Republican es=
tablishment, goading the party=92s angry base with diatribes against wealth=
y donors who he claimed controlled politicians. And he has succeeded while =
defying conventions of presidential campaigning, relying on media attention=
 and large rallies to fire up supporters, and funding his operation with a =
mix of his own money and small-dollar contributions.

But that formula will be tested as he presents himself to a far larger audi=
ence of voters. Mr. Trump has turned to the task of winning over elites he =
once attacked, with some initial success. And he has said he hopes to raise=
 $1 billion, an enormous task given that he named a finance chairman and st=
arted scheduling fund-raisers only this month.

Among the party=92s biggest financiers disavowing Mr. Trump are Paul E. Sin=
ger, a New York investor who has spent at least $28 million for national Re=
publicans since the 2012 election, and Joe Ricketts, the TD Ameritrade foun=
der who with his wife Marlene has spent nearly $30 million over the same pe=
riod of time, as well as the hedge fund managers William Oberndorf and Seth=
 Klarman, and the Florida hospital executive Mike Fernandez.

=93If it is Trump vs. Clinton,=94 Mr. Oberndorf said, =93I will be voting f=
or Hillary.=94

The rejection of Mr. Trump among some of the party=92s biggest donors and f=
und-raisers reflects several strains of hostility to his campaign. Donors c=
ited his fickleness on matters of policy and what they saw as an ad hoc pop=
ulist platform focused on trade protectionism and immigration. Several ment=
ioned Mr. Trump=92s own fortune, suggesting that if he was as wealthy as he=
 claimed, then he should not need their assistance.

Among the more than 50 donors contacted, only nine have said unambiguously =
that they will contribute to Mr. Trump. They include Sheldon G. Adelson, th=
e casino billionaire; the energy executive T. Boone Pickens; Foster Friess,=
 a wealthy mutual fund investor; and Richard H. Roberts, a pharmaceutical e=
xecutive. Mr. Friess wrote in an email that Mr. Trump deserved credit for i=
nspiring =93truckers, farmers, welders, hospitality workers =97 the people =
who really make our country function.=94

Many more donors declined to reveal their intentions or did not respond to =
requests for comment, a remarkable silence about the de facto nominee of th=
eir party.

Asked how Mr. Trump intended to win over major donors, Hope Hicks, a spokes=
woman for the Trump campaign, responded in one sentence. =93There is tremen=
dous support for Mr. Trump,=94 she said.

Mr. Trump has declared that he expects the Republican Party to unite around=
 him, and in recent weeks has made inroads among party leaders who once vow=
ed to oppose him. He delivered a winning performance before lawmakers on Ca=
pitol Hill in a whirlwind visit to Washington this month. And polls show th=
e party=92s rank and file are beginning to coalesce behind Mr. Trump, and t=
hat they want party leaders to do the same.

Some major donors have not explicitly closed the door on helping Mr. Trump,=
 but have set a high bar for him to earn their support, demanding an almost=
 complete makeover of his candidacy and a repudiation of his own inflammato=
ry statements.

=93Until we have a better reason to embrace and support the top of the tick=
et, and see an agenda that is truly an opportunity agenda, then we have lot=
s of other options in which to invest and spend our time helping,=94 said B=
etsy DeVos, a Michigan Republican whose family has given nearly $9.5 millio=
n over the last three elections to party causes and candidates.

But others simply believe Mr. Trump is unfit to serve in the Oval Office. M=
ichael K. Vlock, a Connecticut investor who has given nearly $5 million to =
Republicans at the federal level since 2014, said he considered Mr. Trump a=
 dangerous person.

=93He=92s an ignorant, amoral, dishonest and manipulative, misogynistic, ph=
ilandering, hyper-litigious, isolationist, protectionist blowhard,=94 Mr. V=
lock said.

Mr. Vlock said he might give to Hillary Clinton instead, describing her as =
=93the devil we know.=94

=93I really believe our republic will survive Hillary,=94 he said.

At a dinner of the Manhattan Institute in New York earlier this month, Bruc=
e Kovner, a New York-based investor who has given $3.1 million to national =
Republicans in recent years, argued to a collection of influential conserva=
tives that Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were both unacceptable choices.

=93When I talk to my colleagues and friends in similar positions, they have=
 the same degree of discomfort,=94 Mr. Kovner said in an interview.

Unless Mr. Trump can win over more benefactors, he is likely to become the =
first Republican presidential nominee in decades to be heavily outspent by =
his Democratic opponent, and may find it difficult to pay for both the vote=
r-turnout operations and the paid advertising campaigns that are typically =
required in a general election. Both President Obama and Mitt Romney raised=
 over $1 billion in 2012, and Mrs. Clinton is expected to exceed that figur=
e easily.

Charles G. and David H. Koch, the country=92s two most prolific conservativ=
e donors, are not expected to back Mr. Trump, and their advisers have been =
scathing in private assessments of Mr. Trump=92s candidacy and his policy a=
genda. The Kochs, who command a vast network of conservative donors, have s=
cheduled a conference of their allies in Colorado in late July, where much =
of their 2016 spending may be determined.

Even among the handful of big donors Mr. Trump has won over, doubts persist=
 about both his abilities as a candidate and the political apparatus suppor=
ting him. Mr. Adelson, the most important donor who has endorsed Mr. Trump,=
 has indicated that he will cut big checks to aid his campaign only if ther=
e is a credible advocacy group set up for that purpose.

But Mr. Trump still has no sanctioned =93super PAC=94 able to raise unlimit=
ed sums to support his campaign. A gathering next month at Mr. Pickens=92s =
Texas ranch that was to be sponsored by one of the pro-Trump groups, Great =
America PAC, has been called off because Mr. Pickens was not sure he was ho=
sting Mr. Trump=92s preferred super PAC.

At a Republican Governors Association donor retreat in New Mexico last week=
, there was an active debate on the sidelines about whether to support Mr. =
Trump. Mr. Friess argued that the Supreme Court made it imperative to rally=
 around Mr. Trump.

But Mr. Friess acknowledged in an email that enthusiasm for Mr. Trump was l=
imited among his fellow major donors. If some agreed there was =93no sensib=
le choice other than to rally around Trump,=94 Mr. Friess said, many contri=
butors viewed that prospect with =93the same enthusiasm as a root canal.=94

Walter Buckley, the founder of a Pennsylvania financial management company,=
 said he decided to support Mr. Trump after Gov. Chris Christie of New Jers=
ey endorsed him. Predicting that Mr. Trump would shake up Washington, Mr. B=
uckley, said, =93This political system needs a shaking like it=92s probably=
 not had in 100 years.=94

But Mr. Buckley, who said he would be willing to contribute to the Trump ca=
mpaign or to a super PAC supporting him, said he remained upset about Mr. T=
rump=92s mockery of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, for having =
been captured in Vietnam. =93I don=92t think anything that anybody=92s ever=
 said on the political front has bothered me more than that,=94 Mr. Buckley=
 said.
