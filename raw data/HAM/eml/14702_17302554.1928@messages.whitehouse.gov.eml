REMARKS BY THE FIRST LADY
AT THE 2016 INVICTUS GAMES OPENING CEREMONY

ESPN Worldwide Sports Center
Orlando, Florida



10:03 P.M. EDT

MRS. OBAMA: Well, hello everyone! (Applause.) Are we having fun tonight? =
(Applause.) Well, it is truly an honor to be here tonight to help kick of=
f this years Invictus Games.

I, of course, want to start by thanking Prince Harry for his outstanding =
leadership and for bringing the Invictus Games here to Orlando. He is tru=
ly our Prince Charming, isnt he? (Applause.) And he should be proud of hi=
mself for this work.

Now, in return, I have generously asked the U.S. Team not to win too much=
, right? (Laughter.) Its really the least we can do, right? (Laughter.) B=
ut seriously, I have loved getting to know Prince Harry and his remarkabl=
e family. And I am thrilled to join him here tonight with all of you.

I also want to recognize a devoted advocate for our men and women in unif=
orm -- the Honorary Chair of these Games, and our friend, former Presiden=
t George W. Bush, and our fabulous former First Lady, Laura Bush. (Applau=
se.) And of course, I want to thank Ken Fisher and his family for their t=
remendous support of this event, but more importantly, for their tireless=
 commitment over many years to our military community. Ken, you're amazin=
g. (Applause.)

But most of all, I'm here to honor all of you -- our extraordinary servic=
emembers, our veterans and, of course, our military families. You all are=
 amazing. (Applause.) Truly amazing.

Over the past five years, through our Joining Forces initiative, I've had=
 the privilege of meeting so many of you. And like Prince Harry, I am so =
incredibly inspired by all of you. Im inspired by your courage, by your l=
ove of country. Im inspired by the sacrifices you all make every single d=
ay, particularly the wounded warriors and the caregivers who show such st=
rength and resilience in the face of challenges that most of us cant even=
 imagine.

In the course of your recoveries, youve endured surgery after surgery, an=
d months, even years of painstaking rehabilitation. And you still tell us=
 that you would do it all again if you were given the chance to serve you=
r country. (Applause.) Absolutely. And look at you now. Today, you are he=
re competing in these Games, and you are achieving amazing athletic feats=
. It's just -- I'm so proud of you all.

And as for our caregivers, let's give it up for our caregivers. (Applause=
.) I've met so many of you. We know how you all dropped everything when y=
our loved one was injured; how you stepped up to manage all the appointme=
nts and the medication, and all the finances, often juggling a job and ra=
ising kids at the same time.

And ultimately, thats really what the Invictus Games and Joining Forces a=
re all about. Theyre about shining this big, bright light on all of you -=
- on all of you. Theyre about sharing your stories and your achievements =
with the world, so that we all can be inspired to live up to your example=
.

Thats why were here tonight. That's why I'm here tonight. And that's why =
I'm so proud of you all. That's why I love you all so much. That's why I =
will keep working for you all as long as I'm alive. (Applause.) So I wish=
 you all all the best of luck in your competitions. And I hope you have a=
 lot of fun along the way. Have fun!

And now it is now my pleasure to introduce one of our fabulous Invictus G=
ames Ambassadors, a legend of the silver screen and one of my favorite pe=
ople in the world -- ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Morgan Freeman. (Applause.=
)
