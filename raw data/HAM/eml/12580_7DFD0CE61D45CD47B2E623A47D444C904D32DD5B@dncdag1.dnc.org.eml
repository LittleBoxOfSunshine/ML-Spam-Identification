Donald Trump to Keynote CAGOP 2016 Convention Friday Kickoff Lunch Banquet<https://www.cagop.org/donald-trump-keynote-cagop-2016-convention-friday-kickoff-lunch-banquet/>
SACRAMENTO, Calif. - The California Republican Party announced today that Presidential candidate Donald Trump will deliver the keynote speech at the CAGOP 2016 Convention Kickoff Lunch Banquet on Friday, April 29, 2016 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport in Burlingame.
"We are very excited to have Donald Trump kicking off our weekend convention," said California Republican Party Chairman Jim Brulte. "Mr. Trump's success and experience as an American businessman is a result of his tenacity and unique ability to make any endeavor a triumph. He has built an empire from the ground up, and we are excited to hear his plan to make America great again, starting right here in California."
Mr. Trump currently serves as the Chairman and President of The Trump Organization and launched his bid for President of the United States in June of 2015.
"This is the most exciting Republican Presidential primary California has seen in generations, and we are happy that our delegates - the grassroots leaders of our party - will have the chance to hear from all of our candidates at our convention, starting off with Donald Trump at our Friday Convention kickoff lunch," said California Republican Party Vice Chair Harmeet K. Dhillon. "This nomination may be decided in California, and what better place for party leaders to hear first-hand the different visions for the future of America, than at our party convention."
"California, like much of the rest of the nation, has struggled to regain its full economic success," said Mr. Trump. "A Trump Administration is going to be a pro-jobs, pro-economy, and pro-entrepreneur administration. I look forward to being with the great people of California and sharing my vision to Make America Great Again."
Running on a platform to restore America's economic and global leadership, Mr. Trump has won millions more votes and more delegates than any other GOP candidate in the 2016 presidential field. His life is one of America's great success stories - Mr. Trump is known as an American businessman, real-estate developer, Emmy-nominated television personality, and best-selling author. Trump is one of the most globally recognized brands, renowned for luxury hospitality, real estate, golf and much more.
