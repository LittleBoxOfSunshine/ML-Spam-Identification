John Boehner talks election, time in office<http://www.stanforddaily.com/20=

Stanford Daily // Ada Statler-Throckmorton

=93You can call me boner, beaner, jackass, happy to answer to almost anythi=
ng,=94 said former Speaker of the House John Boehner as he took the stage a=
t CEMEX Auditorium on Wednesday evening. Boehner joined David M. Kennedy, f=
aculty director and history professor emeritus, in a talk hosted by Stanfor=
d in Government (SIG) and the Stanford Speakers Bureau.

This joking yet blunt attitude set the tone for the night as Kennedy and th=
e former Speaker discussed topics ranging from Boehner=92s upbringing in Oh=
io to the future of the Republican Party. For the second half of the progra=
m, Kennedy opened up the floor to student questions.

2016 Presidential election

Much of the discussion =96 and laughs =96 focused on Boehner=92s views on t=
he current presidential candidates. Segueing into the topic, Kennedy asked =
Boehner to be frank given that the event was not being broadcasted, and the=
 former Speaker responded in kind. When specifically asked his opinions on =
Ted Cruz, Boehner made a face, drawing laughter from the crowd.

=93Lucifer in the flesh,=94 the former speaker said. =93I have Democrat fri=
ends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have n=
ever worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.=94

Boehner described other Republican candidates as friends. In particular, th=
e former speaker said he has played golf with Donald Trump for years and th=
at they were =93texting buddies.=94

His friendship with Ohio Governor John Kasich, however, was a little more a=
mbiguous.

=93[Kasich] requires more effort on my behalf than all my other friends =85=
 but he=92s still my friend, and I love him,=94 Boehner said.

Boehner for the most part accepted Trump as the presumptive Republican nomi=
nee, though he did express his surprise at the candidate=92s success. While=
 he did not praise Trump=92s policies, the Speaker did say he would vote fo=
r Trump in the general election if he becomes the Republican nominee. The f=
ormer Speaker said he would not, however, vote for Cruz.

When it came to the Democrat primaries, Boehner asserted his belief that al=
though Bernie Sanders has put up a significant fight, Hillary Clinton will =
win the nomination over Bernie Sanders.

While stating that he disagreed with Sanders on all the issues, the former =
Speaker also called Sanders a nice guy and the most honest politician in th=
e race.

On Clinton, Boehner=92s reviews were more mixed. Early in the talk, the spe=
aker impersonated Clinton, saying =93Oh I=92m a woman, vote for me,=94 to a=
 negative crowd reaction. Later, he added that he had known Clinton for 25 =
years and finds her to be very accomplished and smart.

Boehner also speculated about surprises that could come closer to the Democ=
ratic National Convention if Hillary Clinton=92s emails became a larger sca=
ndal.

=93Don=92t be shocked =85 if two weeks before the convention, here comes Jo=
e Biden parachuting in and Barack Obama fanning the flames to make it all h=
appen,=94 Boehner said.
Time in office

Kennedy also spent a large portion of the talk asking the former speaker ab=
out his time in office and his relationship with President Obama. Having be=
en elected to office 13 times =96 a number which he was quick to clarify wi=
th Kennedy =96 Boehner said he had learned a lot from previous speakers, in=
cluding Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi.

Throughout the talk, Boehner frequently referenced the Freedom Caucus as th=
e =93knuckleheads=94 and =93goofballs=94 in Congress. When Kennedy asked ab=
out the Democrats in Congress, Boehner asserted that both parties have thei=
r own inner-divisions.

=93The thing that=92s different about Republicans and Democrats is that [De=
mocrats] do their fights behind closed doors,=94 the former speaker said. =
=93Republicans are way too independent for that.=94

Although he talked about the challenges of working with a partisan, gridloc=
ked Congress, Boehner reflected positively on his relationship with Obama. =
Although he acknowledged that the two disagree, Boehner said the two get al=
ong well.

Boehner described his days in office as fairly repetitive and very busy. He=
 would wake up around 5:30 a.m., walk to Starbucks for coffee, then return =
home to do some morning reading. He would go into the office around 8 a.m.,=
 and =93then it was like a sprint all day long.=94 According to the Speaker=
, however, he always made sure to go home by 10 p.m..

=93I think my proudest accomplishment is walking out of there the same jack=
ass I was 25 years before,=94 Boehner said.

In speaking of his retirement, the former Speaker said he didn=92t regret a=
 thing. As a Catholic, Boehner said it was particularly moving to meet Pope=
 Francis when he spoke to Congress. Boehner resigned the following day.

Student reactions

When the floor was opened for student questions, questions ranged from aski=
ng Boehner to push for the censure of Former Speaker Dennis Hastert to his =
opinions on the future of the Republican Party.

Brandon Camhi =9216 asked Boehner about how he would prevent more socially =
progressive conservatives from becoming disillusioned with the Republican P=
arty.

=93If I were running for president I=92d be running on things that unite Re=
publicans,=94 Boehner said. =93These other issues are just going to keep co=
ming up, and the Democrats know where our soft spots are.=94

According to Camhi, this was as much as he expected the former speaker to b=
e able to answer his question.

=93He said as much as he=92s going to say, and what he said is true,=94 Cam=
hi said. =93The Republican Party has to move away from divisive social issu=
es.=94

More generally, Camhi was surprised by how candidly Boehner spoke. Accordin=
g to Alex Lee =9218, who attended the smaller reception with Boehner after =
the event as a member of the Stanford Speakers Bureau, this same candidness=
 was present in his personal conversations as well.

According to Lee, it was also interesting to have a minority political opin=
ion being represented on the predominantly liberal campus.

=93I could [feel] the tension in the room when Boehner said certain things,=
 namely claiming that Clinton was leveraging her gender or discussing South=
 Carolina bathrooms,=94 Lee said.

At the end of the discussion, Kennedy re-focused the talk by asking Boehner=
 who his political heroes were. In his answer, Boehner re-emphasized his ow=
n relatively moderate stances within the Republican Party.

=93Well you know I=92m a big fan of Ronald Reagan,=94 Boehner said. =93But =
I love all these knuckleheads talking about the party of Reagan. He would b=
e the most moderate Republican elected today.=94

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=93He said as much as he=92s going to say, and what =
he said is true,=94 Camhi said. =93The Republican Party has to move away fr=
om divisive social issues.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">More generally, Camhi was surprised by how candidly =
Boehner spoke. According to Alex Lee =9218, who attended the smaller recept=
ion with Boehner after the event as a member of the Stanford Speakers Burea=
u, this same candidness was present
 in his personal conversations as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">According to Lee, it was also interesting to have a =
minority political opinion being represented on the predominantly liberal c=
ampus.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=93I could [feel] the tension in the room when Boehn=
er said certain things, namely claiming that Clinton was leveraging her gen=
der or discussing South Carolina bathrooms,=94 Lee said.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">At the end of the discussion, Kennedy re-focused the=
 talk by asking Boehner who his political heroes were. In his answer, Boehn=
er re-emphasized his own relatively moderate stances within the Republican =
Party.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=93Well you know I=92m a big fan of Ronald Reagan,=
=94 Boehner said. =93But I love all these knuckleheads talking about the pa=
rty of Reagan. He would be the most moderate Republican elected today.=94<o=
