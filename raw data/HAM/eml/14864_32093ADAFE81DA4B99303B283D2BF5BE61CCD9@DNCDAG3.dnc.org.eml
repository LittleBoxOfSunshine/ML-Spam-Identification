The =91Rubio Doctrine=92 Is a Rerun<http://www.defenseone.com/politics/2015=
/05/rubio-doctrine-rerun/112753/>

DEFENSE ONE // MOLLY O=92TOOLE



Marco Rubio says he=92s the most qualified of the crowded 2016 field to be =
commander in chief, given his national security experience and bold ideas f=
or a new generation of leader. Yet in a Wednesday address at the Council on=
 Foreign Relations billed as his =93first policy speech=94 as a presidentia=
l candidate, the Florida senator recycled much of the same foreign policy p=
latform that=92s failed to win his party the White House two elections runn=
ing.



=93Those are the three pillars of my doctrine =96 American strength, the pr=
otection of our global economy, and a proud advocacy for America=92s core v=
alues,=94 Rubio said, arguing they will, =93restore America=92s status as a=
 nation that shapes global events rather than one that is shaped by them.=
=94



Rubio began by quoting former President John F. Kennedy=92s last speech bef=
ore his assassination, calling it =93a testament to the bipartisan traditio=
n of strong American leadership,=94 but the speech quickly devolved into fa=
miliar talking points against President Obama.



They go something like this: Obama=92s =93leading from behind=94 by defundi=
ng the military, retreating from the global stage and apologizing for Ameri=
ca. He=92s responsible for a more dangerous world, as evidenced by the unpr=
ecedented array of foreign policy crises the U.S. is currently facing. He=
=92s been wrong =97 and politicians like Rubio have been right =97 on: Russ=
ia, China, North Korea, the Islamic State, Iran, etc.



The answer for most of the GOP candidates vying for the nomination is a def=
ense platform built almost entirely on bashing Obama and boosting military =
spending, and Rubio is no exception. It is a race to show more =93American =
strength=94 by throwing more money at the Pentagon and relying more on mili=
tary action than diplomatic tools.



The strategy is risky for Rubio. His brief time in Congress since his elect=
ion in 2010 and serving on the Senate=92s Intelligence and Foreign Relation=
s committees is a double-edged sword, burnishing credentials but also estab=
lishing a record that opponents can pick apart to put him on the defensive =
or mine for evidence of hypocrisy.



The Pentagon itself asked Congress to help it curb spending as the wars in =
Iraq and Afghanistan drew down, making the claim that Obama has routed the =
Pentagon coffers problematic. And behind the boogeyman of sequestration are=
 the budget caps enacted by members of Congress such as Rubio. The senator =
voted against a deal in 2013 that sought a solution to automatic, across-th=
e-board cuts that would be enacted without a budget compromise.



The White House also requested a Pentagon budget for fiscal 2016 that inten=
tionally busted the caps, a forcing mechanism intended to make Congress fin=
d a solution to sequestration. But instead the Republican majority in both =
chambers is seeking to skirt the issue by simply boosting the Pentagon=92s =
war fund, Overseas Contingency Operations funding, which isn=92t subject to=
 the caps. Rubio offered an amendment to utilize this strategy without any =
offset for the spending, though he=92s also said adding to the deficit is d=
angerous.



Defense Secretary Ash Carter slammed this =93budget gimmick=94 last week, c=
alling it a =93road to nowhere=94 that in fact does the opposite of what Ru=
bio claims he would do =97 allow the military to engage in the long-term st=
rategic planning that is urgently needed to modernize the force.



At times during the speech, Rubio also exhibited a slippery grasp on the mi=
litary that has inspired a lack of confidence in lawmakers=92 capability to=
 oversee national security strategy.



When the topic turned to China building islands and airstrips in the South =
China Sea, Rubio praised recent reporting that Carter would pursue a respon=
se to curb Chinese aggression disruptive to international commerce and the =
region. But then the senator continued, =93I would take all sorts of naval =
actions, not military actions, per se.=94



He also doubled-down on his argument that Obama is going easy on ISIS becau=
se of the ongoing negotiations over Iran=92s nuclear ambitions. =93Once ISI=
S began to emerge I did not consider them the JV team,=94 Rubio said.  But =
a number of experts and officials have soundly rejected this claim for the =
obvious reason that Iran also wants to see the Sunni extremist terrorist gr=
oup defeated.



=93The president=92s proposed deal with Tehran will likely lead to a cascad=
e of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East and could force Israel to tak=
e bold action to defend itself, making war with Iran even more likely,=94 R=
ubio said.



But a procedural move by Rubio and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., after less than=
 two days of debate on the Iran deal review bill to force consideration of =
amendments widely viewed as =93poison pills=94 is broadly seen as a misfire=
. Instead, Rubio was caught on the losing side while other lawmakers claime=
d credit for a bill that reasserted Congress=92s authority on national secu=
rity over White House opposition.



For all the time Rubio and other candidates spend bashing Obama=92s leaders=
hip, he doesn=92t get a third term. The Republican nominee=92s likely oppon=
ent is Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of State, on whom Rubio spent =
only a few lines.



=93We simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leadin=
g agents of this administration=92s foreign policy =96 a leader from yester=
day whose tenure as Secretary of State was ineffective at best and dangerou=
sly negligent at worst,=94 Rubio said.



He continued later, =93I just don=92t believe there=92s many successes they=
 can point to =85 she was the chief architect and spokesperson for a foreig=
n policy that will go down as a complete disaster.=94



But would a greater emphasis on military action as a forcing mechanism bett=
er export American values to the world? When both Clinton and Obama were ru=
nning for president in 2008, they prioritized diplomacy as a means of resto=
ring international relationships that had suffered under President George W=
. Bush, due in large part to the invasion of Iraq.



The former president=92s brother Jeb has taken flak in recent days for sayi=
ng, knowing what we now know, he would=92ve also authorized the invasion (t=
hough he has since walked back his comments.) Rubio, who has a close relati=
onship with Jeb from his days in Florida government, answered: =93Not only =
would I not have been in favor of it, President Bush would not have been in=
 favor of it, and President Bush has said so =85 I don=92t think Congress w=
ould=92ve voted for it if they knew the intelligence was faulty.=94



But Rubio stated his support for another controversial Bush-era initiative,=
 as Congress is currently embroiled over extending section 215 of the Patri=
ot Act. =93We must never find ourselves looking back after a terrorist atta=
ck and saying we could have done more to save American lives,=94 Rubio said=
. Many in the Republican leadership support the extension, but the party is=
 divided on the issue of surveillance, with the conservative grassroots tha=
t come out in droves in the primary often leaning libertarian on the contro=
versial practice, and the House passing reform legislation on Wednesday.



Rubio also called for keeping Guantanamo open. =93I believe that innocent p=
eople, peace loving people, deserve to have their rights respected,=94 he s=
aid, while terrorists, =93deserve to be in prison and be taken off the batt=
lefield.=94 He continued, =93Today we=92re not nearly gathering enough inte=
lligence,=94 adding, =93and many of the people who have been released have =
returned to battlefield.=94 The Intelligence Community says that the so-cal=
led =93recidivism=94 rate among former Guantanamo detainees was far higher =
under Bush and has come down significantly, and that the prison poses a gre=
ater risk open than closed.



It is early in the campaign, and this was one speech. But given his claims =
to be frontrunner for commander in chief, the onus was on Rubio to not only=
 acknowledge the anxiety many Americans currently feel about global securit=
y, but moreover articulate his vision for a path out of it. More money for =
defense, greater economic freedom and =93moral clarity=94 is one already we=
ll-tread.

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">=93We simply cannot afford to ele=
ct as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration=
=92s foreign policy =96 a leader from yesterday whose tenure as
 Secretary of State was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at wo=
rst,=94 Rubio said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">He continued later, =93I just don=
=92t believe there=92s many successes they can point to =85 she was the chi=
ef architect and spokesperson for a foreign policy that will go
 down as a complete disaster.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">But would a greater emphasis on m=
ilitary action as a forcing mechanism better export American values to the =
world? When both Clinton and Obama were running for president
 in 2008, they prioritized diplomacy as a means of restoring international =
relationships that had suffered under President George W. Bush, due in larg=
e part to the invasion of Iraq.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The former president=92s brother =
Jeb has taken flak in recent days for saying, knowing what we now know, he =
would=92ve also authorized the invasion (though he has since
 walked back his comments.) Rubio, who has a close relationship with Jeb fr=
om his days in Florida government, answered: =93Not only would I not have b=
een in favor of it, President Bush would not have been in favor of it, and =
President Bush has said so =85 I don=92t
 think Congress would=92ve voted for it if they knew the intelligence was f=
aulty.=94<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">But Rubio stated his support for =
another controversial Bush-era initiative, as Congress is currently embroil=
ed over extending section 215 of the Patriot Act. =93We must
 never find ourselves looking back after a terrorist attack and saying we c=
ould have done more to save American lives,=94 Rubio said. Many in the Repu=
blican leadership support the extension, but the party is divided on the is=
sue of surveillance, with the conservative
 grassroots that come out in droves in the primary often leaning libertaria=
n on the controversial practice, and the House passing reform legislation o=
n Wednesday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Rubio also called for keeping Gua=
ntanamo open. =93I believe that innocent people, peace loving people, deser=
ve to have their rights respected,=94 he said, while terrorists,
 =93deserve to be in prison and be taken off the battlefield.=94 He continu=
ed, =93Today we=92re not nearly gathering enough intelligence,=94 adding, =
=93and many of the people who have been released have returned to battlefie=
ld.=94 The Intelligence Community says that the
 so-called =93recidivism=94 rate among former Guantanamo detainees was far =
higher under Bush and has come down significantly, and that the prison pose=
s a greater risk open than closed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">It is early in the campaign, and =
this was one speech. But given his claims to be frontrunner for commander i=
n chief, the onus was on Rubio to not only acknowledge the
 anxiety many Americans currently feel about global security, but moreover =
articulate his vision for a path out of it. More money for defense, greater=
 economic freedom and =93moral clarity=94 is one already well-tread.<o:p></=
