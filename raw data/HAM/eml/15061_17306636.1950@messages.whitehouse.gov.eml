THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release May 19, 2016





ON-THE-RECORD CONFERENCE CALL

BY BEN RHODES, DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR=20

FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS;=20

AMBASSADOR MIKE FROMAN, THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE;=20

WALLY ADEYEMO, THE DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR=20

FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS;=20

AND DAN KRITENBRINK, THE SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR ASIAN AFFAIRS=20

AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

ON THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO VIETNAM AND JAPAN



Via Telephone



4:22 P.M. EDT





 MR. STROH: Thank you very much. And, everyone, thanks for joining us thi=
s afternoon on a press conference call to preview the President's trip to=
 Vietnam and Japan. Today we have with us Ambassador Mike Froman, the U.S=
. Trade Representative; Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for =
Strategic Communications; Wally Adeyemo, the Deputy National Security Adv=
isor for International Economics; and Dan Kritenbrink, the Senior Directo=
r for Asian Affairs at the National Security Council. As a reminder, this=
 call is on the record, but we will embargo the call until the conclusion=
 of the call.



 And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben Rhodes.



 MR. RHODES: Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. I'll just st=
art by giving an overview of the President's schedule and some of the key=
 objectives of the trip. I'll hand it over to Wally to speak to the G7, t=
he process in which he's U.S. sherpa and lead, and then to Ambassador Fro=
man to speak to some of the trade issues particularly related to TPP, giv=
en that we are traveling to two TPP countries.



 First of all, let me just say at the outset that this trip I think conti=
nues to demonstrate and elevate the President's focus on the Asia Pacific=
 region. The Asia rebalance has been a central objective of the President=
's broader foreign policy and economic policy, rooted in our belief that =
this largest-emerging market in the world is critical to our future prosp=
erity and also central to a whole host of critical U.S. national security=
 interests as well.=20



And this trip, in particular, highlights both the emerging U.S. partnersh=
ip with Vietnam that has already grown by leaps and bounds since the norm=
alization process began, but is poised to be elevated to a new level -- t=
he U.S.-Japan alliance, which is, of course, the cornerstone of our appro=
ach to stability and security in Asia, together with our other treaty all=
iances, and, of course, the G7, which is one of the principal forums in w=
hich we address international issues.=20



I think what's notable about the trip, and you will see in the schedule, =
is it speaks to the breadth of our engagement with these countries in tha=
t we are addressing security and strategic issues; we are addressing sign=
ificant economic and commercial issues, including the fact that both of t=
hese countries are a part of TPP; and growing people-to-people exchanges.=
=20



Obviously, there is also a significant amount of history between the Unit=
ed States and Vietnam, and the United States and Japan that we can speak =
to in the Q&A. But I do think that the quality of our relationships with =
both Vietnam and Japan just demonstrate how far we have come, from a diff=
icult past, in forging constructive relationships that benefit the people=
s of the United States and Vietnam, as well as the peoples of the United =
States and Japan.



So we will be leaving here on Saturday afternoon and arriving in Vietnam =
on Sunday night. And so our official program in Vietnam will begin at Han=
oi on Monday, May 23rd. The President will begin with an official arrival=
 ceremony, and then he will be having a bilateral meeting with the Presid=
ent of Vietnam. Following that bilateral meeting, the two leaders will be=
 having a press conference -- a joint press conference together.



After that, we anticipate the President will have the opportunity to inte=
ract with the new head of the National Assembly in Vietnam. He will then =
be hosted at a state luncheon in Vietnam, and he will then have a bilater=
al meeting with the Prime Minister of Vietnam. Following that, he will ha=
ve a bilateral meeting with the General Secretary of the Community Party =
of Vietnam.=20



So this series of bilateral meetings I think demonstrates the breadth of =
our engagement with the Vietnamese. We'd expect to have a very robust age=
nda that will include a range of issues, including the cooperation that w=
e pursued to complete the TPP negotiations; our significant efforts to pr=
omote greater commercial ties that benefit growth and job creation in bot=
h of our countries; the discussion that we've had on regional security is=
sues, both bilaterally and through ASEAN, which addresses many issues to =
include cooperation on areas like maritime security and disaster response=
; and our commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes in the region=
; and our emerging and growing people-to-people ties and cooperation in a=
reas like education and entrepreneurship.=20



So we'll have a broad agenda with the Vietnamese. But I think what we wan=
t to demonstrate with this visit is a significant upgrade in the relation=
ship between the United States and Vietnam as partners on many issues, ev=
en as we have areas of difference that will continue to be the case.=20



On Tuesday, May 24th, the President will have a meeting with members of V=
ietnamese civil society as he does in countries around the world. He alwa=
ys like to take the opportunity to meet with both governmental representa=
tives, but also representatives of civil society. That will also give him=
 an opportunity to reaffirm his commitment to human rights and inclusive =
governance in Vietnam, as we do in countries around the world. So he'll h=
ave an opportunity to hear the views and concerns of civil society and sh=
are his own thoughts in return.



Following that, the President will give a speech to the Vietnamese people=
 as, again, he's done in many countries. This is an opportunity I think f=
or the President to step back and reflect upon the enormous progress that=
 has been made over the last two decades in advancing the U.S.-Vietnamese=
 bilateral relations.=20



It will very much focus on the bilateral relationship, on our areas of co=
operation, on the future vision that he has for the U.S.-Vietnamese relat=
ionship. And, of course, there will be areas of difference, but we addres=
s those differences respectfully. And, frankly, having a new and broader =
relationship I think affords us greater opportunity to have respectful di=
alogue -- again, both about areas of common interest and about areas of c=
ontinued differences.



 Following that speech, he will be leaving Hanoi and traveling to Ho Chi =
Minh City. When he arrives in Ho Chi Minh City, we will be visiting the J=
ade Pagoda to be able to pay tribute to and admire the cultural tradition=
s of Vietnam. Following the visit to the Pagoda, he will have an event th=
at is focused on both our commercial ties and on entrepreneurship. Hell b=
e able to meet with some young Vietnamese entrepreneurs who are doing imp=
ortant work, and then hell be able to participate in a discussion that li=
fts up the benefits of TPP to both of our countries, and the ability of T=
PP to promote growth and job creation and also high standards on issues l=
ike labor and the environment. And Ill leave it to Mike to discuss that i=
n greater depth. That will conclude his day in Ho Chi Minh City.



 Then on Wednesday, May 25th, the President will host a town hall with me=
mbers of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative. As you may know, w=
e launched YSEALI a number of years ago. It has grown by leaps and bounds=
 to include engagements with thousands of young people across the 10 ASEA=
N countries, including significant participation from young Vietnamese.=20=




 So as he has done in other countries -- in Myanmar, in Malaysia, and in =
others -- hell have the opportunity to speak and take questions from youn=
g Vietnamese. So, again, I think this visit is unusually long -- were spe=
nding three days in Vietnam, going to two cities, addressing the strategi=
c, security, economic, and people-to-people relationship that were buildi=
ng, and we intend for this to be a truly impactful visit in the history o=
f U.S.-Vietnamese relations.



 After that, we will fly from Vietnam to Japan for the G7 Summit. I will =
leave it to my colleague, Wally, to talk through the sessions and agenda =
for the G7 Summit. I will say that, of course, there are some outstanding=
 scheduling issues. What we would anticipate is that the President will h=
ave a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. When we have a =
time set for that, we will, of course, let you know. And then in addition=
 to that bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Abe, he will be participat=
ing throughout the day on Thursday in the G7 Summit.



 Then he will begin his final day on Friday with the remaining sessions o=
f the G7 Summit. Following the G7 Summit, he will leave and he will fly t=
o Hiroshima. I think hell have an opportunity -- given that we will be fl=
ying into Iwakuni Base -- to also thank some of the U.S. and Japanese ser=
vicemembers who work together and represent our alliance in action today.=
 But then he will proceed to Hiroshima.=20



Obviously this is an incredibly important visit for the Japanese people a=
nd the American people. Weve discussed this, were happy to take your ques=
tions about it. But of course hell be -- we still havent finalized every =
element of the program, but we anticipate that hell of course be able to =
visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial to lay a wreath and engage in a brief =
tour of the memorial grounds, after which he will be able to deliver a st=
atement reflecting upon what his impressions are. He will be accompanied =
by Prime Minister Abe of Japan.



 Id just say briefly at the outset that youve heard us say that, first, t=
his will be an opportunity for him to reflect on the extraordinary human =
toll of war and the loss of innocents in World War II -- the loss of inno=
cents, of course, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but also in many countries a=
round the world. I think the President wants to pay recognition to the hu=
man toll of war, and obviously this is a particularly powerful site for h=
im to do so.



 Second, he will of course be reaffirming his commitment to pursuing the =
peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. We have said that,=
 as the one nation to have used nuclear weapons, the United States has a =
unique and moral responsibility to work on behalf of the goal of a world =
without nuclear weapons. And we hope to instill in the world a greater se=
nse of urgency around that agenda around the Presidents visit.=20

And lastly, hell have an opportunity I think to speak to the fact that fr=
om the tragedy of war, the U.S. and Japan have been able to build an extr=
aordinary alliance that benefits both of our people. And his message in t=
hat regard will be forward-looking; that as we reflect on and confront di=
rectly and engage in dialogue about our history, we are focused on the fu=
ture were trying to seek -- a future of greater peace and cooperation, of=
 nonproliferation going forward.



Ill stop there because thats the conclusion of the Presidents trip. Again=
, there will be some other potential scheduling engagements that are adde=
d. But Ill turn it over to Wally to walk through the G7 agenda.



MR. ADEYEMO: Thanks, Ben. The G7 this year will offer several tangible op=
portunities to make progress on a host of issues that the leaders of the =
G7 have been addressing for the Presidents two terms in office, starting =
with the global economy.=20



While the United States has been relatively a pillar of strength within t=
he G7 economies, growth has been overall moderate and uneven. The global =
economic discussion will give the leaders an opportunity to talk about wh=
at they can do collectively as leaders of seven of the largest developed =
economies to boost global demand, especially in the environment of low in=
terest rate, and a need for increased investment.



In addition to a conversation about the overall global economy, there wil=
l be a conversation about the trade agenda. The G7 nations are all engage=
d in various regional trade agreements. The United States -- and Ill allo=
w Ambassador Froman to speak to these -- but its engaged in trade agreeme=
nts with Japan, Canada, in TPP, and with the European Union in T-TIP. In =
addition to that, other countries -- for example, Canada and the European=
 Union -- are also in discussions about a regional trade agreement, as ar=
e the Japanese and the Europeans.=20



So there will be a discussion about those trade agreements, but in additi=
on to that, there will be a conversation about what we can do to make sur=
e that we are using our trade and trade enforcement tools and our trade a=
greements to maximize the benefits to our workers and our firms, and to l=
evel the playing field. There will also be a discussion about over-capaci=
ty in this session, and what we can do to address over-capacity in severa=
l areas with an emphasis on steel and how we can use our collective actio=
n to best ensure that over-capacity is addressed.



In addition to that, our leaders will have a conversation about foreign p=
olicy and the foreign policy challenges that they face that will largely =
reflect the conversations that occurred amongst our foreign ministers whe=
n they met in Hiroshima. They will also have the opportunity to take note=
 of the climate change agenda that was set in Paris in 2015, and to talk =
about what we can do to ambitiously implement that agenda consistent with=
 our goal of reducing the temperature by 1.5 and 2 degrees.



We will also have an opportunity to hear from a number of Asian countries=
. As Japan is the only Asian member of the G7, they have chosen to invite=
 a number of Asian countries to talk about issues that are particular to =
Asia, but issues that also are relevant to the rest of the world. For exa=
mple, infrastructure, the development agenda, the inclusion of women in t=
he economy and society, and health care. These are issues that are not on=
ly important to our economies, but also socially important to us. And it =
will give us a chance to have a holistic conversation about what the G7 c=
an do to advance the prosperity and the security of our people.



AMBASSADOR FROMAN: Great. Thank you, Ben and Wally. Let me talk a little =
bit about Vietnam and touch on the trade issues regarding the visit to Ja=
pan.=20



With Vietnam -- 90 million people, rapidly growing middle class -- a midd=
le class that is expected to double between 2014 and 2020. And one thing =
we know is that as middle class consumers emerge, they want more of every=
thing that the United States is well-positioned to make and to export. Bu=
t we face significant barriers to those exports.



So in Vietnam, for example, U.S. auto exports face a 70 percent tariff, 7=
4 percent tariff on motorcycles, 32 percent tariff on auto parts. Made-in=
-America machinery like construction equipment are hit with tariffs as hi=
gh as 59 percent; beef, 34 percent; poultry, 40 percent. So we face these=
 barriers getting our products into Vietnam, and those tariffs need to be=
 eliminated or greatly reduced through the TPP implementation.=20



The reason why thats important is that our market is already very open. S=
o we have average applied tariffs of 1.4 percent compared to the tariffs =
that I just described for you. We dont use non-tariff regulations as a ba=
rrier to trade. And TPP gives us an opportunity to level the playing fiel=
d for our workers and ranchers and farmers and firms so that they can get=
 more of their products into this fast-growing market.



Beyond the tariffs, though, and the non-tariff barriers is a set of rules=
 the TPP represents. So, for intellectual property -- issues like counter=
feits or trade secrets. The rules around the digital economy, making sure=
 the Internet stays open and free and theres a free flow of data across b=
orders. Obligations to prevent governments from replacing tariffs with no=
n-tariff barriers. Rules assuring that state-owned enterprises, of which =
there are many in Vietnam, have to compete on a level playing field again=
st our private firms, and our private firms now have recourse if they don=
't.



 Issues around, very importantly, labor and the environment. Vietnam has =
agreed to allow independent unions that can control their own finances, e=
lect their own leaders, conduct strikes, affiliate as they wish, get assi=
stance from outside labor organizations. Theyve agreed to the five basic =
ILO labor principles -- the right to associate, the right to collective b=
argain, prohibitions on child labor and forced labor, prohibitions on emp=
loyment discrimination. Theyve agreed the acceptable conditions of work -=
- having a minimum wage, hours regulations, safe workplace conditions. An=
d all those obligations under TPP are fully enforceable, meaning that the=
ir access to our market is tied to their compliance with these provisions=
.



 Same thing on the environmental side. Vietnam is a market for much of th=
e illegally traded wildlife around the world, and theyve agreed to take o=
n obligations to combat illegal wildlife trade as well.



 So theres a great opportunity here. This is the next phase in our econom=
ic relationship with Vietnam that, as Ben said, has been growing since no=
rmalization of relations 20 or so years ago.



 Japan, as Wally mentioned, of course, is another TPP partner. Theyre wor=
king their way through ratification of TPP. And there, too, are great eco=
nomic opportunities -- from the ag side, where they have a 3.2 percent ta=
riff on beef, substantial protection around pork, obstacles to our export=
s on dairy products that will be dealt with through TPP, to the auto side=
, where we have a special agreement with Japan to deal with the non-tarif=
f barriers to our auto exports.=20



So it will be very important that we engage with Japan and the other part=
ies at the G7 about the ratification process for TPP in the various count=
ries and the continuing work that needs to be done in T-TIP to bring poli=
tical will to the table to address the outstanding issues in a pragmatic =
and creative manner with the goal of, as the President said in Hannover, =
trying to reach agreement on T-TIP over the course of this year.



Q A question related to Vietnam. Whats the decision, if, in fact, one has=
 been made yet, on whether there should be a full lifting of the arms emb=
argo on Vietnam, or whether it should stay in place? And what might be th=
e timing of such an announcement before departure, or possibly during the=
 trip? Or are we talking about taking longer?



MR. RHODES: Thanks, Matt, for the question. We have not finalized a decis=
ion related to this issue. It is something that we regularly review and w=
e certainly expect that it will be a subject of discussion with the Vietn=
amese. So I'd expect that this will be discussed in the context of the Pr=
esident's meetings, and it's something that we obviously have been lookin=
g at as we prepare for the visit in the context of our broader relationsh=
ip. So we are thinking through how is our evolving security cooperation g=
oing to look moving forward. We are looking at, of course, how our broade=
r relationship is evolving, including our continued commitment to support=
 human rights in Vietnam.=20



 So, again, I think this will be discussed in the context of where this r=
elationship is going, and it's something that we'll certainly be addressi=
ng in the bilateral meetings with the Vietnamese. And we'll have the oppo=
rtunity to -- they regularly raise this issue with us, and we'll, of cour=
se, want to have the opportunity to explain our thoughts to them, and I t=
hink we'll have the opportunity to discuss it in that context.



 I will say there's also obviously a lot of views on this issue in Congre=
ss, as well. And we've been engaged in consultations with Congress about =
this and other issues related to the U.S.-Vietnam relationship over the l=
ast days and weeks. So this has factored into the set of issues that we'v=
e been reviewing in preparation for the visit. We expect the President wi=
ll be discussing this issue and how we intend to approach it going forwar=
d in his meetings in Hanoi.=20



And we are looking at it, not narrowly, in the context of simply whether =
or not to look to them, but rather where is our relationship going, what =
is the most effective way of advancing our cooperation, but also in build=
ing the tougher relationship where we can cooperate on areas of common in=
terest while also having productive and respectful dialogue on areas of d=
isagreement, which of course is primarily focused on issues related to hu=
man rights. So we will, again, look forward to continuing this discussion=
 with the Vietnamese and, of course, with those who are interested over t=
he course of the visit.



 Q Hi, Ben. Thanks. And can you tell us how you're viewing this EgyptAir =
incident now that U.S. officials have said that they suspect it was a bom=
b? Is this looking like this is going to be another case of the President=
 traveling and issues of terrorism overshadowing the other issues on the =
trip? And secondly, on the TPP, given the roadblocks that have been out t=
here -- that are still out there, what kind of progress do you expect to =
see towards finally ratifying this eventually? And what's your time frame=
, and when do you envision this actually happening? Thank you.



 MR. RHODES: Thanks, Michelle. On the first question, obviously we are de=
eply concerned about the situation involving the EgyptAir flight, and our=
 hearts go out to the loved ones of those who are currently missing. Our =
government has not reached a formal determination about what took place. =
We have offered our assistance to the relevant authorities that are curre=
ntly engaged in an investigation. And we will continue to provide you wit=
h updates if we draw any formal conclusions. Of course, again, the countr=
ies that are more directly involved -- Egypt and France -- are leading th=
e investigation. We've offered our full support, and we obviously will be=
 doing our own analysis of what we believe happened.=20



 With respect to how that relates to the President's trip, we obviously h=
ave enormous economic and national security interests in the Asia Pacific=
 region, just as we have a profound and enduring interest in preventing a=
ny acts of terrorism. And so we, of course, will be pursuing I think a ve=
ry important assessment of an agenda that has an enormous bearing on the =
long-term interests of the American people and our national security and =
economic security going forward throughout the course of the trip as it r=
elates to terrorism. And that, again, doesnt prejudice the investigation =
because there's not been any formal determination made. Clearly, that wil=
l also be a subject at the G7. One of the principal foreign policy areas =
that has been a focus of the G7 in recent years has been our shared effor=
ts against terrorism.



 On TPP, I'll turn it over to Mike. I will just say that I think that bot=
h of these countries are indications of the types of markets that are goi=
ng to be critical to U.S. exports and job creation going forward. And so =
from just one perspective -- before I go to Mike -- I think it is a furth=
er demonstration of how important it is that the United States not be shu=
t out of certain markets and have the ability to shape the rules of the r=
oad in this critically important region.



 But Im going to hand it over to our trade representative.



 AMBASSADOR FROMAN: Thank you, Ben. Just to build on that, we are and we =
have been in consultation with Congress since completing the agreement la=
st October. We published it in November; we signed it in February. Were c=
ontinuing to work through the various procedures laid out under Trade Pro=
motion Authority that Congress approved last year and were consulting wit=
h congressional leadership and the leadership of our committees on what t=
he best timetable is for bringing this up for a vote.



 In the meantime, we are working with members of Congress individually to=
 walk them through the agreement, address their concerns, demonstrate wha=
ts in the agreement for their constituents or stakeholders that they care=
 a lot about. Were working to resolve a handful of key issues that have b=
een flagged as particularly important by members of Congress. And weve al=
ready started the process -- normally, after Congress approves a trade ag=
reement, then we turn to the implementation process with the countries.=20=




And in this case, weve decided to accelerate that. In consultation with C=
ongress, we are already working with the countries in the region on the v=
arious steps that theyll need to take to bring themselves into compliance=
 with TPP. And that includes Vietnam, where weve already had teams out in=
 Vietnam over the last couple of months talking to them about the array o=
f obligations that they have under the agreement.



 Q So I have a couple of questions for you. Specifically for Ben, what do=
 you think about the absence of Russia from the summit table? How does it=
 affect the discussion on Syria and ISIS, for instance? My final question=
 is, is Obama going to be meeting with Hiroshima survivors during this tr=
ip? Thank you.



 MR. RHODES: Thanks. On the first question, we have been very clear that =
the G7, formerly the G8, part of the basis of the organization is to have=
 cooperation on behalf of the fundamental international principles and no=
rms that allow for peaceful development, peaceful relations among countri=
es. And when Russia flouted those rules because of its violation of the s=
overeignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, the decision was taken c=
ollectively that Russia should not participate in upcoming G7 meetings.



 So it was entirely Russias determination to violate the most basic inter=
national principle, which is the sovereignty and territorial integrity of=
 a country. That led to this being a G7. Of course, the option continues =
to be available to Russia to change course and to respect the sovereignty=
 and territorial integrity of its neighbors. Until it does, not only are =
they not participating in the G7 meeting, but of course, together with th=
e other G7 countries weve imposed very significant sanctions on Russia, r=
elated to its actions in Ukraine.



 I will take the opportunity to briefly say that Russia has an opportunit=
y in front of themselves, together with the Ukrainian government and the =
separatists, to fully implement the Minsk agreement, which would both be =
of great benefit to the people of Ukraine but also weve been very clear i=
t could create a pathway for the relaxation of those sanctions.



 With respect to Syria and ISIL, Russias absence from this forum does not=
 foreclose our ability to be engaged in regular dialogue with them about =
those issues. And, in fact, weve been deeply engaged in discussions with =
Russia about the cessation of hostilities that weve sought to preserve wi=
thin Syria about the efforts to promote a peace process in Geneva. Secret=
ary Kerry and Prime Minister Lavrov have spoken about that. President Oba=
ma and President Putin have. So we have those channels of communication j=
ust as we have efforts to de-conflict our military efforts in Syria. But =
again, I think its important that it is demonstrated that theres a cost f=
or actions that violate basic international law, and thats why this is a =
G7 meeting.



On the Hiroshima program, we have not finalized the elements of the Presi=
dents visit, including who he might meet with or interact with while hes =
in Hiroshima. So we will provide you with updates as that is further deve=
loped. Again, what we do know is that he will visit the Peace Memorial, t=
hat he will be joined by Prime Minister Abe, that hell have an opportunit=
y to lay a wreath but also to offer his reflections on his visit. And I k=
now that he is very much anticipating the opportunity to have that experi=
ence and to speak to the people of Japan and the United States and the wo=
rld about what he takes away from that experience.



Q Hi, thanks for having this call. You mentioned over-capacity, so, Wally=
, or Mike Froman, just wanted to ask, I assume the main focus would be on=
 over-capacity of base metals like steel products and aluminum thats weig=
hing on G7 economies and the U.S. And Im just wondering -- these countrie=
s have met before at the OECD and elsewhere on this issue. Im just wonder=
ing, is the G7 where -- a place where we would expect a plan of action on=
 this? Or is it just a place for countries to discuss their individual ac=
tions that they might take? And where would the U.S. be in that process? =
China and even South Korea are right next door to the G7 meetings, so Im =
just curious to see how thats going.



MR. ADEYEMO: I think, as you know well, the solution to over-capacity, es=
pecially in the base metals, requires a global solution. And while the G7=
 is a large segment of the global economy, it isnt the entire global econ=
omy. The meeting gives us an opportunity to work together to organize our=
 shared approach toward these issues, but we need to work alongside count=
ries like South Korea and Brazil and India and other countries to hold th=
ose accountable who are responsible for over-capacity in the base metal s=
ector.=20



And I think our goal has been, in the United States, to use our trade enf=
orcement laws aggressively to do that. But we know that this is a global =
problem that requires a global solution, and we want to do a better job o=
f coordinating with our international partners in the G7 and in other for=
ums.



Q Thanks for the call. Its a question for Ben or Dan. Weve seen, again, i=
n the last 24 hours, another escalation of tensions, and so I was trying =
to see what this intercepts -- the discussion about the Vietnam arms emba=
rgo, which is annoying the Chinese, and the ruling coming up. I was just =
wondering if you can say -- can tell us how are you kind of -- take a lit=
tle bit of heat out of this issue, and whether you actually want to take =
a little bit of heat out of this issue.



MR. KRITENBRINK: Look, our approach to the South China Sea has been very =
consistent, and youll continue to see that going forward. We have demonst=
rated very clearly that we dont take a position on any of the competing s=
overeignty claims in the South China Sea, but we do very clearly take a p=
osition on how those disputes are resolved, and we make very clear they n=
eed to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law.



And at the same time, weve demonstrated that the United States, as with a=
ll countries, enjoys certain rights under international law, including th=
e freedom of navigation and freedom of overflight.



You have seen, as we have, the reports that there was an unsafe intercept=
 in the South China Sea in the last 24 hours. Were looking into that inci=
dent. I dont have further details for it, but I think youre well aware th=
at we routinely carry out naval and other operations, both in the airspac=
e over the South China Sea and in the international waters of the South C=
hina Sea. We do those routinely, in a safe manner, and well continue to d=
o that going forward.



Although maritime issues is not the central focus of the visit per se, ob=
viously these issues are of great importance to all countries in the regi=
on, including to Vietnam and to Japan, obviously to the United States. An=
d Im confident that when the President sits down with the Vietnamese lead=
ership and with Prime Minister Abe, that this will be one important topic=
 of discussion. And I also anticipate that the leaders at the G7 will hav=
e the opportunity to engage on these issues as well.



MR. RHODES: The only thing Id add, Andrew, is just a couple things. I mea=
n, one is we also have worked to ensure that we have military-to-military=
 engagement with China, in part so that we have the capacity to raise con=
cerns around particular issues, and just have open lines of communication=
.=20



The second thing that Id say is that the United States role in the region=
 has been to reinforce international rules of the road and peace and stab=
ility. And for decades, that presence has helped facilitate peaceful deve=
lopment in the Asia Pacific region. And to the extent to which there is b=
ehavior that seeks to take these types of territorial disputes and put th=
em into the type of dynamic where a bigger nation is seeking to inserts i=
ts rule over a smaller one, I think that raises concerns in the region. A=
nd it only reinforces the need to have a dialogue around support for clea=
r international rules of the road.=20



And so we pursued that discussion at Sunnylands with the ASEAN countries =
-- several of whom are claimants, several of whom aren't -- but all of th=
em have an interest in the peaceful resolution of disputes and the free f=
low of commerce through the South China Sea. We'll certainly have that di=
scussion with Vietnam. It's only one element of many aspects of our coope=
ration on security and economic issues.



But again, I think what we see is an interest in the region and the Unite=
d States being present as a country that is committed to international ru=
les and norms. And that will be our consistent message throughout the cou=
rse of the visit.



I think we have time for a couple more questions.



Q I have two questions, one for Ambassador Froman on TPP. You talked a lo=
t about exports to a growing middle class in Vietnam, but I wonder if you=
 could talk a little bit about the other phenomenon, which is that I thin=
k apparel and footwear textiles imports to the U.S. from Vietnam stand to=
 gain from the lowering of U.S. tariffs. I think the ITC report yesterday=
 talked about imports from TPP countries, especially Vietnam and those ma=
rkets, we expand by 23 percent, and that ultimately manufacturing jobs wo=
uld actually diminish compared to baseline assumptions. What does that sa=
y to American shoe manufacturers and others who were saying the final rem=
aining jobs we have are destined to go to offshore because of this deal? =
Is that just the future of kind of where we're headed, and the U.S. has t=
o focus on other jobs? Is that the message for this deal?



And then one for Ben, if I could, about Japan and the Presidents visit to=
 Hiroshima. There are those who say the Presidents visit will -- even if =
hes not apologizing -- will bring even more closure and final reconciliat=
ion to the people in Hiroshima, but that then it's up to the Japanese Pri=
me Minister, whether it's Abe or a future one, to take more steps to clos=
e the World War II chapter in Asia, despite what he did on the comfort wo=
men and some of the speeches to Congress, and on the 70th anniversary las=
t year in Japan. I wonder if you had thoughts about that, or whether you =
believe Japan has done enough at this point to move forward in the region=
, and whether at all theres any talk between the U.S. and Japan of having=
 Prime Minister Abe visit Pearl Harbor before President Obama leaves offi=
ce.



AMBASSADOR FROMAN: Thanks, David. On your TPP question, we worked very cl=
osely with both the domestic footwear and apparel manufacturers here in t=
he United States as well as the importers throughout the negotiations. An=
d the final deal was endorsed both by the footwear producers in the U.S. =
and the footwear importers, same thing. The textile industry endorsed it =
as well as the apparel importers.=20



Just take footwear, for example. There are high tariffs of our footwear e=
xports into Japan that will be eliminated. So we're going to see our expo=
rts go up. We will see, I believe it's a 2 percent increase in imports of=
 footwear, so most of those increased imports from Vietnam is production =
shifting from China to Vietnam. It's not all an increase in imports to th=
e U.S.



With regard to the manufacturing question you asked, I think that points =
to one of the limitations of the model, which is, as you probably know, t=
he ITC model assumes that the trade deficit remains the same -- the trade=
 balance stays the same as a percentage of GDP. So as they show increases=
 of exports in one sector, they need to show decreases in exports or incr=
eases in imports in other sectors. And it's a relative measure based on w=
here they see the most significant increases in productivity.



And that's why it shows greater gains in services than it may in some oth=
er sectors. But it doesnt mean that in reality theres going to be a decli=
ne relative to the baseline.



MR. RHODES: Thanks, David, for your question. I'd say a couple things. Fi=
rst of all, we said that this is not about issuing an apology. And of cou=
rse, the American people are extraordinarily proud of the generation of s=
ervicemembers who fought in World War II, at a time of maximum peril to o=
ur nation, and they have a revered place in our society.=20



What we are able to do in going to Hiroshima is to pay tribute to the eno=
rmous suffering and loss of innocence in war. And, first of all, as I sai=
d in the opening, you're talking about a conflict that had an enormous hu=
man toll, with tens of millions of people killed around the world, includ=
ing so many innocents. And even in Hiroshima, you had obviously an extrao=
rdinary loss of life of innocent Japanese civilians, and you also had the=
 loss of life of many Koreans who were present in Hiroshima, and even Ame=
rican servicemembers who were there.=20



And I think that the Presidents message, therefore, is, in part, that lea=
ders and citizens have to be mindful going forward about the enormous cos=
t of war, and that we can never forget the toll that war takes on innocen=
t life.=20



Secondly, of course, as I mentioned, Hiroshima and Nagasaki are symbols o=
f both that loss of innocent life, but also the toll of nuclear weapons. =
And it is very important that leaders not lose urgency -- as we get farth=
er and farther away from the use of nuclear weapons, that we not lose urg=
ency in seeking to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and seeking to r=
educe nuclear stockpiles, and ultimately pursue a world without them.=20



And we've spent a lot of time promoting nuclear security and seeking to r=
educe our deployed stockpile and launchers through the New START Treaty, =
and trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons through the Iran deal, a=
nd of course, in dealing with the extraordinary challenge from North Kore=
a as it pursues a nuclear program.=20



So it's an opportunity to I think focus the worlds attention on the need =
to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and seek a world without them.



With respect to Pearl Harbor, I'd just say, first of all, that we draw no=
 linkages to our decision to go to Hiroshima. This is the Presidents deci=
sion. And he is making this decision be he believes that it's important t=
o acknowledge history; it's important to look squarely at history; it's i=
mportant to have a dialogue about history. And every leader has to make t=
heir own choices about how they will do that.



We have encouraged all leaders in Asia to try to look at these difficult =
historical issues in a manner that promotes dialogue and understanding an=
d ultimately reconciliation.=20



 In that context, we very much welcomed the agreement that was reached wi=
th respect to comfort women. And there are many different issues -- and I=
 should add that a great deal of courage from both Prime Minister Abe and=
 President Park, given how important the history of the comfort women is =
to the people of the Republic of Korea.=20



 And there are many historical issues that continue to be hotly discussed=
 and debated in the Asia Pacific. I think our point is that the more that=
 theres able to be peaceful dialogue about those issues, the more they wi=
ll not be sources of tension going forward, but rather we can overcome th=
ose issues. And, frankly, again, the very fact that the United States is =
traveling to Japan, that its now one of our closest allies in the world, =
and Vietnam, which is a merging partner of ours I think demonstrates how =
you are able to move beyond difficult history, and thats what we would en=
courage the countries of the Asia Pacific to do.



 So Prime Minister Abe will make his own decisions about how he addresses=
 these issues and about Pearl Harbor, but I think thats certainly how Pre=
sident Obama views it.



 Last question.



 Q All my questions have actually already been addressed so Ill let someo=
ne else go.



 Q I wondered if in Hiroshima if the President had any plans to use his r=
eflections to offer any new or concrete steps on how to reduce nuclear we=
apons, globally or in the U.S. And in that same vein, can you comment on =
the notion that the world is actually further away from the Presidents go=
al of a nuclear-free world now than it was when he gave his speech in Pra=
gue seven years ago?



 MR. RHODES: Well, first of all, were not going to give a major policy ad=
dress in Hiroshima. We just, frankly, didnt think that it was the appropr=
iate venue. This is such a powerful place and so therefore we thought tha=
t a simple reflection on the cost of war and the cost of nuclear weapons =
was the appropriate way for the President to speak from the heart about h=
is reflections.



 I will say that, again, we do hope that in visiting Hiroshima, were able=
 to once again spotlight the imperative that the world has to seek a redu=
ction and ultimate elimination of the risk of nuclear weapons.



 Look, I would -- it might not surprise you -- take a different view of I=
 think whats happened since we took office. I think we made progress on a=
 number of fronts, even as we acknowledge, and wed be the first to acknow=
ledge, that theres a lot more work to do. First of all, we made clear fro=
m the beginning of our time in office that we wanted to keep our own NPT =
commitments to pursue the reductions of our own stockpiles. And the new S=
TART treaty in the first term was one of the most significant arms contro=
l agreements of recent years. It significantly reduced our deployed stock=
piles and launchers with Russia, and demonstrated that we were once again=
 moving in that direction.



 Secondly, we reduced the role of nuclear weapons in our own national sec=
urity strategy so that we are less reliant on nuclear weapons as we addre=
ss issues around the world.=20



 Thirdly, weve hosted a series of nuclear summits that have significantly=
 enhanced nuclear security protocols and eliminated a significant amount =
of nuclear material -- again, all of which is to help keep the most dange=
rous material out of the hands of terrorists and other actors who we woul=
d not want to obtain weapons.



 Then, in terms of nonproliferation -- and I think this is really importa=
nt -- over the course of the last decades since the Cold War, youve seen =
the proliferation and spread of nuclear weapons through a number of state=
s.=20



During President Obamas seven and a half years in office, there has not b=
een any new member of the nuclear club, in large part because we were abl=
e to reach a diplomatic agreement with the Iranian government and the P5+=
1 that assures and verifies that they will not be able to develop a nucle=
ar weapon, and that, in fact, has demonstrably rolled back their nuclear =
program. Theyve shipped out their stockpile, converted their reactors, an=
d taken other steps to allow for the verification that they are not pursu=
ing a nuclear weapon.



So on nonproliferation and nuclear security and arms control, I think the=
re are things that we are quite proud of. However, to be very specific ab=
out what has not taken place, and very straightforward about that, we had=
 indicated an interest in additional arms control. And Russia, particular=
ly after President Putin took office, indicated that they were not intere=
sted in pursuing that discussion, so we were not able to have an addition=
al round of discussions around further arms control agreements. So thats =
one example of an area where we think that theres further progress.



There are other areas where wed like to see continued progress around agr=
eements like a fissile material cutoff treaty, where, again, there contin=
ue to be challenges in building an international consensus around those i=
ssues.=20



So we certainly acknowledge that theres more to be done. But we do believ=
e that we have bent the curve in the right direction on nonproliferation =
nuclear security, the role of nuclear weapons in our national security st=
rategy, and our own stockpile and launchers. I know theres some controver=
sy around some of our modernization, but what we would say is what Presid=
ent Obama said in Prague, which is as long as nuclear weapons exist, we d=
o need to have an effective and credible deterrent, both for our own secu=
rity and for the security of allies like Japan and the Republic of Korea.=




So again, we hope in going that were able to energize that process, lift =
up progress thats been made, but also with that, spotlight additional eff=
orts that need to be done. Thats all for the better, and we welcome that =
attention. And we hope to do as much as we can with our time in office, a=
nd then we hope that, going forward, future administrations pursue that g=
oal of ultimately -- the goal that, I should say, not just President Obam=
a but Presidents like President Reagan and President Kennedy embraced, wh=
ich was the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.



So Ill stop there. Sorry to go on. I didnt want to just credit ourselves;=
 I also wanted to be very clear that we do recognize that the Presidents =
Prague agenda is unfinished, but thats part of the reason for shining a l=
ight on these issues in Hiroshima.



So thanks, everybody, for joining the call.



MR. STROH: Ladies and gentlemen, just as a reminder, the call was on the =
record, and now that we have concluded, the embargo is lifted. Thanks ver=
y much for your participation.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. STROH:&nbsp; Thank you very m=
uch.&nbsp; And, everyone, thanks for joining us this afternoon on a press c=
onference call to preview the President's trip to Vietnam and Japan.&nbsp; =
Today we have with us Ambassador Mike Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative=
;
 Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications;=
 Wally Adeyemo, the Deputy National Security Advisor for International Econ=
omics; and Dan Kritenbrink, the Senior Director for Asian Affairs at the Na=
tional Security Council.&nbsp; As a reminder,
 this call is on the record, but we will embargo the call until the conclus=
ion of the call.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with that, I'll turn it=
 over to Ben Rhodes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Great.&nb=
sp; Thanks, everybody, for joining the call.&nbsp; I'll just start by givin=
g an overview of the President's schedule and some of the key objectives of=
 the trip.&nbsp; I'll hand it over to Wally to speak to the G7, the process
 in which he's U.S. sherpa and lead, and then to Ambassador Froman to speak=
 to some of the trade issues particularly related to TPP, given that we are=
 traveling to two TPP countries.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, let me just s=
ay at the outset that this trip I think continues to demonstrate and elevat=
e the President's focus on the Asia Pacific region.&nbsp; The Asia rebalanc=
e has been a central objective of the President's broader foreign
 policy and economic policy, rooted in our belief that this largest-emergin=
g market in the world is critical to our future prosperity and also central=
 to a whole host of critical U.S. national security interests as well.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And this trip, in particu=
lar, highlights both the emerging U.S. partnership with Vietnam that has al=
ready grown by leaps and bounds since the normalization process began, but =
is poised to be elevated to a new level
 -- the U.S.-Japan alliance, which is, of course, the cornerstone of our ap=
proach to stability and security in Asia, together with our other treaty al=
liances, and, of course, the G7, which is one of the principal forums in wh=
ich we address international issues.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think what's notable ab=
out the trip, and you will see in the schedule, is it speaks to the breadth=
 of our engagement with these countries in that we are addressing security =
and strategic issues; we are addressing
 significant economic and commercial issues, including the fact that both o=
f these countries are a part of TPP; and growing people-to-people exchanges=
.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Obviously, there is also =
a significant amount of history between the United States and Vietnam, and =
the United States and Japan that we can speak to in the Q&amp;A.&nbsp; But =
I do think that the quality of our relationships
 with both Vietnam and Japan just demonstrate how far we have come, from a =
difficult past, in forging constructive relationships that benefit the peop=
les of the United States and Vietnam, as well as the peoples of the United =
States and Japan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we will be leaving her=
e on Saturday afternoon and arriving in Vietnam on Sunday night.&nbsp; And =
so our official program in Vietnam will begin at Hanoi on Monday, May 23rd.=
&nbsp; The President will begin with an official
 arrival ceremony, and then he will be having a bilateral meeting with the =
President of Vietnam.&nbsp; Following that bilateral meeting, the two leade=
rs will be having a press conference -- a joint press conference together.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">After that, we anticipate=
 the President will have the opportunity to interact with the new head of t=
he National Assembly in Vietnam.&nbsp; He will then be hosted at a state lu=
ncheon in Vietnam, and he will then have
 a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Vietnam.&nbsp; Following th=
at, he will have a bilateral meeting with the General Secretary of the Comm=
unity Party of Vietnam.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this series of bilater=
al meetings I think demonstrates the breadth of our engagement with the Vie=
tnamese.&nbsp; We'd expect to have a very robust agenda that will include a=
 range of issues, including the cooperation
 that we pursued to complete the TPP negotiations; our significant efforts =
to promote greater commercial ties that benefit growth and job creation in =
both of our countries; the discussion that we've had on regional security i=
ssues, both bilaterally and through
 ASEAN, which addresses many issues to include cooperation on areas like ma=
ritime security and disaster response; and our commitment to the peaceful r=
esolution of disputes in the region; and our emerging and growing people-to=
-people ties and cooperation in
 areas like education and entrepreneurship.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we'll have a broad age=
nda with the Vietnamese.&nbsp; But I think what we want to demonstrate with=
 this visit is a significant upgrade in the relationship between the United=
 States and Vietnam as partners on many issues,
 even as we have areas of difference that will continue to be the case. <o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">On Tuesday, May 24th, the=
 President will have a meeting with members of Vietnamese civil society as =
he does in countries around the world.&nbsp; He always like to take the opp=
ortunity to meet with both governmental representatives,
 but also representatives of civil society.&nbsp; That will also give him a=
n opportunity to reaffirm his commitment to human rights and inclusive gove=
rnance in Vietnam, as we do in countries around the world.&nbsp; So he'll h=
ave an opportunity to hear the views and concerns
 of civil society and share his own thoughts in return.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Following that, the Presi=
dent will give a speech to the Vietnamese people as, again, he's done in ma=
ny countries.&nbsp; This is an opportunity I think for the President to ste=
p back and reflect upon the enormous progress
 that has been made over the last two decades in advancing the U.S.-Vietnam=
ese bilateral relations.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">It will very much focus o=
n the bilateral relationship, on our areas of cooperation, on the future vi=
sion that he has for the U.S.-Vietnamese relationship.&nbsp; And, of course=
, there will be areas of difference, but
 we address those differences respectfully.&nbsp; And, frankly, having a ne=
w and broader relationship I think affords us greater opportunity to have r=
espectful dialogue -- again, both about areas of common interest and about =
areas of continued differences.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following that speech, he w=
ill be leaving Hanoi and traveling to Ho Chi Minh City.&nbsp; When he arriv=
es in Ho Chi Minh City, we will be visiting the Jade Pagoda to be able to p=
ay tribute to and admire the cultural traditions of Vietnam.&nbsp;
 Following the visit to the Pagoda, he will have an event that is focused o=
n both our commercial ties and on entrepreneurship.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll be ab=
le to meet with some young Vietnamese entrepreneurs who are doing important=
 work, and then he&#8217;ll be able to participate
 in a discussion that lifts up the benefits of TPP to both of our countries=
, and the ability of TPP to promote growth and job creation and also high s=
tandards on issues like labor and the environment.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll lea=
ve it to Mike to discuss that in greater depth.&nbsp;
 That will conclude his day in Ho Chi Minh City.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then on Wednesday, May 25th=
, the President will host a town hall with members of the Young Southeast A=
sian Leaders Initiative.&nbsp; As you may know, we launched YSEALI a number=
 of years ago.&nbsp; It has grown by leaps and bounds to include
 engagements with thousands of young people across the 10 ASEAN countries, =
including significant participation from young Vietnamese.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So as he has done in other =
countries -- in Myanmar, in Malaysia, and in others -- he&#8217;ll have the=
 opportunity to speak and take questions from young Vietnamese.&nbsp; So, a=
gain, I think this visit is unusually long -- we&#8217;re spending three
 days in Vietnam, going to two cities, addressing the strategic, security, =
economic, and people-to-people relationship that we&#8217;re building, and =
we intend for this to be a truly impactful visit in the history of U.S.-Vie=
tnamese relations.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, we will fly fro=
m Vietnam to Japan for the G7 Summit.&nbsp; I will leave it to my colleague=
, Wally, to talk through the sessions and agenda for the G7 Summit.&nbsp; I=
 will say that, of course, there are some outstanding scheduling
 issues.&nbsp; What we would anticipate is that the President will have a b=
ilateral meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan.&nbsp; When we have a tim=
e set for that, we will, of course, let you know.&nbsp; And then in additio=
n to that bilateral meeting with Prime Minister
 Abe, he will be participating throughout the day on Thursday in the G7 Sum=
mit.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he will begin his fina=
l day on Friday with the remaining sessions of the G7 Summit.&nbsp; Followi=
ng the G7 Summit, he will leave and he will fly to Hiroshima.&nbsp; I think=
 he&#8217;ll have an opportunity -- given that we will be flying into
 Iwakuni Base -- to also thank some of the U.S. and Japanese servicemembers=
 who work together and represent our alliance in action today.&nbsp; But th=
en he will proceed to Hiroshima.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Obviously this is an incr=
edibly important visit for the Japanese people and the American people.&nbs=
p; We&#8217;ve discussed this, we&#8217;re happy to take your questions abo=
ut it.&nbsp; But of course he&#8217;ll be -- we still haven&#8217;t finaliz=
ed
 every element of the program, but we anticipate that he&#8217;ll of course=
 be able to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial to lay a wreath and engage i=
n a brief tour of the memorial grounds, after which he will be able to deli=
ver a statement reflecting upon what his
 impressions are.&nbsp; He will be accompanied by Prime Minister Abe of Jap=
an.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;d just say briefly =
at the outset that you&#8217;ve heard us say that, first, this will be an o=
pportunity for him to reflect on the extraordinary human toll of war and th=
e loss of innocents in World War II -- the loss of innocents, of course,
 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but also in many countries around the world.&nb=
sp; I think the President wants to pay recognition to the human toll of war=
, and obviously this is a particularly powerful site for him to do so.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, he will of course b=
e reaffirming his commitment to pursuing the peace and security of a world =
without nuclear weapons.&nbsp; We have said that, as the one nation to have=
 used nuclear weapons, the United States has a unique and moral
 responsibility to work on behalf of the goal of a world without nuclear we=
apons.&nbsp; And we hope to instill in the world a greater sense of urgency=
 around that agenda around the President&#8217;s visit.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And lastly, he&#8217;ll h=
ave an opportunity I think to speak to the fact that from the tragedy of wa=
r, the U.S. and Japan have been able to build an extraordinary alliance tha=
t benefits both of our people.&nbsp; And his message
 in that regard will be forward-looking; that as we reflect on and confront=
 directly and engage in dialogue about our history, we are focused on the f=
uture we&#8217;re trying to seek -- a future of greater peace and cooperati=
on, of nonproliferation going forward.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I&#8217;ll stop there bec=
ause that&#8217;s the conclusion of the President&#8217;s trip.&nbsp; Again=
, there will be some other potential scheduling engagements that are added.=
&nbsp; But I&#8217;ll turn it over to Wally to walk through the G7 agenda.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. ADEYEMO:&nbsp; Thanks=
, Ben.&nbsp; The G7 this year will offer several tangible opportunities to =
make progress on a host of issues that the leaders of the G7 have been addr=
essing for the President&#8217;s two terms in office,
 starting with the global economy.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">While the United States h=
as been relatively a pillar of strength within the G7 economies, growth has=
 been overall moderate and uneven.&nbsp; The global economic discussion wil=
l give the leaders an opportunity to talk
 about what they can do collectively as leaders of seven of the largest dev=
eloped economies to boost global demand, especially in the environment of l=
ow interest rate, and a need for increased investment.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In addition to a conversa=
tion about the overall global economy, there will be a conversation about t=
he trade agenda.&nbsp; The G7 nations are all engaged in various regional t=
rade agreements.&nbsp; The United States -- and
 I&#8217;ll allow Ambassador Froman to speak to these -- but it&#8217;s eng=
aged in trade agreements with Japan, Canada, in TPP, and with the European =
Union in T-TIP. In addition to that, other countries -- for example, Canada=
 and the European Union -- are also in discussions
 about a regional trade agreement, as are the Japanese and the Europeans.&n=
bsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So there will be a discus=
sion about those trade agreements, but in addition to that, there will be a=
 conversation about what we can do to make sure that we are using our trade=
 and trade enforcement tools and our
 trade agreements to maximize the benefits to our workers and our firms, an=
d to level the playing field.&nbsp; There will also be a discussion about o=
ver-capacity in this session, and what we can do to address over-capacity i=
n several areas with an emphasis on steel
 and how we can use our collective action to best ensure that over-capacity=
 is addressed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In addition to that, our =
leaders will have a conversation about foreign policy and the foreign polic=
y challenges that they face that will largely reflect the conversations tha=
t occurred amongst our foreign ministers
 when they met in Hiroshima.&nbsp; They will also have the opportunity to t=
ake note of the climate change agenda that was set in Paris in 2015, and to=
 talk about what we can do to ambitiously implement that agenda consistent =
with our goal of reducing the temperature
 by 1.5 and 2 degrees.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We will also have an oppo=
rtunity to hear from a number of Asian countries.&nbsp; As Japan is the onl=
y Asian member of the G7, they have chosen to invite a number of Asian coun=
tries to talk about issues that are particular
 to Asia, but issues that also are relevant to the rest of the world.&nbsp;=
 For example, infrastructure, the development agenda, the inclusion of wome=
n in the economy and society, and health care.&nbsp; These are issues that =
are not only important to our economies, but
 also socially important to us.&nbsp; And it will give us a chance to have =
a holistic conversation about what the G7 can do to advance the prosperity =
and the security of our people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">AMBASSADOR FROMAN:&nbsp; =
Great.&nbsp; Thank you, Ben and Wally.&nbsp; Let me talk a little bit about=
 Vietnam and touch on the trade issues regarding the visit to Japan.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">With Vietnam -- 90 millio=
n people, rapidly growing middle class -- a middle class that is expected t=
o double between 2014 and 2020.&nbsp; And one thing we know is that as midd=
le class consumers emerge, they want more
 of everything that the United States is well-positioned to make and to exp=
ort.&nbsp; But we face significant barriers to those exports.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So in Vietnam, for exampl=
e, U.S. auto exports face a 70 percent tariff, 74 percent tariff on motorcy=
cles, 32 percent tariff on auto parts.&nbsp; Made-in-America machinery like=
 construction equipment are hit with tariffs
 as high as 59 percent; beef, 34 percent; poultry, 40 percent.&nbsp; So we =
face these barriers getting our products into Vietnam, and those tariffs ne=
ed to be eliminated or greatly reduced through the TPP implementation.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The reason why that&#8217=
;s important is that our market is already very open.&nbsp; So we have aver=
age applied tariffs of 1.4 percent compared to the tariffs that I just desc=
ribed for you.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t use non-tariff regulations
 as a barrier to trade.&nbsp; And TPP gives us an opportunity to level the =
playing field for our workers and ranchers and farmers and firms so that th=
ey can get more of their products into this fast-growing market.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Beyond the tariffs, thoug=
h, and the non-tariff barriers is a set of rules the TPP represents.&nbsp; =
So, for intellectual property -- issues like counterfeits or trade secrets.=
&nbsp; The rules around the digital economy, making
 sure the Internet stays open and free and there&#8217;s a free flow of dat=
a across borders.&nbsp; Obligations to prevent governments from replacing t=
ariffs with non-tariff barriers.&nbsp; Rules assuring that state-owned ente=
rprises, of which there are many in Vietnam, have
 to compete on a level playing field against our private firms, and our pri=
vate firms now have recourse if they don't.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issues around, very importa=
ntly, labor and the environment.&nbsp; Vietnam has agreed to allow independ=
ent unions that can control their own finances, elect their own leaders, co=
nduct strikes, affiliate as they wish, get assistance from
 outside labor organizations.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve agreed to the five basic =
ILO labor principles -- the right to associate, the right to collective bar=
gain, prohibitions on child labor and forced labor, prohibitions on employm=
ent discrimination.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve agreed the acceptable
 conditions of work -- having a minimum wage, hours regulations, safe workp=
lace conditions.&nbsp; And all those obligations under TPP are fully enforc=
eable, meaning that their access to our market is tied to their compliance =
with these provisions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Same thing on the environme=
ntal side.&nbsp; Vietnam is a market for much of the illegally traded wildl=
ife around the world, and they&#8217;ve agreed to take on obligations to co=
mbat illegal wildlife trade as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there&#8217;s a great op=
portunity here.&nbsp; This is the next phase in our economic relationship w=
ith Vietnam that, as Ben said, has been growing since normalization of rela=
tions 20 or so years ago.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japan, as Wally mentioned, =
of course, is another TPP partner.&nbsp; They&#8217;re working their way th=
rough ratification of TPP. And there, too, are great economic opportunities=
 -- from the ag side, where they have a 3.2 percent tariff on beef,
 substantial protection around pork, obstacles to our exports on dairy prod=
ucts that will be dealt with through TPP, to the auto side, where we have a=
 special agreement with Japan to deal with the non-tariff barriers to our a=
uto exports.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So it will be very import=
ant that we engage with Japan and the other parties at the G7 about the rat=
ification process for TPP in the various countries and the continuing work =
that needs to be done in T-TIP to bring
 political will to the table to address the outstanding issues in a pragmat=
ic and creative manner with the goal of, as the President said in Hannover,=
 trying to reach agreement on T-TIP over the course of this year.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A que=
stion related to Vietnam.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the decision, if, in fact, one=
 has been made yet, on whether there should be a full lifting of the arms e=
mbargo on Vietnam, or whether it should stay in place?&nbsp; And what
 might be the timing of such an announcement before departure, or possibly =
during the trip?&nbsp; Or are we talking about taking longer?<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Matt, for the question.&nbsp; We have not finalized a decision related to =
this issue.&nbsp; It is something that we regularly review and we certainly=
 expect that it will be a subject of discussion with
 the Vietnamese.&nbsp; So I'd expect that this will be discussed in the con=
text of the President's meetings, and it's something that we obviously have=
 been looking at as we prepare for the visit in the context of our broader =
relationship.&nbsp; So we are thinking through
 how is our evolving security cooperation going to look moving forward.&nbs=
p; We are looking at, of course, how our broader relationship is evolving, =
including our continued commitment to support human rights in Vietnam.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, again, I think this wil=
l be discussed in the context of where this relationship is going, and it's=
 something that we'll certainly be addressing in the bilateral meetings wit=
h the Vietnamese.&nbsp; And we'll have the opportunity to --
 they regularly raise this issue with us, and we'll, of course, want to hav=
e the opportunity to explain our thoughts to them, and I think we'll have t=
he opportunity to discuss it in that context.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will say there's also obv=
iously a lot of views on this issue in Congress, as well.&nbsp; And we've b=
een engaged in consultations with Congress about this and other issues rela=
ted to the U.S.-Vietnam relationship over the last days and
 weeks.&nbsp; So this has factored into the set of issues that we've been r=
eviewing in preparation for the visit.&nbsp; We expect the President will b=
e discussing this issue and how we intend to approach it going forward in h=
is meetings in Hanoi.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we are looking at it,=
 not narrowly, in the context of simply whether or not to look to them, but=
 rather where is our relationship going, what is the most effective way of =
advancing our cooperation, but also
 in building the tougher relationship where we can cooperate on areas of co=
mmon interest while also having productive and respectful dialogue on areas=
 of disagreement, which of course is primarily focused on issues related to=
 human rights.&nbsp; So we will, again,
 look forward to continuing this discussion with the Vietnamese and, of cou=
rse, with those who are interested over the course of the visit.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, Ben=
.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; And can you tell us how you're viewing this EgyptAir =
incident now that U.S. officials have said that they suspect it was a bomb?=
&nbsp; Is this looking like this is going to be another case of the Preside=
nt traveling
 and issues of terrorism overshadowing the other issues on the trip?&nbsp; =
And secondly, on the TPP, given the roadblocks that have been out there -- =
that are still out there, what kind of progress do you expect to see toward=
s finally ratifying this eventually?&nbsp;
 And what's your time frame, and when do you envision this actually happeni=
ng?&nbsp; Thank you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Thanks, M=
ichelle.&nbsp; On the first question, obviously we are deeply concerned abo=
ut the situation involving the EgyptAir flight, and our hearts go out to th=
e loved ones of those who are currently missing.&nbsp; Our government
 has not reached a formal determination about what took place.&nbsp; We hav=
e offered our assistance to the relevant authorities that are currently eng=
aged in an investigation.&nbsp; And we will continue to provide you with up=
dates if we draw any formal conclusions.&nbsp;
 Of course, again, the countries that are more directly involved -- Egypt a=
nd France -- are leading the investigation.&nbsp; We've offered our full su=
pport, and we obviously will be doing our own analysis of what we believe h=
appened.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to how that re=
lates to the President's trip, we obviously have enormous economic and nati=
onal security interests in the Asia Pacific region, just as we have a profo=
und and enduring interest in preventing any acts of terrorism.&nbsp;
 And so we, of course, will be pursuing I think a very important assessment=
 of an agenda that has an enormous bearing on the long-term interests of th=
e American people and our national security and economic security going for=
ward throughout the course of the
 trip as it relates to terrorism.&nbsp; And that, again, doesn&#8217;t prej=
udice the investigation because there's not been any formal determination m=
ade.&nbsp; Clearly, that will also be a subject at the G7.&nbsp; One of the=
 principal foreign policy areas that has been a focus
 of the G7 in recent years has been our shared efforts against terrorism.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On TPP, I'll turn it over t=
o Mike.&nbsp; I will just say that I think that both of these countries are=
 indications of the types of markets that are going to be critical to U.S. =
exports and job creation going forward.&nbsp; And so from just one
 perspective -- before I go to Mike -- I think it is a further demonstratio=
n of how important it is that the United States not be shut out of certain =
markets and have the ability to shape the rules of the road in this critica=
lly important region.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I&#8217;m going to hand=
 it over to our trade representative.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AMBASSADOR FROMAN:&nbsp; Th=
ank you, Ben.&nbsp; Just to build on that, we are and we have been in consu=
ltation with Congress since completing the agreement last October.&nbsp; We=
 published it in November; we signed it in February.&nbsp; We&#8217;re cont=
inuing
 to work through the various procedures laid out under Trade Promotion Auth=
ority that Congress approved last year and we&#8217;re consulting with cong=
ressional leadership and the leadership of our committees on what the best =
timetable is for bringing this up for
 a vote.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, we are wor=
king with members of Congress individually to walk them through the agreeme=
nt, address their concerns, demonstrate what&#8217;s in the agreement for t=
heir constituents or stakeholders that they care a lot about.&nbsp;
 We&#8217;re working to resolve a handful of key issues that have been flag=
ged as particularly important by members of Congress.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve=
 already started the process -- normally, after Congress approves a trade a=
greement, then we turn to the implementation process
 with the countries.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And in this case, we&#821=
7;ve decided to accelerate that.&nbsp; In consultation with Congress, we ar=
e already working with the countries in the region on the various steps tha=
t they&#8217;ll need to take to bring themselves into
 compliance with TPP.&nbsp; And that includes Vietnam, where we&#8217;ve al=
ready had teams out in Vietnam over the last couple of months talking to th=
em about the array of obligations that they have under the agreement.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I ha=
ve a couple of questions for you.&nbsp; Specifically for Ben, what do you t=
hink about the absence of Russia from the summit table?&nbsp; How does it a=
ffect the discussion on Syria and ISIS, for instance?&nbsp; My final questi=
on is, is
 Obama going to be meeting with Hiroshima survivors during this trip?&nbsp;=
 Thank you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Thanks.&n=
bsp; On the first question, we have been very clear that the G7, formerly t=
he G8, part of the basis of the organization is to have cooperation on beha=
lf of the fundamental international principles and norms that allow
 for peaceful development, peaceful relations among countries.&nbsp; And wh=
en Russia flouted those rules because of its violation of the sovereignty a=
nd territorial integrity of Ukraine, the decision was taken collectively th=
at Russia should not participate in upcoming
 G7 meetings.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was entirely Russia&#=
8217;s determination to violate the most basic international principle, whi=
ch is the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country.&nbsp; That le=
d to this being a G7. Of course, the option continues to be available
 to Russia to change course and to respect the sovereignty and territorial =
integrity of its neighbors.&nbsp; Until it does, not only are they not part=
icipating in the G7 meeting, but of course, together with the other G7 coun=
tries we&#8217;ve imposed very significant
 sanctions on Russia, related to its actions in Ukraine.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will take the opportunity=
 to briefly say that Russia has an opportunity in front of themselves, toge=
ther with the Ukrainian government and the separatists, to fully implement =
the Minsk agreement, which would both be of great benefit
 to the people of Ukraine but also we&#8217;ve been very clear it could cre=
ate a pathway for the relaxation of those sanctions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to Syria and I=
SIL, Russia&#8217;s absence from this forum does not foreclose our ability =
to be engaged in regular dialogue with them about those issues.&nbsp; And, =
in fact, we&#8217;ve been deeply engaged in discussions with Russia about
 the cessation of hostilities that we&#8217;ve sought to preserve within Sy=
ria about the efforts to promote a peace process in Geneva.&nbsp; Secretary=
 Kerry and Prime Minister Lavrov have spoken about that.&nbsp; President Ob=
ama and President Putin have.&nbsp; So we have those
 channels of communication just as we have efforts to de-conflict our milit=
ary efforts in Syria.&nbsp; But again, I think it&#8217;s important that it=
 is demonstrated that there&#8217;s a cost for actions that violate basic i=
nternational law, and that&#8217;s why this is a G7 meeting.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">On the Hiroshima program,=
 we have not finalized the elements of the President&#8217;s visit, includi=
ng who he might meet with or interact with while he&#8217;s in Hiroshima.&n=
bsp; So we will provide you with updates as that is further
 developed.&nbsp; Again, what we do know is that he will visit the Peace Me=
morial, that he will be joined by Prime Minister Abe, that he&#8217;ll have=
 an opportunity to lay a wreath but also to offer his reflections on his vi=
sit.&nbsp; And I know that he is very much anticipating
 the opportunity to have that experience and to speak to the people of Japa=
n and the United States and the world about what he takes away from that ex=
perience.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, t=
hanks for having this call.&nbsp; You mentioned over-capacity, so, Wally, o=
r Mike Froman, just wanted to ask, I assume the main focus would be on over=
-capacity of base metals like steel products and aluminum
 that&#8217;s weighing on G7 economies and the U.S.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m jus=
t wondering -- these countries have met before at the OECD and elsewhere on=
 this issue.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just wondering, is the G7 where -- a place whe=
re we would expect a plan of action on this?&nbsp; Or is it just
 a place for countries to discuss their individual actions that they might =
take?&nbsp; And where would the U.S. be in that process?&nbsp; China and ev=
en South Korea are right next door to the G7 meetings, so I&#8217;m just cu=
rious to see how that&#8217;s going.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. ADEYEMO:&nbsp; I thin=
k, as you know well, the solution to over-capacity, especially in the base =
metals, requires a global solution.&nbsp; And while the G7 is a large segme=
nt of the global economy, it isn&#8217;t the entire
 global economy.&nbsp; The meeting gives us an opportunity to work together=
 to organize our shared approach toward these issues, but we need to work a=
longside countries like South Korea and Brazil and India and other countrie=
s to hold those accountable who are responsible
 for over-capacity in the base metal sector.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I think our goal has =
been, in the United States, to use our trade enforcement laws aggressively =
to do that.&nbsp; But we know that this is a global problem that requires a=
 global solution, and we want to do a better
 job of coordinating with our international partners in the G7 and in other=
 forums.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
s for the call.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a question for Ben or Dan.&nbsp; We&#8217;=
ve seen, again, in the last 24 hours, another escalation of tensions, and s=
o I was trying to see what this intercepts -- the discussion about the Viet=
nam
 arms embargo, which is annoying the Chinese, and the ruling coming up.&nbs=
p; I was just wondering if you can say -- can tell us how are you kind of -=
- take a little bit of heat out of this issue, and whether you actually wan=
t to take a little bit of heat out of
 this issue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. KRITENBRINK:&nbsp; Lo=
ok, our approach to the South China Sea has been very consistent, and you&#=
8217;ll continue to see that going forward.&nbsp; We have demonstrated very=
 clearly that we don&#8217;t take a position on any of the
 competing sovereignty claims in the South China Sea, but we do very clearl=
y take a position on how those disputes are resolved, and we make very clea=
r they need to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international =
law.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And at the same time, we&=
#8217;ve demonstrated that the United States, as with all countries, enjoys=
 certain rights under international law, including the freedom of navigatio=
n and freedom of overflight.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">You have seen, as we have=
, the reports that there was an unsafe intercept in the South China Sea in =
the last 24 hours.&nbsp; We&#8217;re looking into that incident.&nbsp; I do=
n&#8217;t have further details for it, but I think you&#8217;re
 well aware that we routinely carry out naval and other operations, both in=
 the airspace over the South China Sea and in the international waters of t=
he South China Sea. We do those routinely, in a safe manner, and we&#8217;l=
l continue to do that going forward.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Although maritime issues =
is not the central focus of the visit per se, obviously these issues are of=
 great importance to all countries in the region, including to Vietnam and =
to Japan, obviously to the United States.&nbsp;
 And I&#8217;m confident that when the President sits down with the Vietnam=
ese leadership and with Prime Minister Abe, that this will be one important=
 topic of discussion.&nbsp; And I also anticipate that the leaders at the G=
7 will have the opportunity to engage on these
 issues as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; The onl=
y thing I&#8217;d add, Andrew, is just a couple things.&nbsp; I mean, one i=
s we also have worked to ensure that we have military-to-military engagemen=
t with China, in part so that we have the capacity to
 raise concerns around particular issues, and just have open lines of commu=
nication.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The second thing that I&#=
8217;d say is that the United States&#8217; role in the region has been to =
reinforce international rules of the road and peace and stability.&nbsp; An=
d for decades, that presence has helped facilitate peaceful
 development in the Asia Pacific region.&nbsp; And to the extent to which t=
here is behavior that seeks to take these types of territorial disputes and=
 put them into the type of dynamic where a bigger nation is seeking to inse=
rts its rule over a smaller one, I think
 that raises concerns in the region.&nbsp; And it only reinforces the need =
to have a dialogue around support for clear international rules of the road=
.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so we pursued that di=
scussion at Sunnylands with the ASEAN countries -- several of whom are clai=
mants, several of whom aren't -- but all of them have an interest in the pe=
aceful resolution of disputes and the
 free flow of commerce through the South China Sea.&nbsp; We'll certainly h=
ave that discussion with Vietnam.&nbsp; It's only one element of many aspec=
ts of our cooperation on security and economic issues.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But again, I think what w=
e see is an interest in the region and the United States being present as a=
 country that is committed to international rules and norms.&nbsp; And that=
 will be our consistent message throughout
 the course of the visit.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think we have time for =
a couple more questions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hav=
e two questions, one for Ambassador Froman on TPP.&nbsp; You talked a lot a=
bout exports to a growing middle class in Vietnam, but I wonder if you coul=
d talk a little bit about the other phenomenon, which is
 that I think apparel and footwear textiles imports to the U.S. from Vietna=
m stand to gain from the lowering of U.S. tariffs.&nbsp; I think the ITC re=
port yesterday talked about imports from TPP countries, especially Vietnam =
and those markets, we expand by 23 percent,
 and that ultimately manufacturing jobs would actually diminish compared to=
 baseline assumptions.&nbsp; What does that say to American shoe manufactur=
ers and others who were saying the final remaining jobs we have are destine=
d to go to offshore because of this deal?&nbsp;
 Is that just the future of kind of where we're headed, and the U.S. has to=
 focus on other jobs?&nbsp; Is that the message for this deal?<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And then one for Ben, if =
I could, about Japan and the President&#8217;s visit to Hiroshima.&nbsp; Th=
ere are those who say the President&#8217;s visit will -- even if he&#8217;=
s not apologizing -- will bring even more closure and final
 reconciliation to the people in Hiroshima, but that then it's up to the Ja=
panese Prime Minister, whether it's Abe or a future one, to take more steps=
 to close the World War II chapter in Asia, despite what he did on the comf=
ort women and some of the speeches
 to Congress, and on the 70th anniversary last year in Japan.&nbsp; I wonde=
r if you had thoughts about that, or whether you believe Japan has done eno=
ugh at this point to move forward in the region, and whether at all there&#=
8217;s any talk between the U.S. and Japan
 of having Prime Minister Abe visit Pearl Harbor before President Obama lea=
ves office.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">AMBASSADOR FROMAN:&nbsp; =
Thanks, David.&nbsp; On your TPP question, we worked very closely with both=
 the domestic footwear and apparel manufacturers here in the United States =
as well as the importers throughout the negotiations.&nbsp;
 And the final deal was endorsed both by the footwear producers in the U.S.=
 and the footwear importers, same thing.&nbsp; The textile industry endorse=
d it as well as the apparel importers.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Just take footwear, for e=
xample.&nbsp; There are high tariffs of our footwear exports into Japan tha=
t will be eliminated.&nbsp; So we're going to see our exports go up.&nbsp; =
We will see, I believe it's a 2 percent increase in
 imports of footwear, so most of those increased imports from Vietnam is pr=
oduction shifting from China to Vietnam.&nbsp; It's not all an increase in =
imports to the U.S.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">With regard to the manufa=
cturing question you asked, I think that points to one of the limitations o=
f the model, which is, as you probably know, the ITC model assumes that the=
 trade deficit remains the same -- the
 trade balance stays the same as a percentage of GDP.&nbsp; So as they show=
 increases of exports in one sector, they need to show decreases in exports=
 or increases in imports in other sectors.&nbsp; And it's a relative measur=
e based on where they see the most significant
 increases in productivity.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that's why it shows g=
reater gains in services than it may in some other sectors.&nbsp; But it do=
esn&#8217;t mean that in reality there&#8217;s going to be a decline relati=
ve to the baseline.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Thanks,=
 David, for your question.&nbsp; I'd say a couple things.&nbsp; First of al=
l, we said that this is not about issuing an apology.&nbsp; And of course, =
the American people are extraordinarily proud of the generation
 of servicemembers who fought in World War II, at a time of maximum peril t=
o our nation, and they have a revered place in our society.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What we are able to do in=
 going to Hiroshima is to pay tribute to the enormous suffering and loss of=
 innocence in war.&nbsp; And, first of all, as I said in the opening, you'r=
e talking about a conflict that had an enormous
 human toll, with tens of millions of people killed around the world, inclu=
ding so many innocents.&nbsp; And even in Hiroshima, you had obviously an e=
xtraordinary loss of life of innocent Japanese civilians, and you also had =
the loss of life of many Koreans who
 were present in Hiroshima, and even American servicemembers who were there=
.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I think that the Pres=
ident&#8217;s message, therefore, is, in part, that leaders and citizens ha=
ve to be mindful going forward about the enormous cost of war, and that we =
can never forget the toll that war takes on
 innocent life.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Secondly, of course, as I=
 mentioned, Hiroshima and Nagasaki are symbols of both that loss of innocen=
t life, but also the toll of nuclear weapons.&nbsp; And it is very importan=
t that leaders not lose urgency -- as we
 get farther and farther away from the use of nuclear weapons, that we not =
lose urgency in seeking to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and seekin=
g to reduce nuclear stockpiles, and ultimately pursue a world without them.=
&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we've spent a lot of =
time promoting nuclear security and seeking to reduce our deployed stockpil=
e and launchers through the New START Treaty, and trying to stop the spread=
 of nuclear weapons through the Iran
 deal, and of course, in dealing with the extraordinary challenge from Nort=
h Korea as it pursues a nuclear program.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So it's an opportunity to=
 I think focus the world&#8217;s attention on the need to prevent the sprea=
d of nuclear weapons and seek a world without them.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">With respect to Pearl Har=
bor, I'd just say, first of all, that we draw no linkages to our decision t=
o go to Hiroshima.&nbsp; This is the President&#8217;s decision.&nbsp; And =
he is making this decision be he believes that it's
 important to acknowledge history; it's important to look squarely at histo=
ry; it's important to have a dialogue about history.&nbsp; And every leader=
 has to make their own choices about how they will do that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We have encouraged all le=
aders in Asia to try to look at these difficult historical issues in a mann=
er that promotes dialogue and understanding and ultimately reconciliation.&=
nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that context, we very mu=
ch welcomed the agreement that was reached with respect to comfort women.&n=
bsp; And there are many different issues -- and I should add that a great d=
eal of courage from both Prime Minister Abe and President Park,
 given how important the history of the comfort women is to the people of t=
he Republic of Korea.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there are many historic=
al issues that continue to be hotly discussed and debated in the Asia Pacif=
ic.&nbsp; I think our point is that the more that there&#8217;s able to be =
peaceful dialogue about those issues, the more they will not be sources
 of tension going forward, but rather we can overcome those issues.&nbsp; A=
nd, frankly, again, the very fact that the United States is traveling to Ja=
pan, that it&#8217;s now one of our closest allies in the world, and Vietna=
m, which is a merging partner of ours I think
 demonstrates how you are able to move beyond difficult history, and that&#=
8217;s what we would encourage the countries of the Asia Pacific to do.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Prime Minister Abe will =
make his own decisions about how he addresses these issues and about Pearl =
Harbor, but I think that&#8217;s certainly how President Obama views it.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last question.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All my =
questions have actually already been addressed so I&#8217;ll let someone el=
se go.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonde=
red if in Hiroshima if the President had any plans to use his reflections t=
o offer any new or concrete steps on how to reduce nuclear weapons, globall=
y or in the U.S.&nbsp; And in that same vein, can you comment on the notion
 that the world is actually further away from the President&#8217;s goal of=
 a nuclear-free world now than it was when he gave his speech in Prague sev=
en years ago?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. RHODES:&nbsp; Well, fir=
st of all, we&#8217;re not going to give a major policy address in Hiroshim=
a.&nbsp; We just, frankly, didn&#8217;t think that it was the appropriate v=
enue.&nbsp; This is such a powerful place and so therefore we thought that =
a simple
 reflection on the cost of war and the cost of nuclear weapons was the appr=
opriate way for the President to speak from the heart about his reflections=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will say that, again, we =
do hope that in visiting Hiroshima, we&#8217;re able to once again spotligh=
t the imperative that the world has to seek a reduction and ultimate elimin=
ation of the risk of nuclear weapons.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, I would -- it might n=
ot surprise you -- take a different view of I think what&#8217;s happened s=
ince we took office.&nbsp; I think we made progress on a number of fronts, =
even as we acknowledge, and we&#8217;d be the first to acknowledge, that
 there&#8217;s a lot more work to do.&nbsp; First of all, we made clear fro=
m the beginning of our time in office that we wanted to keep our own NPT co=
mmitments to pursue the reductions of our own stockpiles.&nbsp; And the new=
 START treaty in the first term was one of the most
 significant arms control agreements of recent years.&nbsp; It significantl=
y reduced our deployed stockpiles and launchers with Russia, and demonstrat=
ed that we were once again moving in that direction.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we reduced the ro=
le of nuclear weapons in our own national security strategy so that we are =
less reliant on nuclear weapons as we address issues around the world.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we&#8217;ve hosted=
 a series of nuclear summits that have significantly enhanced nuclear secur=
ity protocols and eliminated a significant amount of nuclear material -- ag=
ain, all of which is to help keep the most dangerous material
 out of the hands of terrorists and other actors who we would not want to o=
btain weapons.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in terms of nonprolif=
eration -- and I think this is really important -- over the course of the l=
ast decades since the Cold War, you&#8217;ve seen the proliferation and spr=
ead of nuclear weapons through a number of states.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">During President Obama&#8=
217;s seven and a half years in office, there has not been any new member o=
f the nuclear club, in large part because we were able to reach a diplomati=
c agreement with the Iranian government and
 the P5&#43;1 that assures and verifies that they will not be able to devel=
op a nuclear weapon, and that, in fact, has demonstrably rolled back their =
nuclear program.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve shipped out their stockpile, converted=
 their reactors, and taken other steps to allow
 for the verification that they are not pursuing a nuclear weapon.<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So on nonproliferation an=
d nuclear security and arms control, I think there are things that we are q=
uite proud of.&nbsp; However, to be very specific about what has not taken =
place, and very straightforward about that,
 we had indicated an interest in additional arms control.&nbsp; And Russia,=
 particularly after President Putin took office, indicated that they were n=
ot interested in pursuing that discussion, so we were not able to have an a=
dditional round of discussions around
 further arms control agreements.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s one example of an a=
rea where we think that there&#8217;s further progress.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">There are other areas whe=
re we&#8217;d like to see continued progress around agreements like a fissi=
le material cutoff treaty, where, again, there continue to be challenges in=
 building an international consensus around
 those issues.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we certainly acknowled=
ge that there&#8217;s more to be done.&nbsp; But we do believe that we have=
 bent the curve in the right direction on nonproliferation nuclear security=
, the role of nuclear weapons in our national security
 strategy, and our own stockpile and launchers.&nbsp; I know there&#8217;s =
some controversy around some of our modernization, but what we would say is=
 what President Obama said in Prague, which is as long as nuclear weapons e=
xist, we do need to have an effective and credible
 deterrent, both for our own security and for the security of allies like J=
apan and the Republic of Korea.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So again, we hope in goin=
g that we&#8217;re able to energize that process, lift up progress that&#82=
17;s been made, but also with that, spotlight additional efforts that need =
to be done.&nbsp; That&#8217;s all for the better, and we welcome
 that attention.&nbsp; And we hope to do as much as we can with our time in=
 office, and then we hope that, going forward, future administrations pursu=
e that goal of ultimately -- the goal that, I should say, not just Presiden=
t Obama but Presidents like President
 Reagan and President Kennedy embraced, which was the peace and security of=
 a world without nuclear weapons.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I&#8217;ll stop there.=
&nbsp; Sorry to go on.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to just credit ourselves; =
I also wanted to be very clear that we do recognize that the President&#821=
7;s Prague agenda is unfinished, but that&#8217;s part of the reason for
 shining a light on these issues in Hiroshima.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So thanks, everybody, for=
