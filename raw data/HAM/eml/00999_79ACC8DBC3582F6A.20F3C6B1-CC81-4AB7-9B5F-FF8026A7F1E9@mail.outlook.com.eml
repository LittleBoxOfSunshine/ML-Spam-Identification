Sorry-didn't see this till just now. Just didn't buzz

There's an international franchise association (couldn't find a national on=
e). They're very GOP heavy but gave $10k to the DCCC this cycle. Abbreviate=
d giving attached but again, I'm not sure if there's any affiliation betwee=
n the two.

Burger King hasn't registered a PAC this cycle.

Hey Luis,
Following up on our conversation, below is the event I was telling you abou=
t.

Date:               Wednesday, June 8th
Time:              1:20-2:00 p.m. (each speaker speaks for 20 minutes =96 2=
 speakers) Sean Spicer from the RNC is speaking
Location:        Hyatt Regency, Crystal City

What: The National Franchisee Association (NFA) is that national trade asso=
ciation representing BURGER KING=AE franchisees in the United States and Ca=
nada who operate more than 7,000 small businesses  and employ almost 200,00=
0 individuals across North America.  For the last eleven years, NFA and Bur=
ger King Corporation have  jointly held our annual Summit in Washington, D.=
C.  which brings together approximately 200 BURGER KING=AE franchise operat=
ors, suppliers and vendors as well as many BKC corporate executives for two=
 days of business and legislative briefings as well as hill visits.

As part of our legislative workshop, we would like a representative from th=
e DNC to speak to our attendees about the current democratic presidential c=
andidates, the outlook for the convention and general election and how thos=
e candidates will help small business owners like those in attendance.  Not=
e that a representative from the RNC will be speaking on the same topics as=
 well.

Is this something you can do?

Thanks,
Patrice
