Yes! We'll have a briefing for you today with deets. Lots of RSVPs so far, so it should be a good call!

Hola!

Yep -- safest dates during the first week of May are Monday the 2nd and Tuesday the 3rd. Right now, he is open on Monday (5/2) after 3:00pm ET, and on Tuesday (5/3) after 11am ET. Let me know what works best on your end and I'll block it in his schedule!
