Daniel --

Back in 2014, Senator Mitch McConnell promised that under
his leadership the Senate would be "working more":

"The first thing I need to do is to get the Senate back to
normal. That means working more. I don't think we've had any
votes on Friday in anybody's memory." (Mitch McConnell,
Meet the Press, 2014)

Fast forward to today, and Majority Leader McConnell's
Senate is on track to work the fewest days in 60 years --
and there still hasn't been a single Friday vote this year.

Breaking that 60-year record would be bad enough, and a
complete lack of action on climate change, common-sense gun
laws, and comprehensive immigration reform would be even
worse. But more than anything else, McConnell's flat-out
refusal to consider President Obama's Supreme Court nominee,
Judge Merrick Garland, paints a clear picture of Senate
leadership that is failing the American people by refusing
to do its job, and spreading dysfunction to our
country's judicial system.

That is unacceptable. Judge Garland deserves a fair hearing.
We need a Supreme Court with nine justices -- and a
Senate that isn't gridlocked by partisan politics.

Add your name -- call for a fair hearing and a timely
up-or-down vote for Judge Merrick Garland:

https://my.barackobama.com/A-Fair-Hearing-For-Judge-Merrick-Garland

Senator McConnell led Republican senators in years of
unprecedented obstruction, but still had the chutzpah to
claim that if he was in charge, the chamber would get back
to work. McConnell's Senate is on track to work only 124
days this year. Turns out his version of "working more"
equates to fewer days in session than any Senate since 1956.

When they are in session, McConnell would prefer to
obstruct progress rather than actually do his job. And the
American people disagree with the members of his caucus that
are going along with it -- just look at the plummeting
approval ratings for the head of the Judiciary Committee,
Senator Chuck Grassley.

They are feeling the pressure, which is why it's so
important OFA supporters like you keep holding these leaders
accountable, and keep demanding that they do their jobs. We
need to keep pushing, and get as many friends and neighbors
involved in this effort as possible.

Add your name to hundreds of thousands of OFA supporters
saying "enough" to this ridiculous partisan obstructionism.
Tell Senate leaders to do their jobs and give Judge Garland
a fair hearing:
