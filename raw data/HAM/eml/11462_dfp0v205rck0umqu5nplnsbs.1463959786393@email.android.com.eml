Off the record He endorsed her opponent in her congressional re-election ca=
mpaign, we're not running that from the DNC. So it made sense it should com=
e from her campaign.

Many thanks. Off the record -  Is it an FEC thing as to why it didn't come =
from DNC (things I'm going to be asked later - apologies).

Hey Luis,
I pinged Mark as well, but do you all have a response to Sander=92s latest =
salvo against DWS? Seems to be getting rather personal. I=92m still not on =
the press list so apologies if you sent something out earlier today.
Thanks,
Jackie
