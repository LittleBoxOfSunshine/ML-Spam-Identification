"Mansour rejected efforts by the Afghan government to seriously engage in peace talks and end the violence that has taken the lives of countless innocent Afghan men, women and children," Mr. Obama continued in the statement. "The Taliban should seize the opportunity to pursue the only real path for ending this long conflict - joining the Afghan government in a reconciliation process that leads to lasting peace and stability."



Obama Looks to Boost Economic, Security Ties in Asia<http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/05/22/us/politics/ap-obama.html>

NEW YORK TIMES // THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

President Barack Obama's mission in Vietnam and Japan is to build stronger economic and security ties with Asian-Pacific allies anxious about the rise of an increasingly muscular China. That forward-looking message will be delivered even as he confronts the legacies of two wars long past - Vietnam and World War II - that still are fraught with emotion. Obama's first stop on his weeklong Asia trip was Vietnam, where he is the third sitting president to visit since the end of the war. Four decades after the fall of Saigon, and two decades after President Bill Clinton restored relations with the nation, Obama is eager to upgrade relations with an emerging power whose rapidly expanding middle class beckons as a promising market for U.S. goods and an offset to China's growing strength in the region. Obama arrived in Hanoi late Sunday. During his three-day stay in Vietnam, he'll make the case for stronger commercial and security ties, including approval of the 12-nation trans-Pacific trade agreement that is stalled in Congress and facing strong opposition from the 2016 presidential candidates.



Obama Braces for Donald Trump Questions From World Leaders<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/world/asia/obama-donald-trump-japan.html?ref=politics>

NEW YORK TIMES // GARDINER HARRIS

Officially, the top world leaders who gather Thursday at the Group of 7 summit meeting will talk about shared concerns, like global trade or the Islamic State. But their private discussions are likely to cover a topic that is not on the agenda: Donald J. Trump. President Obama now hears questions in his meetings with world leaders about whether Mr. Trump has a realistic shot at becoming president. For months, Mr. Obama has answered those questions with an emphatic "no." "I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president," Mr. Obama said in February at the end of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit meeting in California.



TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger may be in trouble<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/22/tsa-administrator-peter-neffenger-may-be-in-trouble/>

WASHINGTON POST // JANELL ROSS

Wait times at major airports that exceed 90 minutes. Independent tests showing Transportation Security Administration screeners failed to detect fake weapons and bombs planted by auditors 95 percent of the time. The constant threat of a terrorist attack. That's the stuff on TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger's daily must-address list. A new addition to that list: a job in possible jeopardy. The Senate approved Neffenger's appointment as the TSA's sixth administrator in June. Just 11 months later, he has basically been warned. During a Sunday morning appearance on ABC's "This Week," Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Edward R. Royce (R-Calif.) each told viewers that there may be a need for management and leadership changes, or at least significant improvement, at the TSA. Schiff is the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Royce is chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. And as members of Congress representing districts in California, both men spend a fair bit of time in airports. When "This Week" host George Stephanopoulos asked them about the need for change at the TSA, Schiff and Royce did not rule out a change in the TSA administrator's office.



Valerie Jarrett: GOP's 'political calculus' delaying Garland nomination<http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/280864-valerie-jarrett-gops-political-calculus-delaying-garland>

THE HILL // CYRA MASTER

Senior White House Adviser Valerie Jarrett says Republicans' decision not to work with President Obama - on his Supreme Court nomination and on a swath of other issues - comes from party leadership. In an interview with "60 Minutes" that aired Sunday night, Jarrett said Republicans are "making the political calculus that to be friendly to the White House is not in their interest." Jarrett said Obama has reached out to Republicans on a number of issues, including the nomination of Merrick Garland to the high court. "I want to completely debunk this notion that if the president were just simply more friendly and more outgoing and [could] schmooze that this would change," she told CBS's Norah O'Donnell. Jarrett said the GOP's decision not to cooperate with Obama on Garland's nomination comes from the top, without naming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell specifically.

Schumer, Gillibrand Call For $1.1 Billion To Fight, Prevent Zika Virus<http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/05/22/zika-virus-prevention/>

CBS NEW YORK // MIKE SMELTZ

U.S. Sens. Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) joined health officials Sunday to ask for increased funding to prevent and treat the Zika virus. As WCBS 880's Mike Smeltz reported, Dr. Bernard Dreyer, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said at the Madison Square Park news conference that the time to act is now. "The Zika virus is a true urgent public health threat," Dreyer said. Dreyer said action cannot wait until after babies are born in the U.S. with Zika-related birth defects. Schumer said the U.S. House of Representatives' approved sum of $600 million to fight Zika comes up woefully short. "There won't be enough money to come up with a vaccine quickly enough, there won't be enough money for prevention and there won't be enough money to do the research to find out exactly how Zika works," Schumer said.



Julian Castro rallies Democrats at first 'swing state' gala<http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/florida/2016/05/8599804/julian-castro-rallies-democrats-first-swing-state-gala>

POLITICO // MATT DIXON

Florida Democratic donors and activists gathered in Orlando Saturday to select final delegates for July's Democratic National Convention, and encourage unity among supporters of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in their common opposition to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. "Remember when the last GOP president left office? We were losing 800,000 jobs, foreclosures signs dotted Florida streets" said Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. "Now the G.O.P. is about to nominate someone who through that was the good old days." Her comments came at the Florida Democratic Party's first ever Swing State Blue Gala in Orlando. The event was used to select the party's final slate of delegates for the national convention and feature speakers to rev up the activists and donors who will return to their home counties and serve as the pillars of local political operations. The delegate selection process was marked by some hurt feelings from party activists who were left off the final ballot, but solidarity was the theme for the $100-a-plate dinner held after the delegate selection process.

Senate set for showdown over women in the draft<http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/280767-senate-set-for-showdown-over-women-in-the-draft>

THE HILL // JORDAIN CARNEY

The Senate is heading for a showdown over women registering for the draft. Supporters of requiring women to sign up for Selective Service see the upper chamber as their last best hope for getting legislation to President Obama's desk. They've turned their attention to the Senate after suffering a setback in the House, which last week dropped language requiring women to register from its version of the annual defense bill. Proponents say women already have the green light to serve in combat roles, hurting the legal argument for excluding them from the draft. But opponents say Congress needs to spend more time studying the politically tricky issue instead of tucking it into a massive "must pass" bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee has already included a requirement to open the draft to women in its version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a move that sparked outrage from conservatives.

THE HILL // JESSIE HELLMAN

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is privately urging Republicans to back Donald Trump, even while he is still publicly criticizing the presumptive GOP nominee. Graham, who once described Trump as "all-over-the-board crazy" and "unfit for office", urged GOP donors at a private fundraiser Saturday to unite behind the likely GOP nominee for president, CNN reports. "He did say that we need to get behind him," Teresa Dailey, a prominent Florida Republican who attended the event, told CNN. A Graham spokesman wouldn't confirm to CNN the content of the senator's remarks, but emphasized that he doesn't support a third-party run that some Republicans are working to organize. "There hasn't been any change in his position," Kevin Bishop said. He also tweeted a similar response to several reporters.



GOP rep calls for management overhaul at TSA<http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/280843-gop-rep-calls-for-management-overhaul-at-tsa>

THE HILL // JESSIE HELLMAN

Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called for a management overhaul of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Sunday, saying the TSA could be more effective. While talking about legislation that would allow for hiring of more screeners to cut down on long lines, Royce said the TSA needs to step in and overhaul management. "One of the difficulties we've had is with a great deal of turnover over at TSA, and there's certainly management problems at TSA. So with this legislation - it's also important the administration move in with an overhaul of management at the TSA to make them more effective," Royce said on ABC's "This Week." "Replace the administrator?" host George Stephanopoulos asked. "Well, I think we have to have better results at TSA, and I think most of the audits show that there are management problems there," Royce said.

Hillary Clinton Warns Against Treating Donald Trump as 'Normal' Candidate<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-campaign.html?ref=politics>

NEW YORK TIMES // AMY CHOZICK

Continuing to treat a victory over Senator Bernie Sanders as a fait accompli, Hillary Clinton on Sunday questioned Donald J. Trump's business record and assailed his ideas, warning that the coming weeks represented a critical period in which, if left unchallenged, Mr. Trump could "normalize himself" as he seeks to broaden his support. But Mr. Sanders pointed to polls showing Mrs. Clinton with dangerously high percentages of people who have unfavorable views of her and asked whether a choice between her and Mr. Trump in the fall would force voters to pick the "lesser of two evils." Even as she contends with Mr. Sanders's unflagging critique from the left, Mrs. Clinton said it was vital for her to pivot to confront Mr. Trump now, lest he successfully repackage himself for wider consumption, rather than appealing to the Republican primary electorate alone.

POLITICO // MATTHEW NUSSBAUM

Previewing her general election line of attack, Hillary Clinton is lambasting Donald Trump as dangerous and unqualified to be president. "My campaign is not going to let Donald Trump try to normalize himself," the Democratic presidential front-runner said in an interview aired Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press." "I've said he was unqualified to be president. I believe that deeply." The former New York senator and secretary of state hit the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for refusing to release his tax returns, talking of pulling the U.S. out of NATO and, she said, of "advocating a return to torture, and even murdering the families of suspected terrorists." "That is beyond the pale. And it poses immediate dangers," Clinton said. "There's no evidence he has any ideas about making America great, as he advertises. He seems to be particularly focused on making himself appear great. And as we go through this campaign, we're going to be demonstrating the hollowness of his rhetoric. And the danger of a lot of what he has said." Trump has said he'd support re-implementing waterboarding and "worse" in interrogating suspected terrorists and that the U.S. should "go after" the families of terrorists.



Clinton: Trump 'afraid' to release taxes<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/05/22/clinton-trump-afraid-release-taxes/84741060/>

USA TODAY // KEVIN JOHNSON

Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton stepped up her attack on presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump Sunday, asserting that the real estate mogul is "afraid'' to release his tax returns because it would reveal that he's paid little or no taxes. In an interview on NBC's Meet The Press, Clinton also said Trump has offered nothing to show that he is capable of fulfilling a campaign slogan that promises to make America great again. "I think in the course of this campaign, we are going to demonstrate he has no ideas,'' Clinton said. "There's no evidence he has any ideas about making America great, as he advertises. He seems to be particularly focused on making himself appear great.'' Clinton said Trump's promises to revitalize the military and invest in America's crumbling infrastructure are hollow pledges because he has aggressively sought to reduce his personal tax burdens even as other Americans pay their share.

WASHINGTON POST // ABBY PHILLIP

Hillary Clinton says she welcomes businessman and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban's interest in potentially becoming her vice presidential running mate. In an interview that aired Sunday, Clinton opened the door wide open to Cuban and other business leaders, who could serve to counter the likely Republican nominee, real estate mogul Donald Trump. "I think we should look widely and broadly. It's not just people in elected office. It is successful businesspeople," Clinton told NBC News's Chuck Todd on "Meet the Press." "I am very interested in that." "And I appreciate his openness to it," she added of Cuban's comments. In a portion of an interview with Todd that was released Friday, Cuban said that he would "absolutely" be willing to meet with Clinton about becoming a potential vice presidential pick, but he noted that he had some concerns that she might have shifted too far to the left during the Democratic primary race against Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. "The key would be she would have to go more to center," Cuban said. "I like the fact that Senator Clinton has thought-out proposals. That's a good thing because at least we get to see where she stands."



Possible Conflict at Heart of Clinton Foundation<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/us/politics/election-clinton-foundation.html>

NEW YORK TIMES // ALBERT HUNT

The Clintons have been targeted by accusations of wrongdoing from Whitewater to Benghazi. There also are self-inflicted wounds: President Bill Clinton's dalliance with Monica Lewinsky and Hillary Clinton's use of private email servers while secretary of state. They may be on the verge of creating another one: The Clinton Foundation, which has done a number of good works over the past 15 years, would appear to present an inherent conflict of interest should Mrs. Clinton become president, and possibly does even now with her as a candidate. Mrs. Clinton has suggested that if she is elected, the foundation - which collects contributions from wealthy interests, including foreign governments - would continue basically as is. "The work that it's done has been extraordinary," she said in March when asked whether there would be any ethical concerns about continuing the foundation. "The answer is transparency." Ethics experts reject that answer. They say there wouldn't be any way to avoid the appearance of conflicts if she wins the presidency.



As Race Drags On, Clinton Says Sanders Has 'Right' to Continue<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-22/clinton-says-sanders-has-every-right-to-continue-campaign>

BLOOMBERG // MICHELLE JAMRISKO

Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton said her challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders, has "every right" to finish his campaign how he chooses, even though her extended 2008 contest for the nomination with Barack Obama was much closer than this year's battle. The former secretary of State also isn't concerned that Sanders's sharp criticisms of the Democratic Party's nomination process, and the potential for a chaotic party convention in July, is helping Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, she said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press." Clinton leads the Vermont senator by 2,293 delegates to 1,533, with 2,383 needed to secure the nomination, according to tallies by the Associated Press that include superdelegates -- party leaders and elected officials not formally bound to any candidate.



Sanders: Voters see Clinton as 'the lesser of two evils' <http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/sanders-clinton-two-evils-223449>

POLITICO // MATTHEW NUSSBAUM

American voters should not be forced to pick between "the lesser of two evils" this November, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says. Asked in an interview airing Sunday on ABC's "This Week" if that's how he'd describe a possible match-up between Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Sanders said it was not him making the characterization. "That's what the American people are saying," he said. "If you look at the favorability ratings of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, both of them have very, very high unfavorables." A recent CNN/ORC polls showed 57 percent of voters nationally viewed Trump unfavorably, while 49 percent viewed Clinton that way. Sanders continued to emphasize that he'll stay in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, though he acknowledged the delegate math provides for "a very steep uphill climb." He also appealed to so-called super delegates, who are not bound to any candidate at the Democratic National Convention, to consider switching their support from Clinton to him over issues of electability.



Sanders steps up feud with Democratic establishment<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN0YD0VS>

REUTERS // JOHN WHITESIDES

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders cranked up his fight with party leaders on Sunday, backing a challenger to the Democratic National Committee's chairwoman and accusing the party's establishment of trying to anoint Hillary Clinton as the nominee for president. In a series of television interviews, Sanders remained defiant despite what he acknowledged was an uphill fight to overtake front-runner Clinton. Clinton has said she already considers herself the de facto nominee and is increasingly turning her attention to Donald Trump, saying on Sunday that the rhetoric of the presumptive Republican nominee was dangerous. Sanders told ABC's "This Week" program that Americans should not have to choose between "the lesser of two evils" in the Nov. 8 election. Sanders said that if he won the White House, he would not reappoint U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz as DNC chairwoman. He also endorsed law professor Tim Canova, who is challenging the Florida congresswoman in the August Democratic primary.



Bernie Sanders Makes a Campaign Mark. Now, Can He Make a Legacy?<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-legacy.html>

NEW YORK TIMES // JONATHAN MAHLER AND YAMICHE ALCINDOR

Congressional candidates who speak of "liberating the American underclass" are flush with campaign donations. The likely Democratic presidential nominee has not only moved to the left on a range of issues, but now routinely rails against the influence of "big money." There are plenty of signs that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has left a mark on the political moment. But some liberal Democrats are beginning to worry that as Mr. Sanders continues his quest for the nomination, his chance to build a lasting legacy may be slipping away. Far from laying the foundation to transform his campaign into a movement, Mr. Sanders is wrapped up in the race itself, sharpening his attacks on Hillary Clinton and demanding that she debate him before the June 7 primary in California. And many of his supporters are following his cue. In an ugly series of events this month that, if nothing else, showed how difficult they may be to herd, Sanders supporters disrupted the Nevada Democratic convention and later threatened the state party chairwoman in a fight over delegates.



Sanders says he's going all the way to the Democratic convention<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/22/sanders-says-hes-going-all-the-way-to-the-democratic-convention/>

WASHINGTON POST // JANELL ROSS

Sen. Bernie Sanders shocked no one Sunday morning when he told viewers of CBS's "Face the Nation" that he plans to remain in the presidential race until at least the Democratic convention. Sanders (Vt.) is certain that he can become the Democratic nominee. But regardless of the outcome, he said he plans to go to the convention and seek what he considers critical changes to the rules. Sanders complained Sunday, as he has many times before, that closed primaries disenfranchise millions of people who may wish to vote for a Democratic candidate. Closed primaries are contests held in states that allow only registered party members, in this case Democrats, to cast ballots. In April, The Washington Post's Greg Sargent reported that Clinton had outperformed Sanders in states with closed primaries, suggesting that some share of support for Sanders comes from independent voters.

WASHINGTON POST // CHRIS CILLIZZA

If you want to make a politician really, really angry, endorse their primary opponent. That's exactly what Bernie Sanders did Saturday to Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. "Clearly, I favor her opponent," Sanders said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper set to air today. "His views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman Schultz's. Let me also say this, in all due respect to the current chairperson: If [I am] elected president, she would not be reappointed chairwoman of the DNC." That puts Sanders on the side of Tim Canova, a former Capitol Hill staffer who has enjoyed considerable fundraising success -- he's raised more than $1 million -- thanks to an anti-establishment message in his primary against Wasserman Schultz. And it ensures that the nastiness between Sanders and his supporters and Wasserman Schultz and the mainstream Democrats she represents will now surge into a full-blown battle.

POLITICO // MARC CAPUTO

Bernie Sanders made it official Sunday: He doesn't just oppose Debbie Wasserman Schultz as Democratic National Committee chair, he wants to help unseat her in Congress. "The political revolution is not just about electing a president. We need a Congress with members who believe, like Bernie, that we cannot change a corrupt system by taking its money," Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote in a fundraising email for Tim Canova, the day after the presidential candidate announced he would back Canova's primary campaign against Wasserman Schultz. "Tim endorsed Bernie's presidential campaign, and was inspired to run because of Wasserman Schultz' support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership," the email read. "His campaign is funded like ours, by lots of people giving small amounts of money." The congressional primary could serve as a proxy war for the Sanders-Clinton rivalry.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday said he supports Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Democratic opponent in her August 30 primary, adding that if he is elected president, he would effectively terminate her chairmanship of the DNC. Sanders, whose campaign has engaged in an increasingly bitter feud with the DNC chairwoman during his presidential bid, said in an interview set to air on CNN's "State of the Union" that he favors Tim Canova in Florida's 23rd congressional district. Canova is supporting Sanders. "Well, clearly, I favor her opponent," Sanders told Tapper. "His views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman Schultz's." On Sunday afternoon, Canova accused Wasserman Schultz of ignoring her home district's economic issues. "In her own votes in the House of Representatives, I think she's making the problems worse," Canova told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield.

Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton edges past presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by just three points in a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday. Clinton leads Trump 46 percent to 43 percent, within the poll's 3.1 percentage-point margin of error. The finding indicates a tightening race between two candidates with high unfavorable ratings. Clinton led Trump by 50 percent to 39 percent in an April NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. The new poll of 1,000 registered voters May 15-19 found that 58 percent of voters view Trump unfavorably, while 54 percent have an unfavorable impression of Clinton. Forty-seven percent of the voters surveyed said they would consider a third-party candidate in a general election match between Clinton and Trump.

Quadrennial battlegrounds Ohio and Florida start off as close races as the general election looms, helping describe a 2016 presidential race that looks to be very competitive. Even as partisans appear to be coming into line behind their parties' likely nominees in these battleground states, many seem to be doing so begrudgingly, compelled by opposition to the alternative. And the wider electorate expresses both anger at the government and concern about the economy, just as primary voters did this spring. For them, the candidates' impending nominations elicit more cynicism than enthusiasm -- all of which could set the backdrop for a volatile, unpredictable contest. In Florida, a hypothetical matchup between Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump shows Clinton with a one-point edge among those with a preference, 43-42, and in Ohio, Clinton leads Trump by five at 44-39. A hypothetical matchup in Florida shows a tie between Democrat Bernie Sanders and Trump at 44 percent apiece, while in Ohio, Sanders enjoys a larger nine-point edge over Trump 48-39.



Key G.O.P. Donors Still Deeply Resist Donald Trump's Candidacy<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/us/politics/donald-trump-republican-fundraising.html?ref=politics&_r=0>

NEW YORK TIMES // JONATHAN MARTIN AND ALEXANDER BURNS

A powerful array of the Republican Party's largest financial backers remains deeply resistant to Donald J. Trump's presidential candidacy, forming a wall of opposition that could make it exceedingly difficult for him to meet his goal of raising $1 billion before the November election. Interviews and emails with more than 50 of the Republican Party's largest donors, or their representatives, revealed a measure of contempt and distrust toward their own party's nominee that is unheard of in modern presidential politics. More than a dozen of the party's most reliable individual contributors and wealthy families indicated that they would not give to or raise money for Mr. Trump. This group has contributed a combined $90 million to conservative candidates and causes in the last three federal elections, mainly to "super PACs" dedicated to electing Republican candidates.



Donald Trump isn't empathetic. Is that a problem?<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/one-question-about-trump-nags-at-me-does-he-need-to-be-empathetic/2016/05/22/b1fadd22-203c-11e6-aa84-42391ba52c91_story.html>

WASHINGTON POST // CHRIS CILLIZA

Donald Trump has cleared every electoral hurdle before him in this presidential race. He went from 1 percent, literally, to the top of the polls. He beat 16 other people for the Republican nomination. He finds himself in a statistical dead heat with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. And, he has done it all by being himself: brash, bold, controversial and unapologetic. As the nation turns its eyes to the general election, I have one question that continues to nag at me as I think about the possibility of Trump in the White House: Can he be empathetic? Like, at all? And does he need to be? "Ultimately, I think a lack of empathy is just one piece of a portrait of a person who is unbalanced and damaged," said Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant who has long vocally opposed Trump. "He has spent his life in a bubble, surrounded by hired yes men and women who have never told his inner child to grow up."



Donald Trump Lags Behind Hillary Clinton in Organizing Key State<http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-lags-behind-hillary-clinton-in-organizing-key-states-1463945208?tesla=y>

WALL STREET JOURNAL // REID EPSTEIN

Though Donald Trump dispensed with his last primary opponent months before Hillary Clinton will, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee trails far behind the leading Democrat in organizing in key general-election states. Ohio, a state that has backed every presidential winner since 1964, presents both Mr. Trump's best opportunity to carry a big swing state and reveals his team's steep logistical challenges. After winning the GOP nomination on a tight budget with a skeletal staff, Mr. Trump doesn't have any general-election staff in the state, and senior aides in New York and Washington haven't made contact with the state Republican Party. Efforts to recruit the state's experienced operatives who helped elect Gov. John Kasich have so far been unsuccessful, people familiar with the matter said.



Trump camp quietly courts Muslims<http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/280762-trump-campaign-quietly-courts-muslims>

THE HILL // JONATHAN EASLEY

Donald Trump's top foreign policy adviser has quietly opened backchannels within Muslim and Middle Eastern communities in the U.S. in an attempt to win over a small but increasingly important voting bloc. Walid Phares, a top national security adviser for Trump, has been courting prominent Muslim Republicans and conservative Middle Eastern activists in the U.S. Some Muslim Republicans and conservative Middle Eastern activists have also engaged with other top campaign officials about furthering Trump's outreach to those communities. In a Friday phone interview with The Hill, Phares said Trump campaign officials had not directed him to engage with the groups. Rather, he described the talks as a natural extension of the relationships he's built over decades of policy work on Middle Eastern affairs. Phares said that he initiated contact with several individuals and groups to ask them to organize for Trump or to sell them on Trump's positions in hopes that they'd at some point support the likely GOP nominee.



Donald Trump's stance on guns in classrooms - yes, no and probably<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/22/donald-trumps-stance-on-guns-in-classrooms-yes-no-and-probably/>

WASHINGTON POST // JANELL ROSS

Donald Trump may be the candidate that the National Rifle Association (NRA) supports in the presidential race, but on Sunday it was not at all clear whether he backs the organization's official position on guns in American schools. During a call-in interview with "Fox & Friends," Trump gave a rather ambiguous response to a question about the issue. "I don't want to have guns in classrooms. Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms," he said. Then he offered more mixed statements about teachers and guns and schools. "I'm not advocating guns in classrooms. ... In some cases - and a lot of people have made this case - teachers should be able to have guns, trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms."



Trump: No Guns in Classrooms, Except Some Teachers<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/05/22/trumpguns0522/>

WALL STREET JOURNAL // WSJ STAFF

Donald Trump said Sunday that he is not "advocating guns in classrooms," but immediately added, "in some cases teachers should have guns in classrooms." The seemingly contradictory remark, made in a phone call to the Fox & Friends television show, was ridiculed by critics. The liberal website Thinkprogress posted an item headed, "Donald Trump wants guns in classrooms but doesn't want guns in classrooms." Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, appeared to be seeking to make a distinction between allowing guns in classrooms generally and permitting individual teacher to carry firearms. "I'm not advocating guns in classrooms," Mr. Trump said. "But remember, in some cases, and a lot of people have made this case, teachers should be allowed to have guns in classrooms. Trained teachers should be allowed to have guns in classrooms."



Mark Cuban: Trump has been good for American politics<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/22/mark-cuban-trump-has-been-good-for-american-politics/>

WASHINGTON POST // JANELL ROSS

Basketball-team owner, entrepreneur, author and reality-TV-show star Mark Cuban thinks that Donald Trump's run for the White House has been good for American politics, in the long term. That's what Cuban told viewers in a pre-taped appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" that was aired Sunday morning. Cuban told "Meet the Press" host Chuck Todd that Trump had cleared the way for non-traditional candidates to enter the presidential fray, shown that the conventional political wisdom does not always prove accurate and eliminated the need for "Stepford candidates." All of that is good for the country in the long term, Cuban said. In the short term, Trump's candidacy has produced some things not so great for the country, such as increased social division, the Dallas Mavericks owner said.



Libertarian candidates draw attention, as #NeverTrump campaigners look elsewhere<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/22/libertarian-candidates-draw-attention-as-nevertrump-campaigners-look-elsewhere/>

WASHINGTON POST // DAVID WEIGEL

Bill Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts who now seeks the Libertarian Party's nomination for vice president, has already received the sort of attention third-party candidates dream of. In an interview with the New York Times, Weld said he could "hear the glass crunching on Kristallnacht" when he contemplated Donald Trump's deportation agenda. In an interview with CNN, Weld talked confidently about a Libertarian campaign being able to "nudge the Democrats toward the economic center" and "nudge the Republicans to get away from their antiabortion stance." Yet the outnumbered but determined band of conservatives looking for a third-party savior are looking elsewhere. On Saturday morning, pollster Doug Schoen released the results of a poll conducted in mid-May with 1,000 likely voters. Fifty-one percent liked the idea of a third-party candidate. Twenty percent would favor a "generic" candidate in a race with Trump and Hillary Clinton. The Libertarian Party, which will decide next weekend whether to nominate Weld for vice president and former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson for president, got no mention at all.

Bernie Isn't Hillary's Problem<http://www.wsj.com/articles/bernie-isnt-hillarys-problem-1463784149>

WALL STREET JOURNAL // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

As more polls show that Hillary Clinton could lose to Donald Trump, Democratic media and political elites have decided that the problem is- Bernie Sanders. The socialist warhorse has had his campaign fun, but now he and his supporters refuse to slink away quietly into Howard Dean obscurity. Doesn't he know that his persistence is helping Republicans? We'd humbly suggest that these Democrats are looking through the wrong end of the campaign telescope. Bernie's continuing string of victories is the symptom of the political demand for change after eight years of Democratic rule. The real Democratic problems this year are the Obama record and the Clinton candidacy. "I will be the nominee," Mrs. Clinton declared this week, and barring an act of God or the FBI director she is no doubt right.



Bill Clinton, Economy Czar?<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/opinion/bill-clinton-economy-czar.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss>

NEW YORK TIMES // ELIZABETH WILLIAMSON

On a warm Friday night, Montana Democrats filed into a middle school gym for a Hillary Clinton rally that was all Bill and no Hillary.

Mrs. Clinton was never on the marquee for this one. Montana, South Dakota and North Dakota all vote on June 7, the last big Tuesday on the presidential primary calendar that includes the critical state of California, with many times more Democratic delegates than all three Western states put together. So it was that Mrs. Clinton dispatched her husband to traverse the Great Plains, speaking at rallies in Sioux Falls, S.D., Fargo, N.D., and Billings.



An Openly Gay Man Runs the Army<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/opinion/sunday/an-openly-gay-man-runs-the-army.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss>

NEW YORK TIMES // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

Last week an openly gay man, Eric Fanning, became secretary of the Army. Read that sentence again and contemplate what it reveals about how much and how quickly American society has changed. Only five years ago, openly gay people were barred from serving in its armed forces. During Mr. Fanning's lengthy confirmation process, his sexual orientation was simply not an issue. That is a tribute to those who fought so hard to repeal the ban, and a measure of the nation's at times uncertain, but as yet unfailing, march toward equality. In retrospect the fight that convulsed this country over whether gay Americans should serve in uniform seems senseless, almost absurd. Yet it is instructive, if only because a Pentagon plan to allow transgender Americans to serve openly in uniform remains stalled by a similar, albeit quieter, debate.



The Broken Bargain With College Graduates<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/opinion/sunday/the-broken-bargain-with-college-graduates.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss>

NEW YORK TIMES // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

Obama focused on the noneconomic reasons for going to college. The skills gained in college, he said, are tools to help "make the right choices - away from fear and division and paralysis, and toward cooperation and innovation and hope." It was an important reminder, well suited to the times and the occasion. But it also came across as if the economic benefits of college were a given. In fact, the familiar assumption - graduate from college and prosperity will follow - has been disproved in this century. College-educated workers have not seen meaningful pay raises, and public policy has failed to address the stagnation. It is true that as a group college graduates make more than high school graduates. This gap is one reason that politicians like Mr. Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump want to make college more affordable. College affordability is thus linked to equality of opportunity. Since 2002, however, inflation-adjusted pay for college graduates has risen a measly 64 cents an hour, to about $31 on average. That's surely better than the 49-cents-an-hour drop for high school-educated workers in the same period, to a little less than $17. But standing still while others regress is no cause for celebration.



A net plus for America<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-net-plus-for-america/2016/05/22/549c3088-1df6-11e6-8c7b-6931e66333e7_story.html>

WASHINGTON POST // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

AMONG THE many unfortunate aspects of the 2016 presidential campaign has been the bashing of "trade deals" by candidates across the political spectrum, including those who should know better, like the Democratic front-runner, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. As matters now stand, the next president - whether it's Ms. Clinton, her Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or the Republican, Donald Trump - will be someone who opposes President Obama's proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement with 11 nations. The TPP's best chance at passage might be during the lame-duck session between the election and Inauguration Day, when Mr. Obama will still be in office and Congress will still be dominated by past supporters of the measure. In case anyone campaigning for office in the meantime is interested in them, some fresh facts about the TPP have just emerged showing why the case against it - that it would "steal" jobs from hard-pressed American workers, as previous such agreements have purportedly done - is so badly overblown. A definitive 800-page estimate of the agreement's impact on the American economy by the U.S. International Trade Commission shows that, by 2032, the TPP would raise U.S. annual real income by $57.3 billion above what it would have been otherwise, and it would create 128,000 full-time jobs. Given the enormous size of the U.S. economy, of course, these are modest improvements indeed: less than a percentage point in each case. Still, a net positive is a net positive.

 That forward-looking message will be delivered even as he confronts the legacies of two wars long past &#8212; Vietnam and World War II &#8212; that still are fraught with emotion. Obama's first stop on his weeklong Asia trip was Vietnam, where he is the third sitting
 president to visit since the end of the war. Four decades after the fall of Saigon, and two decades after President Bill Clinton restored relations with the nation, Obama is eager to upgrade relations with an emerging power whose rapidly expanding middle class
 beckons as a promising market for U.S. goods and an offset to China's growing strength in the region. Obama arrived in Hanoi late Sunday. During his three-day stay in Vietnam, he'll make the case for stronger commercial and security ties, including approval
 of the 12-nation trans-Pacific trade agreement that is stalled in Congress and facing strong opposition from the 2016 presidential candidates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 TSA's sixth administrator in June. Just 11 months later, he has basically been warned. During a Sunday morning appearance on ABC's &quot;This Week,&quot; Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Edward R. Royce (R-Calif.) each told viewers that there may be a need for management
 and leadership changes, or at least significant improvement, at the TSA. Schiff is the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Royce is chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. And as members of Congress representing

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Senior White House Adviser Valerie Jarrett says Republicans&#8217; decision not to work with President Obama &#8212; on his Supreme Court nomination and on a swath of other issues &#8212; comes from
 party leadership. In an interview with &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; that aired Sunday night, Jarrett said Republicans are &#8220;making the political calculus that to be friendly to the White House is not in their interest.&#8221; Jarrett said Obama has reached out to Republicans on
 a number of issues, including the nomination of Merrick Garland to the high court. &#8220;I want to completely debunk this notion that if the president were just simply more friendly and more outgoing and [could] schmooze that this would change,&#8221; she told CBS&#8217;s
 Norah O&#8217;Donnell. Jarrett said the GOP&#8217;s decision not to cooperate with Obama on Garland&#8217;s nomination comes from the top, without naming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell specifically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">U.S. Sens. Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) joined health officials Sunday to ask for increased funding to prevent and treat the Zika virus. As WCBS 880&#8217;s Mike Smeltz
 reported, Dr. Bernard Dreyer, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said at the Madison Square Park news conference that the time to act is now. &#8220;The Zika virus is a true urgent public health threat,&#8221; Dreyer said. Dreyer said action cannot wait
 until after babies are born in the U.S. with Zika-related birth defects. Schumer said the U.S. House of Representatives&#8217; approved sum of $600 million to fight Zika comes up woefully short. &#8220;There won&#8217;t be enough money to come up with a vaccine quickly enough,
 there won&#8217;t be enough money for prevention and there won&#8217;t be enough money to do the research to find out exactly how Zika works,&#8221; Schumer said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 Sanders and Hillary Clinton in their common opposition to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. &#8220;Remember when the last GOP president left office? We were losing 800,000 jobs, foreclosures signs dotted Florida streets&#8221; said Democratic National Committee

 final slate of delegates for the national convention and feature speakers to rev up the activists and donors who will return to their home counties and serve as the pillars of local political operations. The delegate selection process was marked by some hurt
 feelings from party activists who were left off the final ballot, but solidarity was the theme for the $100-a-plate dinner held after the delegate selection process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The Senate is heading for a showdown over women registering for the draft. Supporters of requiring women to sign up for Selective Service see the upper chamber as their last best hope
 for getting legislation to President Obama's desk. They've turned their attention to the Senate after suffering a setback in the House, which last week dropped language requiring women to register from its version of the annual defense bill. Proponents say
 women already have the green light to serve in combat roles, hurting the legal argument for excluding them from the draft. But opponents say Congress needs to spend more time studying the politically tricky issue instead of tucking it into a massive &#8220;must
 pass&#8221; bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee has already included a requirement to open the draft to women in its version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a move that sparked outrage from conservatives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 Republican who attended the event, told CNN. A Graham spokesman wouldn&#8217;t confirm to CNN the content of the senator's remarks, but emphasized that he doesn&#8217;t support a third-party run that some Republicans are working to organize. &#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been any change

 over at TSA, and there's certainly management problems at TSA. So with this legislation &#8212; it's also important the administration move in with an overhaul of management at the TSA to make them more effective,&#8221; Royce said on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;This Week.&quot; &#8220;Replace the administrator?&#8221;

 that the coming weeks represented a critical period in which, if left unchallenged, Mr. Trump could &#8220;normalize himself&#8221; as he seeks to broaden his support. But Mr. Sanders pointed to polls showing Mrs. Clinton with dangerously high percentages of people who
 have unfavorable views of her and asked whether a choice between her and Mr. Trump in the fall would force voters to pick the &#8220;lesser of two evils.&#8221; Even as she contends with Mr. Sanders&#8217;s unflagging critique from the left, Mrs. Clinton said it was vital for
 her to pivot to confront Mr. Trump now, lest he successfully repackage himself for wider consumption, rather than appealing to the Republican primary electorate alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Previewing her general election line of attack, Hillary Clinton is lambasting Donald Trump as dangerous and unqualified to be president. &#8220;My campaign is not going to let Donald Trump
 try to normalize himself,&#8221; the Democratic presidential front-runner said in an interview aired Sunday on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve said he was unqualified to be president. I believe that deeply.&#8221; The former New York senator and secretary of state hit the
 presumptive Republican presidential nominee for refusing to release his tax returns, talking of pulling the U.S. out of NATO and, she said, of &#8220;advocating a return to torture, and even murdering the families of suspected terrorists.&#8221; &#8220;That is beyond the pale.
 And it poses immediate dangers,&#8221; Clinton said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no evidence he has any ideas about making America great, as he advertises. He seems to be particularly focused on making himself appear great. And as we go through this campaign, we&#8217;re going to be demonstrating
 the hollowness of his rhetoric. And the danger of a lot of what he has said.&#8221; Trump has said he&#8217;d support re-implementing waterboarding and &#8220;worse&#8221; in interrogating suspected terrorists and that the U.S. should &#8220;go after&#8221; the families of terrorists.

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton stepped up her attack on presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump Sunday, asserting that the real estate mogul is &quot;afraid'' to release his tax returns
 because it would reveal that he's paid little or no taxes. In an interview on NBC's Meet The Press, Clinton also said Trump has offered nothing to show that he is capable of fulfilling a campaign slogan that promises to make America great again. &quot;I think in
 the course of this campaign, we are going to demonstrate he has no ideas,'' Clinton said. &quot;There's no evidence he has any ideas about making America great, as he advertises. He seems to be particularly focused on making himself appear great.'' Clinton said
 Trump's promises to revitalize the military and invest in America's crumbling infrastructure are hollow pledges because he has aggressively sought to reduce his personal tax burdens even as other Americans pay their share.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Hillary Clinton says she welcomes businessman and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban's interest in potentially becoming her vice presidential running mate. In an interview that aired
 Sunday, Clinton opened the door wide open to Cuban and other business leaders, who could serve to counter the likely Republican nominee, real estate mogul Donald Trump. &quot;I think we should look widely and broadly. It's not just people in elected office. It
 is successful businesspeople,&quot; Clinton told NBC News's Chuck Todd on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; &quot;I am very interested in that.&quot; &quot;And I appreciate his openness to it,&quot; she added of Cuban's comments. In a portion of an interview with Todd that was released Friday, Cuban
 said that he would &quot;absolutely&quot; be willing to meet with Clinton about becoming a potential vice presidential pick, but he noted that he had some concerns that she might have shifted too far to the left during the Democratic primary race against Sen. Bernie
 Sanders of Vermont. &quot;The key would be she would have to go more to center,&quot; Cuban said. &quot;I like the fact that Senator Clinton has thought-out proposals. That's a good thing because at least we get to see where she stands.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The Clintons have been targeted by accusations of wrongdoing from Whitewater to Benghazi. There also are self-inflicted wounds: President Bill Clinton&#8217;s dalliance with Monica Lewinsky
 and Hillary Clinton&#8217;s use of private email servers while secretary of state. They may be on the verge of creating another one: The Clinton Foundation, which has done a number of good works over the past 15 years, would appear to present an inherent conflict
 of interest should Mrs. Clinton become president, and possibly does even now with her as a candidate. Mrs. Clinton has suggested that if she is elected, the foundation &#8212; which collects contributions from wealthy interests, including foreign governments &#8212; would
 continue basically as is. &#8220;The work that it&#8217;s done has been extraordinary,&#8221; she said in March when asked whether there would be any ethical concerns about continuing the foundation. &#8220;The answer is transparency.&#8221; Ethics experts reject that answer. They say
 there wouldn&#8217;t be any way to avoid the appearance of conflicts if she wins the presidency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 in July, is helping Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, she said Sunday on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press.&#8221; Clinton leads the Vermont senator by 2,293 delegates to 1,533, with 2,383 needed to secure the nomination, according to tallies by

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">American voters should not be forced to pick between &#8220;the lesser of two evils&#8221; this November, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says. Asked in an interview airing Sunday on ABC's &quot;This Week&quot;
 if that's how he'd describe a possible match-up between Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Sanders said it was not him making the characterization. &#8220;That&#8217;s what the American people
 are saying,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you look at the favorability ratings of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, both of them have very, very high unfavorables.&#8221; A recent CNN/ORC polls showed 57 percent of voters nationally viewed Trump unfavorably, while 49 percent viewed
 Clinton that way. Sanders continued to emphasize that he'll stay in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, though he acknowledged the delegate math provides for &#8220;a very steep uphill climb.&#8221; He also appealed to so-called super delegates, who are
 not bound to any candidate at the Democratic National Convention, to consider switching their support from Clinton to him over issues of electability.

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders cranked up his fight with party leaders on Sunday, backing a challenger to the Democratic National Committee's chairwoman and accusing
 the party's establishment of trying to anoint Hillary Clinton as the nominee for president. In a series of television interviews, Sanders remained defiant despite what he acknowledged was an uphill fight to overtake front-runner Clinton. Clinton has said she
 already considers herself the de facto nominee and is increasingly turning her attention to Donald Trump, saying on Sunday that the rhetoric of the presumptive Republican nominee was dangerous. Sanders told ABC's &quot;This Week&quot; program that Americans should not
 have to choose between &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot; in the Nov. 8 election. Sanders said that if he won the White House, he would not reappoint U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz as DNC chairwoman. He also endorsed law professor Tim Canova, who is challenging
 the Florida congresswoman in the August Democratic primary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Congressional candidates who speak of &#8220;liberating the American underclass&#8221; are flush with campaign donations. The likely Democratic presidential nominee has not only moved to the left
 on a range of issues, but now routinely rails against the influence of &#8220;big money.&#8221; There are plenty of signs that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has left a mark on the political moment. But some liberal Democrats are beginning to worry that as Mr. Sanders
 continues his quest for the nomination, his chance to build a lasting legacy may be slipping away. Far from laying the foundation to transform his campaign into a movement, Mr. Sanders is wrapped up in the race itself, sharpening his attacks on Hillary Clinton
 and demanding that she debate him before the June 7 primary in California. And many of his supporters are following his cue. In an ugly series of events this month that, if nothing else, showed how difficult they may be to herd, Sanders supporters disrupted
 the Nevada Democratic convention and later threatened the state party chairwoman in a fight over delegates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Sen. Bernie Sanders shocked no one Sunday morning when he told viewers of CBS's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; that he plans to remain in the presidential race until at least the Democratic convention.
 Sanders (Vt.) is certain that he can become the Democratic nominee. But regardless of the outcome, he said he plans to go to the convention and seek what he considers critical changes to the rules. Sanders complained Sunday, as he has many times before, that
 closed primaries disenfranchise millions of people who may wish to vote for a Democratic candidate. Closed primaries are contests held in states that allow only registered party members, in this case Democrats, to cast ballots. In April, The Washington Post's
 Greg Sargent reported that Clinton had outperformed Sanders in states with closed primaries, suggesting that some share of support for Sanders comes from independent voters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">If you want to make a politician really, really angry, endorse their primary opponent. That's exactly what Bernie Sanders did Saturday to Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie
 Wasserman Schultz. &quot;Clearly, I favor her opponent,&quot; Sanders said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper set to air today. &quot;His views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman Schultz's. Let me also say this, in all due respect to the current chairperson:
 If [I am] elected president, she would not be reappointed chairwoman of the DNC.&quot; That puts Sanders on the side of Tim Canova, a former Capitol Hill staffer who has enjoyed considerable fundraising success -- he's raised more than $1 million -- thanks to an
 anti-establishment message in his primary against Wasserman Schultz. And it ensures that the nastiness between Sanders and his supporters and Wasserman Schultz and the mainstream Democrats she represents will now surge into a full-blown battle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Bernie Sanders made it official Sunday: He doesn&#8217;t just oppose Debbie Wasserman Schultz as Democratic National Committee chair, he wants to help unseat her in Congress. &#8220;The political
 revolution is not just about electing a president. We need a Congress with members who believe, like Bernie, that we cannot change a corrupt system by taking its money,&#8221; Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote in a fundraising email for Tim Canova, the
 day after the presidential candidate announced he would back Canova's primary campaign against Wasserman Schultz. &#8220;Tim endorsed Bernie&#8217;s presidential campaign, and was inspired to run because of Wasserman Schultz&#8217; support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership,&#8221;
 the email read. &#8220;His campaign is funded like ours, by lots of people giving small amounts of money.&#8221; The congressional primary could serve as a proxy war for the Sanders-Clinton rivalry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday said he supports Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Democratic opponent in her August 30 primary, adding that
 if he is elected president, he would effectively terminate her chairmanship of the DNC. Sanders, whose campaign has engaged in an increasingly bitter feud with the DNC chairwoman during his presidential bid, said in an interview set to air on CNN's &quot;State
 of the Union&quot; that he favors Tim Canova in Florida's 23rd congressional district. Canova is supporting Sanders. &quot;Well, clearly, I favor her opponent,&quot; Sanders told Tapper. &quot;His views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman Schultz's.&quot; On Sunday afternoon,
 Canova accused Wasserman Schultz of ignoring her home district's economic issues. &quot;In her own votes in the House of Representatives, I think she's making the problems worse,&quot; Canova told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton edges past presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by just three points in a new national NBC News/Wall Street
 Journal poll released Sunday. Clinton leads Trump 46 percent to 43 percent, within the poll&#8217;s 3.1 percentage-point margin of error. The finding indicates a tightening race between two candidates with high unfavorable ratings. Clinton led Trump by 50 percent
 to 39 percent in an April NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. The new poll of 1,000 registered voters May 15-19 found that 58 percent of voters view Trump unfavorably, while 54 percent have an unfavorable impression of Clinton. Forty-seven percent of the voters
 surveyed said they would consider a third-party candidate in a general election match between Clinton and Trump.

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Quadrennial battlegrounds Ohio and Florida start off as close races as the general election looms, helping describe a 2016 presidential race that looks to be very competitive. Even
 as partisans appear to be coming into line behind their parties' likely nominees in these battleground states, many seem to be doing so begrudgingly, compelled by opposition to the alternative. And the wider electorate expresses both anger at the government
 and concern about the economy, just as primary voters did this spring. For them, the candidates' impending nominations elicit more cynicism than enthusiasm -- all of which could set the backdrop for a volatile, unpredictable contest. In Florida, a hypothetical
 matchup between Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump shows Clinton with a one-point edge among those with a preference, 43-42, and in Ohio, Clinton leads Trump by five at 44-39. A hypothetical matchup in Florida
 shows a tie between Democrat Bernie Sanders and Trump at 44 percent apiece, while in Ohio, Sanders enjoys a larger nine-point edge over Trump 48-39.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">A powerful array of the Republican Party&#8217;s largest financial backers remains deeply resistant to Donald J. Trump&#8217;s presidential candidacy, forming a wall of opposition that could make
 it exceedingly difficult for him to meet his goal of raising $1 billion before the November election. Interviews and emails with more than 50 of the Republican Party&#8217;s largest donors, or their representatives, revealed a measure of contempt and distrust toward
 their own party&#8217;s nominee that is unheard of in modern presidential politics. More than a dozen of the party&#8217;s most reliable individual contributors and wealthy families indicated that they would not give to or raise money for Mr. Trump. This group has contributed
 a combined $90 million to conservative candidates and causes in the last three federal elections, mainly to &#8220;super PACs&#8221; dedicated to electing Republican candidates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Donald Trump has cleared every electoral hurdle before him in this presidential race. He went from 1 percent, literally, to the top of the polls. He beat 16 other people for the Republican
 nomination. He finds himself in a statistical dead heat with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. And, he has done it all by being himself: brash, bold, controversial and unapologetic. As the nation turns its eyes to the general election, I have one
 question that continues to nag at me as I think about the possibility of Trump in the White House: Can he be empathetic? Like, at all? And does he need to be? &#8220;Ultimately, I think a lack of empathy is just one piece of a portrait of a person who is unbalanced
 and damaged,&#8221; said Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant who has long vocally opposed Trump. &#8220;He has spent his life in a bubble, surrounded by hired yes men and women who have never told his inner child to grow up.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 in organizing in key general-election states. Ohio, a state that has backed every presidential winner since 1964, presents both Mr. Trump&#8217;s best opportunity to carry a big swing state and reveals his team&#8217;s steep logistical challenges. After winning the GOP
 nomination on a tight budget with a skeletal staff, Mr. Trump doesn&#8217;t have any general-election staff in the state, and senior aides in New York and Washington haven&#8217;t made contact with the state Republican Party. Efforts to recruit the state&#8217;s experienced
 operatives who helped elect Gov. John Kasich have so far been unsuccessful, people familiar with the matter said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Donald Trump&#8217;s top foreign policy adviser has quietly opened backchannels within Muslim and Middle Eastern communities in the U.S. in an attempt to win over a small but increasingly
 important voting bloc. Walid Phares, a top national security adviser for Trump, has been courting prominent Muslim Republicans and conservative Middle Eastern activists in the U.S. Some Muslim Republicans and conservative Middle Eastern activists have also
 engaged with other top campaign officials about furthering Trump&#8217;s outreach to those communities. In a Friday phone interview with The Hill, Phares said Trump campaign officials had not directed him to engage with the groups. Rather, he described the talks
 as a natural extension of the relationships he&#8217;s built over decades of policy work on Middle Eastern affairs. Phares said that he initiated contact with several individuals and groups to ask them to organize for Trump or to sell them on Trump&#8217;s positions in
 hopes that they&#8217;d at some point support the likely GOP nominee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">WASHINGTON POST // JANELL ROSS</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Basketball-team owner, entrepreneur, author and reality-TV-show star Mark Cuban thinks that Donald Trump's run for the White House has been good for American politics, in the long term.
 That's what Cuban told viewers in a pre-taped appearance on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that was aired Sunday morning. Cuban told &quot;Meet the Press&quot; host Chuck Todd that Trump had cleared the way for non-traditional candidates to enter the presidential fray, shown
 that the conventional political wisdom does not always prove accurate and eliminated the need for &quot;Stepford candidates.&quot; All of that is good for the country in the long term, Cuban said. In the short term, Trump's candidacy has produced some things not so
 great for the country, such as increased social division, the Dallas Mavericks owner said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">WASHINGTON POST // DAVID WEIGEL</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Bill Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts who now seeks the Libertarian Party's nomination for vice president, has already received the sort of attention third-party
 candidates dream of. In an interview with the New York Times, Weld said he could &quot;hear the glass crunching on Kristallnacht&quot; when he contemplated Donald Trump's deportation agenda. In an interview with CNN, Weld talked confidently about a Libertarian campaign
 being able to &quot;nudge the Democrats toward the economic center&quot; and &quot;nudge the Republicans to get away from their antiabortion stance.&quot; Yet the outnumbered but determined band of conservatives looking for a third-party savior are looking elsewhere. On Saturday
 morning, pollster Doug Schoen released the results of a poll conducted in mid-May with 1,000 likely voters. Fifty-one percent liked the idea of a third-party candidate. Twenty percent would favor a &quot;generic&quot; candidate in a race with Trump and Hillary Clinton.
 The Libertarian Party, which will decide next weekend whether to nominate Weld for vice president and former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson for president, got no mention at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">As more polls show that Hillary Clinton could lose to Donald Trump, Democratic media and political elites have decided that the problem is&#8212; Bernie Sanders. The socialist warhorse has
 had his campaign fun, but now he and his supporters refuse to slink away quietly into Howard Dean obscurity. Doesn&#8217;t he know that his persistence is helping Republicans? We&#8217;d humbly suggest that these Democrats are looking through the wrong end of the campaign
 telescope. Bernie&#8217;s continuing string of victories is the symptom of the political demand for change after eight years of Democratic rule. The real Democratic problems this year are the Obama record and the Clinton candidacy. &#8220;I will be the nominee,&#8221; Mrs.
 Clinton declared this week, and barring an act of God or the FBI director she is no doubt right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">On a warm Friday night, Montana Democrats filed into a middle school gym for a Hillary Clinton rally that was all Bill and no Hillary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Mrs. Clinton was never on the marquee for this one. Montana, South Dakota and North Dakota all vote on June 7, the last big Tuesday on the presidential primary calendar that includes
 the critical state of California, with many times more Democratic delegates than all three Western states put together. So it was that Mrs. Clinton dispatched her husband to traverse the Great Plains, speaking at rallies in Sioux Falls, S.D., Fargo, N.D.,
 and Billings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Last week an openly gay man, Eric Fanning, became secretary of the Army. Read that sentence again and contemplate what it reveals about how much and how quickly American society has
 changed. Only five years ago, openly gay people were barred from serving in its armed forces. During Mr. Fanning&#8217;s lengthy confirmation process, his sexual orientation was simply not an issue. That is a tribute to those who fought so hard to repeal the ban,
 and a measure of the nation&#8217;s at times uncertain, but as yet unfailing, march toward equality. In retrospect the fight that convulsed this country over whether gay Americans should serve in uniform seems senseless, almost absurd. Yet it is instructive, if
 only because a Pentagon plan to allow transgender Americans to serve openly in uniform remains stalled by a similar, albeit quieter, debate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">NEW YORK TIMES // THE EDITORIAL BOARD</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Obama focused on the noneconomic reasons for going to college. The skills gained in college, he said, are tools to help &#8220;make the right choices &#8212; away from fear and division and paralysis,
 and toward cooperation and innovation and hope.&#8221; It was an important reminder, well suited to the times and the occasion. But it also came across as if the economic benefits of college were a given. In fact, the familiar assumption &#8212; graduate from college
 and prosperity will follow &#8212; has been disproved in this century. College-educated workers have not seen meaningful pay raises, and public policy has failed to address the stagnation. It is true that as a group college graduates make more than high school graduates.
 This gap is one reason that politicians like Mr. Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump want to make college more affordable. College affordability is thus linked to equality of opportunity. Since 2002, however, inflation-adjusted pay for
 college graduates has risen a measly 64 cents an hour, to about $31 on average. That&#8217;s surely better than the 49-cents-an-hour drop for high school-educated workers in the same period, to a little less than $17. But standing still while others regress is no
 cause for celebration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">AMONG THE many unfortunate aspects of the 2016 presidential campaign has been the bashing of &#8220;trade deals&#8221; by candidates across the political spectrum, including those who should know
 better, like the Democratic front-runner, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. As matters now stand, the next president &#8212; whether it&#8217;s Ms. Clinton, her Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or the Republican, Donald Trump &#8212; will be someone who
 opposes President Obama&#8217;s proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement with 11 nations. The TPP&#8217;s best chance at passage might be during the lame-duck session between the election and Inauguration Day, when Mr. Obama will still be in office and Congress will
 still be dominated by past supporters of the measure. In case anyone campaigning for office in the meantime is interested in them, some fresh facts about the TPP have just emerged showing why the case against it &#8212; that it would &#8220;steal&#8221; jobs from hard-pressed
 American workers, as previous such agreements have purportedly done &#8212; is so badly overblown. A definitive 800-page estimate of the agreement&#8217;s impact on the American economy by the U.S. International Trade Commission shows that, by 2032, the TPP would raise
 U.S. annual real income by $57.3 billion above what it would have been otherwise, and it would create 128,000 full-time jobs. Given the enormous size of the U.S. economy, of course, these are modest improvements indeed: less than a percentage point in each
 case. Still, a net positive is a net positive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
