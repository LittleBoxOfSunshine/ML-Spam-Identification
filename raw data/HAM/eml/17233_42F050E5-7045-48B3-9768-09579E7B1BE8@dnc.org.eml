Dear Providence Day Alumni,

It=92s hard to believe, but I began teaching at Providence Day nearly 25 ye=
ars ago. I=92ve seen many first days of school, Commencements, bus photos, =
and been on many field trips during my time at PD. I=92ve had the opportuni=
ty to see the school from different perspectives =96 first as a teacher and=
 coach, then as a parent, and now as a parent of alumni with my last Charge=
r student graduating in June.

Campus looked a little different when I started in the fall of 1991. We are=
 fortunate that our facilities have been able to grow and change along with=
 our increased enrollment. The changes continue with the exciting plans for=
 a new academic building on campus, which also means I=92ll (finally) be mo=
ving from my current location in the West Wing!

In 1995, I helped coin the slogan =93Silver Memories and Golden Dreams=94 f=
or our PDS 25th Anniversary celebration, and now I have many fond silver me=
mories of my 25 years =96 Click here or scroll down to read only a few.

I hope you look back on your time at PDS as fondly as I do =96 and that you=
 have your own collection of memories. I=92ve been surrounded by wonderful =
colleagues and students, and value the legacy you left from your time as a =
student. I ask that as you reflect on your PD memories you will consider jo=
ining me in making an annual gift to the school this fiscal year (100% of f=
aculty have pledged their support!). Alumni have been challenged to reach a=
 giving participation goal of 25%, and if this goal is met the school will =
receive a $25,000 challenge gift from six alumni and alumni parents. This i=
s a wonderful opportunity for the Providence Day community. Alumni particip=
ation is currently at 14.5%, and we need 270 more alumni donors to achieve =
this goal. A gift of any size counts as participation!

The Annual Fund has helped pay for me to attend national history conference=
s, enabling me to make the connections that led to me being involved in rev=
ising the AP US History course for the entire country =96 which was an exci=
ting project!
