Sounds like they're open to corporate, right Jordan?

One other. Do they take corporate dollars or just personal funds. Concerts are expensive.

No prob! Great question.. They'll be solicited by Kathleen Biden and whoever else is running the concert portion of this.

Hey,

I didn't reply to this email. Sorry about that. Quick question. Are the people we submit going to then be solicited to give to this program by a different fundraiser or are you doing the fundraising for this?

Hey all!

Following up to see if anyone has names to submit for this.  Only received names from Tristate so far.  Thanks again!

Hey guys,

The White House is hosting a summit in June called the United State of Women. One piece of the 2 days will be a huge concert at the convention center. This piece needs some fundraising support (and is separate from the summit so can take $$). They've come to us asking if we have donors who would be interested in sponsoring the concert. I think sponsorship levels will range from $5k - $20k. Sponsors will definitely have time with the musicians/talent (tbd), recognition at the concert, and hopefully some other cool perks. Obviously they can go to the summit too.

If you have donors who you think would be interested in this opportunity, can you please pass along their names and email addresses? They will receive info straight from the organizers.

Need to send our list in on Sunday.  Hopefully this is a cool way to engage women (and men) in a fun event this summer.

Thanks!
Claire
