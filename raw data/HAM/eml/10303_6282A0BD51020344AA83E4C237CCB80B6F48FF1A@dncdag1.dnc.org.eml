Cruz Campaign Vetting Carly for VP<http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/2002115>

Ted Cruz's presidential campaign is vetting Carly Fiorina as a potential running mate, THE WEEKLY STANDARD has learned.

According to a spokeswoman for Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO and one-time presidential candidate is being vetted by Cruz's campaign.

"Normal stuff," said Sarah Isgur Flores, who served as deputy campaign manager during Fiorina's bid, when asked about the process. She added that Fiorina has met with members of the Cruz campaign and has given them financial disclosures and other documentation. Flores added that "no offers" have been made.

On ABC's This Week Sunday, reporter Jon Karl floated the idea that Cruz could announce a running mate before next week's critical Indiana primary and suggested Fiorina would be the "one person" to fill that role.

Fiorina endorsed Cruz in March, after her own campaign for president ended. She has made appearances on the behalf of the Texas senator and introduced him at a recent campaign stop in Maryland.

Republicans in Fiorina's home state of California will vote in their state's primary on June 7. Fiorina won the Republican Senate primary in California in 2010.

Update: Cruz campaign spokeswoman Alice Stewart provided a statement to TWS. "We've already announced publicly that we're vetting prospecting VP nominees, but no selection has been made yet. When that decision has been made, we will share it."
