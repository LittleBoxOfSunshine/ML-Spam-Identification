Subject: question

I have a question I am hoping someone there can help me with on background, attributable to a "Democratic official" or whatever terms we negotiate.

Regarding the primary election debates, does anyone there know definitively whether the presidential campaigns negotiate the share of questions they will receive (40% of the questions asked, 50%, etc.), or is that something the network has license to decide? During the general election debate, I'm told, an equal number of questions is a negotiated point.  But how does it work for the primary?

Thanks much for any guidance.
