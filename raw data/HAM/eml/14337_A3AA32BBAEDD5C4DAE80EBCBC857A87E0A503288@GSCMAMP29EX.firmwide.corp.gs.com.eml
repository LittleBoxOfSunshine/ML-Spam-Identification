Subject: Meeting with A G Roy Cooper

Hello, Josh,

In speaking with my friend, Zach Allen, who is arranging for Jeff and
me to meet with Roy Cooper next Tuesday, Zach mentioned that Roy
will be coming to Goldman headquarters next Wednesday, and thought
he might be able to arrange for you to meet him there, rather than your
having to come up to the Regency the day before.

By copy of this email to Zach, he will be able to contact you in order to
effectuate such a meeting.

Best,

Will
