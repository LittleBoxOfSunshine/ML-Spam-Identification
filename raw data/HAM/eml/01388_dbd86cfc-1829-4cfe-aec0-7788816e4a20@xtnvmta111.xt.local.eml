BULLETIN -- AP: White House announces "Obama to travel to Hiroshima ... during [May 21-28 Vietnam and] Japan trip in first visit by sitting U.S. president. ... Japanese prime minister says ... Obama will ... pay respect to atomic bombing victims."

Good Tuesday morning. It's 69 days to Cleveland, 76 days to Philly, 182 days to election.

 

BEHIND THE CURTAIN: Republican insiders are buzzing about Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chair of Senate Foreign Relations, as an attractive, plausible vice-presidential pick for Trump. Corker - age 63, to Trump's 69 - surprised many in Washington by lavishing on-camera praise on Trump's foreign-policy speech two weeks ago. Last week, Corker told USA Today's Mary Troyan, who covers Tennessee for Gannett, that he "offered to help Donald Trump develop a foreign policy platform, making him one of the few senators to publicly embrace Trump ... Trump called him last week and he and Trump's campaign staff have talked since then."

Corker, among the wealthiest members of Congress, spent most of his life in business, and his bio says he brings a "results-driven businessman's perspective." A Republican who knows Corker well said: "He's an independent guy - kind of a tough guy - who's not afraid to swim upstream. He's frustrated by being in the Senate and not getting anything done. I think he'd really lean into this. He's not afraid to buck the old guard.And he's no dummy: He jumped out on the Trump thing early."

Another Great Mentioner told us: "Corker is not well-liked by his colleagues in the Senate. A big reason is he likes to get stuff done with Democrats. Trump might find that attractive."

Trump, who has said he plans to pick an experienced politician who knows the Hill and can help him get things done, dropped a potentially significant clue in his March 31 interview with the WashPost's Bob Woodward and Bob Costa: "somebody that can walk into the Senate and who's been friendly with these guys for 25 years, and people for 25 years."

Who's a current officeholder, who has served in both House and Senate, and first came to the Hill 35 years ago? JMart and Charlie, you can't answer - give someone else a chance.

Wow, you're good: YES! Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), age 72, an Army veteran who served in the House for eight years and the Senate for 10, then was George W. Bush's ambassador to Germany (arriving just before 9/11). Coats promoted faith-based initiatives on the outside, then in 2011 returned to the Senate, where he's on Finance and Intelligence. Of course, Trump has a special place in his heart for the Hoosier state. And a longtime friend said of Coats: "He's beloved. The man has no enemies. Everyone loves him. He's a governing choice. Clean as a whistle."

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), 55, who gets mentioned around town as a V.P., said in March that he'd support the nominee. Thune reiterated that support last week in an interview with KSFY, the ABC station in Sioux Falls, but said he hopes Trump will mature as a candidate: "I think there are a lot of things, in terms of what he's said and how he's said them, that he's going to have to demonstrate that he can improve upon and that he can be a candidate that actually is true to Republican principles. ... I'm hopeful, over time -- and we'll see in the weeks and months ahead -- that Donald Trump can become that kind of person."

One that seems more likely: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (Hoosier theme), who's a favorite of the Kochs and served 12 years in the U.S. House, with a stint as chair of the House Republican Conference. Pence, 56, who says he "achieved the largest state tax cut in Indiana history," voted for Cruz but then endorsed Trump, which makes him a great bridge. "It would symbolically make a statement to the reform segment of the party," a top GOPer said. A little bird tells us that Pence, who's running for reelection, has received vetting overtures from Trump Tower.

BREAKING -- "Dead heat: Trump, Clinton tied in 3 swing-state polls," by Nick Gass: "Trump and Hillary Clinton are effectively tied in ... Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to ... Quinnipiac ... In Florida, Clinton leads Trump, 43 percent to 42 percent ...

MEDIAWATCH -- "Journalists Dispute Claim They Helped Sell White House Iran Deal," by HuffPost's Michael Calderone: "Two prominent foreign policy journalists are pushing back at The New York Times Magazine for what they described as a 'defamatory' characterization in a much-discussed article. The article, a nearly 10,000-word profile of Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes, suggested that the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg and Al Monitor's Laura Rozen 'helped retail' the Obama administration's argument for a nuclear deal with Iran. Both Goldberg and Rozen described the description as false." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=63e0668338c5d5b49861be6bdd3914820a0fac920aecedbac658e45a4e23f76b

--JEFFREY GOLDBERG on TheAtlantic.com, "Ben Rhodes and the 'Retailing' of the Iran Deal": "I did not find this mention of my name amusing at all, because Samuels is making a serious, unsourced, and unsubstantiated allegation against me in an otherwise highly credible publication (one for which I happened to work, in fact). And he did so without disclosing that he holds a longtime personal grudge against me." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=63e0668338c5d5b4e5a3152d5c3139b615e5aebd9ef14215d094e78f30b00e59

--JOSH ROGIN in Bloomberg View, "When a Washington 'Cave Dweller' Steps Into the Light": "Most real power ... [lies with] the 'cave dwellers' of Washington. Occasionally, one of the cave dwellers surfaces and is subjected to public scrutiny. The results are rarely pretty. For one thing, the very important people for whom the cave dwellers work bristle at their lowly staff soaking up some of the spotlight. Other cave dwellers can use the opportunity to settle scores." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=63e0668338c5d5b4a76cd9f83795d3cc7dd61329eb12017c01a88218c9dd8448

FACEBOOK REPONSE to Gizmodo story claiming conservative bias in "Trending" - Tom Stocky, Facebook's V.P. for search: "My team is responsible for Trending Topics, and I want to address today's reports alleging that Facebook contractors manipulated Trending Topics to suppress stories of interest to conservatives. We take these reports extremely seriously, and have found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true. ...

"Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers. We are proud that, in 2015, the US election was the most talked-about subject on Facebook, and we want to encourage that robust political discussion from all sides. ... Our guidelines do permit reviewers to take steps to make topics more coherent, such as combining related topics into a single event (such as #starwars and#maythefourthbewithyou)." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=63e0668338c5d5b4c383f1b2a20380fcd2618dc2e186fa531a8a4b608a98c174 ...

--MARK LEIBOVICH, "Trump Shares His Opponent-Branding Secrets": "Get used to 'Crooked Hillary' ... Soon it will be chanted at Trump's rallies, painted on posters and deployed as a heckling epithet against the probable Democratic nominee. Trump is confident the name will stick, and he's usually right about these things. 'I feel it, it's an instinct,' Trump told me over the phone. ... 'It works, it flows,' Trump said, admiring his latest work. It was nice of Trump to talk to me, given that this is The New York Times, or as he calls us on Twitter, the 'Failing New York Times.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=63e0668338c5d5b4fc2f6ef8f85760c286026f41486ab1df081dd536897a6fd3

--BRET STEPHENS column in WSJ, "Hillary: The Conservative Hope": "Conservatives still play the character card against Hillary Clinton, citing her disdain for other people's rules, her Marie Antoinette airs and her potential law breaking. It's a fair card to play, if only the presumptive Republican nominee weren't himself a serial fabulist, an incorrigible self-mythologizer, a brash vulgarian, and, when it comes to his tax returns, a determined obfuscator. Endorsing Mr. Trump means permanently laying to rest any claim conservatives might ever again make on the character issue." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=63e0668338c5d5b4149cfe18ef0a7e5cc8a6c32f206541b32744abe7b9aeeea2

Trump's foundation has contributed more than $150,000 over the past three years to the Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School, a nonprofit school on Manhattan's Upper West Side also known as Columbia Prep." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=63e0668338c5d5b458330a33c74342377fe755ef3be4521c039ee5d0eceb8b24

--JACOB WEISBERG on Slate, "Why Republicans Who Hate Trump Are Afraid to Say So": "At the height of the Watergate scandal, Republicans found themselves facing an unenviable dilemma: whether to break with the lawbreaker Richard Nixon or remain faithful to party and president. Howard Baker ... took the courageous route ... One of Baker's fellow Republicans on the Watergate committee, a handsome World War II hero named Edward Gurney, followed the opposite course. ... When he died, the headline on his obituary read, 'E.J. Gurney, 82, Senator Who Backed Nixon.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=63e0668338c5d5b470739581ab9ec7bc40c7550c71f26591e1a703be6538e2b1

Come November, the GOP's flirtation with an unserious reality-TV star will likely end. And when it does, the party will need to rebuild itself.

Max and Allison became friends when they worked in Oregon during the 2008 Obama primary (she started in California, he in New Hampshire), and began dating in 2010. On Saturday, Max suggested a walk in Rock Creek Park, where he and Allison have gone on many runs. During the walk he dropped to one knee and proposed, and they were surprised by a few close friends who were waiting around the corner with champagne. Pic

OUT AND ABOUT -- John King was the commencement speaker and received an honorary Doctor of Laws at American University School of Public Affairs over the weekend. He joked that "Dr. King had a nice ring to it" and told students that while many of them had wanted him to bring his Magic Wall to commencement, it was just too expensive to haul around town and he couldn't get Mexico to pay for it. Words of wisdom to graduates included urging them not to "mistake understanding Washington with understanding America." He paid a Mother's Day tribute to his inspirational mom, Joan, saying that he learned from her strength that "dignity is quiet."

** A message from the Alzheimer's Association: Costing taxpayers $18.3 million every HOUR, Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's and more than 15 million unpaid caregivers are providing care for a loved one. Alzheimer's is a national issue, and now it's time we make it a national priority. Alzheimer's yearly cost of $236 billion will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation - an epidemic we cannot afford and shouldn't accept. While it is the only leading cause of death that can't be prevented, cured or even slowed, research and medical advancement can change that. That's why the Alzheimer's
 Association is fighting to eliminate the disease through the advancement of research and providing care and support for all affected. Learn more at www.alz.org/advocacy. **

Japanese prime minister says ... Obama will ... pay respect to atomic bombing victims.&quot;</p><p><b>Good Tuesday morning. 
</b>It's 69 days to Cleveland, 76 days to Philly, 182 days to election.</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>BEHIND THE CURTAIN:
</b> Republican insiders are buzzing about Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chair of Senate Foreign Relations, as an attractive, plausible vice-presidential pick for Trump. Corker - age 63, to Trump's 69 - surprised many in Washington by lavishing on-camera praise on Trump's foreign-policy speech two weeks ago. Last week, Corker told USA Today's Mary Troyan, who covers Tennessee for Gannett, that he &quot;offered to help Donald Trump develop a foreign policy platform, making him one of the few senators to publicly embrace Trump ... Trump called him last week and he and Trump's campaign staff have talked since then.&quot;</p><p><b>Corker, among the wealthiest members of Congress, 
</b>spent most of his life in business, and his bio says he brings a &quot;results-driven businessman's perspective.&quot; A Republican who knows Corker well said: &quot;He's an independent guy - kind of a tough guy - who's not afraid to swim upstream. He's frustrated by being in the Senate and not getting anything done. I think he'd really lean into this. He's not afraid to buck the old guard.<b>And he's no dummy: He jumped out on the Trump thing early.&quot;</b></p><p><b>Another Great Mentioner told us:</b> &quot;Corker is not well-liked by his colleagues in the Senate. A big reason is he likes to get stuff done with Democrats. Trump might find that attractive.&quot;</p><p><b>Trump, who has said he plans to pick
</b> an experienced politician who knows the Hill and can help him get things done, dropped a potentially significant clue in his March 31 interview with the WashPost's Bob Woodward and Bob Costa: &quot;somebody that can walk into the Senate and who's been friendly with these guys for 25 years, and people for 25 years.&quot;</p><p><b>Who's a current officeholder, </b>who has served in both House and Senate, and first came to the Hill <b>35</b> years ago? JMart and Charlie, you can't answer - give someone else a chance.</p><p><b>Wow, you're good:
</b> YES! Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), age 72, an Army veteran who served in the House for eight years and the Senate for 10, then was George W. Bush's ambassador to Germany (arriving just before 9/11). Coats promoted faith-based initiatives on the outside, then in 2011 returned to the Senate, where he's on Finance and Intelligence. Of course, Trump has a special place in his heart for the Hoosier state. And a longtime friend said of Coats: &quot;He's beloved. The man has no enemies. Everyone loves him. He's a governing choice. Clean as a whistle.&quot;</p><p><b>Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.),
</b> 55, who gets mentioned around town as a V.P., said in March that he'd support the nominee. Thune reiterated that support last week in an interview with KSFY, the ABC station in Sioux Falls, but said he hopes Trump will mature as a candidate: &quot;I think there are a lot of things, in terms of what he's said and how he's said them, that he's going to have to demonstrate that he can improve upon and that he can be a candidate that actually is true to Republican principles. ... I'm hopeful, over time -- and we'll see in the weeks and months ahead -- that Donald Trump can become that kind of person.&quot;</p><p><b>One that seems more likely:
</b> Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (Hoosier theme), who's a favorite of the Kochs and served 12 years in the U.S. House, with a stint as chair of the House Republican Conference. Pence, 56, who says he &quot;achieved the largest state tax cut in Indiana history,&quot; voted for Cruz but then endorsed Trump, which makes him a great bridge. &quot;It would symbolically make a statement to the reform segment of the party,&quot; a top GOPer said. A little bird tells us that Pence, who's running for reelection, has received vetting overtures from Trump Tower.</p><p><b>BREAKING -- &quot;Dead heat: Trump, Clinton tied in 3 swing-state polls,&quot; by Nick Gass:

</b> Costing taxpayers $18.3 million every HOUR, Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's and more than 15 million unpaid caregivers are providing care for a loved one. Alzheimer's is a national issue, and now it's time we make it a national priority. Alzheimer's yearly cost of $236 billion will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation - an epidemic we cannot afford and shouldn't accept. While it is the only leading cause of death that can't be prevented, cured or even slowed, research and medical advancement can change that. That's why the Alzheimer's Association is fighting to eliminate the
