THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 11, 2016



*Statement by NSC Spokesperson Ned Price on Assistant to the President fo=
r Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa O. Monaco's Visit to Belgiu=
m*

**

Today, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterror=
ism Lisa Monaco concluded a series of meetings in Brussels, Belgium with =
Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister=
 of Interior Jan Jambon, Minister of Justice Koen Greens, and other Belgi=
an security officials, police, and federal prosecutors. Ms. Monaco led a =
U.S. delegation, at the President's direction, to follow up on our joint =
counterterrorism efforts following the March 22 ISIL terrorist attacks in=
 Brussels. The delegation included John Mulligan, Deputy Director of the =
National Counterterrorism Center, and General Frank Taylor, Under Secreta=
ry for Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. =
Discussions with Belgian officials focused on our whole-of-government app=
roach to information sharing and counterterrorism cooperation with our Be=
lgian partners and solidarity with the Belgian people.



Ms. Monaco praised the work of Belgian intelligence and law enforcement s=
ervices in confronting the threat from ISIL and noted that Belgium is a v=
ital partner in the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL. Ms. Monaco discusse=
d with Belgian officials our shared efforts to disrupt terrorist plotting=
 against the United States and Europe and to degrade and destroy ISIL. Th=
ey also discussed a number of ways we can enhance our counterterrorism co=
operation in the wake of the March attacks in Brussels, to include intens=
ifying our information sharing and sharing lessons the United States lear=
ned following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Ms. Monaco and Be=
lgian officials agreed to advance a foreign terrorist fighter work plan t=
he U.S. Foreign Fighter Surge Team developed with its Belgian counterpart=
s immediately following the attacks, to disrupt the recruitment and flow =
of foreign terrorist fighters to Syria and Iraq. Ms. Monaco and the deleg=
ation also discussed with their Belgian counterparts countering violent e=
xtremism (CVE) efforts, to include our continued joint cooperation throug=
h the Strong Cities network, which includes Antwerp, to share best practi=
ces on counter-radicalization and prevention at the municipal level.



Ms. Monaco and the delegation also met with European Union Counterterrori=
sm Coordinator Giles de Kerchove to discuss how we can support EU efforts=
 to strengthen counterterrorism coordination and information sharing amon=
gst its members. They discussed the importance of quickly and effectively=
 implementing the European Union's directive on passenger name record (PN=
R) collection and sharing, to bolster the EU's border security and effort=
s to disrupt foreign fighter flows.
