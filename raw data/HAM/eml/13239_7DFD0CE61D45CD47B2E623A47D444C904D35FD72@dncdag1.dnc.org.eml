Trump Challenged London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, After Khan Called Trump "Ignorant" About Islam: "Let's Do An IQ Test." MORGAN: "Sadiq Khan is the first Muslim Mayor of London. He has attacked you for being ignorant. He says that if you're president--" TRUMP: "Let's do an IQ test." MORGAN: "He says you will make both countries less safe. He says I hope Donald Trump loses the election. My message to Donald Trump and his team is your views of Islam are ignorant." TRUMP: "I wished him well but now, I don't care. Let's see if he is a good mayor." MORGAN: "Are you offended by what he says? Are you offended by what he says?" TRUMP: "I am. He has never met me and doesn't know what I'm about. They are rude statements and tell him I will remember those statements. They are very nasty statements." [Good Morning Britain, ITV, 5/16/16] [2:15]

Trump Challenged Those Who Say He Doesn't Understand Global Warming: "Let's Do IQ Tests." TRUMP: "Nobody is stronger on nuclear than I am. It's the biggest single problem this world has. Not global warming. You know, Obama said the biggest problem we have is global warming. And by the way, it's supposed to be 70 degrees today. It's freezing here. Speaking of global warming, where is- We need some global warming! It's freezing. Man. In fact, this is the second record cold spell on the whole big section of the United States. It's not just Rochester. The whole big section. It's like record, record cold. And I keep hearing about global warming. Now they'll say, 'He doesn't understand. This is a world-wide problem.' Oh no, I don't understand? Let's do IQ tests." [Campaign Rally, Rochester NY, 4/10/16] [49:00]


Trump Said He Had A "Much Higher" IQ Than The Intellectuals And "Egg-Heads" Who Criticize His Trade Policy. TRUMP: "We are going to have a trade deficit of five-hundred billion dollars, folks. It's not happening anymore, not going to happen anymore. They've taken our jobs. They've taken our money. They've taken our manufacturing. They've taken our base, not going to happen anymore. Then, I have these guys--  I'm a free trader, but free trade has to be smart trade, it has to be equal trade. We can't let these people, these so called egg-heads and by the way, I guarantee you my IQ is much higher than theirs, alright. Somebody said the other day, 'Yes, well the intellectuals--' I said, 'What intellectuals? I'm smarter than they are, many of people in this audience are smarter than they are.' The intellectuals, like they're smart people. These are the same people, the pundits, I could tell you every one of them, I know them so well. I hate to mention their names because you give them credit." [Campaign Rally, Columbus OH, 3/1/16] [19:40]
