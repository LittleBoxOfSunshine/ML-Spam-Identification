Good Morning Everybody,

I was just following up on the interview request from yesterday for 
Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz for May 12 for The Costa Report.

By the way, as an aside, I am interested in booking other national 
Democratic Party leaders for the show as well for the rest of the year.

It is important to us to have an ideological balance on the show.

If you can help me on that front, I would be very grateful for that as well.

Thanks,

Brad

                  <br class="">
                  Dear Mr. Banfill,<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  My name is Brad Polisuk and I am a producer for the
                  nationally syndicated The Costa Report featuring
                  Rebecca Costa, broadcast from KSCO studios in Santa
                  Cruz, California, one of the last independently owned
                  radio stations in the US.<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  The Costa Report is a post-partisan human affairs show
                  with an audience of over 2 million people with over
                  250,000 followers on social media.<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  I am pitching this to you because Rebecca Costa is
                  interested in doing an interview with Congresswoman
                  Wasserman-Schultz that isn't particularly partisan or
                  political in nature but to appeal to our higher angels
                  as Americans in terms of our love for civic duty and
                  commitment to public service.<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  I am sure the Congresswoman would like to do an
                  interview where she is not either on the offensive or
                  defensive as chair of the DNC or as a political
                  candidate.<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  Put simply, it won't be a hostile interview but more
                  of an interview that focuses on what can we do as a
                  country together, regardless if Hillary Clinton or
                  Donald Trump becomes president or if Congress stays
                  the same or changes hands.<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  Also, to be blunt, we would love to have more
                  Democrats in Congress on the program.<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  You can hear recordings of past work here:
                  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.rebeccacosta.com/the-costa-report.htm">http://www.rebeccacosta.com/the-costa-report.htm</a> &nbsp;You
                  will see that we have had on major players on before.<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  I have May 12 open right now, which is right before
                  the California primary. It would be an opportune time
                  for her to be on and reach out to a talk radio
                  audience that would open to another perspective on the
                  Congresswoman's life and career.<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  There are a few options for a phone interview:<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  1. Live interview scheduled in between 2:00 - 3:00 pm
                  (Pacific Time) with various breaks in between.<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  2. A recorded interview between 9:00 - 10:00 am
                  (Pacific Time).<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  3. A recorded interview between 10:00 - 11:00 am
                  (Pacific Time).<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  Also, I would like to develop a long-term relationship
                  with her so we can feature more Democrats on the
                  program but more from a public servant perspective
                  with an agenda to move forward and get things done.<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  If this interests you and Congresswoman
                  Wasserman-Schultz, please let me know as soon as you
                  can. &nbsp;Thanks for your time.<br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  <br class="">
                  Sincerely,<br class="">
