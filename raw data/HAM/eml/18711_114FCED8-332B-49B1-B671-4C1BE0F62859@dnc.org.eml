Friend --

I hope you saw our exciting announcement last week around the newly formed Democratic Lawyers Council at the Democratic National Committee.

As part of this national announcement, we are hosting a National Kickoff Call on Tuesday, May 3rd at 2:00pm with special guests, Stephanie Cutter and David Simas. Participants will receive an insider's view of the 2016 presidential election and other progress updates.

You can sign up for the National Kickoff Call now using the following link: https://finance.democrats.org/page/s/DLCMay3Call

Additionally, if you would like to join the Democratic Lawyers Council today, you can reserve your spot here: https://finance.democrats.org/page/contribute/DLC2016

This election is too important for the legal community to sit on the sidelines. The next president may have the opportunity to appoint three to four Supreme Court justices and will weigh in on issues important to the legal community, including tort reform, judicial appointments, and criminal justice reform.

Thank you for your past and future support!
