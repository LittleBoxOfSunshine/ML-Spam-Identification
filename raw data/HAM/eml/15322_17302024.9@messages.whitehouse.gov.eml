THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 6, 2016



*Statement on the Employment Situation in April*



WASHINGTON, DC  Jason Furman, Chairman of the Council of Economic Adviser=
s, issued the following statement today on the employment situation in Ap=
ril. You can view the statementHERE [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/201=
6/05/06/employment-situation-april ].



Posted by Jason Furman on May 6, 2016 at 9:30AM ET

*Summary: The economy added 160,000 jobs in April, extending the longest =
streak of private-sector job growth on record, as wage growth picked up.*=


"The longest streak of private-sector job growth on record continued in A=
pril, with businesses adding 171,000 jobs, well above the pace necessary =
to maintain a low and stable unemployment rate. U.S. businesses have now =
added 14.6 million jobs over 74 straight months of job growth. Most impor=
tantly, average hourly earnings for private employees have increased 3.2 =
percent at an annual rate so far in 2016. Nevertheless, more work remains=
 to sustain faster wage growth and to ensure that the benefits of the rec=
overy are broadly shared, including investing in infrastructure and job t=
raining, implementing high-standards free trade agreements like the Trans=
-Pacific Partnership, and raising the minimum wage. "

*FIVE KEY POINTS ON THE LABOR MARKET IN APRIL 2016*

**


  * *U.S. businesses have now added 14.6 million jobs over 74 straight mo=
nths, extending the longest streak on record*. Today we learned that priv=
ate employment rose by 171,000 jobs in April. Total nonfarm employment ro=
se by 160,000 jobs in April, somewhat below the pace of recent months but=
 well above the pace of 80,000 jobs a month necessary to maintain a low a=
nd stable unemployment rate given longstanding demographic trends in labo=
r force participation. The unemployment rate held steady at 5.0 percent i=
n April, though the labor force participation rate decreased. Average hou=
rly earnings for private employees increased 0.3 percent in April, while =
wage growth in previous months was revised upward, eliminating a drop see=
n in earlier estimates. Wage growth has accelerated in recent months: ove=
r the last twelve months, average hourly earnings increased 2.5 percent, =
and have grown at 3.2 percent at an annual rate so far in 2016.=20



Chart1


  * * As the labor market continues to recover, the distribution of unemp=
loyment has shifted towards individuals who have recently entered the wor=
kforce or have chosen to leave a job and away from those who have lost a =
job.* In recessions, the distribution of unemployment shifts more heavily=
 towards those who are unemployed due to involuntary job loss, while the =
share of the unemployed who have either newly entered or reentered the la=
bor force or left a job voluntarily decreases. In the current business cy=
cle, the share of unemployment attributable to those who lost their jobs =
rose to an all-time high of 65 percent in September 2009. Over the course=
 of the recovery, however, this share has fallen steadily and has been be=
low its pre-recession average for the past two years, standing at 49 perc=
ent in April 2016. With the continuing improvement in the labor market, t=
he share of unemployed workers who recently entered the labor force has i=
ncreased, and has been noticeably above its pre-recession average in rece=
nt months. Moreover, the share of unemployment due to individuals volunta=
rily leaving their jobs has increased steadily as Americans feel more sec=
ure about their prospects in the labor market, reaching its pre-recession=
 average of 11 percent in April for the first time since 2008.**=20

*Chart2*




  * * Two-thirds of States have seen their unemployment rates fall below =
their pre-recession averages.* In April, the overall U.S. unemployment ra=
te stood at 5.0 percent, half its Great Recession peak and below its pre-=
recession average of 5.3 percent. As shown in the chart below, there was =
extremely wide variation in the effect of the Great Recession on unemploy=
ment across States and the District of Columbia, with increases ranging f=
rom nearly 200 percent (Nevada) to just 13 percent (Alaska) of their resp=
ective 2001-2007 averages. As of March 2016, however, 34 States have seen=
 their unemployment rates recover fully, with a number of States seeing u=
nemployment rates substantially below their pre-recession averages (inclu=
ding Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Oregon). The seventeen States=
 (and the District of Columbia) that still have elevated unemployment rat=
es include the six States that saw the largest percentage increases in un=
employment in the recession (Nevada, Florida, Alabama, Arizona, Delaware,=
 and Rhode Island) and several energy-producing States (Wyoming, Montana,=
 West Virginia, and Louisiana), where low energy prices have weighed on j=
ob growth in recent months. (Data on State-level employment and unemploym=
ent for each month are released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics several=
 weeks after the release of data at the national level.)=20



Chart3


  * * The Beveridge curvethe relationship between job vacancies and the u=
nemployment rateappears to have shifted outward in the recovery. *Named f=
or the British economist William Beveridge, the Beveridge curve plots the=
 relationship between job vacancies and unemployment. Since higher unempl=
oyment is usually associated with a lower level of vacancies (and vice-ve=
rsa), the curve is downward-sloping. While movements along the Beveridge =
curve indicate the position of the economy in the business cycle, shifts =
in the curve itself can be taken as an indicator of structural changes in=
 the process by which workers are matched with jobs, among other trends. =
The figure below plots the Beveridge curve using data from the BLS Job Op=
enings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) and the household survey. As can=
 be seen, the Beveridge curve has shifted outwards since the end of the G=
reat Recession, with a higher level of job openings for a given unemploym=
ent rate than was the case in the 2000s expansion. Some economists have s=
uggested that this outward shift does not represent a fundamental change =
in the economy but is due instead to increases in online job search, whic=
h have lowered the cost to employers of posting and maintaining job vacan=
cies. Other economists have raised concerns about workers ability to find=
 orchange jobs, which may have declined due to the rise in occupational l=
icensing [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/licensing_=
report_final_nonembargo.pdf ]or the potential growth of a skills mismatch=
 between workers and jobs. In any case, the decline in the unemployment r=
ate to below its pre-recession average has provided strong evidence again=
st concerns from earlier in the recovery that the apparent shift out in t=
he Beveridge curve represented a substantial increase in structural unemp=
loyment.=20

Chart4


  * * The distribution of job growth across industries in April was reaso=
nably similar to recent trends, with manufacturing and mining still facin=
g global headwinds but showing somewhat better growth in April compared t=
o the past year. *Above-average gains relative to the past year were seen=
 in industries such as financial activities (+20,000), professional and b=
usiness services (+56,000, excluding temporary help services), and privat=
e educational services (+16,000). On the other hand, several industries, =
including construction (+1,000), leisure and hospitality (+22,000), and r=
etail trade (-3,000) saw noticeably weaker-than-average growth. Manufactu=
ring posted a small increase in April (+4,000), while employment in minin=
g and logging, which includes oil extraction, continued to decline (-8,00=
0), though at a slower pace than in recent months. Both industries have s=
een cutbacks in recent months as a result of slow growth abroad and the d=
ecline in oil prices. Across the 17 industries shown below, the correlati=
on between the most recent one-month percent change and the average perce=
nt change over the last twelve months was 0.89, in line with the average =
correlation over the last year.=20

"As the Administration stresses every month, the monthly employment and u=
nemployment figures can be volatile, and payroll employment estimates can=
 be subject to substantial revision. Therefore, it is important not to re=
ad too much into any one monthly report, and it is informative to conside=
r each report in the context of other data as they become available."

who are unemployed due to involuntary job loss, while the share of the unem=
ployed who have either newly entered or reentered the labor force or left a=
 job voluntarily decreases. In the current business cycle, the share of une=
mployment attributable to those who lost their jobs rose to an all-time hig=
h of 65 percent in September 2009. Over the course of the recovery, however=
, this share has fallen steadily and has been below its pre-recession avera=
ge for the past two years, standing at 49 percent in April 2016. With the c=
ontinuing improvement in the labor market, the share of unemployed workers =
who recently entered the labor force has increased, and has been noticeably=
 above its pre-recession average in recent months. Moreover, the share of u=
nemployment due to individuals voluntarily leaving their jobs has increased=
 steadily as Americans feel more secure about their prospects in the labor =
market, reaching its pre-recession average of 11 percent in April for the f=
irst time since 2008.</span><strong><span style=3D"font-size: 12.0pt; font-=

ployment rate stood at 5.0 percent, half its Great Recession peak and below=
 its pre-recession average of 5.3 percent. As shown in the chart below, the=
re was extremely wide variation in the effect of the Great Recession on une=
mployment across States and the District of Columbia, with increases rangin=
g from nearly 200 percent (Nevada) to just 13 percent (Alaska) of their res=
pective 2001-2007 averages. As of March 2016, however, 34 States have seen =
their unemployment rates recover fully, with a number of States seeing unem=
ployment rates substantially below their pre-recession averages (including =
Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Oregon). The seventeen States (and t=
he District of Columbia) that still have elevated unemployment rates includ=
e the six States that saw the largest percentage increases in unemployment =
in the recession (Nevada, Florida, Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, and Rhode Is=
land) and several energy-producing States (Wyoming, Montana, West Virginia,=
 and Louisiana), where low energy prices have weighed on job growth in rece=

are released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics several weeks after the rele=

hifted outward in the recovery. </span></strong><span style=3D"font-size: 1=
2.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif; padding: 0in;">Named for the Brit=
ish economist William Beveridge, the Beveridge curve plots the relationship=
 between job vacancies and unemployment. Since higher unemployment is usual=
ly associated with a lower level of vacancies (and vice-versa), the curve i=
s downward-sloping. While movements along the Beveridge curve indicate the =
position of the economy in the business cycle, shifts in the curve itself c=
an be taken as an indicator of structural changes in the process by which w=
orkers are matched with jobs, among other trends. The figure below plots th=
e Beveridge curve using data from the BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover S=
urvey (JOLTS) and the household survey. As can be seen, the Beveridge curve=
 has shifted outwards since the end of the Great Recession, with a higher l=
evel of job openings for a given unemployment rate than was the case in the=
 2000s expansion. Some economists have suggested that this outward shift do=
es not represent a fundamental change in the economy but is due instead to =
increases in online job search, which have lowered the cost to employers of=
 posting and maintaining job vacancies. Other economists have raised concer=
ns about workers&#8217; ability to find or&nbsp;change jobs, which may have=
 declined due to the rise in <a href=3D"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/de=
fault/files/docs/licensing_report_final_nonembargo.pdf">occupational licens=
ing</a>&nbsp;or the potential growth of a skills mismatch between workers a=
nd jobs. In any case, the decline in the unemployment rate to below its pre=
-recession average has provided strong evidence against concerns from earli=
er in the recovery that the apparent shift out in the Beveridge curve repre=
sented a substantial increase in structural unemployment.</span></li>
