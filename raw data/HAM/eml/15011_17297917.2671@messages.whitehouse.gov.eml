THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

April 25, 2016



*FACT SHEET: White House Launches New $100 Million Competition to Expand =
Tuition-Free Community College Programs that Connect Americans to In-Dema=
nd Jobs*

**

""Every American, whether theyre young or just young at heart, should be =
able to earn the skills and education necessary to compete and win in the=
 21st century economy."

" President Barack Obama"



Today, the Vice President and Dr. Biden will highlight how communities ar=
e coming together to make education tuition-free for hard-working student=
s. This announcement celebrates the 27 new free community college program=
s that have launched in states, communities and community colleges and th=
e additional investment of $100 million for Americas Promise Job-Driven T=
raining grants (Americas Promise Grants) to connect more Americans to edu=
cation and in-demand jobs. The Vice President and Dr. Biden will make the=
se announcements at the Community College of Philadelphia, which modeled =
a free community college program after the Presidents Americas College Pr=
omise plan this time last year.



Americas more than 1,100 community colleges are the backbone of our natio=
ns postsecondary education and training system. They serve over 7 million=
 undergraduates, including many older, low- or moderate-income, minority,=
 first-generation, and rural Americans an opportunity to earn a quality, =
affordable degree or credential that meet the demands of a competitive gl=
obal economy. That is why President Obama has challenged communities to t=
ake action to grow the momentum for Americas College Promise, a plan to m=
ake two years of community college free for responsible students, letting=
 students earn the first half of a bachelors degree and the skills needed=
 in the workforce at no cost. And, in order to help communities accept th=
is challenge, he is calling on Congress take action on the America's Coll=
ege Promise Act, introduced by Senator Baldwin and Congressman Scott, whi=
ch would expand access to higher education for our nation's students.



Companies are choosing to grow in the U.S. in part because we have the mo=
st educated, creative, and adaptable workforce. Over the last six years, =
American businesses have created over 14 million new jobs. Of the new job=
s the economy is expected to generate over the next ten years, around hal=
f will require postsecondary education or training. The Presidents Job-Dr=
iven Training agenda has made federally supported education and training =
programs more responsive to employer needs. As part of this approach, com=
munity and technical colleges are playing a critical role in helping Amer=
icans get the skills to get good jobs. The $100 million Americas Promise =
Grants will help communities catalyze new and strengthen existing partner=
ships and programs to offer more Americans access to the knowledge and sk=
ills they need to pursue their educational and career goals, particularly=
 in high-growth sectors like technology, manufacturing, and health care.



These investments build on the Obama Administrations record of investing =
in students and the workforce. Since 2009, the Obama Administration has i=
nvested more than $70 billion dollars in support of community colleges in=
cluding over $66 billion in over 19 million Pell scholarships to help stu=
dents and families pay for college; $2 billion in Job-Driven Training Com=
munity College Grants to strengthen education and training programs that =
lead to in-demand employment and provide a ticket to the middle class at =
nearly half of the nations community colleges; and $1.6 billion in Title =
III and Title V to strengthen institutions capacity for providing student=
s an affordable, high-quality education. These critical investments have =
helped transform the role of community colleges as leading providers of h=
igh-quality, affordable, pathways for all Americans to work hard in pursu=
it of skills employers seek and of knowledge.



*"_Highlights from Todays Announcements:_"*

*""*


  * *$100 Million Americas Promise Grants*. Early this summer, the Admini=
stration will launch an H-1B funded grant competition by the Department o=
f Labor to create and expand innovative regional and sector partnerships =
between community colleges and other training providers, employers, and t=
he public workforce system to create more dynamic, tuition-free education=
 and training programs for in-demand middle and high-skilled jobs across =
the country. Built off the model of shared responsibility for educating t=
his nations students and workforce, Americas Promise Grants continue to b=
uild on the Administrations investments to strengthen education, training=
, and employer engagement.=20
  * *More than $70 million in New Investments Building Progress on Americ=
as College Promise for 40,000 Americans. *Since the launch of Americas Co=
llege Promise, state and local elected officials, community college leade=
rs, non-profits, business, and philanthropy have come together across the=
 country to expand free community college programs. Since President Obama=
 announced Americas College Promise, at least 27 new free community colle=
ge programs have launched in states, communities, and individual communit=
y colleges. Collectively, these new programs add over $70 million in new =
public and private investments to serve nearly 40,000 students at communi=
ty colleges.=20

*"_More Details on Todays Announcements_:"*


  * *$100 Million for Americas Promise Grants*=20

Today the Vice President announced a commitment to make $100 million avai=
lable through the Department of Labor to expand high quality education an=
d training programs that give Americans the skills most in-demand from re=
gional employers for middle- to high-skilled jobs. Grants will be awarded=
 to pilot and scale innovative tuition-free partnerships between employer=
s, economic development, workforce development boards, community and tech=
nical colleges and systems, training programs, K-12 education systems, an=
d community-based organizations that will strengthen the pipeline of Amer=
icans ready for in-demand jobs, bridge students educational opportunities=
 and employer needs, attract more jobs from overseas, and create more pat=
hways for Americans to reach the middle class through the following activ=
ities:

o "_Increase opportunities for all Americans_". With the rising costs of =
higher education, post-secondary education may feelout of reach for many =
Americans. Grantees will develop strategies to increase tuition-free oppo=
rtunities for unemployed, *underemployed, and low-income workers *to ente=
r skilled occupations and industries. Grantees will use and align existin=
g resources to help sustain and scale up programs.

o "_Expand employer engagement_"*. *These regional partnerships from empl=
oyers to support program design and delivery and identify skills and comp=
etencies needed to meet businesses needs. Employer partners will offer in=
novative ways for skills attainment through work-based learning and custo=
mized upskilling strategies to move low-skilled individuals up a career p=
athway with registered apprenticeship, paid-work experience, and paid int=
ernship opportunities.

o "_Strengthen education and training performance_". Grantees will reduce=
 the need for remediation, and increase skills development through eviden=
ce-based interventions. Grantees are encouraged to use evidence-based des=
igns that can increase the employability, employment, earnings, and educa=
tional outcomes of students, while supporting employers economic growth.


  * *More than $70 million in New Investments Building Progress on Americ=
as College Promise for 40,000 Americans.*=20

In his 2015 State of the Union, the President announced a vision for Amer=
icas College Promise to make two years of community college free, letting=
 responsible students earn the first half of a bachelors degree or earn s=
kills needed in the workforce at no cost by creating a new partnership wi=
th states. The program would require everyone to do their part: community=
 colleges must strengthen their programs and increase the number of stude=
nts who graduate, states must invest more in higher education and trainin=
g, and students must take responsibility for their education, earn good g=
rades, and stay on track to graduate.



Since then, state and local elected officials, community college leaders,=
 non-profits, business, and philanthropy from across the political spectr=
um and from all corners of the country are taking action, including throu=
gh todays release of a new PSA from the Heads Up America campaign [ https=
://youtu.be/pD2-Aa3ZSVk ].At least 27 new free community college programs=
 launched in states, communities, and individual community colleges since=
 the Presidents 2015 State of the Union address. Collectively, those new =
programs add over $70 million in new public and private investments to se=
rve nearly 40,000 students at community colleges.


  * Statewide programs include: Oregon, Minnesota and Rhode Island.=20
  * Local efforts span at least 12 states and include: College of the Sis=
kiyous (CA), Community College of Philadelphia (PA), Dabney Lancaster Com=
munity College (VA), Detroit (MI), Gateway Technical College (WI), Harper=
 College (IL), Ivy Tech (IN), Lone Star College (TX), Los Angeles (CA), M=
anistee County Commitment Scholarship (MI), Milwaukee Area Technical Coll=
ege (WI), Madison Area Technical College (WI), Mid-north Promise (IN), Mo=
have Community College (AZ), Oakland (CA), Richmond County (NC), Salt Lak=
e Community College (UT), San Diego Community College District (CA), Sant=
a Barbara City College (CA), Scotland County (NC), Sinclair Community Col=
lege (OH), Wichita Area Technical College (KS), Wisconsin Indianhead Tech=
nical College (WI), and Vance-Granville Community College (NC).=20

Additionally, a number of new legislative proposals have been made to exp=
and free community college programs. At the Federal level, Sen. Tammy Bal=
dwin (WI) and Rep. Bobby Scott (VA) proposed Americas College Promise Act=
 of 2015 for the countrys community and technical colleges  including His=
torically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutio=
ns  while 17 other states have proposed legislation to make community col=
lege free state-wide [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/04/25/states-=
and-local-leaders-join-push-free-community-college ]. Additionally, surve=
y data from the American Association of Community Colleges shows that a q=
uarter of community college presidents believe it is likely that their in=
stitutions will offer a tuition-free (or nearly free) program within the =
next two years, which would double the number of available tuition-free o=
ptions.



States and communities are demonstrating that there is a range of thought=
ful and effective ways to design a tuition-free Promise program customize=
d to address local and state knowledge and skills needs, funding opportun=
ities, and shared community goals. Nearly all these announced programs ha=
ve features that ensure hard-working students have a fair shot and stay o=
n track to graduate successfully. Key designs include:

o "_Supporting responsible high school graduates_ "by requiring participa=
nts to have graduated from high school and maintain at least a minimum gr=
ade point average (GPA). Americas College Promise designates a 2.5 GPA re=
quirement, which is comparable to many of these programs.

o "_Promoting more credit accumulation_" through full-time or at least pa=
rt-time enrollment to ensure that students are making progress towards co=
mpletion, which can increase the likelihood of completing on time and sav=
e students tuition.

o "_Requiring FAFSA completion_" to help students access federal, state, =
institutional, and private financial aid. Over 39 percent of community co=
llege students do not complete the FAFSA, even though they are likely to =
qualify for some form of aid. These provisions help ensure students recei=
ve the financial support they need to pursue their education and stay on =
track to complete a degree or credential. Tennessee Promises FAFSA requir=
ement helped lead to the greatest year over year increase at the state le=
vel, and helped Tennessee lead the country in FAFSA completion.

o "_Ensuring credits fully transfer_ "so that students are more likely to=
 cut down on redundant courses, reduce remediation, and stay on track to =
earn half of the credit they need for a four-year degree on-time if they =
choose to transfer.

*_Building on the Obama Administrations Investments in Community College =
to Strengthen Education and Job-Driven Training_*


  * *Increasing Investments in Scholarships for Students. *This Administr=
ation has invested over $66 billion in community colleges, providing over=
 19 million Pell scholarships to students attending community colleges; t=
his funding to community colleges represents over one-third of all Pell g=
rants. To continue improving and expanding these important investments, t=
he Administration will soon announce selected pilot sites who for the fir=
st time will offer up to $20 million in Federal Pell Grants for over 10,0=
00 high school students to pay for college courses typically provided by =
community colleges and put themselves on a fast-track to college completi=
on before even setting foot on campus. Evidence shows that dual enrollmen=
t programs help high school students earn better grades and increase thei=
r likelihood of college enrollment, persistence and completion. In additi=
on, to further strengthen community colleges, particularly for traditiona=
l underrepresented students, this Administration has invested $1.6 billio=
n in Title III and Title V programs.=20
  * *$2 Billion for 2,300 In-Demand Education and Training Programs at Co=
mmunity Colleges in all 50 States. *The Trade Adjustment Assistance Commu=
nity College and Career Training (TAACCCT) program, provided more than ha=
lf of our nations community colleges and other eligible institutions of h=
igher education with funds to partner with nearly 2,500 employers to expa=
nd and improve education and career training programs that help job seeke=
rs get the skills they need for in-demand jobs in industries such as info=
rmation technology, health care, energy, and advanced manufacturing. To d=
ate, nearly 300,000 participants have enrolled in these programs, earning=
 160,000 credentials. 40 states received grants that supported state-wide=
 systematic change by including all or most community colleges in the sta=
te. Select examples of successful partnerships, which have reached more t=
han 4,500 individuals, include:=20

o "_Motlow State Community College (MSCC) (TN)._" MSCC received $3.3 mill=
ion and partnered with Bridgestone Tire Company to develop a new mechatro=
nics training facility on-site at Bridgestone in Smyrna, TN. In addition =
to contributing to curriculum development, Bridgestone has contributed ov=
er $4 million towards renovations and equipment.

o "_Piedmont Technical College (PTC) (SC)._" As part of a consortium cons=
isting of 10 of the 16 public, two-year colleges in South Carolina and fu=
nded at nearly $20 million, PTC partnered with 37 employers to redesign a=
 new advanced manufacturing certificate program. Sixteen of the partnerin=
g companies and local county organizations collectively contributed $1.4 =
million to create the PTC Center for Advanced Manufacturing to support th=
e program.

o "_Alpena Community College (ACC) (MI)_": ACC received $2.8 million to i=
mplement the Sustainable Solutions for Northeast Michigan: Green Jobs and=
 Clean Energy project to build a statewide energy partnership network, wh=
ich included the Michigan National Guard and DTE Energy and Consumers Ene=
rgy, the two largest energy employers in Michigan as well as the state wo=
rkforce development board. This partnership network designed and implemen=
ted a Gas Energy Bootcamp, targeting unemployed people and returning vete=
rans. Program completers had a 96 percent employment rate.


  * *Launch of New Health Career Pathways Initiative [ https://www.whiteh=
ouse.gov/blog/2016/04/25/expanding-career-pathways-and-co nnecting-americ=
ans-healthcare-jobs ]: Business-Led Effort to Expand Career Pathways in H=
ealthcare Industry*. One of the key goals of the Americas Promise grants =
and other federal funding is to spur longer-term, industry led efforts to=
 prepare more people from all backgrounds for in-demand jobs. Today, lead=
ing healthcare employers are building on a career pathways framework deve=
loped with a $19.6 million Job-Driven Training Community College Departme=
nt of Labor grant to better match up training with their needs at a more =
national scale.=20

o "_Business-Led Task Force on Core Skills and Career Pathways._" The Adv=
isory Board Company will convene employers to agree on common ways to des=
cribe and measure the skills needed for healthcare jobs to focus training=
 on in-demand skills and help workers to translate the skills they alread=
y have to move between roles and employers. Initial members include: "Uni=
versity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Sutter Health, New York City Health=
 and Hospitals Corporation, Mercy Health West Michigan/Trinity Health, an=
d Fairview Health Services"

o "_Partnership with Communities to Adopt Common Skills and Career Pathwa=
ys for Healthcare Workers._" Brought together by Hope Street Group, seven=
 founding Health Career Pathway Communities composed of 15 healthcare sys=
tems, 11 community colleges and systems, 7 workforce boards, and 12 commu=
nity-based organizations will adopt common skill and career pathways and =
support more than 1,000 disadvantaged Americans with training and placeme=
nt into healthcare jobs with paid internships, career counseling, etc. HP=
Cs include: "Grand Rapids and Muskegon, MI; Denver, CO; Minneapolis, MN; =
Charlotte, NC; Bronx, Westchester and Hudson Valley, NY; New York City, N=
Y; and Sacramento, CA."


  * *Scaling Up What Works Across Federal Programs with A Job-Driven Chec=
klist Applied To Billions Of Training Dollars. *In July 2014, the Adminis=
tration laid out a Job-Driven Checklist of seven elements that matter mos=
t to get Americans into better jobs (e.g., strong employer engagement, wo=
rk-based learning, better use of labor market information, accountability=
 for employment outcomes). Since then, agencies have awarded over 15 comp=
etitive job-training grants that total more than $1.5 billion, with an ad=
ditional 12 competitive grants of more than $800 million to be awarded ov=
er the remainder of 2016 that incorporate the job-driven training element=
s. More details on progress can be found here [ https://www.whitehouse.go=
v/sites/default/files/docs/job-driven_training_and_apprenticeship_progres=
s_report.pdf ].=20
  * *Expanding learn and earn training opportunities through apprenticesh=
ips:* In September 2015, the Department of Labor awarded $175 million in =
American Apprenticeship Grants to 46 public-private partnerships that wil=
l help train more than 34,000 new apprentices in high-growth industries l=
ike health care, IT, and advanced manufacturing while scaling up proven p=
rograms. Earlier this month, DOL announced the newest investments for exp=

*_Budget Proposals to Connect More Americans to Training for In-Demand Jo=
bs_*

**


  * *Expand Innovative Tuition-Free Training Programs at Community Colleg=
es.*Building on the TAACCCT program, the Presidents Budget request includ=
es $75 million for a new American Technical Training Fund, which are comp=
etitive grants that support the development, operation, and expansion of =
innovative, evidence-based, short-term, or accelerated job training progr=
ams that enable students, particularly from low-income backgrounds, to ac=
cess tuition-free education and training leading to career pathways for j=
obs in high-demand fields. Projects would emphasize strong employer partn=
erships, work-based learning opportunities, accelerated training, and fle=
xible scheduling.=20
  * *Strengthening Partnerships between Businesses and Community Colleges=
 to Grow the Middle Class. *The Administration has proposed a new tax cre=
dit to incentivize employers to strengthen community and technical colleg=
es through contributions like designing curriculum, donating instructors =
and equipment, and creating job-based learning opportunities. Employers c=
an earn a one-time $5,000 tax credit for hiring a qualifying community co=
llege student graduate full-time. Altogether, this could help half a mill=
ion students access the training and jobs they need to succeed over the c=
ourse of five years.=20

  * *Helping More Americans Complete College Affordably. Along with Conti=
nuing To Index The Pell Grant To Ensure It Keeps Pace With Inflation, *th=
e Administration is calling for significant new investments in the federa=
l Pell Grant programthe cornerstone of college affordability  with two ne=
w Pell proposals that will help students accelerate progress towards thei=
r degrees and increase their likelihood of on-time completion. These two =
proposals include Pell for Accelerated Completion, which would allow full=
-time students to take courses in a third semester, and On-Track Pell Bon=
us, which offers $300 for students to take 15-credits, which would accele=
rate progress towards a degree. In fiscal year 2017, these changes would =
mean an additional $2 billion in Pell Grants for students working toward =
their degrees.=20

  * *$3 Billion Talent Compact to Keep and Attract Jobs to the U.S. *The =
Presidents Budget proposes competitive funding to create over 50 Talent H=
otspots. These would consist of employers, training programs, and workfor=
ce leaders that prioritize one sector and make a commitment to recruit an=
d train the workforce to help businesses grow and attract more jobs from =
overseas. This proposal would produce a pipeline of about half a million =
skilled workers over five years.=20

 highlight how communities are coming together to make education tuition-fr=

han 1,100 community colleges are the backbone of our nation&#8217;s postsec=
ondary education and training system. They serve over 7 million undergradua=
tes, including many older, low- or moderate-income, minority, first-generat=
ion, and rural Americans an opportunity to earn a quality, affordable degre=
e or credential that meet the demands of a competitive global economy. That=
 is why President Obama has challenged communities to take action to grow t=
he momentum for America&#8217;s College Promise, a plan to make two years o=
f community college free for responsible students, letting students earn th=
e first half of a bachelor&#8217;s degree and the skills needed in the work=
force at no cost. And, in order to help communities accept this challenge, =
he is calling on Congress take action on the America's College Promise Act,=
 introduced by Senator Baldwin and Congressman Scott, which would expand ac=

t because we have the most educated, creative, and adaptable workforce. Ove=
r the last six years, American businesses have created over 14 million new =
jobs. Of the new jobs the economy is expected to generate over the next ten=
 years, around half will require postsecondary education or training. The P=
resident&#8217;s Job-Driven Training agenda has made federally supported ed=
ucation and training programs more responsive to employer needs. As part of=
 this approach, community and technical colleges are playing a critical rol=
e in helping Americans get the skills to get good jobs. <span>The $100 mill=
ion America&#8217;s Promise Grants will help communities catalyze new and s=

09, the Obama Administration has invested more than $70 billion dollars in =
support of community colleges including over $66 billion in over 19 million=
 Pell scholarships to help students and families pay for college; $2 billio=
n in Job-Driven Training Community College Grants to strengthen education a=

 to the middle class at nearly half of the nation&#8217;s community college=
s; and $1.6 billion in Title III and Title V to strengthen institutions&#82=

These critical investments have helped transform the role of community coll=

ncentivize employers to strengthen community and technical colleges through=
 contributions like designing curriculum, donating instructors and equipmen=
t, and creating job-based learning opportunities. Employers can earn a one-=
time $5,000 tax credit for hiring a qualifying community college student gr=
aduate full-time. Altogether, this could help half a million students acces=
s the training and jobs they need to succeed over the course of five years.=

 towards their degrees and increase their likelihood of on-time completion.=
 These two proposals include Pell for Accelerated Completion, which would a=
llow full-time students to take courses in a third semester, and On-Track P=
ell Bonus, which offers $300 for students to take 15-credits, which would a=
ccelerate progress towards a degree. In fiscal year 2017, these changes wou=
