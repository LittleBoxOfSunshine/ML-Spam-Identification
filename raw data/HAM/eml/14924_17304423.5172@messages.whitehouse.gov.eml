THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 13, 2016

**

*U.S.-Nordic Leaders Summit Joint Statement*

**

Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the United States reaffirm=
 our deep partnership based on shared fundamental values.

Democracy, the rule of law, gender equality, respect for human rights, an=
d the protection and equal treatment of all people without regard to race=
, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity unite the No=
rdic countries and the United States and serve as a natural basis for our=
 cooperation. Transparency, accountability and good governance, strong ma=
rket economies, free trade, shared prosperity, open space for civil socie=
ty, and sustainable development are keys to political stability and socia=
l well-being. We reaffirm our commitment to pursue these values and objec=
tives and to work together to encourage other countries to do the same.=20=




Building on the U.S.-Nordic meeting in 2013 in Stockholm, today we have p=
ledged to deepen our cooperation on key international issues related to s=
ecurity and defense; migration and refugees; climate, energy and the Arct=
ic; and economic growth and global development. __

*_Security and Defense_***

The Nordic countries and the United States stress the importance of uphol=
ding the European security order and the fundamental principles of intern=
ational law. Our countries are committed to strengthening investments in =
defense and military capabilities, as well as in diplomacy and regional c=
ooperation, commensurate with a more challenging security environment. Th=
e Nordic countries greatly value the United States' commitment to Europe =
and its security. NATO remains key to transatlantic and European security=
, and the contributions of Sweden and Finland, including those they make =
as NATO enhanced opportunity partners, are highly valuable. The United St=
ates, Denmark, Iceland, and Norway are committed to building on NATOs enh=
anced opportunity partners framework in order to promote a close politica=
l dialogue and military cooperation between Finland and Sweden and NATO A=
llies (28+2). Through their overlapping memberships in NATO and the EU, t=
he Nordic states, and the United States take measures to increase regiona=
l security that are mutually reinforcing and contribute substantially to =
stability in Europe. The Nordic countries and the United States strongly =
support closer cooperation between NATO and the EU, and consider new area=
s of practical cooperation between the two to be a priority for the NATO =
Summit in Warsaw in July.=20

We share with the Baltic States an interest in strengthening the security=
 and stability of the Baltic Sea region. The United States welcomes Nordi=
c Defense Cooperation and intends to support its initiatives, including p=
articipation in training, exercises, and creative frameworks that deepen =
regional ties and promote security. We commit to improving our individual=
 and collective capacity to withstand hybrid threats and to leverage appr=
opriate political, economic, and military tools to strengthen national an=
d regional resilience. In anticipation of the NATO Summit in Warsaw, Denm=
ark and Norway are prepared to join the United States in contributing to =
enhanced allied forward presence. Concrete contributions will be develope=
d in consultations with NATO allies in preparation for the NATO Summit.

The United States and the Nordic countries share a firm conviction that t=
here can be no compromises over the international security order and its =
fundamental principles. Russias illegal occupation and attempted annexati=
on of Crimea, which we do not accept, its aggression in Donbas, and its a=
ttempts to destabilize Ukraine are inconsistent with international law an=
d violate the established European security order. The United States and =
the Nordic countries reaffirm our support for Ukraines sovereignty and te=
rritorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. Europe=
 and the United States have reacted firmly to Russia's violations of inte=
rnational law in Ukraine. Sanctions against Russia for its actions in eas=
tern Ukraine cannot be lifted until Russia fully implements its Minsk com=
mitments. Our Crimea-related sanctions are also to remain in force until =
Russia returns this territory to Ukrainian control.

We expect the Ukrainian government to redouble efforts to adopt and imple=
ment effective reforms. The United States and the Nordic countries will c=
ontinue to assist Ukraine actively in this effort. We strongly support th=
e EUs Eastern Partnership.

The United States and the Nordic countries are concerned by Russias growi=
ng military presence in the Baltic Sea region, its nuclear posturing, its=
 undeclared exercises, and the provocative actions taken by Russian aircr=
aft and naval vessels. We call on Russia to ensure that its military mane=
uvers and exercises are in full compliance with its international obligat=
ions and commitments to security and stability. Our countries recognize t=
he need for an appropriate dialogue with Russia to be maintained to enhan=
ce transparency and reduce risk, and to address issues of common concern,=
 including the counter-ISIL campaign and ongoing efforts to negotiate an =
end to the conflict in Syria.

The United States and the Nordic countries are committed to partnering to=
gether to strengthen international security and address global issues bey=
ond Europe. Global stability requires determined steps to address the pro=
blems faced by fragile states and to address the root causes of conflict =
and instability. We together recognize Sweden's leadership on the Interna=
tional Dialogue for Peacebuilding and Statebuilding and acknowledge that =
the worlds poorest and most vulnerable are increasingly concentrated in f=
ragile states. We reaffirm our shared commitment to work together to prom=
ote resilient, democratic societies and to address the drivers of state f=
ragility. We share a long-term commitment to stabilization and developmen=
t in Afghanistan and are working to bolster the Afghan government and its=
 security forces, maintain international support for Afghanistan, and enc=
ourage the Taliban to join a meaningful and inclusive peace process with =
the Afghan government. Denmark will further strengthen its contribution t=
o NATO's Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan to around 100 military p=
ersonnel and has also decided to sustain its financial support to the Afg=
han National Defense and Security Forces with $15 million annually until =
2020, setting a strong example for the international community heading in=
to the NATO Summit in Warsaw. Achieving a negotiated settlement to the wa=
r in Syria is an immediate and pressing issue. The United States and the =
Nordic countries have a common aim in stabilizing the situation in Mali a=
nd the Sahel region as well as in Somalia and the Horn of Africa. The lon=
g-term stability of the Middle East requires that key players assume thei=
r responsibilities to make progress on Middle East peace. The situation o=
n the ground shows the urgent need for a negotiated two-state solution, w=
hich remains the only way to achieve a sustainable, long-term peace betwe=
en Israelis and Palestinians. Norway, as chair of the Ad Hoc Liaison Comm=
ittee, will continue its efforts to support a sustainable Palestinian eco=
nomy as a critical component of a political solution.

Terrorism and violent extremism are major challenges for the internationa=
l community. The United States and the Nordic countries intend to work to=
gether to counter these threats as well as to address their root causes. =
As members of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, our collective aim is=
 to degrade the capabilities of and to defeat Daesh. We confirm our conti=
nued engagement in all lines of effort in the Coalitions fight against Da=
esh in Iraq and Syria and in advancing stabilization, civilian support, a=
nd humanitarian aid in the region.

Denmark will redeploy F16 fighter jets, a C130J transport aircraft, and m=
ake additional troop contributions, including special operation forces, f=
or operations in Iraq and Syria. Denmark will also support stabilization =
efforts in Iraq and Syria with at least $40 million over the next three y=
ears, and has pledged $47 million in 2016 for humanitarian relief in Syri=
a. Finland is enhancing its contribution to Operation Inherent Resolve in=
 Iraq by providing up to 100 training staff in the fall of 2016. Finland =
is committing $29 million for humanitarian relief in Syria in 2016. From =
the beginning of the crisis, Finnish humanitarian assistance has amounted=
 to more than $120 million. Norway has stepped up its military contributi=
on to the coalition against ISIL, and will continue to train Iraqi soldie=
rs and will deploy a contingent of around 60 soldiers that will provide t=
raining, advice and operational support to Syrian local forces fighting I=
SIL. Norway has recently pledged $1.2 billion over 4 years in humanitaria=
n aid to Syria and has pledged $24 million to stabilization efforts, incl=
uding $3.1 million in 2016 for demining in Iraq. Sweden is contributing m=
ilitary trainers in Iraq, has provided over $400 million in humanitarian =
aid to Iraq and Syria since 2011, and has committed $200 million in devel=
opment assistance to address the Syrian crisis over 5 years. The US is le=
ading the global coalition to counter ISIL and is the largest contributor=
 of stabilization and humanitarian assistance to Iraq and Syria, most rec=
ently announcing an additional $155 million in humanitarian relief for Ir=
aq and contributing over $600 million for Syria, as announced at the rece=
nt London Conference.

The United States and the Nordic countries will continue to work together=
, exchange information, and share experiences on preventing and counterin=
g violent extremism. Nordic and U.S. local officials and civil society le=
aders plan to exchange best practices for local CVE programming. We encou=
rage Nordic and U.S. cities to join the Strong Cities Network in order to=
 share their experiences and reach out to other cities around the world. =
We also encourage youth to join the Youth Civil Activism Network to find =
innovative ways to counter violent extremism.

Civilian support and stabilization in post-conflict countries must addres=
s the humanitarian hazards posed by landmines and unexploded ordnance (UX=
O). Building on the U.S.-Norwegian Demining Initiative for Colombia, The =
United States and Nordic countries commit to establishing a new U.S.-Nord=
ic partnership to support the removal of such weapons, making post-confli=
ct communities safer and setting the stage for recovery and development. =
The United States and Nordic countries encourage other countries as well =
as private sector participants to join this new partnership. Nordic count=
ries commit to provide more than $13 million toward UXO removal in Syria =
and Iraq, with a focus on efforts in Ramadi and other areas liberated fro=
m ISIL.=20

Cyberspace issues, including cybersecurity, the application of internatio=
nal law and norms in cyberspace, and Internet governance pose pressing an=
d continuously evolving challenges. We acknowledge that cyber threats und=
ermine our collective ability to use the Internet to bolster economic gro=
wth and development around the world. In cyberspace, just as elsewhere, s=
tates have a special responsibility to promote security, stability, and e=
conomic ties with other nations. In support of that objective, we affirm =
that no state should conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of =
intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential busi=
ness information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to =
companies or commercial sectors. We also endorse the 2015 report of the U=
N Group of Governmental Experts in the Field of Information and Telecommu=
nications in the Context of International Security, affirm that existing =
international law, in particular the UN Charter, applies to state conduct=
 in cyberspace, and commit ourselves to the view that all states should a=
bide by voluntary and non-binding norms of responsible state behavior in =
cyberspace during peacetime.=20

Major progress has been made in promoting crisis management  both militar=
y and civilian  as highlighted by the Leaders' Summit on UN peacekeeping =
in September 2015. The United States and the Nordic countries intend to c=
ontinue to engage in making UN peace operations more effective, efficient=
 and responsive, based on the recommendations of the High-Level Independe=
nt Panel on Peace Operations. Preventive action and peacebuilding are ess=
ential.

Women's full and meaningful participation in all aspects of social and po=
litical life is key to sustainable peace, security and development. The N=
ordic countries and the United States believe that gender equality and th=
e empowerment of all women and girls are important goals in their own rig=
ht, as well as powerful instruments for building human capacity and promo=
ting social and political stability. The United States and the Nordic cou=
ntries will continue empowering women and highlighting the importance of =
womens active participation in conflict prevention and resolution, peace =
processes, mediation, peacemaking, peacekeeping, humanitarian response, a=
nd post-conflict reconstruction as set forth in UNSCR 1325 and its progen=
y. Both the Nordic Women Mediators Network and the Nordic Centre for Gend=
er in Military Operations are valuable contributions. We reaffirm the imp=
ortance of making all efforts to prevent gender-based and sexual violence=
, to support victims, and to hold perpetrators to account in order to red=
ress the culture of impunity that often surrounds such acts of violence. =
The United States and the Nordic countries encourage partners to join the=
 initiative Call to Action on Protection from gender-based Violence in Em=
ergencies, for which Sweden recently took over the chairmanship from the =
United States. We are committed to strengthening the UN Peace and Securit=
y Agenda.

Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation are major areas for coop=
eration for the United States and Nordic countries. Our countries are com=
mitted to working together in promoting nuclear security, disarmament and=
 non-proliferation. Building on the achievements of the 2016 Nuclear Secu=
rity Summit, the United States and the Nordic countries intend to work to=
gether within the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency,=
 INTERPOL, the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and the Glob=
al Partnership to promote improvements in nuclear security and to counter=
 nuclear smuggling. We are committed to full implementation of UN Securit=
y Council Resolution 1540 on preventing the proliferation of weapons of m=
ass destruction to non-state actors. The United States and Nordic countri=
es intend to continue to show leadership toward minimizing the use of hig=
hly enriched uranium in civilian applications. The destruction of Syrias =
declared chemical weapons was an important achievement in which cooperati=
on between the United States, Denmark, Finland, and Norway played a promi=
nent role, and we continue to press Syria with respect to omissions and d=
iscrepancies in its declaration. We share a common view on the importance=
 of implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran. Norway=
 contributed to the removal of Irans low-enriched uranium in December 201=
5.=20

The Nordic countries and the United States support the objectives set out=
 in the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) and commit to assist a numbe=
r of developing countries to meet their obligations under international h=
ealth regulations, including by developing and assisting with implementat=
ion of a national plan to achieve the targets of the GHSA. In this regard=
, the United States will assist at least 31 countries, and Nordic Countri=
es will collectively assist 10 countries. The United States and Nordic Co=
untries will also support Joint External Evaluations, developed under the=
 leadership of the United States and Finland, including by providing tech=
nical and/or financial assistance.

The United States and the Nordic countries reaffirm our support for the U=
N and for mediation, conflict prevention and peacebuilding, as well as fo=
r the development of peacebuilding and peacekeeping operations. The U.S.N=
ordic Security Dialogue continues to be an important forum for deliberati=
ons on these issues.__

*_Migration and Refugees_***

Today the number of irregular migrants, refugees, and internally displace=
d people is on a scale unprecedented since World War II. This is a global=
 challenge requiring a comprehensive and systematic response. The United =
States and the Nordic countries commit to work together to meet urgent hu=
manitarian needs and promote solutions that deal with the root causes of =
irregular migration, address associated challenges such as human smugglin=
g and trafficking, and seek global solutions that promote respect for the=
 right to seek and attain asylum, taking into account regional responsibi=
lity-sharing arrangements.=20

Legal pathways to immigration and orderly refugee resettlement are a supe=
rior alternative to irregular migratory movements, and also reduce risks =
of discrimination and abuse to members of more vulnerable groups such as =
older persons, persons with disabilities, women, and children.

Nordic countries and the United States are world leaders in humanitarian =
response and have historically taken in a large share of refugees. We int=
end to maintain our humanitarian record and to advance measures to make t=
he international humanitarian response more effective, efficient and full=
y able to respond to todays challenges. Further, the United States is com=
mitted to working alongside Europe in dealing with the global refugee and=
 migration crisis and by addressing its root causes. Support to the regio=
ns hardest affected by the refugee crisis is one of the most effective co=
mponents of a sustainable solution.

There is a clear link between forced displacements and the lack of good g=
overnance, rule of law and respect for human rights. We emphasize the res=
ponsibility of states to protect their populations from genocide, crimes =
against humanity, ethnic cleansing, and war crimes.

There is a fundamental need to strengthen humanitarian response, to fashi=
on a long-term approach to managing migration and recurring and protracte=
d crises and to identify global solutions based on responsibility sharing=
 and respect for international human rights. The World Humanitarian Summi=
t in May, the UN High-Level Meeting on Addressing Large Scale Movements o=
f Refugees and Migrants, and the U.S.-led Leaders' Summit on Refugees in =
September are excellent opportunities for addressing humanitarian challen=
ges and irregular migration, and advancing concrete and comprehensive sol=
utions for vulnerable refugee populations. __

*_Climate Change, Energy and the Arctic_***

The leaders recognize that climate change is one of the foremost challeng=
es the world is facing. No effort should be spared in making concrete pro=
gress domestically and abroad over the coming decades by shifting to low =
carbon economies and creating more resilient communities. The United Stat=
es and the Nordic countries acknowledge the foundational role energy play=
s in our economies and that energy security is key for overall security.

Building on a history of collaboration, the United States and the Nordic =
countries commit to strengthening European energy security and to join an=
d implement the Paris Agreement, accelerate the transition to a clean ene=
rgy future, strengthen adaptation efforts, especially in developing count=
ries, protect and restore forests, and continue to take science-based ste=
ps to protect the Arctic and its peoples.=20

"Energy Security"

The United States and the Nordic countries agree that a well-functioning,=
 integrated and efficient European energy market is important to producin=
g economic prosperity and energy security. Diversified supply sources and=
 routes are a prerequisite for an efficient energy market and the securit=
y of Europes energy supply. We support the EU goal of increased diversifi=
cation of supply sources and routes, increased indigenous and sustainable=
 production, greater levels of interconnection, and enhanced energy effic=
iency. We also support the efforts of EU countries to further improve the=
 functioning of the market, including by establishing more infrastructure=
 to enhance the efficiency of the market and by developing a more effecti=
ve regulatory framework to promote energy security and support diversific=
ation of fuel types, sources, and routes for energy imports. These steps =
are preconditions for energy security, affordable energy and an effective=
 climate policy in Europe.

"Implementing the Paris Agreement "

The leaders commit to join the Paris Agreement as soon as possible. Norwa=
y, Iceland, and the United States have committed to join the Paris Agreem=
ent this year, building on more than 30 countries that have already joine=
d or have committed to taking necessary domestic steps with a view to joi=
ning this year. As countries implement their respective Nationally Determ=
ined Contributions, they should strive to formulate and communicate long-=
term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies pursuant to the P=
aris Agreement.=20

The United States and the Nordic countries are committed to working with =
developing country partners to assist in strengthening their adaptation a=
nd mitigation efforts. We intend to make every effort to enhance the effe=
ctiveness of adaptation assistance by coordinating support for adaptation=
 planning and action in appropriate fora, including the National Adaptati=
on Plans Global Network. The United States and the Nordic countries recog=
nize the potential for the effects of climate change to exacerbate confli=
ct and fragility in vulnerable countries and share the view that foreign =
policy instruments must contribute to addressing this challenge effective=
ly. We commit to prioritizing the prevention of compound risks stemming f=
rom climate fragility and to better integrating consideration of those ri=
sks into foreign, defense, and development policies, planning, and assist=
ance programs.=20

The United States and the Nordic countries commit to provide leadership o=
n climate finance. Following the Paris Agreement, it is critical to scale=
 up support to developing countries to implement their respective Nationa=
lly Determined Contributions, including by using public resources to mobi=
lize robust increases in private capital.=20

The United States and the Nordic countries will also work together to inf=
orm robust accounting for the use of international carbon markets, includ=
ing a new offset program under the UNFCCC, to ensure the environmental in=
tegrity and to avoid the double counting of market-based mitigation actio=
ns.

"Cooperation on Clean Energy"

The world is facing a dual challenge: we need to meet the increased energ=
y demand following a growing population and economic growth and at the sa=
me time, we need to reduce the emissions. A comprehensive change in the g=
lobal energy system is required in order to reduce emissions. The United =
States and the Nordic countries will be at the forefront of efforts to de=
velop cleaner energy systems, renewable energy, including renewable fuels=
, increased energy efficiency and technologies for cleaner energy product=
ion.

The leaders also intend to cooperate and use their influence in multilate=
ral development banks and international financial institutions to decreas=
e their carbon footprint by promoting an increase in their investments in=
 renewable energy and energy efficiency. We will also advocate for public=
-private partnerships and the mobilization of private capital to finance =
climate investments and the transition to clean energy, including clean e=
nergy systems and other instruments mentioned in the Nordic declaration o=
n innovative climate finance.

The United States and the Nordic countries are committed to promoting the=
 aims of the Clean Energy Ministerial and Mission Innovation and to imple=
ment ambitious energy transitions to accelerate the deployment of clean e=
nergy sources. In particular, we intend to provide resources, and politic=
al support to establish a multilateral secretariat, including a financial=
 contribution of $1.3 million from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, =
and $1 million from the United States, along with continued, extensive su=
pport for Clean Energy Ministerial initiatives and campaigns.=20

Given the growing importance of offshore wind to their clean energy futur=
e, the United States and several Nordic countries commit to collaborate t=
o increase the deployment of offshore wind in the United States and Europ=
e. To formalize their collaboration, the Government of Denmark and the U.=
S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management are announcing a new memorandum of u=
nderstanding (MOU) to strengthen cooperation on offshore wind energy. The=
 MOU highlights important priorities for cooperation and information shar=
ing between the countries related to best practices for managing offshore=
 wind, effective regulatory approaches, protection of the environment, an=
d strategies to encourage expansion of offshore wind energy development. =
The MOU builds on ongoing U.S. engagement with Denmark on offshore wind.=20=




"Enhancing Climate Action through International Fora"

""

The United States and the Nordic countries intend to support enhanced cli=
mate action by working together to achieve ambitious outcomes within inte=
rnational fora such as the Montreal Protocol and International Civil Avia=
tion Organization (ICAO). In particular, the United States and Nordic cou=
ntries affirm their commitment to adopt a Montreal Protocol HFC phasedown=
 amendment in 2016, and intend to provide additional support through the =
Protocols Multilateral Fund following adoption of an amendment for its im=
plementation. The United States and Nordic countries plan to continue to =
support a range of activities that promote alternatives to hydrofluorocar=
bons (HFCs) with high global warming potential and to promote greener tec=
hnologies in all countries.=20

The leaders also express their strong commitment to work together and thr=
ough the ICAO to reduce international aviations climate impact by fosteri=
ng technological and operational advancements, development and deployment=
 of sustainable alternative jet fuels, and adopting a strong global marke=
t-based measure (GMBM) to enable carbon neutral growth from 2020. They en=
courage world leaders to join them in supporting adoption at ICAOs fall 2=
016 Assembly of a GMBM that reflects environmental integrity and avoids m=
arket distortion.

The United States and Iceland reaffirm their support for the Global Geoth=
ermal Alliance launched during COP21 in Paris - a concerted effort by gov=
ernments, international agencies and the private sector to promote wider =
penetration of geothermal in the global energy mix.

"Combatting Methane Emissions"



The leaders reconfirm our commitment to combat methane emissions as part =
of our commitment to implement the Paris Agreement, and in line with othe=
r international commitments and national priorities, by ensuring each cou=
ntry has developed a national methane reduction plan or otherwise identif=
ied and implemented enhanced actions to significantly reduce our overall =
methane emissions, and by expanding technical cooperation, where appropri=
ate.. We are determined to continue to drive down our oil and gas methane=
 emissions, where applicable, through sound regulation, climate targets, =
and voluntary initiatives. In particular, we strongly encourage companies=
 working within our countries to develop company-wide methane reduction g=
oals, and to join the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) Oil & Gas Me=
thane Partnership. The Nordic countries welcome the announcement of new U=
.S.-Canadian methane reduction goals from the oil and gas sector, and ple=
dge to keep their respective methane emissions from this sector at or bel=
ow current levels. The Nordic countries will also encourage other countri=
es to join in this effort and would support the development of a global m=
ethane emission goal for this sector. We encourage other countries to do =
the same, and intend to communicate on our progress through international=
 fora, such as the CCAC, Global Methane Initiative and the Arctic Council=
.

"Collaboration on the Important Role of Forests"



The Paris Agreement reflected the importance of forests and other lands i=
n addressing global climate change. The United States and the Nordic coun=
tries are determined to cooperate to support and incentivize developing c=
ountry forest partners to conserve, restore and sustainably manage forest=
s, as well as strengthen their respective efforts to combat illegal loggi=
ng and associated trade, thereby contributing to the implementation of Na=
tionally Determined Contributions by both reducing forest emissions and e=
nhancing sequestration. The United States and the Nordic countries will a=
lso collaborate to facilitate private sector efforts to eliminate defores=
tation from the production of commodities such as palm oil, pulp and pape=
r, cattle and soy. Today, the US and Norway are announcing that they will=
 sign a joint statement to reinforce their intention to enhance cooperati=
on on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+=
) and sustainable landscapes. As a signal of their commitment, this week =
the United States announced the first results and a detailed action plan =
to reduce emissions and increase carbon storage in soils and forests thro=
ugh the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Building Blocks for Climate=
 Smart Agriculture and Forestry. Through this initiative, USDA committed =
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon stored in forests =
and soils by over 120 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent pe=
r year by 2025.

"Promoting Energy for All"



The Nordic countries and the United States commit to further strengthen e=
fforts to achieve global access to sustainable, reliable, affordable and =
secure modern energy for all, consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustain=
able Development. This work will be pursued through a range of initiative=
s, including development support to mechanisms which seek to unlock inves=
tments in sustainable energy, such as through Power Africa as well as the=
 Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA). We also commit to work to fur=
ther strengthen the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative throug=
h support to the ongoing process of developing a new strategy for SE4All =
and its implementation. In addition, the United States and the Nordic cou=
ntries intend to promote access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and =
modern energy for all by encouraging the reduction of fossil fuel subsidi=
es, promoting renewable energies and fuels, and enhancing energy efficien=
cy.=20

In sub-Saharan Africa alone, more than two-thirds of the population is wi=
thout access to power. To support a doubling of electricity access in sub=
-Saharan Africa the United States and Nordic countries have expressed our=
 support for the Power Africa initiative and commit to work together to p=
rovide technical assistance, financing, and other support to enable addit=
ional investment in energy projects throughout the region. Since the laun=
ch of the Power Africa initiative in 2013, the Government of Sweden has c=
ommited to catalyze investments of one billion dollars to Power Africa. T=
he commitment represents grants for distribution and transmission project=
s, and guarantees and loans for renewable Power Africa projects. In Decem=
ber 2015, Power Africa announced a new partnership with Norway, which ali=
gns the collective investments of the United States and Norwegian governm=
ents in renewable energy and expands off-grid and mini-grid efforts. Thro=
ugh this partnership, Norway is committing to bringing 1,500 MW online ov=
er a five-year period, contributing to Power Africa's overall 30,000 MW e=
lectricity generation goal.=20

"The Arctic"

The United States, the Kingdom of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and =
Sweden affirm our commitment to safeguarding the Arctic environment while=
 providing enhanced opportunities for sustainable development for all inh=
abitants of the Arctic, including indigenous peoples.

The Arctic is rapidly changing and attracting global attention. It is a g=
lobally unique region that provides livelihoods for its inhabitants, but =
is also one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. Rich with o=
pportunities for transport, tourism, energy, and innovation, the Arctic i=
s characterized by close cooperation on a broad range of issues between t=
he United States and the Nordic Countries, together with our Arctic partn=
ers Canada and Russia. Continuing to keep the Arctic region a zone of pea=
ce and stability is at the heart of our efforts. We reaffirm the importan=
ce of maintaining the Arctic region based on universally recognized princ=
iples of international law including those reflected in the United Nation=
s Convention on the Law of the Sea.=20

The Arctic Council celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, reaffirming=
 its commitment to cooperation and coordination on matters of common inte=
rest among the Arctic States and indigenous peoples of the region. As the=
 preeminent high-level forum among the Arctic States, the Arctic Council =
has proven instrumental in addressing new challenges and opportunities, w=
hile retaining a core focus on environmental protection and sustainable d=
evelopment.

The United States and Nordic countries will continue to work actively in =
the Arctic Council to ensure progress on shared priorities. The work of t=
he current U.S. chairmanship and subsequent Finnish and Icelandic chairma=
nships will be closely coordinated to ensure effective progress on these =
priorities.=20

We will strengthen our work, both within the Arctic and globally, to addr=
ess the environmental challenges facing the region. We remain committed t=
o managing the region with an ecosystem-based approach, which balances co=
nservation and sustainable use of the environment. We are committed to th=
e pursuit of international and national climate change goals. We will wor=
k towards the highest global standards, best international practice, and =
a precautionary approach, when considering new and existing commercial ac=
tivities in the Arctic, including oil and gas operations.=20

The United States and the Nordic countries are committed to recognizing t=
he rights of the indigenous and local peoples and we reaffirm our commitm=
ent to the unique role played by Arctic indigenous and local communities =
and their traditional and local knowledge.

We will advance scientifically based protection and conservation of areas=
 of ecologically important marine, terrestrial and freshwater habitats, t=
aking into account ecological resilience in a changing climate and nation=
al and global climate and environmental goals. We are dedicated to promot=
e the active involvement of the people of the Arctic in the management an=
d sustainable use of protected areas.=20

We are committed to deepen the knowledge and understanding of the Arctic,=
 both inside and outside the region, to strengthen Arctic research and tr=
ansdisciplinary science, and to encourage cooperation between higher educ=
ation institutions and society as well as synergies between science and t=
raditional and local knowledge. The Nordic countries welcome the White Ho=
use Arctic Science Ministerial.

*_Jobs, Growth and Trade_***

Economic freedom, open markets, and free trade are fundamental to maintai=
ning prosperity and promoting welfare for our citizens. The Transatlantic=
 economy is strong, and will remain at the core of the global economy. To=
gether, the United States and the Nordic countries will continue to be a =
strong voice for open and sustainable trade and investments, and in parti=
cular commerce that embraces women's economic empowerment, innovation, an=
d new technology. The Nordic region is among the largest foreign investor=
s in the United States.

Digitization and sustainable production have the potential to contribute =
to more competitive economies and to strengthen our industrial sectors. T=
he United States and the Nordic countries will continue to show leadershi=
p in R&D, innovation, digitization, the provision of platforms for new te=
chnology, and the launch of start-ups, all of which create jobs, enhance =
competitiveness and pave the way for improving our businesses and societi=
es. Innovation is also central to targeting key challenges, including cli=
mate change, health, gender inequality, and urbanization. Ultimately, inn=
ovation is about finding ways to achieve sustainable growth and sustainab=
le societies. The United States and the Nordic countries will together pr=
omote innovation, including through the Nordic Innovation House in Silico=
n Valley.

We share the view that the multilateral trade system is crucial for the g=
lobal economy and our intent is to work to bring the benefits of free tra=
de and open economies to all. The United States and the European Union ar=
e working to complete negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investm=
ent Partnership (T-TIP) in 2016. We also look forward to exploring ways t=
o bolster trade and investment among the United States, Norway, and Icela=
nd. Deepening transatlantic ties through trade and investment is in our e=
conomic as well as our strategic interests. The conclusion of an ambitiou=
s and comprehensive agreement would lower barriers, create opportunities =
for small businesses, and boost economic growth and job creation through =
exports in the United States and Europe. It would also benefit the global=
 economy and further increase economic integration.=20

The United States and the Nordic countries have committed to promote prod=
uctive employment and decent work as key elements to spreading the benefi=
ts of globalization and reducing poverty. We are resolved, in line with t=
he 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, to reduce inequality within a=
nd among countries. Rising inequalities have a negative impact on current=
 and potential growth. We also recognize that promoting gender equality a=
nd increasing womens labor market participation rates are important eleme=
nts of sustainable growth.

The Nordic countries and the United States have always enjoyed intensive =
people-to-people contacts and exchanges. We share a joint desire to boost=
 these contacts further and to enhance collaboration in innovation, highe=
r education and research.=20

*_Global Development and Humanitarian Assistance_***

2015 marked a pivotal year for global development. World leaders from mor=
e than 190 countries adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,=
 which sets out a global development vision and priorities for the next 1=
5 years, and adopted the Paris Agreement, the most ambitious climate chan=
ge agreement in history. Sustainable global development is fundamental fo=
r peace and prosperity, and is inseparable from democracy, human rights a=
nd good governance.=20

We are fully committed to support the global effort to achieve the 2030 A=
genda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda). The United States and th=
e Nordic Countries reaffirm the universality of the 2030 Agenda, and comm=
it to implementing it, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)=
 and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, both domestically and internationally=
. The United States and the Nordic Countries also commit to continue to w=
ork together, and individually, to support the efforts of developing coun=
tries to reach the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including by=
 enhancing developing countries ability to mobilize and effectively use t=
heir domestic resources and to attract private sector investment for sust=
ainable development.

To protect development gains and respond to urgent humanitarian needs, th=
e Nordic countries and the United States intend to maintain a high-level =
of humanitarian assistance, including in response to drought, floods and =
other climatic shocks exacerbated or induced by the El Nino and the La Ni=
na phenomena, with special emphasis on the needs of women and girls and v=
ulnerable groups within any affected population.

Gender equality is a central human right and a development issue. The Uni=
ted States and the Nordic Countries have a longstanding commitment to pro=
mote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, particularly=
 adolescent girls around the world who are held back from reaching their =
full potential. We will support efforts to ensure that adolescent girls a=
re provided opportunities to continue their education. We will continue t=
o promote the empowerment of women and girls by enhancing representation =
and opportunity especially through global education and health, as well a=
s advancing and protecting their health and their sexual and reproductive=
 rights. Additionally, reducing the barriers to education - such as lack =
of access, early pregnancy, the contraction of HIV/AIDS and other disease=
s, as well as harmful practices such as early and forced marriage and fem=
ale genital mutilation/cutting  is critical to advancing the shared forei=
gn policy, security and development priorities of the United States and N=
ordic countries.

Universal human rights belong to all individuals regardless of sexual ori=
entation or gender identity. The United States and the Nordic countries w=
ill work together in multilateral fora and at the national level to promo=
te the protection of LGBTI people, ensuring that they can enjoy the same =
rights as everyone else.

The United States and the Nordic countries are committed to high levels o=
f development cooperation, and intend to work to catalyze further private=
 investments for sustainable development.=20

The United States and the Nordic countries are committed to leading by ex=
ample to fight corruption and promote transparency and accountability. We=
 will support countries in efforts to combat illicit financial flows and =
help build capacity for civil society to aid in the fight against corrupt=
ion. Tax evasion and corruption undermine development and drain public re=
sources, and are fundamental development issues. As an important part of =
financing for development, the United States and Nordic countries will wo=
rk together to support the Addis Tax Initiative and we will support devel=
oping countries in their efforts to strengthen domestic resource mobiliza=
tion, including through enhanced taxation and new efforts to combat tax e=
vasion.

The relationship between the United States and the Nordic countries runs =
deep. Our nations share a history of extensive societal ties that firmly =
bind us together. Through these strong personal and institutional bonds w=
e will continue to promote our common commitment to freedom, democracy, u=
niversal human rights, and peace.
