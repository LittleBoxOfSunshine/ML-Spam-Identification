At last night=92s Americans for Prosperity =93Road to Reform=94 event in Ne=
w Hampshire, Jeb Bush said<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DRy_fRjLyE68&fe=
ature=3Dyoutu.be> =93we need to figure out a way to phase out=94 Medicare f=
or future enrollees.
Today, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, DNC Vice Chair and Chairman=
 of the New Hampshire Democratic Party Hon. Ray Buckley, Alliance for Retir=
ed Americans Executive Director Rich Fiesta, and Hampton, NH Senior Lenore =
Patton held a press call to respond. Here are a few excerpts from the call:
DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz:
=93Once again, Jeb Bush has shown that he just doesn=92t get it on the issu=
es that matter to middle class families. Maybe Jeb Bush can afford to get b=
y without Medicare. I=92m sure the Koch brothers would be fine too. But mil=
lions of Americans are counting on Medicare when they retire for access to =
quality, affordable health care. I am sick and tired of Republicans who say=
 that the only way to save Medicare is to destroy it. But my frustration is=
 nothing compared to what it must be like for hardworking Americans who hav=
e their peace-of-mind and well-being threatened every time Republicans want=
 to score a few political points.=94

DNC Vice Chair and Chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party Hon. Ray =
Buckley:

=93This is just the latest chapter in a long book of Republicans trying to =
destroy Medicare or turn it over to corporations. Nearly the entire Republi=
can field supported Paul Ryan=92s efforts to end Medicare as we know it. An=
d Jeb Bush just made it crystal clear. Bush also said last night that he th=
inks phasing out Medicare will be a quote-unquote =93winning argument.=94 I=
=92m happy to take that bet. Not here in the Granite State.=94
Alliance for Retired Americans Executive Director Rich Fiesta:
=93Jeb Bush=92s campaign is starting to look like something out of a Dicken=
s novel. Saying you=92re going to phase out a successful program is not jus=
t cruel, it=92s short-sighted. On the same day that the Medicare trustees s=
aid that the program will be solvent through 2030, and just a week before w=
e celebrate the program=92s 50th anniversary, Jeb Bush says we need to phas=
e the program out. We can=92t afford to have someone in the White House who=
 would dismantle a program that has worked for 50 years and is helping Amer=
icans.=94
NH Senior Lenore Patton:


=93I am frustrated that Jeb wants to phase out Medicare. I thought this fig=
ht was over when President Obama was elected and our country rejected the R=
omney-Ryan plan to privatize Medicare. Seniors like me have worked hard the=
ir whole lives, supported their families, given back to their communities. =
It=92s clear Jeb Bush doesn=92t get it. Calling for phasing out Medicare an=
d repealing the Affordable Care Act, which has saved seniors money, is not =
what we need.=94
