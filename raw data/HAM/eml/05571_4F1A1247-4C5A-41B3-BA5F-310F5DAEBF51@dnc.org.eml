The DNC is neutral in the primary.

The DNC Chair has repeatedly said on the air and otherwise that it=92s not =
her job to tell either candidate to get out and has never called for anyone=

most-primary-debates-889d8ab42ca#.qepssg11f> overall this year than they di=
d in past cycles. And as NBC knows all too well, when we were able to get b=
oth campaigns to agree, we added four.


The rules in place for this election have been pretty much the same for sev=
eral cycles. In fact, the major change from 2008 =96 when Obama beat Clinto=
n --- is that there are actually LESS unpledged =93super=94 delegates, now =
down to 15% from 20% prior to the change. No one wrote or rewrote any rules=
 to help or hurt any specific candidate, these are the Party rules.



The single biggest factor determining the nominee (85%) is the participatio=
n of voters in primaries and caucuses. You can see a post we did here that =
lays out the facts on Super Delegates<https://medium.com/@patricetaylor/her=
e-are-the-actual-facts-about-super-delegates-7660c5c7dd1#.288n079v7>. It al=

The DNC=92s delegate selection rules for this primary were set before any o=

 several cycles =96 including 2008 when Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clint=

Off the Record: There=92s just no evidence that the process has been rigged=
