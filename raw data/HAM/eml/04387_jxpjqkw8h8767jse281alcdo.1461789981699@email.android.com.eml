Hello T.J.

I am sorry I didn't get a chance to meet you when you were in Flint for the=
 debate but maybe we will meet at the Democratic Convention.

I am contacting you because Bankole Thompson Editorial Columnist at The Det=
roit News and host on Detroit's newest radio station Superstation 910 am ( =
he is a former host on WDET public radio in Detroit where he interviewed th=
e chair on what was then an overcrowded Republican field of candidates and =
the difference between that race and the Democratic race) would like to int=
erview Rep. Schultz on his show Friday April 29, 2016. He would like to dis=
cuss the recent caucuses as well as Ted Cruz's decision to name Carly Fiori=
na as his running mate and their attraction to potential voters.

Redline airs every Friday from 12:00m-2:00pm. We would prefer to have her a=
t 1:00pm as that is our most listened to hour but we will take her anytime =
she is available during the show. If she is not available this week, perhap=
s she could join us next week.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter,

Karen Morgan
Producer
