Let us know what you think

TITLE: Democrats are ready for the general elections, thanks in part to joi=
nt victory funds
BYLINE: Brad Marshall


There has been a lot of misinformation about the joint victory funds the DN=
C has established to help fund our general election efforts. As someone who=
 has managed the finances of the Party for more than two decades, I can tel=
l you the criticisms are flat out wrong.

When I started working at the Democratic National Committee, the office was=
 smaller, the computers were bigger, and if I wanted to talk through campai=
gn finance, it meant blocking off a couple hours and heading down to the FE=
C to physically pull and copy records.

Since then, there have been a whole lot of changes. But like then, we are s=
till using joint victory funds to make sure that every Democrat has the res=
ources they need to succeed in November.

This year, we have established joint victory funds with both the Clinton an=
d the Sanders campaigns, which is exactly what we did with the Obama campai=
gn in 2012, with both the Obama and Clinton campaigns in 2008, [I DON'T THI=
NK THAT THE DNC DID A JOINT FUNDRAISING COMMITTEE WITH CLINTON IN 2008, BUT=
 MY PARALEGAL IS CHECKING - CC'D HERE] with the Kerry campaign in 2004, and=
 with our other Democratic committees in the 90s. [I BELIEVE THIS IS ACCURA=
TE, BUT KATE IS ALSO VERIFYING THAT THERE WERE 1990S JFCS WITH THE DNC]. Yo=
u get the picture. Under these agreements LIKE THESE, our candidates can fu=
ndraise simultaneously for their campaigns, for the DNC, and for the state =
parties that do so much work to support down-ballot Democrats. [THE KERRY A=
ND OBAMA 2008 VICTORY FUNDS DID NOT INCLUDE STATE PARTIES - SO I CHANGED IT=
 TO AGREEMENTS "LIKE THESE' BUT AS A FLAG, WE SHOULD NOT SAY THAT ALL JFCS =
INCLUDE STATE PARTIES. JFCS CAN BE BETWEEN ANY COMMITTEES - LIKE A CAMPAIGN=
 AND A LEADERSHIP PAC, AND NOT ALL OF THE DNC JOINT FUNDRAISING COMMITTEES =
HAVE INCLUDED STATE PARTIES]. And yes, these funds are absolutely allowed b=
y the Federal Elections Commission.

As I said, there has been a lot of confusion and misinformation about the j=
oint victory funds, so I want to correct a few points.


1. Joint Victory Funds are building our general election nest egg
Millions of dollars that we WILL USE have earmarked for the general electio=
n are sitting in the bank AT OUR JOINT FUNDRAISING COMMITTEE, ready to be d=
istributed to state parties (and, for what it's worth, to the DNC) once the=
 general election is officially underway . [I PROPOSED A DELETION HERE AS H=
VF HAS OBVIOUSLY MOVED SOME MONEY TO THE DNC AND STATE PARTIES ALREADY, AND=
 WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO BEFORE THE CONVENTION, SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE WAN=
T TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE USING THESE FUNDS NOW - THEY =
WILL JUST BE USED TO PREPARE FOR THE GENERAL, SOME OF WHICH WILL HAPPEN NOW=
, AND SOME LATER].  You may have heard that state parties are only keeping =
1% of the money being raised by Joint Victory Funds, but that's misleading =
[I THINK WE NEED TO BE STRONGER HERE THAN MISLEADING - "FALSE" "NOT CORRECT=
"]. It ignores the money that is being kept for general election needs. IT =
ALSO IGNORES THAT SOME STATE PARTIES HAVE SENT FUNDS TO THE DNC FOR THE DNC=
 TO PAY FOR KEY INFRASTRUCTURE EXPENSES THAT THE DNC MAKES ON BEHALF OF THE=
 ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO HELP CAMPAIGN, STATE PARTIES, AND CANDIDATES UP=
 AND DOWN THE BALLOT. As more coordinated campaigns -[I PROPOSED A CHANGE H=
ERE BECAUSE 'COORDINATED CAMPAIGNS' ARE NOT TECHNICALLY A THING - THEY ARE =
JUST WHAT WE CALL WHAT THE STATE PARTIES DO - AND I THINK IT IS A LITTLE TO=
O INSIDE BASEBALL THAT PEOPLE WON'T UNDERSTAND].  WORK STARTS TO BE DONE BY=
 THE DNC AND STATE PARTIES TO PROVIDE A home base for Democrats working and=
 volunteering TO SUPPORT THE PARTY AND HELP ELECT presidential, statewide, =
and local candidates - are established, that money will pay for staff and o=
ffice space.

l-MY&e=3D> Caption: VP Biden brings pizza for campaign staff and volunteers=
]


2. Joint Victory Funds pay for resources the state parties need
You probably know that the DNC manages a massive amount of voter data that =
everyone from our presidential campaigns down to candidates running for loc=
al office can leverage in their races. But that costs a lot of money, and t=
he staff and vendors who manage that data are paid by the DNC. The DNC is a=
lso building the tools and staff to manage complex rapid response, communic=
ations, and digital organizing needs - again, we pay for it, and give the t=
ools and resources to down-ballot Dems. FUNDS THAT THE DNC RECEIVES FROM JO=
INT VICTORY FUNDS, AND MONEY THAT THE STATE PARTIES RECEIVE FROM VICTORY FU=
NDS AND SEND TO THE DNC, HELP PAY FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE JUST LIKE THI=
S.

3. Joint Victory Funds are legal
It might sound strange coming from the guy who manages the Democratic Party=
's money, but I believe that putting commonsense limits on the amount of mo=
ney any one person can give to a candidate or political party is good for o=
ur democracy. And that's also one of the good things about joint victory fu=
nds - they have a lot of legal limitations in place that help to keep the a=
mount of money we raise under control and ensure that every dollar gets rep=
orted. [I WONDER IF THIS JUST WON'T RING TRUE GIVEN THE HUGE AMOUNTS HVF CA=
N ACCEPT - MAYBE INSTEAD WE GO FOR THE TRANSPARENCY ANGLE?  - SOMETHING LIK=
E THIS: IT MAY SOUND STRANGE COMING FROM THE GUY WHO MANAGES THE DEMOCRATIC=
 PARTY'S MONEY, BUT I BELIEVE THAT ROBUST CAMPAIGN FINANCE RULES AND COMMON=
SENSE LIMITS ARE GOOD FOR OUR DEMOCRACY.  THE PRACTICES ALLOWED AFTER CITIZ=
ENS UNITED WHERE CORPORATIONS OR BILLIONAIRES CAN SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS=
 TO SUPPORT THEIR CANDIDATES AND ALSO DO IT WITH DARK MONEY COMPLETELY IN S=
ECRET ARE COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. JOINT FUNDRAISIN=
G COMMITTEES DO NOT WORK LIKE SUPER PACS OR OTHER SECRET WAYS TO MOVE HUGE =
AMOUNTS OF MONEY INTO POLITICS. EVERY DOLLAR THAT COMES IN TO A JOINT FUNDR=
AISING COMMITTEE, WHO GAVE IT AND WHERE IT GOES IS FULLY REPORTED TO THE FE=
C, AND THE SAME CONTRIBUTION LIMITS AND PROHIBITIONS ON CORPORATE MONEY THA=
T APPLY TO CAMPAIGNS AND THE PARTY NORMALLY, ALSO APPLY TO JOINT FUNDRAISIN=
G COMMITTEES - IT JUST ALLOWS CAMPAIGNS AND ALL MANY DEMOCRATIC PARTY COMMI=
TTEES TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE STRONGEST ORGANIZATION POSS=
IBLE GOING INTO THE 2016 ELECTION. ANY ALLEGATIONS THAT THERE MAY BE SOMETH=
ING FISHY ABOUT OUR JOINT FUNDRAISING JUST ARE NOT TRUE.

But you don't have to trust me: Plenty of experts in campaign finance and e=
lection law have looked at the criticism of the DNC's use of joint victory =
funds and found they're pretty standard. One wrote of the criticisms, "lega=
lly, this seems weak."

The general election will be here before we know it, and I'm resting easier=
 knowing that we have built the tools and saved the money we need to come o=
ut of the gate as strong as possible. If you care about electing Democrats,=
 you should feel that way, too.

mittee

DNC manages a massive amount of voter data that everyone from our president=
ial campaigns down to candidates running for local office
 can leverage in their races. But that costs a lot of money, and the staff =
and vendors who manage that data are paid by the DNC. The DNC is also build=
ing the tools and staff to manage complex rapid response, communications, a=
nd digital organizing needs - again,
 we pay for it, and give the tools and resources to down-ballot Dems.&nbsp;=

 one person can give to a candidate or political party is good for our demo=
cracy. And that&#8217;s also one of the good things about joint victory fun=

the amount of money we raise under control and
 ensure that every dollar gets reported.&nbsp;</span><span style=3D"font-si=

 DO NOT WORK LIKE SUPER PACS OR OTHER SECRET WAYS TO MOVE HUGE AMOUNTS OF M=
ONEY INTO POLITICS. EVERY DOLLAR THAT COMES IN TO A JOINT FUNDRAISING COMMI=

AME CONTRIBUTION LIMITS AND PROHIBITIONS
 ON CORPORATE MONEY THAT APPLY TO CAMPAIGNS AND THE PARTY NORMALLY, ALSO AP=
