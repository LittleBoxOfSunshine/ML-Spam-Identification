UNITY PARTY: DONALD TRUMP and PAUL RYAN will meet next week, the two sides announced on Friday, just a day after Ryan, the House Speaker, said he couldn't yet back his party's presumptive nominee for president. 

Ryan's office said he invited Trump to meet with him and other members of House Republican leadership and that they will get together on Thursday in Washington. Separately, Ryan and Trump will also meet with Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, POLITICO's Rachael Bade reports.  

Ryan's office pegged it as an opportunity for unity. But Trump on Friday appeared to still be stinging from Ryan's initial rejection. "He's doing it under the banner of unity, when in actuality that's the opposite of unity," Trump said of Ryan. "I've also had many people say that I'm better off, but I don't believe that. I think we should have unity. I think it would be better to have him. But it's just too bad. Many people think I'm better off. Who knows?"

Here are four more things we're watching today. 

2) G(MEN) CHAT: The FBI has talked to top HILLARY CLINTON aides about her email and private server, POLITICO's Josh Gerstein reports, including top aide Huma Abedin. The news was first reported by CNN on Thursday. The investigation is, if nothing else, a continued distraction for Clinton's campaign and a bogeyman for Republicans. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c350b15d00a5bd24e2d62c8e9ea30a129996c147ce79a50d494 CBS reported Friday that Clinton herself was set to talk to be interviewed by the FBI. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c359595c68018dd8ae91913fea02ea621487fb39774d81da996 Clinton's campaign had no comment on either report other than to say, "From the start, Hillary Clinton has offered to answer any questions that would help the Justice Department complete
 its review, and we hope and expect that anyone else who is asked would do the same," campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said. "We are confident the review will conclude that nothing inappropriate took place."

3) RYAN REVERB: Even as PAUL RYAN and DONALD TRUMP announced they would meet next week, the reverb from Ryan's comments continued: Trump seemed to suggest that Ryan was not fit to be Speaker http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c35acfca971606ff47552a348525c74ffe2b2e015bf88250c1c Ryan found backing from 2012 GOP nominee MITT ROMNEY, who also said he would not support Trump. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c35473c3fc19a8c13a9841f7c64d8eeef748711b748bd88fcc6 Sean Hannity accused Ryan of leading a "circular firing squad." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c35fa4265903433485b6f01acd4a569a11b9ddc7884b4c36809 Ryan's primary opponent also said he would back Trump. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c35f4dec22f9eba2e74972fdf221b39e33a9bf56bd028b01eb5 And on it went: JEB BUSH said he wouldn't vote for DONALD TRUMP either. 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c35c16fe5ca20a1bcf9a5eafe29fb8c40fa0503ea94c68b58fa 

BLAST NOTE: Want to know how all this started? POLITICO's Jake Sherman has a fascinating tick-tock on how Ryan came to his decision. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c35ae38d763adf204877691ff0302f66e3b8566cb4b3c59cd94 

4) MAY DAZE: BERNIE SANDERS is poised for a big May, posing a nuisance to HILLARY CLINTON even if she's still on track to march to the Democratic nomination. POLITICO's Daniel Strauss reports the calendar tilts in Sanders' favor, starting with West Virginia, which votes on May 10. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c35df223b5715802830613519cea10df0d0c8ac3fe6ba3b715b The likely victories are part of Sanders' reason for staying the race. And he's fighting for his spot: He also accused the Democratic National Committee of stacking the Philadelphia convention in Clinton's favor by appointing Clinton loyalists to key committee seats. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c35dbea1c2acb7231194e01b82442e13dcc2e5851dd623051c6 Meanwhile, both sides prepare to scrap for delegates on
 Saturday in Guam, which has a caucus. 

5)   BENGHAZI A LONG TIME: Rep. Trey Gowdy, whose House Select Committee on Benghazi could yet provide political fodder against HILLARY CLINTON, blames the Obama administration for dragging out the committee's work. In an interview with POLITICO's Rachael Bade, Gowdy said it is not a matter of Congressional Republicans wanting to drag the investigation into November's election. "It's taken way too long and way too much of our energy in simply gaining access," Gowdy said. "There continues to be time wasted negotiating with executive branch entities who do not want to give us what I believe Congress is entitled to." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c35a727cbb50cd3703ea3649015861c16b30ee70c141f7f4adc 

TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Reince Priebus is pretty sure. HILLARY CLINTON is looking for Rangers. BERNIE SANDERS could mount a floor fight and Wisconsin may be a November battleground. CHRIS CHRISTIE gets a hand. 

LEND ME YOUR EARS: The Blast recommends a new POLITICO podcast the, appropriately titled, Nerdcast. Listen to the best insights from our colleagues here: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c3567fee8895c96bb48e7414421748324d551f52d1ecf3add40 

SHOCK SURVEY: DONALD TRUMP has the most aggressive supporters on the Internet, a survey shows. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c351600bfc7d46f749fa28c0b978e10bd1df55148a23a2f516a 

SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE! RNC Chairman Reince Priebus says it's "highly doubtful" someone other than DONALD TRUMP is the GOP nominee. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c35be7cd7254cca0b6c24cdaf77b31b78976e61af035ff5cd5c 

CHRISTIE'S AUCTION: DONALD TRUMP will hold a fundraising rally in New Jersey to help CHRIS CHRISTIE get rid of his presidential debts. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c354f341327fcf1b977a062f0d93e661bf8358299ad1b2ec73b 

ON WISCONSIN: HILLARY CLINTON staffs up in Wisconsin, indicating she thinks it's a swing state. (Journal-Sentinel) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c352d7fe5850d5d46af35e39d82870a0a39fcd6014f4990b7cb 

HILL RAISING: Brooklyn is looking at raising money from former Bush donors, arguing that HILLARY CLINTON is a better return on investment than DONALD TRUMP. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c35749b504a645dd7fd98ec1af649b91dc4967eb58d1b6bcc67

IN MODERATION: HILLARY CLINTON's brain trust is also puzzling over how to reach out to Republican voters unenthused by Trump's rise. (The New York Times)  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c3588f9d954d744f4901316397387ecafded8e5653e4425e60b 

MODIFIED BERN: BERNIE SANDERS has won more than enough delegates to create some havoc - though not wrest away the nomination - at the convention. (USA Today) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c359b51e956b7ef236b004d7fb86f90846e6b2feeb677c1f437 

WHAT'S NEXT: DONALD TRUMP campaigns in Washington state on Saturday. HILLARY CLINTON and BERNIE SANDERS focus on West Virginia ahead of Tuesday's vote. But first: Guam Democrats caucus on Saturday.

THEY SAID IT: "My view is just relax and be gracious and I'll talk to Paul and we'll try to work on this." - RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, preaching calm between DONALD TRUMP and PAUL RYAN. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=d60f49e48bd42c35fcaa90a72e29f802da4c119c8f01582daee27593e4d12b5d 

MAGIC NUMBER: 12. That's the number of delegates available for BERNIE SANDERS and HILLARY CLINTON in Guam.
