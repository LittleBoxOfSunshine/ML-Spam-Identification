MATTHEWS: "But when you run for president, will you release your income tax returns?" TRUMP: "You know, it's something I haven't even thought of, but I certainly, I guess, as I get closer to the decision, which I'll probably make in February, it's something I will be thinking of. They're very big.  They're very complex.  But I would probably have -- I probably wouldn't have a problem with doing it." [Hardball, MSNBC, 11/18/99]

Trump Said Mitt Romney Was "Hurt Really Very Badly" By Not Releasing His Income Tax Returns And That Romney Should Have Released Them By April 1. VAN SUSTEREN: "Your prediction on South Carolina?" TRUMP: "It's going to be very close. I think Mitt was hurt really very badly by this whole thing with the income tax returns. I believe he should have given them April 1, but I didn't think going into a little bit of detail without going into a lot of detail was positive thing. He'll come back. He has proven to be very resilient guy." [On the Record, Fox News, 1/18/12]



2012: Trump Said "Historically," Presidential Candidates Released Their Tax Returns By April 1. VAN SUSTEREN: "Has Governor Romney been boxed on this tax return thing, and if he called you up tonight and said, Donald what should I do about tax return thing, should I release them or not?" TRUMP: "I think first answer would have been good. It should have been delivered a certain way. But April 1st historically is the time that everybody gives them." VAN SUSTEREN: "I hear April 1, I think of April Fool's Day." TRUMP: "OK, make it April 2nd." [On the Record, Fox News, 1/18/12]



TRUMP SUGGESTED IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE HIDING SOMETHING IF YOU DID NOT RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS



Trump: "If You Didn't See The Tax Returns, You Would Think There Is Almost Like Something Wrong. What's Wrong?" TRUMP: "It's sort of like, you know, when we are talking about the tax returns if you didn't see them - and the tax returns look like they're fine. But if you didn't see the tax returns, you would think there is almost like something wrong. What's wrong?" [Hannity, Fox News, 1/26/12]



2015: TRUMP REPEATEDLY SAID HE PLANNED ON RELEASING TAX RETURNS



Trump Said He Would Release Tax Returns, But He Would Also Explain To People He Had Been In The Business Of Making Money. HEWITT: "Would you release tax returns, though?" TRUMP: "I would release tax returns, and I would also explain to people that as a person that's looking to make money, you know, I'm in the business of making money until I do this." [Hugh Hewitt Radio, 2/25/15<http://www.hughhewitt.com/donald-trump-on-2016-and-trolling-the-gop/>]



*         Trump: "I Have No Objection To Certainly Showing Tax Returns." TRUMP: "But we'll take a good, strong look at that, Hugh. I mean, it's obviously not something I thought of, but you know, I've given any real thought to, but I have no objection to certainly showing tax returns." [Hugh Hewitt Radio, 2/25/15<http://www.hughhewitt.com/donald-trump-on-2016-and-trolling-the-gop/>]



April 2015: Trump: "I Want To Tell You Right Now I Have No Problem With Giving My Tax Returns But I Would Tell You Upfront A Stupid Person, A Really Stupid Person Is Paying A Lot Of Taxes." TRUMP: "I want to tell you right now I have no problem with giving my tax returns but I would tell you upfront a stupid person, a really stupid person is paying a lot of taxes. If you are in business -- again I'm in business for myself and for my family. I want to take care of my kids. I give a lot of money to charity. And I am proud of the fact as a businessman I want to pay as little tax as possible." [Special Report with Bret Baier, 4/10/15]



October 2015: Trump Said He Would Release His Tax Rate "At Some Point... But I Pay As Little As Possible. I'm Very Proud To Tell You." TRUMP: "But you know what, and I'm very honest on my tax returns." STEPHANOPOULOS: "What is your tax rate?" TRUMP: "I'm not going to say, but at some point, I'll release it. But I pay as little as possible. I'm very proud to tell you." [This Week, ABC, 10/4/15]



FEBRUARY 2016: TRUMP SAID HE WAS WORKING ON RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS AND WOULD DO SO IN THE COMING MONTHS, IT WAS JUST TIME-CONSUMING BECAUSE THEY WERE SO LONG ...



February 2016: Trump Said He Would Release His Tax Returns "Over The Next Three, Four Months. We're Working On Them Very Hard. And They Will Be Very Good." DICKERSON: "Your tax returns, when are we going to see them?" TRUMP: "I would say, over the next three, four months. We`re working on them very hard. And they will be very good."  [Face the Nation, CBS, 2/14/16]



February 2016: Trump Said His Tax Returns Were "Extremely Complicated" And It Would Take A Little While To Release Them. WALLACE: "New question, new subject. When are you going to release your tax returns?" TRUMP: "Well, we're having them made. They're extremely complicated. It's going to take a little while. I don't know if you ever saw the picture I gave, but I gave you a picture with about 2 1/2 feet of tax returns standing in front of me as I was signing. They're having them done. And we'll do at the appropriate time." [Fox News Sunday, Fox News, 2/21/16]



... BUT THEN CLAIMED HE COULD NOT RELEASE THEM AT ALL BECAUSE HE WAS BEING AUDITED, BUT HE WOULD RELEASE THEM WHENEVER THE AUDIT WAS FINISHED ...



2/25/16: Trump Said He Wanted To Release His Tax Returns, But He Could Not Release Them While He Was Under A Routine Audit. HEWITT: "Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube, that you would release your tax returns." TRUMP: "True." HEWITT: "Are you going back on your commitment?" TRUMP: "No, I'm not. First of all, very few people listen to your radio show. That's the good news." (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: "Let me just tell you, let me just -- which happens to be true. Check out the ratings. Look, let me just tell you something. Let me just tell you something. I want to release my tax returns but I can't release it while I'm under an audit. We're under a routine audit. I've had it for years, I get audited. And obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return. As soon as the audit is done, I love it." [Republican Primary Debate, Houston TX, 2/25/16]



Trump Said He Had "No Problem With Releasing Tax Returns" And Would Release Them As Soon As He Was Finished Being Audited. TODD: "Why not release the tax returns that aren't involved in the audit?" TRUMP: "Because it's a link. I have very big tax returns. I'm sure you've seen the picture where the returns are literally..." TODD: "OK." TRUMP: "-- from the floor to up to here." TODD: "Will you ---" TRUMP: "They're extremely complex." TODD: "-- do you think you can do..." TRUMP: "I get audited..." TODD: "-- it before the election, though?" TRUMP: "I hope so. I'd like to. I have no problem with releasing tax returns." TODD: "Do you pledge to do it before the election?" TRUMP: "Excuse me. Sure, if -- if -- if the auditors finish. I'll do it as fast as the audit is finished. Remember this, I've already given my financials. And my financials show I'm worth more than $10 billion by any stretch of the imagination." TODD: "Gotcha." TRUMP: "Has tremendous cash, tremendous cash flow. You don't learn much from tax returns. But I would love to give the tax returns but I can't do it until I'm finished with the audit." [Meet the Press, NBC, 5/8/16]



NO LAWS ACTUALLY PREVENTED TRUMP FROM RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS WHILE UNDER AUDIT, AND EARLIER YEARS OF RETURNS HAD ALREADY BEEN CLEARED



HEADLINE: "Trump's Tax Lawyers Say 2002-2008 Returns No Longer Under Audit." [Bloomberg, 3/31/16<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-31/trump-s-tax-lawyers-say-2002-2008-returns-no-longer-under-audit>]



The IRS Confirmed That Audits Would Not Prevent An Individual From Sharing Their Own Tax Information. "Donald Trump says he isn't releasing his tax returns yet because they are being audited, though the Internal Revenue Service says that's no barrier to disclosure.  In a statement Friday, the IRS said that federal privacy rules prohibit the agency from discussing individual tax matters, but 'nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information.'" [USA Today, 2/26/16<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/02/26/donald-trump-internal-revenue-service-audits/80996086/>]



Trump Claimed He Could Not Release The Tax Returns That Were Not Being Audited Because They Were All Linked Together. TODD: "Why not release the tax returns that aren't involved in the audit?" TRUMP: "Because it's a link. I have very big tax returns. I'm sure you've seen the picture where the returns are literally..." TODD: "OK." TRUMP: "-- from the floor to up to here."

5/10/16: TRUMP SAID HE WOULD NOT RELEASE HIS TAXES AT ALL BEFORE NOVEMBER AND THAT THE TAXPAYERS DID NOT NEED TO SEE THEM



5/10/16: Trump Announced He Did Not Plan On Releasing His Tax Returns Before November, Claiming There Was Nothing Voters Could Learn From Them. "Despite pressure, the billionaire also doesn't expect to release his tax returns before November, citing an ongoing audit of his finances. He said he will release them after the audit ends. But he said that he wouldn't overrule his lawyers and instruct them to release his returns if the audit hasn't concluded by November. 'There's nothing to learn from them,' Trump told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday. He also has said he doesn't believe voters are interested." [Associated Press, 5/10/16<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/087bc8bc5028405c80fa20cea70be877/ap-interview-trump-narrows-vp-list-he-moves-general>]



PERHAPS TRUMP WAS AFRAID OF VOTERS FINDING OUT JUST HOW LITTLE HE PAID IN TAXES OR ABOUT THE "MASSIVE DEDUCTIONS" HE TOOK



April 2015: Trump: "I Want To Tell You Right Now I Have No Problem With Giving My Tax Returns But I Would Tell You Upfront A Stupid Person, A Really Stupid Person Is Paying A Lot Of Taxes." TRUMP: "I want to tell you right now I have no problem with giving my tax returns but I would tell you upfront a stupid person, a really stupid person is paying a lot of taxes.

[This Week, ABC, 10/4/15]



Trump: "You Can't Tell Anything From Tax Returns, Because You Take Deductions, Massive Deductions And Lots Of Other Things." TRUMP: "Well, number one, I fully disclosed my financials. And I put them in actually right on time. And nobody else did, by the way, but I put them in on time. And it's almost 100 pages of financials. And it shows over $10 billion. If you figure it out, it's over $10 billion in net worth. And it's an amazing company with great cash flow, very little debt, all of that. You can't tell anything from tax returns, because you take deductions, massive deductions and lots of other things. And you can't tell very much from a tax return. You really can't tell anything as to that." [State of the Union, CNN, 2/28/16]
