Hey Sri,

Per our other chain, wanted to get this to the top of your inbox.  Also Cc'=
d here is my colleague, Claire Olszewski, who is our Women's Leadership For=
um Director.  The two of us are working together on female empowerment roun=
dtables (1-pager attached here) across the country and would love to get Ti=
na onboard.

Ideally, we would have Tina act as a (solo) surrogate in some cities and we=
 would pair her with another surrogate (i.e. Neera Tanden, Congresswoman Bo=
nnie Watson Coleman, et al) in other cities, pending your approval of the p=
airing of course.  We have already made contact with Neera's office and the=
 Congresswoman Coleman's staff; both have agreed to participate.

If you wouldn't mind letting us know dates in May and June that work well f=
or Tina, we can coordinate with our respective hosts and other surrogates t=
o make sure everyone is in sync.  We can also get you the other surrogates =
availability if that's helpful.  My contact info is below if it's easier to=
 talk through everything.  Thanks for all your help!

Hi Sri,

Jordan Vaughn here from the DNC.  Reaching out as I know Tina has spoken wi=
th both Michele Taylor and Jordan Kaplan about potentially doing female emp=
owerment roundtables (1-pager attached) for us.

Wanted to follow up with you to see if Tina has any open dates in May or Ju=
ne that would work for her to act as a surrogate at one of these roundtable=
s.  The locations we are currently hoping to get her to are New York City a=
nd Raleigh-Durham.

Please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have additional questions; my co=
ntact is below.  I look forward to hearing from you.
