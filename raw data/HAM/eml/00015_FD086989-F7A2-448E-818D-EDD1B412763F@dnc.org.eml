 few in Congress who have provided the kind of thoughtful, and often courag=

is someone who regularly delivers for his constituents, his district, and h=
is country, never afraid to put in the hard work to make a real and substan=

ors and responders, passing common-sense gun safety laws, or protecting a w=
oman's right to choose, Jerry's voice and leadership is something we desper=
