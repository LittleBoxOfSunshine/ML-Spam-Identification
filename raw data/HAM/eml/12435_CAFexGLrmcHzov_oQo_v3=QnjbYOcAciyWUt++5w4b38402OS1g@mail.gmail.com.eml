Hi Luis,

Just wanted to circle back around on this. We're trying to nail down
production numbers, and we'd love to get your input on who/how many would
benefit from these toolkits and could put them to use =E2=80=94 including s=
tate
party staff, committee staff, convention staff, speechwriters, etc.

Let me know if it would be more helpful to hop on a call. Thanks!
