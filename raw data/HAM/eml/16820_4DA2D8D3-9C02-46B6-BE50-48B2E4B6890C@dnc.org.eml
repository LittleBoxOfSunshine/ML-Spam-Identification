Between us, don't thank me at all yet. She can't do money yet herself, this month. Still committed to 33,400 but needs couple months.  Both her and Bill still want to attend rt.

I've suggested installments. She hasn't answered yet on that idea.

I just got this word from her late last night. Didn't see until this morning.

Still calling today to get new money. Hopefully can get someone who can't attend but can do money now to at least cover the gap.

She's good for it but may not help us with cash flow in May.

I'm sorry for all the difficulty, especially after Benter nonsense.
