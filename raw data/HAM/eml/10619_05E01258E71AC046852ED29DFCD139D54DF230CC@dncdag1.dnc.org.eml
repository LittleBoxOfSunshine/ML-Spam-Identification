Chaos At Nevada Democratic Convention; State Party Chair Flees Building As =
Sanders Supporters Demand Recount
By Tim Hains<mailto:thains@realclearpolitics.com>

(Update/clarification: This situation escalated out of control when Roberta=
 Lange, Chairwoman of the Nevada State Democratic Party & member of the nat=
ional DNC Executive Committee subjectively called the results of a voice vo=
te, adjourned the meeting using a gavel, and left<http://www.realclearpolit=
ics.com/video/2016/05/15/sanders_supporters_immediately_question_yeasnays_s=
he_passed_it_before_we_even_said_no.html>. According to a Democratic Party =
spokesman, the national party or its Chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, =
"did not have a part in this.")

Adryenn Ashley<https://www.facebook.com/AdryennAshley/videos?fref=3Dphoto> =
posted several live videos (below) from inside the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas=
, where arcane secondary rounds of the delegate selection process of Nevada=
's Democratic caucus erupted into chaos Saturday night. Bernie Sanders supp=
orters demanded 64 rejected pro-Sanders delegates listed in a "minority rep=
ort<https://lasvegassun.com/news/2016/may/14/at-democratic-convention-in-la=
s-vegas-rules-divide/>" prepared by their campaign be allowed to participat=
e in selecting delegates for the national convention.

State party chair and DNC executive committee member Roberta Lange refused =
to reconsider their decision not to allow this, adjourned, and fled the bui=
lding amid a chorus of boos; leaving hotel security and local police office=
rs to handle the angry Sanders supporters.

Earlier in the day, the Sanders camp objected to several of their delegates=
 beingdisqualified from voting for administrative reasons<http://www.realcl=
earpolitics.com/video/2016/05/15/nevada_democratic_credentials_committee_co=
-chair_actions_to_exclude_sanders_supporters_violate_the_spirit_of_the_valu=
es_of_our_nation.html>, and booed Sen. Barbara Boxer<http://www.realclearpo=
litics.com/video/2016/05/15/barbara_boxer_to_nevada_democrats_if_you_boo_me=
_youre_booing_bernie_sanders.html> when she called for unity. "If you're bo=
oing me, you're booing Bernie Sanders," she told them. "Go ahead, boo yours=
elves out of this election."

A member of the rules committee called the act of disallowing votes for pur=
ely administrative reasons a violation of the spirit of the values of our n=
ation<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/05/15/nevada_democratic_c=
redentials_committee_co-chair_actions_to_exclude_sanders_supporters_violate=
_the_spirit_of_the_values_of_our_nation.html>.

The longest of Ashley's videos is the most consequential, others posted fur=
ther below:

Sanders supporters are observed considering a sit-in in Ashley's video, but=
 hotel security forced them out, saying "it is now in the hands of the atto=
rneys."

"Please leave peacefully," the security officers said. "Please leave, it is=
 not safe here."

"If we do not leave, it becomes a big issue," said one Sanders supporter. "=
I'm not leaving."

At one point, Ashley loses the video connection, but audio remains. "I don'=
t know if you can see this," she says. "I don't know if you can hear this, =
but there are twenty armed sheriffs here to help them steal the election...=
 They're saying leave now or else."

After minute nine of the above video, Ashley asks someone what is going on:=
 "We've got 620 viewers here, you have nothing to say?"

"The guy that is speaking is not a member of the DNC, he is head of securit=
y for Paris [hotel]. He says he is a dedicated --I don't know if he is a De=
mocrat," someone responds. "But the election process, and please leave. It =
is not safe here. And by it is not safe here, I expect he means all those s=
heriffs at the front of the room... They are asking us to 'leave the privat=
e property at this time.' This should be national news. This needs to be na=
tional news."

Eventually they shut the lights off to get the Sanders supporters out.

She garnered more than 1,000 viewers by the end of her twenty-minute livest=
ream.

So far this video of a "fight" is the only sign of violence.

See below. Didn't we hear yesterday that the Sanders campaign had accepted =
the result? This headline needs to be changed. This convention was not run =
by the DNC or DNC leaders. It was run by the Nevada Democratic Party.

or Recount on the Floor, Roberta ignored it, and called a motion to adjurn =
the meeting and then Ran out, even though the Nays won it. She did that on =
purpose, she is a crook, and needs to be kicked out of her position as Neva=
da Democratic Chair Woman. I am officially registering as an Independent, I=
 was considering voting Hillary if I had to over Trump, she just changed my=
 mind. She just proved Democrats are Crooks."

&quot;Please leave peacefully,&quot; the security officers said. &quot;Plea=

<br>
&quot;If we do not leave, it becomes a big issue,&quot; said one Sanders su=

At one point, Ashley loses the video connection, but audio remains. &quot;I=

can hear this, but there are twenty armed sheriffs here to help them steal =
the election... They're saying leave now or else.&quot;<br>
<br>
After minute nine of the above video, Ashley asks someone what is going on:=
 &quot;We've got 620 viewers here, you have nothing to say?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The guy that is speaking is not a member of the DNC, he is head of se=

 a Democrat,&quot; someone responds. &quot;But the election process, and pl=

 (below) from inside the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas, where arcane secondary r=
ounds of the delegate selection process
 of Nevada's Democratic caucus erupted into chaos Saturday night. Bernie Sa=
nders supporters demanded 64 rejected pro-Sanders delegates listed in a &qu=

 report</a>&quot; prepared by their campaign be allowed to participate in s=
electing delegates for the national convention.
<br>
<br>
DNC leaders refused to reconsider their decision not to allow this, adjourn=
ed, and fled the building amid a chorus of boos; leaving
<i>hotel security</i> and local police officers to handle the angry Sanders=
 supporters.<br>
<br>
Earlier in the day, the Sanders camp objected to several of their delegates=
 being

<br>
A member of the rules committee called the act of disallowing votes for pur=

a violation of the spirit of the values of our nation</a>.<br>
<br>
The longest of Ashley's videos is the most consequential, others posted fur=
ther below:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sanders supporters are observed considering a sit-in in Ashley's video, but=
 hotel security forced them out, saying &quot;it is now in the hands of the=
 attorneys.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Please leave peacefully,&quot; the security officers said. &quot;Plea=
se leave, it is not safe here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If we do not leave, it becomes a big issue,&quot; said one Sanders su=
pporter. &quot;I'm not leaving.&quot;<br>
<br>
At one point, Ashley loses the video connection, but audio remains. &quot;I=
 don't know if you can see this,&quot; she says. &quot;I don't know if you =
can hear this, but there are twenty armed sheriffs here to help them steal =
the election... They're saying leave now or else.&quot;<br>
<br>
After minute nine of the above video, Ashley asks someone what is going on:=
 &quot;We've got 620 viewers here, you have nothing to say?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The guy that is speaking is not a member of the DNC, he is head of se=
curity for Paris [hotel]. He says he is a dedicated --I don't know if he is=
 a Democrat,&quot; someone responds. &quot;But the election process, and pl=
ease leave. It is not safe here. And by it is not
 safe here, I expect he means all those sheriffs at the front of the room..=
. They are asking us to 'leave the private property at this time.' This sho=
uld be national news. This needs to be national news.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eventually they <i>shut the lights off</i> to get the Sanders supporters ou=
t.<o:p></o:p></p>

Chairwoman of the Nevada State Democratic Party &amp; member of the DNC Exe=

tion for Recount on the Floor, Roberta ignored it, and called a motion to a=
djurn the meeting and then Ran out, even
 though the Nays won it. She did that on purpose, she is a crook, and needs=
 to be kicked out of her position as Nevada Democratic Chair Woman. I am of=
ficially registering as an Independent, I was considering voting Hillary if=
 I had to over Trump, she just changed
 my mind. She just proved Democrats are Crooks.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>
