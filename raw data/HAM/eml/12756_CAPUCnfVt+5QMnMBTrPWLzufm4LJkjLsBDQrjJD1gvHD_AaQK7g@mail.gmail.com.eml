*IN CASE YOU MISSED ITDonald Trump and the Art of the Tax LoopholeThe New

TYPE =E2=80=9CTrump system rigged=E2=80=9D into the Google search bar and y=
ou=E2=80=99ll get more
than 500,000 hits. I didn=E2=80=99t inspect all of them but the first 50 we=
re
variants of Donald Trump complaining that the Republican primary process
was tilted against him.

That=E2=80=99s beyond ironic. Mr. Trump and his family have been the benefi=
ciaries
of a great rigged system: the tax code, which bestows huge advantages on
the real estate business. Throughout his career, Mr. Trump has not only
grabbed for every loophole and legal lever he could find, he=E2=80=99s boas=
ted
about it.

=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve taken advantage of the laws of this country, like oth=
er people,=E2=80=9D Mr.
Trump has said.

The Republican front-runner has been dodging releasing his returns on the
specious grounds that he was being audited. On Tuesday, he told The
Associated Press that he wouldn=E2=80=99t release them before the election =
=E2=80=94
period. On Wednesday, he denied saying this, reversed course and
said,=E2=80=9CHopefully before the election I=E2=80=99ll release.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s nothing to learn from them,=E2=80=9D he said in th=
e Associated Press
interview.

I=E2=80=99ll bet there=E2=80=99s plenty to learn. More likely, Mr. Trump do=
esn=E2=80=99t want us to
know how small his tax hit is, something that he bragged about earlier in
the campaign, before realizing that it could come back to bite him.

=E2=80=9CI fight like hell to pay as little as possible,=E2=80=9D Mr. Trump=
 said last
August.

Real estate guys can take advantage of the best loopholes left in the tax
code, thanks in part to some aggressive nudging of lawmakers. For starters,
real estate investors can take deductions for the ostensible depreciation
of the value of their buildings, even though the point of owning buildings
is that they generally appreciate.

For another, they often borrow against those properties, and because they
hold these investments in partnerships or limited liability companies, the
interest payments are tax-deductible.

=E2=80=9CIf you get close to paying taxes, you just buy another building,=
=E2=80=9D a real
estate friend told me.

If Mr. Trump were to sell a property, the profits would be taxed as capital
gains at far lower rates (23.8 percent) than those imposed on ordinary
income (39.6 percent). But real estate owners often don=E2=80=99t even pay =
capital
gains taxes. They can take advantage of a provision known as Section 1031
to swap a piece of real estate that they are ready to part with for one
that they would like to add to their portfolio =E2=80=94 all tax free. Ther=
e is no
limit on how many swaps they can make, deferring capital gains taxes
indefinitely.

Section 1031 is among the real estate operators=E2=80=99 favorite provision=
s =E2=80=94 and
it=E2=80=99s a break not readily available to other kinds of investors. No =
wonder
that attempts to rein in or eliminate Section 1031, including a recent one
by the Obama administration, have been met with fierce resistance from the
industry.

The tax benefits don=E2=80=99t stop, even at death. If an investor dies hol=
ding
appreciated properties, the heirs get a step up in basis, which means that
they can sell the real estate and pay no taxes on the gain in value.

Mr. Trump=E2=80=99s quest for loopholes ranges far. In 2005, he got a $39.1=
 million
tax deduction for donating a conservation easement on a New Jersey golf
course, meaning that any further development on the property is restricted.
On top of that, he installed goats on two of his New Jersey golf courses as
part of a plan to get them designated as agricultural properties, thereby
vastly lowering his property taxes.

Meanwhile, according to Mr. Trump=E2=80=99s campaign, from 2010 to 2014, he
=E2=80=9Cdonated=E2=80=9D more than $102 million to charity =E2=80=94 witho=
ut giving away even $1
of his own money. More conservation easements constituted the biggest
source of deductions, but the =E2=80=9Cgifts=E2=80=9D included items like f=
ree rounds of
golf for charity events. Many of these =E2=80=9Ccharitable contributions,=
=E2=80=9D of
course, gave rise to more tax deductions.

Taxes are far from the only way that Mr. Trump has gamed the system. He=E2=
=80=99s
added materially to his net worth by pushing the edges of the bankruptcy
laws.

By arguing that his name had huge commercial value, for example, he managed
to retain more ownership in his Atlantic City hotel and casino projects
than is customary in an insolvency, thereby minimizing his losses while his
creditors lost billions.

Finally, by his own admission, Mr. Trump has used our broken campaign
finance system to achieve private gain by giving generously to politicians
of both parties (including to Hillary Clinton) in order to gain influence.
Since 1989, he has donated more than $1.5 million to political causes, 62
percent of it going to Republicans, according to PolitiFact.

=E2=80=9CWhen they call, I give,=E2=80=9D Mr. Trump said in the first Repub=
lican debate.
=E2=80=9CAnd you know what? When I need something from them, two years late=
r, three
years later, I call them. They are there for me.=E2=80=9D

Among the ways that politicians have been there for him and his brethren
has been developing a tax system in which real estate moguls pay little or
no taxes. =E2=80=9CThe Declaration of Independence tells us that all men ar=
e
created equal, but the government definitely favors real estate investors!=
=E2=80=9D
wrote one such investor, David Lindahl. Where did this appear? =E2=80=9CTru=
