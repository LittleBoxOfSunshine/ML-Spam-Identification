[00:33:26]

By the way there is a couple of these gentleman who I have gotten to know
the years who have spent years in reeducation camps and were =E2=80=93 How =
many
years?



VIETNAMESE-AMERICAN: Five-and-a-half years.



MCCAIN: Five-and-a-half years in a reeducation camp. I=E2=80=99m very happy=
 that you
are here with us in the United States. The Vietnamese community has
contributed an enormous amount.



[00:33:48]

*There=E2=80=99s so many other groups: our Hispanic Americans, all =E2=80=
=93 but also there
is a special group also that have been very active and that=E2=80=99s our I=
ranian
community.*



[Applause]



[00:34:08]

They care deeply about their country. They care a great deal about what has
happened o Iran. They feel that they need a President and a Congress that
will stand up Iranian aggression. I thank the Iranian-American group for
all they have done for me.



*[00:34:28]*

accurately =E2=80=93 that I was quoted as saying that this could be the tou=
ghest
race of my political career.* Anybody who sees the turbulence in the
political environment today could not conclude anything else. I am
confident of victory. But *I believe that we have to ask people to work for
us harder than perhaps they have before.*



[00:35:28]

I=E2=80=99m very grateful at this turn out. I=E2=80=99m grateful =E2=80=93 =
*as usual this is going
to come down to what usually determines elections and that=E2=80=99s voter =
turn
out. That=E2=80=99s general speaking the way elections are decided =E2=80=
=93 obviously in
Democracies =E2=80=93 and will this Fall. As you know we have a late primar=
y at the
end of August and we=E2=80=99ve got to get through that: and of course the =
general
election.*

[00:02:00]

(Chatter from McCain staffers)



[00:02:14]

(McCain staff greets the volunteer tracker and enters the room)



[00:11:09]

(Announcer welcomes the Senators and McCain to applause. Chatter as McCain
and others make their way to the stage and greet people.)



[00:12:06]

MCCAIN: Well thanks to all of you coming this morning, thanks for this
great turn out. I=E2=80=99m very honored to have so many of our supporters,=
 some
old geezers - like my friend here -that have been with us for many years.
But also I=E2=80=99m very pleased to see our young interns who have done su=
ch a
magnificent job.



[Applause]



[00:12:30]

MCCAIN: Somewhere in that group of young interns is a future Congressman, a
future Senator - I=E2=80=99m sorry to say I=E2=80=99m not so sure about Pre=
sident because
we in Arizona have very poor record. Barry Goldwater from Arizona ran for
president of the United States. Morris Udall from Arizona ran for president
of the United States. Bruce Babbitt from Arizona ran for President of the
United States. I from Arizona ran for President of the United States.  You
know Arizona may be the only state in American where mothers don=E2=80=99t =
tell
their children that some day they can grow up and be President of the
United States.



[00:13:11]

I=E2=80=99m very honored to have 4 of my colleagues =E2=80=93 we had a 5th =
one Tom Cotton,
Senator from Arkansas who was with us yesterday and didn=E2=80=99t come bac=
k =E2=80=93 but
I=E2=80=99m very honored. I know that many of you know that the election of
2014 brought
in a new generation of leadership into the United States Senate.  In fact
12, practically a quarter of the number of Republicans Senators were
elected in 2014.



[00:13:41]

They represent a new generation of leadership, they represent the kind of
work and dedication to the people they represent: and a diverse but very
important fashion. I have spent a lot of time with these new members of the
United States Senate: I refuse to call them freshman and I have spent time
with them and I am heartened and encouraged by what they have brought to
their respective states and what they have brought to the nation and to the
Republican Party.



[00:14:17]

So I am very honored that they would take the time from their busy
schedules to come to Arizona and be here on behalf, on probably as I said
before perhaps one of the toughest campaign of my political career. So with
that I would like to mention about each one of them and then ask them to
say a few words, although they have been in the Senate now long enough to
be incapable of a few words.



[00:14:45]

So could I introduce first of all Joni Ernst? Joni Ernst if from the great
state of Iowa. [Applause] Every four years the Senator from Iowa becomes
the most popular person in Senate. It doesn=E2=80=99t last long. When the p=
rimary
is over they forget about that Senator. But before the Iowa caucuses that
Senator from Iowa is really one of the most important.



[00:15:21]

Joni brings unique qualifications to the United States Senate, she grew up
on a farm, I=E2=80=99m sure that most of you know that the most famous comm=
ercial
of the 2014 campaign was showing Joni Ernst with some pigs around her
family farm, she talked about what she was going to squeeze when she came
to Washington. So far we are okay but =E2=80=93 [laughter]



[00:15:48]

But she also served with distinction in the US Army Reserve and the Iowa
Guard and actually was in Iraq during that period of time: unique
qualifications and we are very proud to have her with us.



[00:16:03]

Second I=E2=80=99d like to mention Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska. [Applaus=
e] He
has a great deal of military experience he has been a leader in the United
States Senate on the Asia-Pacific Armed services committee on Asia-Pacific
issues: all of that. He=E2=80=99s really a great guy but unfortunately he w=
as in
the Marine Corps so...



[00:16:35]

Dan Sullivan understands the needs of our men and women in the military
having served, in face still serving on active duty, and we are very proud
of the great work he has done as a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee. Corey Gardner: I want everybody to be so nice to him okay.
You=E2=80=99ve got to be nice to him because that is where our water comes =
from.



[Applause]



[00:17:07]

I always do go over and kiss his ring every time. Please the water coming
down the Colorado. Cory Gardner was in the legislature. He is now one of
the most valued members of the Foreign Relations Committee. Recently, and
remember he was in his first term; he was responsible for a significant
piece of legislation concerning this test of intercontinental ballistic
missiles by the Iranians. He has emerged as that leadership. Everybody
thank him for the water.



[Applause]



[00:17:48]

Senator David Perdue is from Georgia, he has an incredible =E2=80=93 there =
she is.
He was the CEO of Reebok and Dollar General; he has the most extensive
experience. Any of you that didn=E2=80=99t like your Reebok: he=E2=80=99d b=
e glad to talk
to you about that.



[00:18:12]

He is the foremost advocate for restraint on our out of control spending.
He is the foremost advocate to bring our spending under control. These
young people that are here our interns, I=E2=80=99m sure that they would be=
 the
first to tell you, we are laying a burden of debt on them that is
unconscionable. He is foremost expert =E2=80=93 spokesperson on getting our=
 fiscal
house in order.



[00:18:44]

I=E2=80=99m proud of my work on behalf of national defense. We are proud of=
 the
hard work that we do to train and equip the men and women who are serving.
Unless we get this debt under control all that work will be for
nothing.  Let=E2=80=99s thank David Perdue of Georgia one of the great lead=
ers of
the United States Senate.



[00:19:11]

So with that I would like to hand it over to Joni Ernst who will tell you
that one of the great events in the world is the Iowa State Fair: where if
you are really smart you can get a deep fried Twinkie.



[00:19:27]

(Ernst laughs and thanks McCain. Ernst takes a swipe at the liberal war on
women. She lauds McCain=E2=80=99s experience.)



[00:23:03]

(Sullivan goes on introduces himself and the freshman class in Senate,
talks about how McCain is a mentor, shout out to McCain interns, McCain is
SASC chairman and is awesome.)



[00:26:43]

(Gardner jokes about water and baseball. We are going to keep the majority
in the Senate. McCain stands up for people who are struggling. )



[00:29:09]

(Perdue talks about how young peoples energy inspires him and McCain, this
race is about our country. We need McCain to help lead America again. This
campaign will turn campaign back to America=E2=80=99s founding principles. =
He=E2=80=99s an
American hero, let=E2=80=99s get him reelected.)



[00:32:20]

CROWD: John! John! John! John! ....



[00:32:30]

MCCAIN: Thank you. Thank you. I=E2=80=99m very humbled and flattered and I =
can=E2=80=99t
tell you how grateful I am to see this kind of support and eloquence. Don=
=E2=80=99t
you think that this is a wonderful group of Senators to help America?



[Applause]



[00:32:51]

MCCAIN: I=E2=80=99m proud and humbled to be in their company. I want to tha=
nk our
interns again but I=E2=80=99d also like to say that there=E2=80=99s a group=
 of other
Americans that I have been very pleased to have their support and really
deep involvement: and that=E2=80=99s the Vietnamese community here in Arizo=
na. They
are so active. Would are Vietnamese friends raise their hands for us?



[Applause]



[00:33:26]

By the way there is a couple of these gentleman who I have gotten to know
the years who have spent years in reeducation camps and were =E2=80=93 How =
many
years?



VIETNAMESE-AMERICAN: Five-and-a-half years.



MCCAIN: Five-and-a-half years in a reeducation camp. I=E2=80=99m very happy=
 that
you are here with us in the United States. The Vietnamese community has
contributed an enormous amount.



[00:33:48]

There=E2=80=99s so many other groups: our Hispanic Americans, all =E2=80=93=
 but also there
is a special group also that have been very active and that=E2=80=99s our I=
ranian
community.



[Applause]



[00:34:08]

They care deeply about their country. They care a great deal about what has
happened o Iran. They feel that they need a President and a Congress that
will stand up Iranian aggression. I thank the Iranian-American group for
all they have done for me.



[00:34:28]

We are assembling a coalition of different ethnic groups. We=E2=80=99ve got=
 a
special, very special group =E2=80=93 you know our daughter Bridget was bor=
n in
Bangladesh so we are motivating the Bangladesh community. There it is right
there. If we get that vote out it could tip the scales.



[Laughter]



[00:34:52]

I just want to thank all of you again for this expression of support and I
just want to repeat what has been said =E2=80=93 maybe not totally accurate=
ly but
fairly accurately =E2=80=93 that I was quoted as saying that this could be =
the
toughest race of my political career. Anybody who sees the turbulence in
the political environment today could not conclude anything else. I am
confident of victory. But I believe that ask people to work for us harder
than perhaps they have before.



[00:35:28]

I=E2=80=99m very grateful at this tern out. I=E2=80=99m grateful =E2=80=93 =
as usual this is going
to come down to what usually determines elections and that=E2=80=99s voter =
turn
out. That=E2=80=99s general speaking the way elections are decided =E2=80=

end of August and we=E2=80=99ve got to get through that: and of course the =
general
election.



[00:35:55]

So your participation today means a lot to me. My colleagues=E2=80=99 mean =
a lot to
me. We can=E2=80=99t slack off; we=E2=80=99re going to have to work very, v=
ery hard. And I
know that I can succeed and I know that I can have the great honor of
continuing to serve the people of Arizona in the United States Senate with
your help and support. Thank you and God Bless.
