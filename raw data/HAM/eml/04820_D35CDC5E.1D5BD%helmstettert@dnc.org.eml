Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private

Donald J. Trump had barely met Rowanne Brewer Lane when he asked her to cha=
nge out of her clothes.

Donald was having a pool party at Mar-a-Lago. There were about 50 models an=
d 30 men. There were girls in the pools, splashing around. For some reason =
Donald seemed a little smitten with me. He just started talking to me and n=
obody else.

He suddenly took me by the hand, and he started to show me around the mansi=
on. He asked me if I had a swimsuit with me. I said no. I hadn=92t intended=
 to swim. He took me into a room and opened drawers and asked me to put on =
a swimsuit.

=96Rowanne Brewer Lane, former companion

Ms. Brewer Lane, at the time a 26-year-old model, did as Mr. Trump asked. =
=93I went into the bathroom and tried one on,=94 she recalled. It was a bik=
ini. =93I came out, and he said, =91Wow.=92 =94

Mr. Trump, then 44 and in the midst of his first divorce, decided to show h=
er off to the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Fla. =93He bro=
ught me out to the pool and said, =91That is a stunning Trump girl, isn=92t=
 it?=92 =94 Ms. Brewer Lane said.

Donald Trump and women: The words evoke a familiar cascade of casual insult=
s, hurled from the safe distance of a Twitter account, a radio show or a ca=
mpaign podium. This is the public treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, the=
 presumptive Republican nominee for president: degrading, impersonal, perfo=
rmed. =93That must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees,=94 he t=
old a female contestant on =93The Apprentice.=94 Rosie O=92Donnell, he said=
, had a =93fat, ugly face.=94 A lawyer who needed to pump milk for a newbor=
n? =93Disgusting,=94 he said.

But the 1990 episode at Mar-a-Lago that Ms. Brewer Lane described was diffe=
rent: a debasing face-to-face encounter between Mr. Trump and a young woman=
 he hardly knew. This is the private treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, =
the up-close and more intimate encounters.

The New York Times interviewed dozens of women who had worked with or for M=
r. Trump over the past four decades, in the worlds of real estate, modeling=
 and pageants; women who had dated him or interacted with him socially; and=
 women and men who had closely observed his conduct since his adolescence. =
In all, more than 50 interviews were conducted over the course of six weeks=
.

Their accounts =97 many relayed here in their own words =97 reveal unwelcom=
e romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, a shrewd relia=
nce on ambitious women, and unsettling workplace conduct, according to the =
interviews, as well as court records and written recollections. The interac=
tions occurred in his offices at Trump Tower, at his homes, at construction=
 sites and backstage at beauty pageants. They appeared to be fleeting, unim=
portant moments to him, but they left lasting impressions on the women who =
experienced them.

What emerges from the interviews is a complex, at times contradictory portr=
ait of a wealthy, well-known and provocative man and the women around him, =
one that defies simple categorization. Some women found him gracious and en=
couraging. He promoted several to the loftiest heights of his company, a da=
ring move for a major real estate developer at the time.

He simultaneously nurtured women=92s careers and mocked their physical appe=
arance. =93You like your candy,=94 he told an overweight female executive w=
ho oversaw the construction of his headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. He co=
uld be lewd one moment and gentlemanly the next.

In an interview, Mr. Trump described himself as a champion of women, someon=
e who took pride in hiring them and was in awe of their work ethic. =93It w=
ould just seem,=94 he said, =93that there was something that they want to r=
eally prove.=94

Pressed on the women=92s claims, Mr. Trump disputed many of the details, su=
ch as asking Ms. Brewer Lane to put on a swimsuit. =93A lot of things get m=
ade up over the years,=94 he said. =93I have always treated women with grea=
t respect. And women will tell you that.=94

But in many cases there was an unmistakable dynamic at play: Mr. Trump had =
the power, and the women did not. He had celebrity. He had wealth. He had c=
onnections. Even after he had behaved crudely toward them, some of the wome=
n sought his assistance with their careers or remained by his side.

For Ms. Brewer Lane, her introduction to Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago was the st=
art of a whirlwind romance =97 a heady blur of helicopter rides and high-en=
d hotel rooms and flashing cameras.

=93It was intimidating,=94 she said. =93He was Donald Trump, obviously.=94

Boarding School =91Ladies=92 Man=92

It started at the New York Military Academy, a small, severe boarding schoo=
l 90 minutes north of New York City. Strictly enforced rules prohibited gir=
ls from setting foot on the all-boys campus unless it was a special occasio=
n. And on those special occasions, young Donald Trump paid careful mind to =
the kind of girls he brought to school. They had to be gorgeous =97 10s, in=
 his future parlance.

=93Donald was extremely sensitive to whether or not the women he invited to=
 campus were pretty,=94 recalled George White, a fellow student in the clas=
s of 1964.

=93For Donald,=94 he added, =93it=92s display.=94

He steadily built an image as a young playboy amid the deprivations of a si=
ngle-sex military school, where most boys craved but rarely enjoyed the com=
pany of a girl. By senior year, his classmates had crowned him =93ladies=92=
 man=94 in the yearbook, a nod to the volume of his dates.

He wasn=92t bringing the same girl. He had a variety of girls coming up. Do=
nald was bringing in very pretty women, very sophisticated women and very w=
ell-dressed women. You could always tell they were of a higher class.

=96George White, high school classmate

Asked how he had earned the =93ladies=92 man=94 title, Mr. Trump at first d=
emurred. =93I better not tell you =97 I=92ll get myself in trouble,=94 he s=
aid. He later elaborated, saying he had =93a great feeling=94 and =93a grea=
t like=94 for women.

The Alpha Trump

Mr. Trump grew up with an influential role model for how to deal with women=
: Fred C. Trump, his powerful and unyielding father.

The elder Mr. Trump exerted control no matter how big or small the decision=
, as Ivana Zelnickova learned over dinner one night in the late 1970s. Her =
boyfriend, Donald Trump, had invited her to join his siblings and parents a=
t Tavern on the Green, the ornate restaurant in Central Park.

When the waiter came to take orders, Ivana made the mistake of asking for w=
hat she wanted. Fred Trump set her straight, she recalled in a previously u=
npublished interview with Michael D=92Antonio, the author of =93The Truth A=
bout Trump.=94

Fred would order steak. Then Donald would order steak. =85 Everybody order =
steak. I told the waiter, =93I would like to have fish.=94 O.K., so I could=
 have the fish. And Fred would say to the waiter: =93No, Ivana is not going=
 to have a fish. She is going to have a steak.=94 I said, =93No, I=92m goin=
g to have my fish.=94 And Donald would come home and say, =93Ivana, why wou=
ld you have a fish instead of a steak?=94 I say, =93Because I=92m not going=
 to be told by somebody to have something which I don=92t want.=94

=96Ivana Trump, ex-wife

Mr. Trump defended his father=92s conduct. =93He would=92ve said that out o=
f love,=94 he said. If his father had overruled her fish order, Mr. Trump s=
aid, =93he would have said that only on the basis that he thought, =91That =
would be better for her.=92 =94

The elder Mr. Trump did not hide his more traditional views on gender. When=
 his son hired a woman, Barbara A. Res<https://www.createspace.com/6026691>=
, as his head of construction in the 1980s, Fred Trump was mystified and an=
noyed.

Fred did not like the idea that Donald had hired me. =93A woman?=94 Donald =
told me that. But I could tell by the way Fred treated me. He used to say t=
hat all the time: =93You don=92t know what you are talking about.=94 When I=
 would complain to Donald about Fred, he would say, =93Fred didn=92t want m=
e to hire you or didn=92t think it was a woman=92s job.=94

=96Barbara A. Res, former Trump executive

Mr. Trump said it was a different era. =93My father,=94 he said, =93probabl=
y never would have seen a woman in that position.=94

Mr. Trump still holds up his parents as models, praising his stay-at-home m=
other for understanding and accommodating a husband who worked almost nonst=
op.

=93My mother was always fine with it,=94 he said, recalling her =93brillian=
t=94 management of the situation. =93If something got interrupted because h=
e was going to inspect a housing site or something, she would handle that s=
o beautifully.=94

=93She was an ideal woman,=94 he said.

The Company of Women

With his purchase of the Miss Universe Organization, Mr. Trump was now in t=
he business of young, beautiful women.

They craved his advice and approval, a fact he seemed to understand well.

Temple Taggart, the 21-year-old Miss Utah, was startled by how forward he w=
as with young contestants like her in 1997, his first year as the owner of =
Miss USA, a branch of the beauty pageant organization. As she recalls it, h=
e introduced himself in an unusually intimate manner.

He kissed me directly on the lips. I thought, =93Oh my God, gross.=94 He wa=
s married to Marla Maples at the time. I think there were a few other girls=
 that he kissed on the mouth. I was like =93Wow, that=92s inappropriate.=94

=96Temple Taggart, 1997 Miss Utah USA

Mr. Trump disputes this, saying he is reluctant to kiss strangers on the li=
ps. But Ms. Taggart said it was not an isolated incident.

At the gala celebration after the show, she said, Mr. Trump immediately zer=
oed in on her, telling her how much he liked her style and inviting her to =
visit him in New York to talk about her future. Soon enough, she said, he d=
elivered another unwelcome kiss on her lips, this time in Trump Tower. Afte=
r boasting of his connections to elite modeling agencies, he advised her to=
 lie about her age to get ahead in the industry, she said.

=93 =91We=92re going to have to tell them you=92re 17,=92 =94 Ms. Taggart r=
ecalled him telling her, =93because in his mind, 21 is too old. I was like,=
 =91No, we=92re not going to do that.=92 =94

His level of involvement in the pageants was unexpected, and his judgments,=
 the contestants said, could be harsh. Carrie Prejean, who was 21 when she =
participated in the Miss USA contest in 2009 as Miss California, was surpri=
sed to find Mr. Trump personally evaluating the women at rehearsal. =93We w=
ere told to put on our opening number outfits =97 they were nearly as revea=
ling as our swimsuits =97 and line up for him onstage,=94 she wrote in her =
memoir, =93Still Standing.=94

Donald Trump walked out with his entourage and inspected us closer than any=
 general ever inspected a platoon. He would stop in front of a girl, look h=
er up and down, and say, =93Hmmm.=94 Then he would go on and do the same th=
ing to the next girl. He took notes on a little pad as he went along. After=
 he did this, Trump said: =93O.K. I want all the girls to come forward.=94 =
=85

Donald Trump looked at Miss Alabama.

=93Come here,=94 he said.

She took one more step forward.

=93Tell me, who=92s the most beautiful woman here?=94

Miss Alabama=92s eyes swam around.

=93Besides me?=94 she said. =93Uh, I like Arkansas. She=92s sweet.=94

=93I don=92t care if she=92s sweet,=94 Donald Trump said. =93Is she hot?=94=
 =85

It became clear that the point of the whole exercise was for him to divide =
the room between girls he personally found attractive and those he did not.=
 Many of the girls found the exercise humiliating. Some of the girls were s=
obbing backstage after he left, devastated to have failed even before the c=
ompetition really began to impress =93The Donald.=94

=96Carrie Prejean, 2009 Miss California USA

Mr. Trump, in an interview, said he would =93never do that.=94 Such behavio=
r, he said, would bruise egos and hurt feelings. =93I wouldn=92t hurt peopl=
e,=94 he said. =93That=92s hurtful to people.=94

A Preoccupation With Bodies

Mr. Trump was not just fixated on the appearance of the women around him. H=
e possessed an almost compulsive need to talk about it.

Inside the Trump Organization, the company that manages his various busines=
ses, he occasionally interrupted routine discussions of business to opine o=
n women=92s figures. Barbara Res, his construction executive, remembered a =
meeting in which she and Mr. Trump interviewed an architect for a project i=
n the Los Angeles area. Out of the blue, she said, Mr. Trump evaluated the =
fitness of women in Marina del Rey, Calif. =93They take care of their asses=
,=94 he said.

=93The architect and I didn=92t know where he was coming from,=94 Ms. Res s=
aid. Years later, after she had gained a significant amount of weight, Ms. =
Res endured a stinging workplace observation about her own body from Mr. Tr=
ump. =93 =91You like your candy,=92 =94 she recalled him telling her. =93It=
 was him reminding me that I was overweight.=94

Her colleague Louise Sunshine experienced similar observations from Mr. Tru=
mp when she gained weight. But she saw it as friendly encouragement, not a =
cruel insult. =93He thought I looked much better thin,=94 she said. =93He w=
ould remind me of how beautiful I was.=94

Whenever possible, Mr. Trump wanted his visitors to see his most attractive=
 employees, as Ms. Res learned.

We had a big meeting once. I grabbed one of the women in the office and sen=
t her in to get lunch orders. Donald said, =93Not her.=94 She didn=92t look=
 great. He got another woman to take the lunch orders. That was purely abou=
t looks. He wanted the people in that room to think that all the women who =
worked for him were beautiful.

=96Ms. Res

Mr. Trump frequently sought assurances =97 at times from strangers =97 that=
 the women in his life were beautiful. During the 1997 Miss Teen USA pagean=
t, he sat in the audience as his teenage daughter, Ivanka, helped to host t=
he event from onstage. He turned to Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee, Miss Un=
iverse at the time, and asked for her opinion of his daughter=92s body.

=93 =91Don=92t you think my daughter=92s hot? She=92s hot, right?=92 =94 Ms=
. Lee recalled him saying. =91I was like, =91Really?=92 That=92s just weird=
. She was 16. That=92s creepy.=94

Ms. Brewer Lane, who dated Mr. Trump for several months in 1990 and early 1=
991, said it did not take long for him to solicit her view on the attractiv=
eness of two of his previous romantic partners, Marla Maples and Ivana Trum=
p.

He did ask me, on a scale of 1 to 10, what I thought of Marla. I thought th=
at was very boyish of him. He asked me the same thing about Ivana. I said, =
obviously, she is your wife. A beautiful woman. What could you say but a 10=
? I am not going to judge your wife.

=96Ms. Brewer Lane

Mr. Trump said he did not know Ms. Brewer Lane very well, despite dating he=
r. =93I wouldn=92t have asked anybody about how they rate other women,=94 h=
e said.

Kissing, and Telling Everyone

He liked to brag about his sexual prowess and his desirability as a date, n=
o matter who was around.

Barbara J. Fife, a deputy mayor under David N. Dinkins, New York=92s mayor =
in the early 1990s, was not especially close to Mr. Trump. But that did not=
 stop him from telling her why he was in such a hurry one day as he sat in =
her office at City Hall.

=93I have this great date tonight with a model for Victoria=92s Secret,=94 =
Ms. Fife recalled him telling her.

=93I saw it as immature, quite honestly,=94 she said.

At his office in Trump Tower, Mr. Trump seemed eager for his colleagues to =
hear about his new companion, Ms. Maples. When The New York Post feasted on=
 her supposed satisfaction with him in bed, captured in the headline =93Bes=
t Sex I=92ve Ever Had,=94 Mr. Trump was unabashed, Ms. Res said.

He absolutely loved that. He waved it around the office. =93Did you see thi=
s?=94 Everyone who worked there were kind of horrified. We all thought it m=
ade him look bad. He didn=92t.

=96Ms. Res

Mr. Trump denies boasting about the headline. He seems more bashful these d=
ays, saying he cannot recall how many women he has dated. =93Not as many as=
 people would think,=94 he said. =93I=92m not somebody that really loved th=
e dating process.=94

Women as Trusted Colleagues

To build his business, Mr. Trump turned to women for a simple reason: They =
worked hard =97 often harder than men, he told them.

When Mr. Trump hired Ms. Res to oversee the construction of Trump Tower, he=
 invited her to his apartment on Fifth Avenue and explained that he wanted =
her to be his =93Donna Trump=94 on the project, she said. Few women had rea=
ched such stature in the industry.

He said: =93I know you=92re a woman in a man=92s world. And while men tend =
to be better than women, a good woman is better than 10 good men.=94 =85 He=
 thought he was really complimenting me.

=96Ms. Res

He entrusted several women in his company with enormous responsibility =97 =
once they had proven themselves worthy and loyal. Ms. Sunshine had little e=
xperience in real estate, but as a top campaign fund-raiser for Gov. Hugh C=
arey of New York, she had fulfilled a lifelong wish for Mr. Trump: She secu=
red him a vanity license plate with his initials, DJT, which adorned his li=
mousine for years.

It=92s something he had wanted since his father bought him toy cars. By som=
e gift of God, I was able to obtain it for him. He was beyond thrilled. And=
 I became the woman in his life who could do no wrong. And he became the ma=
n in my life who was going to be my mentor.

=96Louise Sunshine, former Trump executive

Ms. Sunshine worked for Mr. Trump for 15 years, becoming a major New York r=
eal estate figure in her own right. Ms. Res remained at the company for 12 =
years, left after a disagreement over a project and then returned as a cons=
ultant for six more years. Both expressed gratitude for the chances Mr. Tru=
mp had taken on them.

In a rough-and-tumble industry thoroughly dominated by men, Mr. Trump=92s o=
ffice stood out for its diversity, recalled Alan Lapidus, an influential ar=
chitect who designed the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City.

He is a lot more complicated than the cartoon character. The top people in =
his company were women, like Barbara Res. For any company to hire a woman a=
s chief of construction was actually startling. I don=92t know of a single =
other developer who had a woman in that position. The respect for women was=
 always there. That=92s why, in spite of the comments he makes now =97 and =
God knows why he says these things =97 when he was building his empire, the=
 backbone was women.

=96Alan Lapidus, architect

Dismissive Nicknames

To women who had climbed to positions of power outside his company, Mr. Tru=
mp=92s behavior could feel like a jarring throwback.

Alair A. Townsend was for a time the highest-ranking woman inside New York=
=92s City Hall during the Koch administration, with the title of deputy may=
or for economic development. But when Mr. Trump called her, she said, her p=
osition seemed less relevant to him than her gender.

He was dismissive. It was always, =93Hon,=94 =93Dear.=94 Things he wouldn=
=92t have said to a man. It was designed to make you feel small. And he did=
 that repeatedly.

=96Alair A. Townsend, former deputy mayor

It was an unthinking habit when he interacted with women, colleagues said. =
=93At Trump Tower,=94 said Ms. Res, his longtime colleague, =93he called me=
 Honey Bunch.=94

Wife and Partner, and Regret

No single figure better encapsulated the paradoxes of Mr. Trump=92s treatme=
nt of women in the workplace than his first wife, Ivana.

He entrusted her with major pieces of a corporate empire and gave her the t=
itles to match. She was the president of Trump=92s Castle, a major casino i=
n Atlantic City, and the Plaza Hotel, the storied complex on Central Park S=
outh in Manhattan. =93She ran that hotel,=94 Ms. Res said. =93And she ran i=
t well.=94

But he compensated her as a spouse, not a high-level employee, paying her a=
n annual salary of $1 for the Trump=92s Castle job, according to her tax do=
cuments. And he grew to resent her outsize role. By the end of their marria=
ge, Mr. Trump wrote in his 1997 book, =93The Art of the Comeback,=94 he reg=
retted having allowed her to run his businesses.

My big mistake with Ivana was taking her out of the role of wife and allowi=
ng her to run one of my casinos in Atlantic City, then the Plaza Hotel. The=
 problem was, work was all she wanted to talk about. When I got home at nig=
ht, rather than talking about the softer subjects of life, she wanted to te=
ll me how well the Plaza was doing, or what a great day the casino had.

I will never again give a wife responsibility within my business.

=96Donald J. Trump, presumptive Republican nominee

He seems to have kept his word. His current wife, Melania, has marketed her=
 own lines of beauty products and jewelry. But Mr. Trump remains mostly uni=
nvolved in her work. After calling it =93very successful,=94 he struggled t=
o describe it.

=93What is it on television with the sales?=94 he asked. =93What do they ca=
ll that? Not Home Shopping, the other one.=94

Accusations and Denials

Once his first marriage started to collapse, Mr. Trump faced his most serio=
us allegations of aggression toward women.

When =93Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,=94 by the journalis=
t Harry Hurt III, was released in 1993, it included a description of a nigh=
t in which Mr. Trump was said to have raped Ivana in a fit of rage. It also=
 included a statement from Ivana that Mr. Trump=92s lawyers insisted be pla=
ced in the front of the book. In the statement, she described an occasion o=
f =93marital relations=94 during which =93I felt violated, as the love and =
tenderness, which he normally exhibited toward me, was absent.=94

=93During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, =
I stated that my husband had raped me,=94 the statement said. =93I referred=
 to this as a =91rape,=92 but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a=
 literal or criminal sense.=94

Mr. Trump denied raping Ivana, and she did not respond to a request for com=
ment. After the allegation re-emerged in the news media last year, Ivana sa=
id in a statement<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/28/do=
nald-trump-aide-apologizes-for-saying-you-cant-rape-your-spouse/>, =93The s=
tory is totally without merit.=94

In the early 1990s, Jill Harth and her boyfriend at the time, George Houran=
ey, worked with Mr. Trump on a beauty pageant in Atlantic City, and later a=
ccused Mr. Trump of inappropriate behavior toward Ms. Harth during their bu=
siness dealings. In a 1996 deposition, Ms. Harth described their initial me=
eting with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower.

Donald Trump stared at me throughout that meeting. He stared at me even whi=
le George was giving his presentation. =85 In the middle of it he says to G=
eorge, =93Are you sleeping with her?=94 Meaning me. And George looked a lit=
tle shocked and he said, =93Well, yeah.=94 And he goes, =93Well, for the we=
ekend or what?=94

=96Jill Harth, former pageant promoter

Mr. Houraney said in a recent interview that he was shocked by Mr. Trump=92=
s response after he made clear that he and Ms. Harth were monogamous.

=93He said: =91Well, there=92s always a first time. I am going after her,=
=92 =94 Mr. Houraney recalled, adding: =93I thought the man was joking. I l=
aughed. He said, =91I am serious.=92 =94

By the time the three of them were having dinner at the Oak Room of the Pla=
za Hotel the next night, Mr. Trump=92s advances had turned physical, Ms. Ha=
rth said in the deposition.

=93Basically he name-dropped throughout that dinner, when he wasn=92t gropi=
ng me under the table,=94 she testified. =93Let me just say, this was a ver=
y traumatic thing working for him.=94

Ms. Harth, who declined to comment, gave the deposition in connection with =
a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump had failed to meet his obligations in a bu=
siness partnership. Mr. Trump settled that case but denied wrongdoing. Ms. =
Harth withdrew her own lawsuit against Mr. Trump alleging unwanted advances=
, but she has stood by her original claims.

Mr. Trump said it was Ms. Harth who had pursued him, and his office shared =
email messages in which Ms. Harth, over the past year, thanked Mr. Trump fo=
r helping her personally and professionally and expressed support for his p=
residential candidacy.

Defending His Record

Mr. Trump says the world misunderstands his relationship with women.

He sees himself as a promoter of women =97 a man whose business deals, like=
 the purchase of the struggling Miss Universe pageant, have given them unto=
ld opportunities for employment and advancement. =93Hundreds and hundreds o=
f women, thousands of women, are the better for it,=94 he said.

He has groomed his daughter, Ivanka, to run his company. And as a chief exe=
cutive, he said, he admires women for a work ethic that can exceed that of =
the men around them. Mr. Trump recalled a telling exchange with a female wo=
rker.

I=92ve said, =93Why don=92t you go home and take it easy now, just go relax=
.=94 =93No, Mr. Trump, I have to finish this job.=94 And I said, =93Boy, yo=
u really are a worker.=94 And it would just seem that there was something, =
that they want to really prove something, which is wonderful.

=96Mr. Trump

Several women who have held positions of power within the Trump Organizatio=
n in recent years said they had never known Mr. Trump to objectify women or=
 treat them with disrespect.

=93I think there are mischaracterizations about him,=94 said Jill Martin, a=
 vice president and assistant counsel at the company. Ms. Martin said Mr. T=
rump had enthusiastically supported her decision to have two children over =
the past five years, even when it meant working from home and scaling back =
on business travel.

=93That=92s hard with women lawyers,=94 she said. =93For me, he=92s made it=
 a situation where I can really excel at my job and still devote the time n=
ecessary for my family.=94

After competing in the 2009 Miss USA pageant, Laura Kirilova Chukanov, a Bu=
lgarian immigrant who lived in Utah, met with Mr. Trump in his New York off=
ice and explained that she wanted to make a documentary about her home coun=
try. Mr. Trump encouraged the project and followed through on a promise to =
put her in touch with his production company.

=93He genuinely wanted to know what I wanted to do with my life and how he =
could help,=94 Ms. Chukanov said.

A Damaging Critique

But when Mr. Trump lost confidence in women, he could inflict lasting damag=
e on their lives.

After Alicia Machado won the 1996 Miss Universe title, something very human=
 happened: She gained weight. Mr. Trump did not keep his critique of her ch=
anging body quiet =97 he publicly shamed her, she said.

I told the president of Miss Universe, a very sweet woman, I said I need so=
me time to recuperate, to rest, to exercise, to eat right. I asked them to =
bring me a doctor to help me =97 to have a special diet and get exercise, a=
nd they said yes. They took me to New York, installed me in a hotel. The ne=
xt day, they took me to the gym, and I=92m exposed to 90 media outlets. Don=
ald Trump was there. I had no idea that would happen.

I was about to cry in that moment with all the cameras there. I said, =93I =
don=92t want to do this, Mr. Trump.=94 He said, =93I don=92t care.=94

=96Alicia Machado, 1996 Miss Universe

Mr. Trump said he had pushed her to lose weight. =93To that, I will plead g=
uilty,=94 he said, expressing no regret for his tactics.

But the humiliation, Ms. Machado said, was unbearable. =93After that episod=
e, I was sick, anorexia and bulimia for five years,=94 she said. =93Over th=
e past 20 years, I=92ve gone to a lot of psychologists to combat this.=94

<h1 class=3D"title">Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women =
in Private</h1>
<p>Donald J. Trump had barely met Rowanne Brewer Lane when he asked her to =
change out of her clothes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donald was having a pool party at Mar-a-Lago. There were about 50 models=
 and 30 men. There were girls in the pools, splashing around. For some reas=
on Donald seemed a little smitten with me. He just started talking to me an=
d nobody else.</p>
<p>He suddenly took me by the hand, and he started to show me around the ma=
nsion. He asked me if I had a swimsuit with me. I said no. I hadn=92t inten=
ded to swim.
<strong>He took me into a room and opened drawers and asked me to put on a =
swimsuit.</strong></p>
<p><em>=96Rowanne Brewer Lane, former companion</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Brewer Lane, at the time a 26-year-old model, did as Mr. Trump asked=
. =93I went into the bathroom and tried one on,=94 she recalled. It was a b=
ikini. =93I came out, and he said, =91Wow.=92 =94</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, then 44 and in the midst of his first divorce, decided to sho=
w her off to the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Fla. =93He =
brought me out to the pool and said, =91That is a stunning Trump girl, isn=
=92t it?=92 =94 Ms. Brewer Lane said.</p>
<p>Donald Trump and women: The words evoke a familiar cascade of casual ins=
ults, hurled from the safe distance of a Twitter account, a radio show or a=
 campaign podium. This is the public treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, =
the presumptive Republican nominee
 for president: degrading, impersonal, performed. =93That must be a pretty =
picture, you dropping to your knees,=94 he told a female contestant on =93T=
he Apprentice.=94 Rosie O=92Donnell, he said, had a =93fat, ugly face.=94 A=
 lawyer who needed to pump milk for a newborn?
 =93Disgusting,=94 he said.</p>
<p>But the 1990 episode at Mar-a-Lago that Ms. Brewer Lane described was di=
fferent: a debasing face-to-face encounter between Mr. Trump and a young wo=
man he hardly knew. This is the private treatment of some women by Mr. Trum=
p, the up-close and more intimate
 encounters.</p>
<p>The New York Times interviewed dozens of women who had worked with or fo=
r Mr. Trump over the past four decades, in the worlds of real estate, model=
ing and pageants; women who had dated him or interacted with him socially; =
and women and men who had closely
 observed his conduct since his adolescence. In all, more than 50 interview=
s were conducted over the course of six weeks.</p>
<p>Their accounts =97 many relayed here in their own words =97 reveal unwel=
come romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, a shrewd re=
liance on ambitious women, and unsettling workplace conduct, according to t=
he interviews, as well as court records
 and written recollections. The interactions occurred in his offices at Tru=
mp Tower, at his homes, at construction sites and backstage at beauty pagea=
nts. They appeared to be fleeting, unimportant moments to him, but they lef=
t lasting impressions on the women
 who experienced them.</p>
<p>What emerges from the interviews is a complex, at times contradictory po=
rtrait of a wealthy, well-known and provocative man and the women around hi=
m, one that defies simple categorization. Some women found him gracious and=
 encouraging. He promoted several
 to the loftiest heights of his company, a daring move for a major real est=
ate developer at the time.</p>
<p>He simultaneously nurtured women=92s careers and mocked their physical a=
ppearance. =93You like your candy,=94 he told an overweight female executiv=
e who oversaw the construction of his headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. He=
 could be lewd one moment and gentlemanly
 the next.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Trump described himself as a champion of women, som=
eone who took pride in hiring them and was in awe of their work ethic. =93I=
t would just seem,=94 he said, =93that there was something that they want t=
o really prove.=94</p>
<p>Pressed on the women=92s claims, Mr. Trump disputed many of the details,=
 such as asking Ms. Brewer Lane to put on a swimsuit. =93A lot of things ge=
t made up over the years,=94 he said. =93I have always treated women with g=
reat respect. And women will tell you that.=94</p>
<p>But in many cases there was an unmistakable dynamic at play: Mr. Trump h=
ad the power, and the women did not. He had celebrity. He had wealth. He ha=
d connections. Even after he had behaved crudely toward them, some of the w=
omen sought his assistance with
 their careers or remained by his side.</p>
<p>For Ms. Brewer Lane, her introduction to Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago was the=
 start of a whirlwind romance =97 a heady blur of helicopter rides and high=
-end hotel rooms and flashing cameras.</p>
<p>=93It was intimidating,=94 she said. =93He was Donald Trump, obviously.=
=94</p>
<h4>Boarding School =91Ladies=92 Man=92</h4>
<p>It started at the New York Military Academy, a small, severe boarding sc=
hool 90 minutes north of New York City. Strictly enforced rules prohibited =
girls from setting foot on the all-boys campus unless it was a special occa=
sion. And on those special occasions,
 young Donald Trump paid careful mind to the kind of girls he brought to sc=
hool. They had to be gorgeous =97 10s, in his future parlance.</p>
<p>=93Donald was extremely sensitive to whether or not the women he invited=
 to campus were pretty,=94 recalled George White, a fellow student in the c=
lass of 1964.</p>
<p>=93For Donald,=94 he added, =93it=92s display.=94</p>
<p>He steadily built an image as a young playboy amid the deprivations of a=
 single-sex military school, where most boys craved but rarely enjoyed the =
company of a girl. By senior year, his classmates had crowned him =93ladies=
=92 man=94 in the yearbook, a nod to the
 volume of his dates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He wasn=92t bringing the same girl. He had a variety of girls coming up.=
 <strong>
Donald was bringing in very pretty women, very sophisticated women and very=
 well-dressed women.
</strong>You could always tell they were of a higher class.</p>
<p><em>=96George White, high school classmate</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked how he had earned the =93ladies=92 man=94 title, Mr. Trump at firs=
t demurred. =93I better not tell you =97 I=92ll get myself in trouble,=94 h=
e said. He later elaborated, saying he had =93a great feeling=94 and =93a g=
reat like=94 for women.</p>
<h4>The Alpha Trump</h4>
<p>Mr. Trump grew up with an influential role model for how to deal with wo=
men: Fred C. Trump, his powerful and unyielding father.</p>
<p>The elder Mr. Trump exerted control no matter how big or small the decis=
ion, as Ivana Zelnickova learned over dinner one night in the late 1970s. H=
er boyfriend, Donald Trump, had invited her to join his siblings and parent=
s at Tavern on the Green, the ornate
 restaurant in Central Park.</p>
<p>When the waiter came to take orders, Ivana made the mistake of asking fo=
r what she wanted. Fred Trump set her straight, she recalled in a previousl=
y unpublished interview with Michael D=92Antonio, the author of =93The Trut=
h About Trump.=94</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fred would order steak. Then Donald would order steak. =85 Everybody ord=
er steak. I told the waiter, =93I would like to have fish.=94 O.K., so I co=
uld have the fish.
<strong>And Fred would say to the waiter:</strong><strong> =93No, Ivana is =
not going to have a fish. She is going to have a steak.=94</strong> I said,=
 =93No, I=92m going to have my fish.=94 And Donald would come home and say,=
 =93Ivana, why would you have a fish instead
 of a steak?=94 I say, =93Because I=92m not going to be told by somebody to=
 have something which I don=92t want.=94</p>
<p><em>=96Ivana Trump, ex-wife</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Trump defended his father=92s conduct. =93He would=92ve said that ou=
t of love,=94 he said. If his father had overruled her fish order, Mr. Trum=
p said, =93he would have said that only on the basis that he thought, =91Th=
at would be better for her.=92 =94</p>
<p>The elder Mr. Trump did not hide his more traditional views on gender. W=
hen his son hired a woman,
<a href=3D"https://www.createspace.com/6026691">Barbara A. Res</a>, as his =
head of construction in the 1980s, Fred Trump was mystified and annoyed.</p=
>
<blockquote>
<p>Fred did not like the idea that Donald had hired me. =93A woman?=94 Dona=
ld told me that. But I could tell by the way Fred treated me. He used to sa=
y that all the time: =93You don=92t know what you are talking about.=94 Whe=
n I would complain to Donald about Fred, he
 would say, =93Fred didn=92t want me to hire you or didn=92t think it was a=
 woman=92s job.=94</p>
<p><em>=96Barbara A. Res, former Trump executive</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Trump said it was a different era. =93My father,=94 he said, =93prob=
ably never would have seen a woman in that position.=94</p>
<p>Mr. Trump still holds up his parents as models, praising his stay-at-hom=
e mother for understanding and accommodating a husband who worked almost no=
nstop.</p>
<p>=93My mother was always fine with it,=94 he said, recalling her =93brill=
iant=94 management of the situation. =93If something got interrupted becaus=
e he was going to inspect a housing site or something, she would handle tha=
t so beautifully.=94</p>
<p>=93She was an ideal woman,=94 he said.</p>
<h4>The Company of Women</h4>
<p>With his purchase of the Miss Universe Organization, Mr. Trump was now i=
n the business of young, beautiful women.</p>
<p>They craved his advice and approval, a fact he seemed to understand well=
.</p>
<p>Temple Taggart, the 21-year-old Miss Utah, was startled by how forward h=
e was with young contestants like her in 1997, his first year as the owner =
of Miss USA, a branch of the beauty pageant organization. As she recalls it=
, he introduced himself in an unusually
 intimate manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He kissed me directly on the lips. I thought, =93Oh my God, gros=
s.=94 </strong>
He was married to Marla Maples at the time. I think there were a few other =
girls that he kissed on the mouth. I was like =93Wow, that=92s inappropriat=
e.=94</p>
<p><em>=96Temple Taggart, 1997 Miss Utah USA</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Trump disputes this, saying he is reluctant to kiss strangers on the=
 lips. But Ms. Taggart said it was not an isolated incident.</p>
<p>At the gala celebration after the show, she said, Mr. Trump immediately =
zeroed in on her, telling her how much he liked her style and inviting her =
to visit him in New York to talk about her future. Soon enough, she said, h=
e delivered another unwelcome kiss
 on her lips, this time in Trump Tower. After boasting of his connections t=
o elite modeling agencies, he advised her to lie about her age to get ahead=
 in the industry, she said.</p>
<p>=93 =91We=92re going to have to tell them you=92re 17,=92 =94 Ms. Taggar=
t recalled him telling her, =93because in his mind, 21 is too old. I was li=
ke, =91No, we=92re not going to do that.=92 =94</p>
<p>His level of involvement in the pageants was unexpected, and his judgmen=
ts, the contestants said, could be harsh. Carrie Prejean, who was 21 when s=
he participated in the Miss USA contest in 2009 as Miss California, was sur=
prised to find Mr. Trump personally
 evaluating the women at rehearsal. =93We were told to put on our opening n=
umber outfits =97 they were nearly as revealing as our swimsuits =97 and li=
ne up for him onstage,=94 she wrote in her memoir, =93Still Standing.=94</p=
>
<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump walked out with his entourage and inspected us closer than =
any general ever inspected a platoon. He would stop in front of a girl, loo=
k her up and down, and say, =93Hmmm.=94 Then he would go on and do the same=
 thing to the next girl. He took notes
 on a little pad as he went along. After he did this, Trump said: =93O.K. I=
 want all the girls to come forward.=94 =85</p>
<p>Donald Trump looked at Miss Alabama.</p>
<p>=93Come here,=94 he said.</p>
<p>She took one more step forward.</p>
<p>=93Tell me, who=92s the most beautiful woman here?=94</p>
<p>Miss Alabama=92s eyes swam around.</p>
<p>=93Besides me?=94 she said. =93Uh, I like Arkansas. She=92s sweet.=94</p=
>
<p><strong>=93I don=92t care if she=92s sweet,=94 Donald Trump said. =93Is =
she hot?=94 =85</strong></p>
<p>It became clear that the point of the whole exercise was for him to divi=
de the room between girls he personally found attractive and those he did n=
ot. Many of the girls found the exercise humiliating. Some of the girls wer=
e sobbing backstage after he left,
 devastated to have failed even before the competition really began to impr=
ess =93The Donald.=94</p>
<p><em>=96Carrie Prejean, 2009 Miss California USA</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Trump, in an interview, said he would =93never do that.=94 Such beha=
vior, he said, would bruise egos and hurt feelings. =93I wouldn=92t hurt pe=
ople,=94 he said. =93That=92s hurtful to people.=94</p>
<h4>A Preoccupation With Bodies</h4>
<p>Mr. Trump was not just fixated on the appearance of the women around him=
. He possessed an almost compulsive need to talk about it.</p>
<p>Inside the Trump Organization, the company that manages his various busi=
nesses, he occasionally interrupted routine discussions of business to opin=
e on women=92s figures. Barbara Res, his construction executive, remembered=
 a meeting in which she and Mr. Trump
 interviewed an architect for a project in the Los Angeles area. Out of the=
 blue, she said, Mr. Trump evaluated the fitness of women in Marina del Rey=
, Calif. =93They take care of their asses,=94 he said.</p>
<p>=93The architect and I didn=92t know where he was coming from,=94 Ms. Re=
s said. Years later, after she had gained a significant amount of weight, M=
s. Res endured a stinging workplace observation about her own body from Mr.=
 Trump. =93 =91You like your candy,=92 =94 she
 recalled him telling her. =93It was him reminding me that I was overweight=
.=94</p>
<p>Her colleague Louise Sunshine experienced similar observations from Mr. =
Trump when she gained weight. But she saw it as friendly encouragement, not=
 a cruel insult. =93He thought I looked much better thin,=94 she said. =93H=
e would remind me of how beautiful I was.=94</p>
<p>Whenever possible, Mr. Trump wanted his visitors to see his most attract=
ive employees, as Ms. Res learned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a big meeting once. I grabbed one of the women in the office and =
sent her in to get lunch orders. Donald said, =93Not her.=94 She didn=92t l=
ook great. He got another woman to take the lunch orders. That was purely a=
bout looks.
<strong>He wanted the people in that room to think that all the women who w=
orked for him were beautiful.</strong></p>
<p><em>=96Ms. Res </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Trump frequently sought assurances =97 at times from strangers =97 t=
hat the women in his life were beautiful. During the 1997 Miss Teen USA pag=
eant, he sat in the audience as his teenage daughter, Ivanka, helped to hos=
t the event from onstage. He turned
 to Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee, Miss Universe at the time, and asked fo=
r her opinion of his daughter=92s body.</p>
<p>=93 =91Don=92t you think my daughter=92s hot? She=92s hot, right?=92 =94=
 Ms. Lee recalled him saying. =91I was like, =91Really?=92 That=92s just we=
ird. She was 16. That=92s creepy.=94</p>
<p>Ms. Brewer Lane, who dated Mr. Trump for several months in 1990 and earl=
y 1991, said it did not take long for him to solicit her view on the attrac=
tiveness of two of his previous romantic partners, Marla Maples and Ivana T=
rump.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He did ask me, on a scale of 1 to 10, what I thought of Marla.</=
strong> I thought that was very boyish of him. He asked me the same thing a=
bout Ivana. I said, obviously, she is your wife. A beautiful woman. What co=
uld you say but a 10? I am not going
 to judge your wife.</p>
<p><em>=96Ms. Brewer Lane</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Trump said he did not know Ms. Brewer Lane very well, despite dating=
 her. =93I wouldn=92t have asked anybody about how they rate other women,=
=94 he said.</p>
<h4>Kissing, and Telling Everyone</h4>
<p>He liked to brag about his sexual prowess and his desirability as a date=
, no matter who was around.</p>
<p>Barbara J. Fife, a deputy mayor under David N. Dinkins, New York=92s may=
or in the early 1990s, was not especially close to Mr. Trump. But that did =
not stop him from telling her why he was in such a hurry one day as he sat =
in her office at City Hall.</p>
<p>=93I have this great date tonight with a model for Victoria=92s Secret,=
=94 Ms. Fife recalled him telling her.</p>
<p>=93I saw it as immature, quite honestly,=94 she said.</p>
<p>At his office in Trump Tower, Mr. Trump seemed eager for his colleagues =
to hear about his new companion, Ms. Maples. When The New York Post feasted=
 on her supposed satisfaction with him in bed, captured in the headline =93=
Best Sex I=92ve Ever Had,=94 Mr. Trump
 was unabashed, Ms. Res said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He absolutely loved that. He waved it around the office. =93Did you see =
this?=94 Everyone who worked there were kind of horrified. We all thought i=
t made him look bad. He didn=92t.</p>
<p><em>=96Ms. Res</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Trump denies boasting about the headline. He seems more bashful thes=
e days, saying he cannot recall how many women he has dated. =93Not as many=
 as people would think,=94 he said. =93I=92m not somebody that really loved=
 the dating process.=94</p>
<h4>Women as Trusted Colleagues</h4>
<p>To build his business, Mr. Trump turned to women for a simple reason: Th=
ey worked hard =97 often harder than men, he told them.</p>
<p>When Mr. Trump hired Ms. Res to oversee the construction of Trump Tower,=
 he invited her to his apartment on Fifth Avenue and explained that he want=
ed her to be his =93Donna Trump=94 on the project, she said. Few women had =
reached such stature in the industry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He said: =93I know you=92re a woman in a man=92s world. <strong>And whil=
e men tend to be better than women, a good woman is better than 10 good men=
.=94</strong> =85 He thought he was really complimenting me.</p>
<p><em>=96Ms. Res</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He entrusted several women in his company with enormous responsibility =
=97 once they had proven themselves worthy and loyal. Ms. Sunshine had litt=
le experience in real estate, but as a top campaign fund-raiser for Gov. Hu=
gh Carey of New York, she had fulfilled
 a lifelong wish for Mr. Trump: She secured him a vanity license plate with=
 his initials, DJT, which adorned his limousine for years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It=92s something he had wanted since his father bought him toy cars. By =
some gift of God, I was able to obtain it for him. He was beyond thrilled. =
And I became the woman in his life who could do no wrong. And he became the=
 man in my life who was going to be
 my mentor.</p>
<p><em>=96Louise Sunshine, former Trump executive</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Sunshine worked for Mr. Trump for 15 years, becoming a major New Yor=
k real estate figure in her own right. Ms. Res remained at the company for =
12 years, left after a disagreement over a project and then returned as a c=
onsultant for six more years. Both
 expressed gratitude for the chances Mr. Trump had taken on them.</p>
<p>In a rough-and-tumble industry thoroughly dominated by men, Mr. Trump=92=
s office stood out for its diversity, recalled Alan Lapidus, an influential=
 architect who designed the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is a lot more complicated than the cartoon character. The top people =
in his company were women, like Barbara Res. For any company to hire a woma=
n as chief of construction was actually startling. I don=92t know of a sing=
le other developer who had a woman
 in that position. The respect for women was always there. That=92s why, in=
 spite of the comments he makes now =97 and God knows why he says these thi=
ngs =97 when he was building his empire, the backbone was women.</p>
<p><em>=96Alan Lapidus, architect</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Dismissive Nicknames</h4>
<p>To women who had climbed to positions of power outside his company, Mr. =
Trump=92s behavior could feel like a jarring throwback.</p>
<p>Alair A. Townsend was for a time the highest-ranking woman inside New Yo=
rk=92s City Hall during the Koch administration, with the title of deputy m=
ayor for economic development. But when Mr. Trump called her, she said, her=
 position seemed less relevant to
 him than her gender.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was dismissive. <strong>It was always, =93Hon,=94 =93Dear.=94 Things =
he wouldn=92t have said to a man.</strong> It was designed to make you feel=
 small. And he did that repeatedly.</p>
<p><em>=96Alair A. Townsend, former deputy mayor</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was an unthinking habit when he interacted with women, colleagues sai=
d. =93At Trump Tower,=94 said Ms. Res, his longtime colleague, =93he called=
 me Honey Bunch.=94</p>
<h4>Wife and Partner, and Regret</h4>
<p>No single figure better encapsulated the paradoxes of Mr. Trump=92s trea=
tment of women in the workplace than his first wife, Ivana.</p>
<p>He entrusted her with major pieces of a corporate empire and gave her th=
e titles to match. She was the president of Trump=92s Castle, a major casin=
o in Atlantic City, and the Plaza Hotel, the storied complex on Central Par=
k South in Manhattan. =93She ran that
 hotel,=94 Ms. Res said. =93And she ran it well.=94</p>
<p>But he compensated her as a spouse, not a high-level employee, paying he=
r an annual salary of $1 for the Trump=92s Castle job, according to her tax=
 documents. And he grew to resent her outsize role. By the end of their mar=
riage, Mr. Trump wrote in his 1997
 book, =93The Art of the Comeback,=94 he regretted having allowed her to ru=
n his businesses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My big mistake with Ivana was taking her out of the role of wife and all=
owing her to run one of my casinos in Atlantic City, then the Plaza Hotel.
<strong>The problem was, work was all she wanted to talk about.</strong> Wh=
en I got home at night, rather than talking about the softer subjects of li=
fe, she wanted to tell me how well the Plaza was doing, or what a great day=
 the casino had.</p>
<p>I will never again give a wife responsibility within my business.</p>
<p><em>=96Donald J. Trump, presumptive Republican nominee</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He seems to have kept his word. His current wife, Melania, has marketed =
her own lines of beauty products and jewelry. But Mr. Trump remains mostly =
uninvolved in her work. After calling it =93very successful,=94 he struggle=
d to describe it.</p>
<p>=93What is it on television with the sales?=94 he asked. =93What do they=
 call that? Not Home Shopping, the other one.=94</p>
<h4>Accusations and Denials</h4>
<p>Once his first marriage started to collapse, Mr. Trump faced his most se=
rious allegations of aggression toward women.</p>
<p>When =93Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,=94 by the journa=
list Harry Hurt III, was released in 1993, it included a description of a n=
ight in which Mr. Trump was said to have raped Ivana in a fit of rage. It a=
lso included a statement from Ivana
 that Mr. Trump=92s lawyers insisted be placed in the front of the book. In=
 the statement, she described an occasion of =93marital relations=94 during=
 which =93I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally ex=
hibited toward me, was absent.=94</p>
<p>=93During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial cas=
e, I stated that my husband had raped me,=94 the statement said. =93I refer=
red to this as a =91rape,=92 but I do not want my words to be interpreted i=
n a literal or criminal sense.=94</p>
<p>Mr. Trump denied raping Ivana, and she did not respond to a request for =
comment. After the allegation re-emerged in the news media last year, Ivana
<a href=3D"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/28/donald-tr=
ump-aide-apologizes-for-saying-you-cant-rape-your-spouse/">
said in a statement</a>, =93The story is totally without merit.=94</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Jill Harth and her boyfriend at the time, George Hou=
raney, worked with Mr. Trump on a beauty pageant in Atlantic City, and late=
r accused Mr. Trump of inappropriate behavior toward Ms. Harth during their=
 business dealings. In a 1996 deposition,
 Ms. Harth described their initial meeting with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower.</=
p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump stared at me throughout that meeting. He stared at me even =
while George was giving his presentation. =85 In the middle of it he says t=
o George,
<strong>=93Are you sleeping with her?=94</strong> Meaning me. And George lo=
oked a little shocked and he said, =93Well, yeah.=94 And he goes, =93Well, =
for the weekend or what?=94</p>
<p><em>=96Jill Harth, former pageant promoter</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Houraney said in a recent interview that he was shocked by Mr. Trump=
=92s response after he made clear that he and Ms. Harth were monogamous.</p=
>
<p>=93He said: =91Well, there=92s always a first time. I am going after her=
,=92 =94 Mr. Houraney recalled, adding: =93I thought the man was joking. I =
laughed. He said, =91I am serious.=92 =94</p>
<p>By the time the three of them were having dinner at the Oak Room of the =
Plaza Hotel the next night, Mr. Trump=92s advances had turned physical, Ms.=
 Harth said in the deposition.</p>
<p>=93Basically he name-dropped throughout that dinner, when he wasn=92t gr=
oping me under the table,=94 she testified. =93Let me just say, this was a =
very traumatic thing working for him.=94</p>
<p>Ms. Harth, who declined to comment, gave the deposition in connection wi=
th a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump had failed to meet his obligations in a=
 business partnership. Mr. Trump settled that case but denied wrongdoing. M=
s. Harth withdrew her own lawsuit
 against Mr. Trump alleging unwanted advances, but she has stood by her ori=
ginal claims.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump said it was Ms. Harth who had pursued him, and his office shar=
ed email messages in which Ms. Harth, over the past year, thanked Mr. Trump=
 for helping her personally and professionally and expressed support for hi=
s presidential candidacy.</p>
<h4>Defending His Record</h4>
<p>Mr. Trump says the world misunderstands his relationship with women.</p>
<p>He sees himself as a promoter of women =97 a man whose business deals, l=
ike the purchase of the struggling Miss Universe pageant, have given them u=
ntold opportunities for employment and advancement. =93Hundreds and hundred=
s of women, thousands of women, are
 the better for it,=94 he said.</p>
<p>He has groomed his daughter, Ivanka, to run his company. And as a chief =
executive, he said, he admires women for a work ethic that can exceed that =
of the men around them. Mr. Trump recalled a telling exchange with a female=
 worker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I=92ve said, =93Why don=92t you go home and take it easy now, just go re=
lax.=94 =93No, Mr. Trump, I have to finish this job.=94 And I said, =93Boy,=
 you really are a worker.=94 And it would just seem that there was somethin=
g, that they want to really prove something, which
 is wonderful.</p>
<p><em>=96Mr. Trump</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several women who have held positions of power within the Trump Organiza=
tion in recent years said they had never known Mr. Trump to objectify women=
 or treat them with disrespect.</p>
<p>=93I think there are mischaracterizations about him,=94 said Jill Martin=
, a vice president and assistant counsel at the company. Ms. Martin said Mr=
. Trump had enthusiastically supported her decision to have two children ov=
er the past five years, even when it
 meant working from home and scaling back on business travel.</p>
<p>=93That=92s hard with women lawyers,=94 she said. =93For me, he=92s made=
 it a situation where I can really excel at my job and still devote the tim=
e necessary for my family.=94</p>
<p>After competing in the 2009 Miss USA pageant, Laura Kirilova Chukanov, a=
 Bulgarian immigrant who lived in Utah, met with Mr. Trump in his New York =
office and explained that she wanted to make a documentary about her home c=
ountry. Mr. Trump encouraged the
 project and followed through on a promise to put her in touch with his pro=
duction company.</p>
<p>=93He genuinely wanted to know what I wanted to do with my life and how =
he could help,=94 Ms. Chukanov said.</p>
<h4>A Damaging Critique</h4>
<p>But when Mr. Trump lost confidence in women, he could inflict lasting da=
mage on their lives.</p>
<p>After Alicia Machado won the 1996 Miss Universe title, something very hu=
man happened: She gained weight. Mr. Trump did not keep his critique of her=
 changing body quiet =97 he publicly shamed her, she said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I told the president of Miss Universe, a very sweet woman, I said I need=
 some time to recuperate, to rest, to exercise, to eat right. I asked them =
to bring me a doctor to help me =97 to have a special diet and get exercise=
, and they said yes. They took me
