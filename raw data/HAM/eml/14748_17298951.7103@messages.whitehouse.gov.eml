THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the First Lady

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

April 27, 2016



*First Lady Joins Team USA to Announce Nationwide Commitments to Get Near=
ly Two Million Kids Active This Year*



New York, NY  Today, First Lady Michelle Obama joined U.S. Olympians, Par=
alympians, and Rio hopefuls at the US Olympic Committees 100 Day Countdow=
n event in Times Square to announce nationwide commitments to get nearly =
two million American children active as part of her"Lets Move!" [ http://=
www.letsmove.gov/ ] initiative. Mrs. Obama is working to turn the inspira=
tion of the Olympic and Paralympic Games into action by getting more kids=
 healthy and active. Through commitments to the Partnership for a Healthi=
er America (PHA) by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) and USOC N=
ational Governing Bodies for sport, including USA Archery, USA Basketball=
, USA Cycling/USA BMX, US Equestrian Federation, USA Fencing, USA Field H=
ockey, USA Gymnastics, USA Handball, USA Judo, USA Swimming, USA Synchron=
ized Swimming, US Tennis Association (USTA) Foundation, USA Track & Field=
, USA Triathlon, USA Weightlifting, and USA Wrestling, these organization=
s will provide beginner athletic programming to kids throughout the next =
year.=20



To build on the inspiration of the Summer Games, NBC Olympics is providin=
g a path to the playing field, pool, gymnasium and court through Gold Map=
 , a program that leads young Olympic viewers on a journey that begins wi=
th watching the Games on their television sets and ends with their partic=
ipation in an Olympic sport in their local area. Visit NBCOlympics.com/Go=
ldMap [ http://www.nbcolympics.com/GoldMap ] to learn more.



We want our young people to be inspired by the amazing stories of our Oly=
mpic and Paralympic athletes. And we dont just want our young people to w=
atch these Olympic sports  we want them to get active and try these sport=
s out for themselves, said First Lady Michelle Obama. Thats why I am so t=
hrilled to announce that the USOC and 16 of its national governing bodies=
 will be providing opportunities for nearly two million kids across Ameri=
ca to participate in Olympic sports right in their own communities.



Team USA was honored to be joined by Mrs. Obama today as we celebrated th=
e 100 Day Countdown to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. Its an exciting time f=
or our athletes and for fans across the country, and its the perfect time=
 to launch our collaborative efforts with Mrs. Obama and the "Let's Move!=
" initiative, said Scott Blackmun, CEO of the US Olympic Committee. The m=
ore we can do to expose children to Olympic and Paralympic sports, the he=
althier and happier they will be. We're thrilled to harness the incredibl=
e interest in the 2016 Games to promote active, healthy lifestyles, and t=
o encourage the next generation of Team USA all-stars.=20



Every two years Team USA inspires us to reach higher, go faster and be st=
ronger as we try and emulate their accomplishments. And today, with these=
 new commitments more children will have access to the tools, facilities,=
 coaching and support to do just that, said PHA President and CEO Larry S=
oler. Active kids do better and the Olympic Games is a perfect time to re=
mind everyone that you dont have to train like an Olympic athlete to get =
moving  you just have to get up and be active.



Mrs. Obama has been leading a nationwide effort to help kids and families=
 lead healthier lives over the last six years. The"Lets Move!" initiative=
 is a comprehensive, collaborative, and community-oriented initiative tha=
t has sought to engage every sector of society to tackle head-on the vari=
ous factors that lead to childhood obesity. Todays announcement is a sign=
ificant step towards providing children across the country with opportuni=
ties to be physically active.



The Partnership for a Healthier America secured the following commitments=
 from the USOC and several of its National Governing Bodies (NGBs). PHA a=
nd USOC will work with each of these groups to evaluate and monitor their=
 progress and continue to develop additional commitments to get kids acti=
