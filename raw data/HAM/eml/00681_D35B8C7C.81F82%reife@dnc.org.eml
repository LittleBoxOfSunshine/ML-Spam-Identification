HI all =97 We=92ll send this to Factivists tomorrow. Thanks!

Hey there, NAME =97
Remember that classic =9180s movie where high school kids from all differen=
t walks of life come together over weekend detention and realize they=92re =
not so different after all? Well, Speaker Paul Ryan and the Republican Part=
y=92s presumptive nominee for president, Donald Trump, spent some time toge=
ther on Thursday morning and realized there is plenty they have in common.

In fact, they issued a statement (just like The Breakfast Club=92s assignme=
nt!) saying how crucial it was that "Republicans unite around our shared pr=
inciples, advance a conservative agenda, and do all we can to win this fall=
,=94 and =93while we recognize our few differences, we recognize that there=
 are also many important areas of common ground=94 and ultimately "remain c=
onfident there=92s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall=
.=94
Yes, the Republican Party is unifying around a candidate who has stoked hat=
red and intolerance so much, some of his biggest fans are white nationalist=
s:

Whose approval rating among women is historically low =97 with good reason:

https://twitter.com/DNCWomen/status/730817363583602688

And who is at odds with our most fundamental American values:

https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/730858701498793985

But really, it shouldn=92t surprise Speaker Ryan =97 or anyone else, for th=
at matter =97 that he should be able to find common ground with Donald Trum=
p. After all, Trump=92s candidacy has given the Republican Party what they=
=92ve been asking for after years of sowing seeds of fear, hatred, greed, a=
nd intolerance:

The stakes have never been higher for electing Democrats this November, NAM=
E. Especially when the Republican nominee is as resistant to facts and fact=
-checking as Trump is, your job is more important than ever to get the word=
 out to your family, friends, and neighbors on what a disaster Trump =97 an=
d the rest of his Republican Party =97 would be for our country, so tweet, =
share, and forward this email to everyone you can.

Thanks for your help, and talk soon!
