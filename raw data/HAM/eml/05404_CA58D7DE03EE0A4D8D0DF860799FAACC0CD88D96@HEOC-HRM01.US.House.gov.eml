Speaker Ryan and his House Republican Conference say they're shocked at pre=
sumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump=92s appalling policies and d=
espicable rhetoric.  Yet for years, Republicans in Congress have advanced t=
he same kind of extremist, reprehensible language and discriminatory legisl=
ation.

Americans aren't buying the GOP's surprised attitude.  As Democratic Leader=
 Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats leaders said yesterday: there=92s =93not =
a dime's worth of difference<http://www.reuters.com/video/2016/05/11/pelosi=
-not-a-dimes-worth-of-difference-b?videoId=3D368453173>=94 between<http://w=
ww.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/house-republicans-in-their-own-words/> Tru=
mp and House Republicans.


POLITICO<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/nancy-pelosi-paul-ryan-trump=
-support-223058>:



House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday blasted House Speaker Paul =
Ryan and other Republicans in the chamber who have been unwilling to suppor=
t Donald Trump.



=93Some Republicans, including members of their leadership, have said they =
cannot support the vile rhetoric and radical proposals of the Republican fr=
ont-runner,=94 Pelosi said at the outset of a news conference convened by H=
ouse Democrats. =93Today, we have gathered to ask, since when? Since when h=
ave the House Republicans been so concerned about intolerant statements and=
 discriminatory ideas?=94



Pelosi said Republicans appear to be surprised by the rhetoric Trump and fo=
rmer GOP candidates deployed on the campaign trail. =93But year after year,=
 Republicans have enthusiastically turned their intolerance and their discr=
imination into legislation,=94 she said.



The California Democrat argued that there isn=92t =93a dime=92s worth of di=
fference=94 between Trump and Republicans in the lower chamber, remarking t=
hat House Republicans attacked women=92s health care a dozen times and thre=
atened a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding.



 =93The Republicans have created an environment in radicalism, fear and exc=
lusion,=94 Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said. =93The presumptive nominee is th=
e result of their work, and what they have sowed is what they are reaping.=
=94



The Hill<http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/279550-dems-house-gop-just-=
like-trump>:



=93What has happened in this campaign is that Donald Trump has pulled back =
the veil,=94 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday d=
uring a press briefing in the Capitol. =93What he says, is what they say, a=
nd now people can see the connection between them.=94



Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the minority whip, piled on, accusing the Republi=
cans of =93creating an environment of radicalism, fear and exclusion=94 tha=
t echoes in Trump=92s message.



=93The presumptive nominee is the result of their work,=94 Hoyer charged. =
=93And what they have sowed they are now reaping.=94



GOP criticism of Trump hit a highpoint last week when Speaker Paul Ryan (Wi=
s.), the highest-ranking Republican in Washington, took the extraordinary s=
tep of refusing to endorse Trump=92s bid, citing concerns with the tenor of=
 Trump's message as well as policy positions that run counter to Ryan's con=
servative leanings.



=93Since when have the House Republicans been so concerned about intolerant=
 statements and discriminatory ideas?=94 Pelosi asked.



=93They appear to be shocked by their candidate =85 by their rhetoric on th=
e campaign trail. But year after year, Republicans have enthusiastically tu=
rned their intolerance and their discrimination into legislation,=94 she ad=
ded. =93Whether it's insulting President Obama, women, immigrants, Muslims,=
 LGBT Americans =96=96 there's not a dime's worth of difference between wha=
t Donald Trump says and what the House Republicans have been saying all alo=
ng.=94



The Democrats unveiled a video highlighting statements by rank-and-file mem=
bers.



In one clip, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) claims that an overwhelming majority =
of undocumented immigrants are drug smugglers =93with calves the size of ca=
ntaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.=
=94



In another, Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), former chairman of the Homeland Secur=
ity Committee, says he =93absolutely=94 promotes the universal surveillance=
 of mosques and Muslim communities.



Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) promotes his bill to ban abortions after 20 wee=
ks by claiming that the =93incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are ver=
y low.=94



And Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-Texas), in still another clip, decries the =93fas=
cist intolerance=94 of gay rights advocates, comparing them to Nazis.



Rep. Joe Crowley (N.Y.), vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus, said such =
statements have given rise to Trump, and any Republicans lamenting their pr=
esidential frontrunner have only themselves to blame.



Rep. Jim Clyburn (S.C.), the third-ranking House Democrat and a leading mem=
ber of the Congressional Black Caucus, took the argument back much further,=
 maintaining that Trump's bellicose message has roots in other Republican c=
ampaigns of decades past. He cited Barry Goldwater's opposition to the Civi=
l Rights Act; Richard Nixon's "Southern Strategy;" and Ronald Reagan's camp=
aign speech outside Philadelphia, Miss., where three civil rights activists=
 had been murdered by white supremacists in 1964.



Huffington Post<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-democrats-donald-=

=85House Democratic leaders argued that Republicans over the years created =
the very environment in which the former reality TV star has risen politica=
lly.



Throughout his campaign, Trump has tried to isolate disadvantaged groups, s=
tarting with Mexican immigrants, whom he described as =93criminals=94 and =
=93rapists.=94 As president, he said, he would ban Muslims from entering th=
e U.S. He referred to Fox News host Megyn Kelly=92s menstrual cycle when ac=
cusing her of asking unfair questions.



=93The list goes on,=94 said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).



A brief video, played at the Democrats=92 press conference, showed Republic=
ans making similar comments years before Trump entered the political scene.



Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) was heard in one clip standing by his 2007 remarks=
 to Politico that there =93are too many mosques in this country.=94 In anot=
her clip, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) compared LGBT rights advocates to Na=
zis. And in a 2013 clip, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) claimed that undocumented=
 immigrants have =93calves the size of cantaloupes=94 because they are carr=
ying drugs across the border.



Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) took the story back even further to the 1960s, =
when he said Republican candidate Barry Goldwater kicked off his presidenti=
al campaign with opposition to the Civil Rights Act. Next, GOP candidate Ri=
chard Nixon built his run for the White House on what Nixon dubbed the =93S=
outhern strategy,=94 said Clyburn.



Morning Consult<https://morningconsult.com/alert/democrats-campaigning-trum=

=85House Democratic leaders played a video designed to flesh out their cent=
ral argument about why voters should choose their party in November. They s=
ay that Donald Trump=92s controversial rhetoric=85been used by House Republ=
icans for years.



=93House Republicans in their own words,=94 a title card reads at the start=
, as a piano recording of =93Battle Hymn of the Republic=94 begins in the b=
ackground. The video then launches into a montage of House Republicans on c=
amera saying that mosques should be kept under government surveillance or t=
hat President Obama may not have been born in the United States and arguing=
 that federal funds to Planned Parenthood should be curtailed.



=93There=92s not a dime=92s worth of difference between what Donald Trump s=
ays and what House Republicans have been saying all along,=94 House Minorit=
y Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters on Wednesday. =93Our point =
is, since when =97 all of a sudden =97 is this very same rhetoric appalling=
 to the Republican leadership and some of the Republican establishment?=94



=93Donald Trump is the offspring of Republicans in Congress,=94 echoed Rep.=
 Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), chairmen of the House Democratic Caucus.

During a press conference Wednesday addressing how presumptive Republican p=

While trying to provide examples of how Trump=92s words allegedly mirror wh=
at House Republicans have been saying, Pelosi said there was a prepared vid=
eo she was unable to show because of House rules.



She said, =93But if you saw a side-by-side, you=92d see his birther remarks=
 and their birther remarks. His anti-Muslim remarks and their building wall=

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi released a new video on Wednesday that b=
lasts Republican lawmakers for embracing the policies and positions of thei=
r party's presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump.



The video does not mention Trump by name, but instead uses a series of soun=
dbites taken from interviews and floor speeches given by congressional Repu=
blicans to further substantiate the Democrats' claims that Trump and House =
Republicans are anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-women, and anti-LGBT.



Statements made by Republican Reps. Peter King of New York, Steve King of I=
owa, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and Louie Gohmert of Texas, among other=
s, about immigrants, monitoring mosques and ending the federal funding of P=
lanned Parenthood are featured in the video.



"House Republicans: The Party of Radicalism and Fear," the screen reads aft=
er nearly two minutes of soundbites.



Pelosi released the video during a press conference Wednesday morning as pa=
rt of the Democrats' effort to win back a majority in both chambers now tha=
t Republicans face a rift in their own party with Trump as their nominee. S=
he argued that Republicans can't pretend to be shocked by Trump's controver=
sial comments when they agree with so much of what Trump says.



"[D]on't you wonder why, and since when, all of the sudden, [the] Republica=
n establishment is appalled by the comments of what Donald Trump is saying =
when it's what we hear here every day?" she asked.

Donald-Nancy-Pelosi-gives-Trump-nickname-hammering-House-Republicans-just-i=
ntolerant-discriminatory-presumptive-GOP-nominee.html>:



Pelosi and four other top Democrats took turns quoting House Republicans an=
d comparing their comments to those of Trump, who will make an appearance t=
omorrow in Washington and meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan who has sporadi=
cally condemned The Donald's remarks.



'Today we gather to ask, "Since when?"' said Pelosi, taking the podium. 'Si=
nce when have the House Republicans been so concerned about intolerant stat=
ements and discriminatory ideas?'



Pelosi, along with Reps. Steny Hoyer, Jim Clyburn, Xavier Becerra and James=
 Crowley, all members of the House Democratic leadership, took turns giving=
 examples of comments the Republicans have made, including Rep. Joe Wilson'=
s famous 'you lie' during the State of the Union and Rep. Steve King's 'cal=
ves the size of cantaloupes' aimed at immigrants coming from Mexico and sou=
th.



'On the evening of [Obama's] inauguration, [Republicans] met at a local res=
taurant to plot their program of undercutting and undermining his authority=
 as president of the United States and, as if on cue, Donald Trump picked u=
p his efforts to lead the birther movement,' Clyburn pointed out.



'But he didn't stop with just the birth certificate. He began to raise issu=
e with the president's college transcripts as if not only to delegitimize h=
im as president, but to devalue him as a human being,' Clyburn continued.



The Democrats also played a video of some of what they considered to be the=
 most heinous quotes.



'Since when has the Republican leadership in this House been appalled by an=
ti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBT, anti-Barack Obama, anti-woman comment=
s made by their members?' she mused.



PJ Media<https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2016/05/11/house-dem-leaders=
-gop-environment-of-radicalism-fear-and-exclusion-preceded-trump/>:



House Democratic leaders began their press conference today by showing a vi=
deo of Republican lawmakers saying things that, Minority Leader Nancy Pelos=
i (D-Calif.) argued, proves they're no different than Donald Trump.



The video includes quotes from Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) on surveillance of =
Muslims, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) on Mexican drug smugglers, Rep. Marsha Bl=
ackburn (R-Tenn.) on defunding Planned Parenthood, and more.



"All we could present to you today is what they had said in an official set=
ting. In another setting off campus, we will show you what they have said o=
n the campaign trail... I said there's not a dime's worth of difference bet=
ween Donald Trump and the House Republicans what they say. Attacks on women=
 in the Congress are a dime a dozen. Republicans use taxpayer funds to crea=
te a panel to attack women's health and advance a plan of blatant intimidat=
ion," Pelosi told reporters.



"They are taking names. They are taking names. You saw that chairwoman of t=
hat committee, Congresswoman Blackburn, they are taking names. Does that so=
und familiar? Republican Trent Franks tries to roll back women's access to =
comprehensive healthcare because he thinks rape can't cause pregnancy, and =
he's a Judiciary Subcommittee chair. Meanwhile, again, Marsha Blackburn say=
s women don't want equal pay and Speaker Ryan calls leave for families an u=
nfunded mandated while he says people should have time to spend with their =
families but -- personally, but not to support it officially."



Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) added that "the Republicans have created =
an environment of radicalism, fear and exclusion."



"The presumptive nominee is the result of their work, and what they have so=
wed they are now reaping," Hoyer said. "Tomorrow, House Republicans will we=
lcome Donald Trump to Capitol Hill, someone who supports legislation to all=
ow businesses to refuse services to LGBT people and their families; segrega=
tion revisited. But this is nothing new, as the leader has said. In fact, H=
ouse Republicans have been supporting policy that expressly discriminate ag=
ainst Americans based on who they are or who they love."



Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.) charged that "from day o=
ne, Republican leaders and operatives have orchestrated a program of unprec=
edented disrespect for President Barack Obama... and as if on cue, Donald T=
rump picked up his efforts to lead the birther movement."

:



Pelosi and other Democrats gathered to make the case that as shocking as so=
me of Trump's comments can be, he is mirroring many of the same things Hous=
e Republicans have said over the last few years. Democrats put together a v=
ideo showing Republicans making what they say are anti-woman and anti-immig=
rant comments.



Pelosi said a side-by-side of Trump and GOP members could have easily been =
made by the press, but said Democrats were happy to help do it for reporter=
s. She said some late-night TV shows have made these comparisons, and said =
she hopes the "traditional press" will start doing the same.
