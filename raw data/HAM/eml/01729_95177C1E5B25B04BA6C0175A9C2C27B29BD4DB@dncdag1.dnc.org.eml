What happened to the =91best=92 people for Trump?<https://www.washingtonpos=
t.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/05/10/what-happened-to-the-best-people-for-t=
rump/?postshare=3D2111462909337433&tid=3Dss_tw>
WASHINGTON POST // JENNIFER RUBIN

Throughout the campaign, Donald Trump boasted that he would get =93great=94=
 people, the =93best=94 people to work for him. As the campaign wore on, it=
 turned out the best people did not want to work for him. He came up with a=
 hodgepodge of under-qualified or downright flaky foreign policy advisers<h=
ttps://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/03/03/whos-feeding-t=
rump-those-nutty-foreign-policy-ideas/>.



The problem is that a great many qualified people do not want to work with =
him and certainly do not want to be his VP (e.g., South Carolina Gov. Nikki=
 Haley, Ohio Gov. John Kasich). Now we see just how troubling is his judgme=
nt in advisers.



Corey Lewandowski, not a lawyer but someone who was charged with battery (c=
harges later were dropped) and sought to smear the accuser, is now going to=
 oversee the VP selection process. Do we think Lewandoswki can pick out peo=
ple who are respectful of others<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016=
/04/08/corey-lewandowski-called-coworker-f-cking-b-tch-yelled-at-subordinat=
e-for-visiting-dying-grandma.html>, have high standards<http://www.thedaily=
beast.com/articles/2016/03/16/the-shady-past-of-corey-lewandowski-donald-tr=
ump-s-campaign-manager.html> and would contribute something other than =93Y=
es, Mr. President=94 to the administration? Probably not.



Then there is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is overseeing the transit=
ion team. (Usually candidates wait at least until after the nomination.) Th=
at=92s odd since Christie has never served in an administration (other than=
 as a U.S. attorney), has picked fights<http://articles.latimes.com/2013/ja=
n/02/news/la-pn-chris-christie-sandy-aid-congress-20130102> with Congress, =
was tutored by foreign policy experts<https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/=
right-turn/wp/2016/02/26/chris-christies-despicable-endorsement-of-trump/> =
for months and then embraced a candidate who shared none of those positions=
, and managed to burn bridges with serious conservatives over his embrace o=
f Trump. It=92ll be fascinating to see how he figures out which sorts of pe=
ople go with which jobs, let alone finds anyone to fill them.



And let=92s not forget he tapped Steven Mnuchin<https://www.washingtonpost.=
com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/05/05/treacherous-territory-navigating-the-tru=
mp-terrain/> (a Democratic money man, ex-Goldman Sachs employee and failed =
movie investor who skipped out before a bankruptcy filing) as his finance d=
irector. I suppose we should be thankful he is not the first pick for treas=
ury secretary. (Oh, gosh, what if. . .)



Finally, there is Paul Manafort, former representative to the =93Torturer=
=92s Lobby<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/13/top-trump-aide-=
led-the-torturers-lobby.html>=94 whose connections to Russia<http://www.pol=
itico.eu/article/donald-trumps-russia-connections-foreign-policy-presidenti=
al-campaign/> are so problematic it may complicate Trump=92s national secur=
ity briefing. (=93Trump=92s top adviser<https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/m=
anafort-russia?utm_term=3D.mhWwPVgmjy#.hegB9A3ODW>, Paul Manafort, has spen=
t much of his recent career working for pro-Russian forces in Ukraine, and =
doing complex deals for an oligarch with close ties to Putin. And while a D=
emocratic senator has already charged Trump is not responsible enough to re=
ceive secret information, Manafort=92s deep relationships with top pro-Russ=
ian figures raise special concerns.=94) Surely Manafort is likely to be rew=
arded with a plum position if Trump wins. Secretary of state? National secu=
rity adviser? One can only imagine.



This, you see, is one of the big problems with Trump=92s policy promises, i=
ncluding court nominees (not just the Supreme Court but also lower courts).=
 The people around him are not equipped to put in place an administration o=
f quality people who can shape and implement policy or vet and recommend ju=
dges. Trump values loyalty above all, regardless of experience, competence =
or character. Imagine an entire administration full of Lewandowskis and Rog=
er Stones<https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/04/13/tru=
mps-best-people-are-seriously-flawed/>. These people will have the power of=
 the IRS, the Justice Department, countless regulatory agencies and, of cou=
rse, the armed forces. Between public servants who take themselves out of t=
he running and qualified people dubbed to be insufficiently loyal and subse=
rvient to Trump, the quality of a Trump administration will make the Obama =
team look like superstars by comparison.



It is, quite frankly, a recipe for corruption and self-dealing as Trump and=
 his minions use the levers of government to reward friends and punish enem=
ies. Some of the worst nominees will get weeded out by Congress, but many o=
thers will get rubber stamped. The White House staff, of course, is not sub=
ject to congressional confirmation (which is an excellent reason to chop it=
 down to size).



If one selects a president who is intellectually and unethically unfit, you=
=92re practically guaranteeing the vast majority of his staff and appointme=
nts will be so as well. Quality attracts quality, and the reverse is true a=
s well.
