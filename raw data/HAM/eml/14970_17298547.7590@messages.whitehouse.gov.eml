REMARKS BY THE FIRST LADY

AT COLLEGE SIGNING DAY



Harlem Armory=20

New York, New York





3:45 P.M. EDT





 MRS. OBAMA: This has been pretty exciting, huh? (Applause.) I am so, so =
happy to be here with you guys. Look how good you all look! (Applause.) Y=
ou look so good! (Applause.)



All right, let me start by thanking a few people. I want to thank Melissa=
 and Ben for being here and for their amazing introduction.=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!



MRS. OBAMA: I love every single one of you! Every single one of you! (App=
lause.) I'm so proud of you all. (Applause.)



But I also want to thank La La and Sway and all of MTV for co-hosting thi=
s. You know they put this together for you all? Do you know that? (Applau=
se.)=20



But most of all, I want to give a huge shout-out to all the amazing young=
 people who are here today because just -- I want you to take a moment be=
cause you saw what just happened on this stage. You understand how many p=
eople it took to put this together. We did this because of you all. (Appl=
ause.) You all are the reasons we did this. Melissa, Ben, Allan Houston, =
Sway, La La, Carmelo -- I mean, all of us are here today because we are b=
eyond proud of you. (Applause.)=20



I want you all to listen to this: These Grammy Award winners, these NBA A=
ll-Stars, these Hollywood celebrities all wanted to be a part of this day=
. I called, they came. They love me, but they love you even more. They wa=
nt to celebrate your achievements. (Applause.)



So I want you to take this in, because no matter what path any of us on t=
his stage took to our success, we all know that completing your education=
 past high school is the most important thing you can do to reach your dr=
eams. That's why we're here.



So while you all might be in awe of us, let me tell you, we are in awe of=
 you. (Applause.) Because we know how much work it took for you to get to=
 this point. We know that you have been studying. (Applause.) We know how=
 early you had to wake up every morning to either catch the bus or walk t=
o school. (Applause.) We know about all those applications and essays, al=
l those FAFSA forms you had to complete to make it to this day. It wasn't=
 just a notion! (Applause.)



But we also know that even in those moments when you were tired and a lit=
tle frustrated, maybe filled with a little doubt, that you never gave up.=
 (Applause.) You never stopped fighting for your dreams. And you did it! =
Every single one of you in this room is going to college! (Applause.) Man=
! Look at you all! And that's really what College Signing Day is all abou=
t. It's about celebrating your academic achievements. Listen to this. We =
are celebrating education up in here! (Applause.)



We wanted to shine a big, bright light on outstanding young people like y=
ou because, until recently, signing days have been exclusively associated=
 with big-time athletes, big contracts, and even bigger money. The countr=
y spends weeks anticipating which players are going to sign with which te=
ams. Now, we love that picture of the high school or college student hold=
ing up their jersey to the cheers of the nation, and while we all love th=
e excitement and drama of sports signing days, we all believe here that c=
ollege signing days deserve the same level of attention. (Applause.)



See, we believe that all the adoration and attention should not just be f=
ocused on a few amazing football or basketball players. The focus should =
be on young people like you. (Applause.) We want people to be sitting on =
the edges of their couches, wondering where you're going to college. (App=
lause.) We believe that the entire nation should be looking up to you all=
 as our heroes and role models. (Applause.)



So that's why we're all here today. And let me tell you, I am so thrilled=
 that College Signing Day is catching on nationwide. Two years ago when w=
e started this, there were just a few dozen communities who were holding =
events like this. Last year, it was 600 communities that had a College Si=
gning Day. And today -- today there are more than 1,000 signing day event=
s happening all across the country. (Applause.)



So understand that you all are part of a movement. And please understand =
today, this is your day. So I really want you to take a moment to just so=
ak it in. Think about everybody who came parading out here for you. We ar=
e so proud of everything you've achieved, and we don't take the struggle =
for granted. (Applause.) So soak it in and enjoy it.



But then, here's the thing, the minute you get to college this fall, I wa=
nt you to get right back to work. (Applause.) Because today is not the en=
d of your journey -- it's just the beginning. Remember, the goal, the ult=
imate goal here isn't just getting into college; the goal is to finish an=
d get that degree, okay? (Applause.)=20



And trust me, you guys, there are going to be times when that is going to=
 seem like an impossible task -- and I know that from my own experience. =
My parents did not go to college. So while they loved and supported me un=
conditionally, they couldn't answer any of my questions or give me advice=
 about how to succeed on a college campus. They had never done it.=20



So when I arrived at Princeton my freshman year -- (applause) -- and imag=
ine, little miss South Side of Chicago girl on Princeton's campus. Believ=
e me, I had a lot of catching up to do. I didn't know anybody. I didn't k=
now what classes to take. Shoot, I didn't even have the right size sheets=
 for my bed. (Laughter.) Because I didn't realize the beds in college are=
 extra-long. (Laughter.) I was homesick. I was anxious. But after a coupl=
e of months, I had to get it together. I had to make a decision. And I de=
cided that I needed to step up and own my college education, just like I =
owned my high school education. (Applause.)



And I realized that in order to do that, I couldn't just rely on myself. =
I needed to ask for help. So I started reaching out to anybody I could --=
 to professors, I started making friends with the upperclassmen, they bec=
ame my mentors. And believe me, ya'll, I studied like I'd never studied b=
efore.



And soon enough, I kind of got the college thing down. I was feeling myse=
lf a little bit. (Applause.) But the one reason I share my experience wit=
h you all is because I am no different from you all. My parents didn't ha=
ve money. I went to public school. We didn't have a whole lot of examples=
 to follow, but I know that if I can do it, you can do it, too. I know th=
at in my heart. (Applause.)



And I want you to hear that from me. I want you to hear it from your Firs=
t Lady: As long as you're willing to put in the work, you're going to mak=
e this happen. You can do this. (Applause.)



So I just want to end by giving you a few pieces of wisdom that I want yo=
u to really listen to and think about, because I know how you're going to=
 feel when you get on campus. The first reality is that I want you to be =
focused. You have to be focused in your classes. What does that mean? You=
've got to be on time. You've got to show up every day. Just think about =
the cost, per day, that you are paying for class. Do not miss class. Pay =
attention. Take careful notes. Raise your hand. Ask questions when you're=
 confused. Don't be afraid to be wrong, because that was me -- I didn't e=
ven want to hear my voice in class. I don't want that for you. Don't be a=
fraid. In college, you can't just sit back and space out. You have to be =
an active participant.



Second, I want you to be engaged in campus life. If you are sitting in yo=
ur dorm room too much by yourself, you're not doing the right thing. You'=
ve got to get out and join clubs, extracurricular activities, just like y=
ou did in high school. Find internships, as Damon said, and other opportu=
nities that are going to get you ready for summer jobs, jobs after colleg=
e, graduate school, and all of life after that. You have to go after thos=
e opportunities, because kids who are prepared know -- they're hustling t=
o get their summer internships in line. So I want you to get on campus an=
d be prepared for that.



The last thing I want you to do -- and this is no small piece of advice -=
- ask for help. Ask for help, ya'll. (Applause.) And don't wait. The minu=
te you start to feel like you're falling behind, the minute you find your=
self struggling, you absolutely have to ask for help. And remember this: =
No one gets through college alone, and you're not supposed to. You're not=
 supposed to know anything when you get there. That's why there are count=
less people on your campuses whose job it is to help you succeed. You're =
going to have RAs and deans. You're going to have a writing center, a tut=
oring center, counseling centers -- they're all just waiting for you to c=
ome to them for help.



But here's the thing. In college, they're not going to come knocking on y=
our door. That's just the difference. They are not going to be looking fo=
r you. It's going to be up to you to go knocking on their door. And let m=
e tell you this: If the first person that answers that door is not friend=
ly or helpful -- which they may not be, there are a lot of people that do=
n't want to help -- then ask somebody ask. And I want you to keep asking =
until you find somebody that's going to get you in the right place. Know =
that -- you're going to hit walls. There are going to be people who are g=
oing to turn their back. You keep asking, because if you go to college, t=
here is somebody there who is going to help you get where you need to be.=




And if you all do all of this, then I know you will succeed. I am so sure=
 of it. And then when that day comes, and you find yourself walking aroun=
d campus like you own the place, which you all will be doing, okay -- (la=
ughter and applause) -- then I don't want you to just pat yourself on the=
 back and say good job. I want you to reach back and help other young peo=
ple like you find their path to success. (Applause.) That's your job now.=
 You all are mentors. And at this stage in the game, you all know somebod=
y just like you who's not thinking about college. They don't think they'r=
e college material. Maybe it's a younger brother or sister, or a kid down=
 the street -- they're just like you. I want you to show them that your s=
tory can be their story, too. And that starts right now, today.



So we're going to do a little making-this-all-go-viral stuff right now. (=
Applause.) So I want to know if anybody here has an iPhone -- yes, I know=
 you all do. Come on, don't act like you're not carrying this stuff aroun=
d. All the selfies you ask me to take. (Laughter.) So I want you all righ=
t now, get your phones out, you have permission to take out your phone --=
 everybody, take your phone out, and I want you to take a selfie right no=
w in your college gear. Take it right now. I did this, this morning -- th=
at's why I'm wearing my t-shirt. My husband did it this morning. Every at=
hlete and celebrity here today is going to do it, too. And together, we'r=
e going to make this event go viral.



So after you take your selfie, I want you to tweet it, post it, Instagram=
 it, whatever you all do -- I don't know all the little things you do. (L=
aughter.) Use the hashtag #CollegeSigningDay. And if we do this, we're go=
ing to show everyone out there in the world, we want to show them who you=
 are. And we want you to brag a little bit about all that you've achieved=
, okay? Can you do that? We're already trending out there in the ether. W=
ith your help, we can get this over the top.=20



And then next fall, at college, get out there, and continue to make your =
families proud, your community proud. Make your President proud. (Applaus=
e.) Make your First Lady proud of you. (Applause.) But most of all, make =
yourselves proud. (Applause.) I know you all can do it. I love you all wi=
th all of my heart. I am going to be cheering for you. Every step of the =
way I'm going to be praying for you. And I cannot wait to see all that yo=
u're going to achieve and do with your lives. I'm so proud.=20



Now, we've got one more thing. I am now excited to turn things over to so=
me of the most talented people I know -- the folks who, along with Colleg=
e Humor, helped me debut my rap career -- (applause) -- by taping a rap o=
f me in the White House. Lets give it up for Jay Pharaoh and the Gregory =
Brothers! Give it up. (Applause.)

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All right, let me start b=
y thanking a few people.&nbsp; I want to thank Melissa and Ben for being he=
re and for their amazing introduction.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; We=
 love you!<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; I love =
every single one of you!&nbsp; Every single one of you!&nbsp; (Applause.)&n=
bsp; I'm so proud of you all.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But I also want to thank =
La La and Sway and all of MTV for co-hosting this.&nbsp; You know they put =
this together for you all?&nbsp; Do you know that?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But most of all, I want t=
o give a huge shout-out to all the amazing young people who are here today =
because just -- I want you to take a moment because you saw what just happe=
ned on this stage.&nbsp; You understand how
 many people it took to put this together.&nbsp; We did this because of you=
 all.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; You all are the reasons we did this.&nbsp;&nb=
sp; Melissa, Ben, Allan Houston, Sway, La La, Carmelo -- I mean, all of us =
are here today because we are beyond proud of you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I want you all to listen =
to this:&nbsp; These Grammy Award winners, these NBA All-Stars, these Holly=
wood celebrities all wanted to be a part of this day.&nbsp; I called, they =
came.&nbsp; They love me, but they love you even more.&nbsp;
 They want to celebrate your achievements.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I want you to take thi=
s in, because no matter what path any of us on this stage took to our succe=
ss, we all know that completing your education past high school is the most=
 important thing you can do to reach
 your dreams.&nbsp; That's why we're here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So while you all might be=
 in awe of us, let me tell you, we are in awe of you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbs=
p; Because we know how much work it took for you to get to this point.&nbsp=
; We know that you have been studying.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
 We know how early you had to wake up every morning to either catch the bus=
 or walk to school.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We know about all those applica=
tions and essays, all those FAFSA forms you had to complete to make it to t=
his day.&nbsp; It wasn't just a notion!&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But we also know that eve=
n in those moments when you were tired and a little frustrated, maybe fille=
d with a little doubt, that you never gave up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; You =
never stopped fighting for your dreams.&nbsp; And you
 did it!&nbsp; Every single one of you in this room is going to college!&nb=
sp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Man!&nbsp; Look at you all!&nbsp; And that's really w=
hat College Signing Day is all about.&nbsp; It's about celebrating your aca=
demic achievements.&nbsp; Listen to this.&nbsp; We are celebrating educatio=
n
 up in here!&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We wanted to shine a big,=
 bright light on outstanding young people like you because, until recently,=
 signing days have been exclusively associated with big-time athletes, big =
contracts, and even bigger money.&nbsp; The
 country spends weeks anticipating which players are going to sign with whi=
ch teams.&nbsp; Now, we love that picture of the high school or college stu=
dent holding up their jersey to the cheers of the nation, and while we all =
love the excitement and drama of sports
 signing days, we all believe here that college signing days deserve the sa=
me level of attention.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">See, we believe that all =
the adoration and attention should not just be focused on a few amazing foo=
tball or basketball players.&nbsp; The focus should be on young people like=
 you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We want people to be
 sitting on the edges of their couches, wondering where you're going to col=
lege.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We believe that the entire nation should be l=
ooking up to you all as our heroes and role models.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that's why we're all h=
ere today.&nbsp; And let me tell you, I am so thrilled that College Signing=
 Day is catching on nationwide.&nbsp; Two years ago when we started this, t=
here were just a few dozen communities who were
 holding events like this.&nbsp; Last year, it was 600 communities that had=
 a College Signing Day.&nbsp; And today -- today there are more than 1,000 =
signing day events happening all across the country.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So understand that you al=
l are part of a movement.&nbsp; And please understand today, this is your d=
ay.&nbsp; So I really want you to take a moment to just soak it in.&nbsp; T=
hink about everybody who came parading out here for
 you.&nbsp; We are so proud of everything you've achieved, and we don't tak=
e the struggle for granted.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; So soak it in and enjoy=
 it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But then, here's the thin=
g, the minute you get to college this fall, I want you to get right back to=
 work.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Because today is not the end of your journey=
 -- it's just the beginning.&nbsp; Remember, the goal,
 the ultimate goal here isn't just getting into college; the goal is to fin=
ish and get that degree, okay?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And trust me, you guys, t=
here are going to be times when that is going to seem like an impossible ta=
sk -- and I know that from my own experience.&nbsp; My parents did not go t=
o college.&nbsp; So while they loved and supported
 me unconditionally, they couldn't answer any of my questions or give me ad=
vice about how to succeed on a college campus.&nbsp; They had never done it=
.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So when I arrived at Prin=
ceton my freshman year -- (applause) -- and imagine, little miss South Side=
 of Chicago girl on Princeton's campus.&nbsp; Believe me, I had a lot of ca=
tching up to do.&nbsp; I didn't know anybody.&nbsp;
 I didn't know what classes to take.&nbsp; Shoot, I didn't even have the ri=
ght size sheets for my bed.&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;Because I didn't realiz=
e the beds in college are extra-long.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I was homesic=
k.&nbsp; I was anxious.&nbsp; But after a couple of months, I had to
 get it together.&nbsp; I had to make a decision.&nbsp; And I decided that =
I needed to step up and own my college education, just like I owned my high=
 school education.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I realized that in or=
der to do that, I couldn't just rely on myself.&nbsp; I needed to ask for h=
elp.&nbsp; So I started reaching out to anybody I could -- to professors, I=
 started making friends with the upperclassmen,
 they became my mentors.&nbsp; And believe me, ya'll, I studied like I'd ne=
ver studied before.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And soon enough, I kind o=
f got the college thing down.&nbsp; I was feeling myself a little bit.&nbsp=
; (Applause.)&nbsp; But the one reason I share my experience with you all i=
s because I am no different from you all.&nbsp; My parents
 didn't have money.&nbsp; I went to public school.&nbsp; We didn't have a w=
hole lot of examples to follow, but I know that if I can do it, you can do =
it, too.&nbsp; I know that in my heart.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I want you to hear th=
at from me.&nbsp; I want you to hear it from your First Lady:&nbsp; As long=
 as you're willing to put in the work, you're going to make this happen.&nb=
sp; You can do this.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I just want to end by =
giving you a few pieces of wisdom that I want you to really listen to and t=
hink about, because I know how you're going to feel when you get on campus.=
&nbsp; The first reality is that I want you
 to be focused.&nbsp; You have to be focused in your classes.&nbsp; What do=
es that mean?&nbsp; You've got to be on time.&nbsp; You've got to show up e=
very day.&nbsp; Just think about the cost, per day, that you are paying for=
 class.&nbsp; Do not miss class.&nbsp; Pay attention.&nbsp; Take careful
 notes.&nbsp; Raise your hand.&nbsp; Ask questions when you're confused.&nb=
sp; Don't be afraid to be wrong, because that was me -- I didn't even want =
to hear my voice in class.&nbsp; I don't want that for you.&nbsp; Don't be =
afraid.&nbsp; In college, you can't just sit back and space out.&nbsp;
 You have to be an active participant.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Second, I want you to be =
engaged in campus life.&nbsp; If you are sitting in your dorm room too much=
 by yourself, you're not doing the right thing.&nbsp; You've got to get out=
 and join clubs, extracurricular activities, just
 like you did in high school.&nbsp; Find internships, as Damon said, and ot=
her opportunities that are going to get you ready for summer jobs, jobs aft=
er college, graduate school, and all of life after that.&nbsp; You have to =
go after those opportunities, because kids
 who are prepared know -- they're hustling to get their summer internships =
in line.&nbsp; So I want you to get on campus and be prepared for that.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The last thing I want you=
 to do -- and this is no small piece of advice -- ask for help.&nbsp; Ask f=
or help, ya'll.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And don't wait.&nbsp; The minute yo=
u start to feel like you're falling behind, the minute you
 find yourself struggling, you absolutely have to ask for help.&nbsp; And r=
emember this:&nbsp; No one gets through college alone, and you're not suppo=
sed to.&nbsp; You're not supposed to know anything when you get there.&nbsp=
; That's why there are countless people on your campuses
 whose job it is to help you succeed.&nbsp; You're going to have RAs and de=
ans.&nbsp; You're going to have a writing center, a tutoring center, counse=
ling centers -- they're all just waiting for you to come to them for help.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But here's the thing.&nbs=
p; In college, they're not going to come knocking on your door.&nbsp; That'=
s just the difference.&nbsp; They are not going to be looking for you.&nbsp=
; It's going to be up to you to go knocking on their door.&nbsp;
 And let me tell you this:&nbsp; If the first person that answers that door=
 is not friendly or helpful -- which they may not be, there are a lot of pe=
ople that don't want to help -- then ask somebody ask.&nbsp; And I want you=
 to keep asking until you find somebody that's
 going to get you in the right place.&nbsp; Know that -- you're going to hi=
t walls.&nbsp; There are going to be people who are going to turn their bac=
k.&nbsp; You keep asking, because if you go to college, there is somebody t=
here who is going to help you get where you need
 to be.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And if you all do all of =
this, then I know you will succeed.&nbsp; I am so sure of it.&nbsp; And the=
n when that day comes, and you find yourself walking around campus like you=
 own the place, which you all will be doing, okay
 -- (laughter and applause) -- then I don't want you to just pat yourself o=
n the back and say good job.&nbsp; I want you to reach back and help other =
young people like you find their path to success.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; T=
hat's your job now.&nbsp; You all are mentors.&nbsp; And
 at this stage in the game, you all know somebody just like you who's not t=
hinking about college.&nbsp; They don't think they're college material.&nbs=
p; Maybe it's a younger brother or sister, or a kid down the street -- they=
're just like you.&nbsp; I want you to show them
 that your story can be their story, too.&nbsp; And that starts right now, =
today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we're going to do a li=
ttle making-this-all-go-viral stuff right now.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; So I=
 want to know if anybody here has an iPhone -- yes, I know you all do.&nbsp=
; Come on, don't act like you're not carrying this
 stuff around.&nbsp; All the selfies you ask me to take.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&=
nbsp; So I want you all right now, get your phones out, you have permission=
 to take out your phone -- everybody, take your phone out, and I want you t=
o take a selfie right now in your college gear.&nbsp;
 Take it right now.&nbsp; I did this, this morning -- that's why I'm wearin=
g my t-shirt.&nbsp; My husband did it this morning.&nbsp; Every athlete and=
 celebrity here today is going to do it, too.&nbsp; And together, we're goi=
ng to make this event go viral.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So after you take your se=
lfie, I want you to tweet it, post it, Instagram it, whatever you all do --=
 I don't know all the little things you do.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Use the=
 hashtag #CollegeSigningDay.&nbsp; And if we do this,
 we're going to show everyone out there in the world, we want to show them =
who you are.&nbsp; And we want you to brag a little bit about all that you'=
ve achieved, okay?&nbsp; Can you do that?&nbsp; We're already trending out =
there in the ether.&nbsp; With your help, we can get
 this over the top.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And then next fall, at co=
llege, get out there, and continue to make your families proud, your commun=
ity proud.&nbsp; Make your President proud.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Make yo=
ur First Lady proud of you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But most
 of all, make yourselves proud.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I know you all can =
do it.&nbsp; I love you all with all of my heart.&nbsp; I am going to be ch=
eering for you.&nbsp; Every step of the way I'm going to be praying for you=
.&nbsp; And I cannot wait to see all that you're going to achieve
 and do with your lives.&nbsp; I'm so proud.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, we've got one more t=
hing.&nbsp; I am now excited to turn things over to some of the most talent=
ed people I know -- the folks who, along with College Humor, helped me debu=
t my rap career -- (applause) -- by taping
 a rap of me in the White House.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s give it up for Jay Phara=
