DNC Chair Statement on Reports That John Kasich is Suspending his Campaign =
for President



"With Governor Kasich out of the race, any remaining hope the GOP had of co=
ncealing its true colors behind his comparatively friendly-faced candidacy =
has evaporated. But make no mistake, the extreme policies for which he has =
long fought, are virtually indistinguishable from those of Donald Trump, Te=
d Cruz, and the rest of the modern Republican Party.



"Under Kasich, Ohio's job growth has trailed the national average for 40 st=
raight months. He promised to fight any federal increase in the minimum wag=
e. And he has one of the most extreme anti-choice records of any governor i=
n the country, having signed legislation that shut down half the abortion c=
linics in his state.



"For years, Republican leaders have employed a divisive political strategy =
to compel people to vote out of distrust, suspicion and hate - rewarding th=
ose at the top and denigrating women, minorities, the LGBT community and mo=
re in the process. The result is the cynical, divided, bickering Republican=
 base we see now. Today, the only energy left in the Republican primary isn=
't for anything, it's against everything that doesn't line up with their ex=
treme views. The obstruction and broken government we're seeing in Washingt=
on is the result.



"The contrast couldn't be more stark. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders ar=
e fighting for the American people - for higher wages, for more opportunity=
, for a level playing field and for a brighter future. Our voters are energ=
ized, enthusiastic, and optimistic because our candidates are committed to =
moving America forward. And that's why we're going to win on Election Day i=
n November."
