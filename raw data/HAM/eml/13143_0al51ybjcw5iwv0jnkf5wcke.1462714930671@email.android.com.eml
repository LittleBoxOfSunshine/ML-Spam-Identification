I missed the beginning of the Trump interview but came in when he was argui=
ng that his tax plan will be negotiated and not look like what he put out. =
He claimed it would be a boon for the middle class and raise his taxes. We =
could/maybe should do a hit on  this. Sounded like he didn=92t know his own=
 plan.


On a Fox panel one of the commentators (Kim something?) hit Trump for chang=
ing his mind on his tax plan this week.

He was asked about his flip flop on the minimum wage and he said he was ope=
n to changing it but he really wanted to bring jobs where people could earn=
 more.

He was asked how he could keep Carrier and other companies here when the pr=
oducts for the Trump Collection aren=92t made in the US. He said that the i=
tems for his collection aren=92t made here and didn=92t think it was hypocr=
itical=85.


There is probably more from this interview so someone should take a second =
look.
