suming that Hillary Clinton is the nominee, how big a challenge do you thin=
k Donald Trump will be to her?"

>     *   REP. XAVIER BECERRA, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIR:  "We have to =
take everyone seriously but Donald Trump doesn't seem to take himself serio=
usly so it's hard to tell.  I'm not sure where this is going to go, talking=
 about a Cruz/Rubio combination is like saying that Broncos didn't win the =
Super Bowl.  That=92s done.  Been there, done that.  Let=92s move forward."
>=20
>        *   "It's Trump as the nominee it will be Clinton, I believe, as t=
he nominee on the Democratic side, we still have a bit of a race but I don'=
t think it makes any difference to Hillary Clinton.  Hillary Clinton outwor=
ked everyone.  She=92s going to earn the votes that she needs.  She's alrea=
dy gotten 2 million more votes than Donald Trump has.  And so she=92s just =
going to move forward. Let Donald Trump be Donald Trump and let Hillary Cli=
nton win the White House."

to have to find someone who is willing to share the stage with.  I don't kn=
ow if we=92ve found who he's willing to share the stage. [remember when Chr=

If that's going to be the debate, one about who is trying to fight for wome=
n to have opportunity, to finally get paid equally to men.  If it's going t=
o be about who can help create jobs, not just whimsically declare bankruptc=
y and cost a lot of Americans their jobs, we're ready.

> "I think Secretary Clinton as Amanda said will talk about this, because s=
he has plans on how to create jobs.  She has done that, and so she's ready =
for it, but Donald Trump has got to be careful throwing that first stone."

>     *   ..."The second problem I think for Republicans on this issue is, =
they should have a messenger who hasn't had multiple marriages and doesn't =
have his own problems with women.  So, I think it's going to focus on jobs =
and paychecks and there is no one who is talking more about that than Hilla=
ry Clinton."

 doing that, Hillary Clinton was in California talking to thousands of Cali=
fornia voters, a lot of them Latino... telling people what she would do to =
help them have a better future, talking about their children, talking about=
 reforming our immigration reform laws that are broken. And he's telling us=
