 For Immediate Release May 18, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20







1:10 P.M. EDT



 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I do have a=
 quick statement at the top before we get to questions. As I'm sure you a=
re aware, today Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are =
doing their jobs and fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities by =
reviewing Chief Judge Garlands questionnaire and holding a public meeting=
 to learn more about this highly qualified nominee.



 One of the individuals they have invited to the Senate today to speak in=
 support of Chief Judge Garlands character and credentials is a man named=
 Timothy Lewis. Mr. Lewis is a retired former judge of the U.S. Court of =
Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. In his written remarks, Judge Lewis noted, F=
or anyone who questions, as most Americans do, the Senates treatment of J=
udge Garlands nomination to the United States Supreme Court, I am living =
proof that it doesnt have to be this way. As Judge Lewis notes, he was no=
minated in the fall of 1992, weeks before a presidential election. He was=
 nominated by a Republican President to serve on the Court of Appeals. He=
 had a hearing before a Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee =
and was unanimously confirmed by a Democratic-controlled Senate on Octobe=
r 8th, just three weeks before the election.



 That's one way in which his testimony today is interesting. And theres a=
 second. Later in his career, Judge Lewis returned to Congress to testify=
 on behalf of his 3rd Circuit colleague, Sam Alito. At the time, Judge Le=
wis noted that he did not share Justice Alitos conservative ideology, but=
 that he found him to be a good person and a fine judge, intellectually h=
onest, highly principled, and well qualified to serve on the Court.=20



 Following Judge Lewiss testimony that day, Senator Grassley noted that h=
e found Judge Lewiss testimony on behalf of then-Judge Alito particularly=
 compelling. So today, we hope that Senator Grassley will be similarly co=
mpelled by Judge Lewiss remarks. Otherwise, Senator Grassleys continued o=
bstruction amounts to what former Judge Lewis today called dangerous poli=
tical gamesmanship rooted in an unfortunate ideological fervor that ultim=
ately harms each branch of government and dilutes the effectiveness and c=
apacity of the judiciary.



 So before today I had not had the pleasure of ever having heard of Judge=
 Lewis, but presumably all of you have. But obviously he has some interes=
ting things to say and he comes to this issue from a unique perspective. =
So I commend his testimony to your attention.



 So with all that, we'll go straight to the birthday boy. Josh, you can b=
egin.



 Q Thanks, Josh. It seems like you were having fun with that last windup.=




 MR. EARNEST: I enjoyed reading about Judge Lewiss testimony today.



 Q I wanted to start with Senator Pat Robertss comments about the confirm=
ation of Eric Fanning --



 MR. EARNEST: Yes. We last discussed him when he was crumbling the Gitmo =
paper in his hands and filming himself throwing it into a wastebasket.=20=




 Q Well, he essentially suggested that there was a quid pro quo between h=
im and the Defense Department that he agreed to lift this hold because he=
 was told by Deputy Defense Secretary Work that the clock had run out on =
transferring people to Leavenworth or really to the mainland. I know that=
 the Deputy Defense Secretary has put out his own statement despite this,=
 but one thing he doesnt address in that statement is the specific langua=
ge that Senator Roberts brought up about the clock has run out on being a=
ble to do this in the time that's left in this administration. So I'm won=
dering if you can -- is the White House disputing Senator Robertss accoun=
t of what he was told by the Defense Department about that?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not going to get into any -- I don't have any insight t=
o share about private conversations between Senator Roberts and the Depar=
tment of Justice. The good news is -- I'm sorry -- the Department of Defe=
nse. The good news is that the Department of Defense has explained exactl=
y what was communicated to Senator Roberts. They were involved in those d=
iscussions, and they can make clear exactly what was communicated to him.=


=20

 The thing that I can just confirm for you is that nothing about the admi=
nistration's position, with regard to the need to close the prison at Gua=
ntanamo Bay, has changed. We continue to believe that the most effective =
way to close the prison is to transfer all those individuals that can be =
safely transferred. We continue to work with our partners all around the =
world to do that in a way that is consistent with our national security.=20=




But we also believe that it's possible to transfer the remaining detainee=
s at the prison at Guantanamo Bay to the United States to secure faciliti=
es where those detainees can be held without posing a threat to our natio=
nal security. After all -- and Senator Roberts knows this quite well -- t=
hat there are dangerous, convicted, hardened terrorists serving time on A=
merican soil, in American prisons, right now. That does not pose a threat=
 to our national security. In fact, detaining them, having brought them t=
o justice through our Article III courts, actually makes our country safe=
r.



 So our argument on this is quite clear. This is an argument that has str=
ong bipartisan support among national security experts. President Bush ag=
reed with this position. Both Colin Powell, General David Petraeus have a=
lso articulated their strong support for the priority that should be plac=
ed on closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay explicitly for national securi=
ty reasons.



 Q I think the elephant in the room here is that even if Congress were to=
 see the light, in your view, and embrace what you've described as the mo=
st effective, direct way to close the prison by lifting these restriction=
s, that would be effective at the start of the new fiscal year. So you ba=
sically have October, November, December and part of January to select a =
location, prepare a location, transfer dozens of detainees from Gitmo to =
the United States, and then close the prison. So are you able to acknowle=
dge at this point that even if President Obama is able to order the closu=
re of Guantanamo Bay, that he won't be able to actually, because of these=
 logistical constraints, close it by the time he leaves office?



 MR. EARNEST: I havent been presented with that conclusion. So we continu=
e to believe that it is possible and, in fact, should be a priority of th=
e United States government to succeed in closing that prison. And Preside=
nt Obama vowed to do it as soon as possible. He did that on I believe it =
was his second or third full day in office. And the President continues t=
o strongly believe that that should be a priority and that that would be =
possible if our efforts to achieve this goal were not being thwarted by o=
bstructionists in the United States Congress.



 Q And I wanted to ask you about this dispute within the Democratic Party=
 primary and some of the comments from Senator Sanders just in the last d=
ay, saying, in light of what happened in Nevada, the Democratic Party bas=
ically has a choice. It can open its doors, bring people in, or it can ch=
oose to be -- its status-quo structure remain dependent on big-money cont=
ributions and be a party with limited energy. And I'm wondering if you fe=
el that, after seven and a half years of the Democratic Party being under=
 the leadership of President Obama, if that's an accurate description of =
the way the party stands.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, let me make a couple of observations. The first is th=
at I do feel confident -- though I did not specifically do this myself --=
 that if you were to Google news coverage from May 18th, 2008, the tenor =
of the coverage would be quite similar to the tenor of the coverage today=
. There would be all kinds of hand-wringing among party activists about w=
hether or not the party would come together after a divisive primary betw=
een Senator Obama and Senator Clinton. There would be pundits with decade=
s of electoral experience posing difficult questions about whether or not=
 it is even possible given the passion of Clinton supporters for even som=
ebody with all the skills of Senator Obama to unite the Democratic Party.=
 There would be Republicans salivating at the prospect of a divided Democ=
ratic Party limping into a general election, giving an advantage to the R=
epublican nominee.=20



 I guess the point is that we've seen a lot of this before. And that's no=
t to diminish anybody's candidacy. It's not to diminish the passion and c=
ommitment of supporters for either candidate. But it is an indication tha=
t the Democratic Party in a general election will be focused on a differe=
nt question. Americans across the country will be focused on a very clear=
 choice that they'll have in a general election, and there will be ample =
time over the next six or seven months for candidates on either side to m=
ake their case. And President Obama will certainly be weighing in to make=
 his case. And I think all of that will serve to motivate the American pe=
ople to engage in this debate and to participate in the election.=20



 And President Obama and others will certainly be making that case. And I=
 dont have too many doubts about the intensity of the debate that is like=
ly to ensue or the degree to which voters on both sides and both parties =
will be highly motivated to participate. It's a good thing for our democr=
acy. And President Obama had an opportunity to speak about this at the co=
mmencement ceremony at Rutgers University over the weekend. And the idea =
that our electorate gets more engaged in these kinds of political debates=
 is good for the country.



 Q The primaries are always hard-fought, I think we acknowledge. But this=
 seems to be a different flavor here. I mean, we've got allegations of vi=
olence, of disenfranchisement; the DNC Chairwoman saying one of the candi=
date's campaigns is doing insufficient to address that. Does the Presiden=
t feel no obligation at this point to mediate or to try and resolve some =
of this? He's basically just going to wait until the candidates do that a=
mongst themselves to get involved?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Josh, that we have seen that the party prima=
ries typically are, particularly ones that are contested as passionately =
as this one has been. There are going to be strong feelings on both sides=
.



 But I think one of the lessons of the election in 2008 is not to confuse=
 the passion in the primary for disinterest in the general election. I th=
ink, if anything, the reason that people are so passionate about the curr=
ent primary process is they understand the stakes in the general election=
. So that certainly was true in 2008. Well see if its true in 2016. But I=
m confident that the Presidents engagement in the general election will b=
e useful in sharpening up that case and he certainly looks forward to the=
 opportunity to do it.



 But I also think that President Obama benefits from his own personal inv=
olvement in the last hotly contested Democratic presidential primary; tha=
t yes, the issues are a little different and the debates are always a lit=
tle bit different but no less intense. They certainly were intense, parti=
cularly in this period, in May of 2008. So theres probably an interesting=
 story to be written there about sort of where things were at this stage =
eight years ago.



 Jeff.



 Q Josh, Donald Trump said yesterday in an interview with Reuters that he=
 would be willing to talk to North Koreas leader, and that if he were suc=
cessful in winning the White House, that he would renegotiate the Paris c=
limate deal. Whats your reaction to the first? And on the second, should =
U.S. allies be concerned that the Paris deal is not as strong or as bulle=
tproof as the President did say when he helped to create it?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, on the question related to North Korea, the President=
 has been -- has had a number of opportunities recently to make clear exa=
ctly what our position is there. The United States has worked effectively=
 with the international community, including countries like Russia and Ch=
ina, to isolate North Korea because of their failure to abide by their in=
ternational obligations when it comes to their nuclear program. And we ha=
ve succeeded in ramping up that pressure and ramping up that isolation. I=
t has not yet had the desired effect on the North Korean regime, but ther=
es ample evidence to indicate that they are feeling that pressure.



 And what we have said is that that pressure can be relieved and the inte=
rnational community is prepared to engage with North Korea as soon as the=
y make clear their commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and =
ending the kind of provocative rhetoric and acts that are so destabilizin=
g to the broader region. So weve been pretty clear about what the path ou=
t of this isolation is for the North Korean government. Thus far, they ha=
ve declined to pursue it, but thats the strategy that we have laid out an=
d it is a strategy that is consistent with the joint pursuit of our inter=
ests in that region of the world, where the United States stands by our a=
llies in South Korea and stands by our allies in Japan and coordinates wi=
th China and Russia in pursuit of this goal.



 As it relates to the Paris climate agreement, I would just note that its=
 more than 190 countries who signed on to this agreement, and each of the=
m made specific commitments with regard to how they would reduce carbon p=
ollution in their countries. This is an agreement that took years to nego=
tiate. It is an agreement that was only possible because of the leadershi=
p of the United States -- this is something that Prime Minister Cameron m=
entioned at the news conference that he did with President Obama in Londo=
n a couple of weeks ago.



 This agreement was catalyzed when President Obama announced alongside Pr=
esident Xi in China that both China and the United States were prepared t=
o make commitments to cut carbon pollution. The Republican talking point =
for years had been that it was folly for the United States to pursue an i=
nternational climate agreement and to cut carbon pollution in the United =
States knowing that China was going to only pollute more. The truth is be=
cause of principled, effective diplomacy and the leadership of President =
Obama, we did reach an agreement where China agreed to cap their emission=
s and begin to bring them down.



 Whats significant about that is not just the positive impact we anticipa=
te that that will have on the climate and the positive impact it had on d=
iplomacy in terms of bringing other countries to the table, its also goin=
g to have a positive impact on the U.S. economy. We already know that Wes=
tinghouse, a fine American business, has committed to building four nucle=
ar plants in China. I think thats a pretty good indication of -- a pretty=
 clear example of how the worlds commitment to a low-carbon future has a =
positive economic impact in the United States. The same is true of other =
countries -- I mean of other U.S. companies like General Electric that no=
w have essentially a global market for renewable energy.=20



As other countries have made a commitment to cutting their carbon polluti=
on, they have to look to renewable energy to power their economy. And the=
 United States -- in part because of some of the historic investments tha=
t were made in this sector of the economy under President Obamas leadersh=
ip, the United States is the leading edge of that industry. And a global =
commitment on the part of nations around the world to considering sources=
 of renewable energy only creates good economic opportunities for America=
n businesses and American workers.



 So the completion of the Paris agreement is a testament to President Oba=
mas leadership, the effectiveness of diplomacy, the positive impact it wi=
ll have on the climate and the positive impact it will have on the U.S. e=
conomy.



 Q But just to circle back to my questions, is the White House concerned =
that U.S. allies may view comments like this as a sign that this agreemen=
t is not as robust as the President said when he signed it? And on the No=
rth Korea topic --=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, let me just do that one first. I dont know that there=
s anybody thats losing sleep here at the White House about that. So, no, =
thats not a source of concern.



 Q And on North Korea, the President, when he was a candidate in 2008, al=
so suggested that he would talk to U.S. enemies. Does he consider it resp=
onsible or irresponsible for Donald Trump to be suggesting that about Kim=
 Jong-un?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont think Im going to weigh in at this point on the pron=
ouncements or rhetoric of any of the candidates, particularly with regard=
 to an issue like North Korea. But we certainly have made clear what our =
approach to that situation is, and it is rooted in the Presidents commitm=
ent to working closely with our allies and partners around the world to r=
amp up pressure on countries like North Korea.



 I should also note that President Obama, over the last several years, ha=
s also deployed additional military assets to the Asia Pacific region, so=
me of them oriented specifically to counter North Koreas missile program.=
 And because of those investments and because of those strategic decision=
s that the President made in close consultation with our military leaders=
, believes that weve got sufficient protections in place. But that certai=
nly has not dampened our desire to work effectively with the internationa=
l community to ramp up pressure on the North Koreans to get them to chang=
e course.



 Q Briefly, on one other topic. The Vice President was unveiling the over=
time -- details of the overtime rules that weve been expecting for some t=
ime. Is the White House confident that these will stand up to legal chall=
enges from Republicans in the business community? And are you confident t=
hat they will stay in place if a Republican -- Donald Trump, in this case=
 -- wins the White House in November?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the short answer to your question is yes. I w=
ill elaborate on it briefly. As it relates to sort of the legal questions=
, this is actually not the creation of a new rule. This is a rule that ha=
s been on the books governing overtime pay for decades now. So this is me=
rely an update of an already-existing rule that will ensure that the hard=
est-working Americans are paid fairly for their overtime. So the principl=
e is quite simple. The impact is quite significant. We would anticipate t=
hat this executive action that would extend overtime protections to more =
than 4 million American workers -- again, by definition, these are 4 mill=
ion of the hardest-working Americans. These are individuals who are alrea=
dy working overtime. And the President believes that they should be paid =
fairly for their work. And the economic impact is also significant. The e=
conomic impact, according to our estimates, is that Americans wages would=
 increase by $12 billion over the next 10 years as a result of this rule.=
 So this an impactful way for us to ensure that American workers are paid=
 fairly, and to do something that many people have identified as an impor=
tant goal, which is to put upward pressure on wages.=20



 We've seen strong economic growth in this country. We've seen strong tre=
nds related to job creation. But we haven't seen as much progress made on=
 increasing wages in this country. And this is a tangible example of how =
we can do that. And by the way, by definition, this is increasing wages f=
or people who make $47,000 or less. So this is consistent with the Presid=
ents strategy that our economy is going to be strongest when we're growin=
g from the middle out and we're looking for opportunities to expand econo=
mic opportunity for middle-class families and those families that are wor=
king hard to get to the middle class.



 Q The question is, can they withstand legal challenges?



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, they can withstand legal challenges. Again, it's not a=
 new rule. This is a rule that's been on the books for a long time. It's =
just merely updated with new standards. And the next President will have =
to make their own choices with regard to the way that they choose to use =
executive action. That's true on a whole range of things. But the legal f=
oundation for making this argument is solid.



 Justin.



 Q I want to start with Zika. Yesterday, the Senate did not pass the Pres=
idents $1.9 billion request but did pass the $1.1 billion package. Stipul=
ating everything that you've said many times before about public health e=
xperts wanting the full $1.9 billion, is the package that passed the Sena=
te something that you guys would be willing to accept?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we are going to continue to advocate for the $1.9 bil=
lion package. And we were pleased to see that that proposal, while it did=
 not pass, did garner some important bipartisan support. So Republicans l=
ike Marco Rubio and even Bill Cassidy from Louisiana -- two states that a=
re on the Gulf Coast that I think are legitimately concerned about the po=
tential impact of the Zika virus on the populations in those two states -=
- supported the $1.9 billion package.=20



And Senator Rubio, I think, said it in a way that I would strongly agree =
with for a change. He said, yes, the proposal came from the White House. =
But it's really the scientists request, the doctors request, the public h=
ealth sectors request for how to address this issue. And hes right. The P=
resident put forward this proposal, but he did so based on the specific a=
dvice that he has received from our public health professionals. And we'r=
e going to continue to urge Congress to consider fully funding the reques=
t that our public health professionals have made.



I'm no expert in math, but obviously the Senate proposal that was passed =
yesterday is larger than the House Republican proposal that's under consi=
deration. So obviously we've seen just in the last couple of weeks import=
ant progress in the right direction. For a while we saw Republicans on Ca=
pitol Hill basically rejecting the need for this kind of funding, but now=
 we've seen bipartisan legislation move through the Senate that would fun=
d our efforts for more than a billion dollars.=20



So obviously that's good progress, but it falls short of what our public =
health professionals believe is necessary. And we're going to continue to=
 advocate for what our public health professionals believe is necessary.



Q You said that you would veto the House bill, and so I'm wondering, I gu=
ess, does that veto threat stand for anything less than the $1.9 billion?=
 Or is the $1.1 billion something that -- not exactly everything you want=
, but you're willing to take it?



MR. EARNEST: Well, we're going to continue to advocate for the $1.9 billi=
on. And I don't have a veto threat to issue on the $1.1 billion. Our conc=
erns about the Republican proposal in the House are many. It's not just t=
hat they are about $1.3 billion short of what our experts say is necessar=
y. It also demands that that emergency funding be paid for by gutting inv=
estments in protecting the American people from the Ebola virus. So the a=
pproach that Republicans have advocated for in the House is wrong, it's u=
nwise, and it is inconsistent with prioritizing the public health and wel=
lbeing of the American people.



 Q On Libya, I'm wondering if you have a timeline to share for the U.S. a=
nd its allies to secure the U.N. Security Council resolution that they wa=
nt that would enable us to ship arms to the unity government there. And a=
lso, I know that you talked a little bit about how it would be designed t=
o keep arms out of the hands of people that we dont want to have them in =
the region, but I'm wondering if you could just maybe talk more broadly a=
bout if there's any risk that an infusion of arms is going to heighten te=
nsion or kind of fuel additional conflict just by their mere presence the=
re.



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of a timeline that has been set out for the p=
assage of a resolution. You can check with my colleagues in Ambassador Po=
wer's office. They would have a better sense of the mechanics of all of t=
his. But the broader question is, what can the international community do=
 to support the government of national accord in Libya in their efforts t=
o secure the country and combat the ISIL presence that we know is there. =
And how can we do all of that in a way that prevents the arms from fallin=
g into the wrong hands. Libya is a dangerous place, and there are a varie=
ty of factions that arent shy about resorting to violence to try to get t=
heir way inside of Libya. So the prospect of further militarizing the sit=
uation is a prospect that must be carefully considered.=20



But what's also clear is that the government of national accord needs suf=
ficient resources and equipment to get that situation under control. And =
so that's what our experts will be examining. And I recognize that they h=
ave to walk a fine line here, so it will be carefully considered. I dont =
know if there is a timeline. I dont think there will be any desire to rus=
h it. But at the same time, further delays are only going to create more =
space for some of those armed factions that arent shy about resorting to =
violence.



So this is a difficult situation. We've made tremendous progress, though,=
 when you sort of consider where we were even three or four months ago. T=
here was a lot of doubt about whether or not we were going to be able to =
bring about the kind of political consensus among a variety of opposition=
 groups to even form a government. But the U.N. did a lot of important wo=
rk. The United States played a leading role in facilitating these convers=
ations and bringing the international community together behind them. And=
 we do now have a government of national accord, and that government of n=
ational accord now is in Tripoli.



So we've made a lot of important progress that, frankly, a couple of mont=
hs I dont think I even would have believed was possible. And so we need t=
o look for ways to keep that momentum going. And one way to do that is to=
 consider international support for their security efforts there.



Q And last one. House Republicans are saying today that classified admini=
stration reports provided to Congress over the last three years show that=
 the administration knowingly approved for the transfer of Gitmo detainee=
s to countries that were incapable of preventing them from returning to t=
errorism, and argue that administration officials have given misleading t=
estimony about that. So I was wondering how you respond to that sort of r=
equest from Republicans to correct the record on this issue.



MR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the record is quite clear about what Pre=
sident Obama has worked to do. When he took office in 2009, he instituted=
 a new procedure for considering specific cases of individual Gitmo detai=
nees. And that process included a review of individual case files to dete=
rmine the best way to dispose of those cases. And what the idea has been =
is that, by carefully reviewing the individual cases, we can design the m=
ost effective way to prevent them from posing a threat to the United Stat=
es or our allies.=20



And this has been a rigorous process and it's been meticulous, and you'll=
 recall that early in 2009 and 2010, it took a while to stand this proces=
s up and to move through all of the applications. But that process has pa=
id significant dividends for our national security because it has allowed=
 us to succeed in transferring 144 individuals since January of 2009. And=
 what we know is that less than 5 percent of them, of those individuals, =
have been confirmed as reengaging in the fight; 95 percent of them arent.=
 And that's an indication of the ability that the United States has to cl=
ose the prison at Guantanamo Bay in a way that mitigates the risk that is=
 posed to the American people.=20



So this is a process that is rigorous, that sometimes is not just exhaust=
ive, but exhausting, but it has demonstrated a track record of success. A=
nd the President believes that we would be even more successful if Congre=
ss werent time and time again trying to throw sand in the gears of the pr=
ocess in a way that has only slowed down our efforts and made our efforts=
 more difficult. And that's unfortunate. But our track record here is sol=
id and it is one that the President is proud of. It's one that has bipart=
isan support in terms of pursuing a goal that Democrats and Republicans s=
hare, and that is the need to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. This is=
 often shaped up as a fight between Democrats and Republicans, or Republi=
cans on Capitol Hill in a Democratic administration. The truth is, the Re=
publican administration supported closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.=20=




So I did have a chance to take a look at the statement from the Speaker's=
 office today, and there was a suggestion somehow that the Obama administ=
ration was prioritizing politics in this situation. Well, that's pretty r=
ich. I dont think that General David Petraeus is prioritizing politics wh=
en he says we should close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. I dont think tha=
t General Colin Powell is prioritizing politics when he suggests that we =
should close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. I dont think Senator McCain is=
 playing politics when he suggests that we should close the prison at Gua=
ntanamo Bay. I dont think that Senator Graham of South Carolina is playin=
g politics when suggests that we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. I do=
nt think that Senator Collins is playing politics when she says that it w=
ould be a good idea to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.=20



You know who is playing politics with this? The RNC, who says that they a=
ctually want to run ads against Democrats all across the country for want=
ing to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.



So we know what's going on here. And you have congressional Republicans t=
hat are cynically playing politics and playing on the fears of the Americ=
an people in order to score some cheap political points. The truth is, th=
e American people would be safer if we succeeded in closing the prison. A=
nd that's not just my assessment. That's the assessment of the United Sta=
tes Department of Defense. That's the assessment of the United States int=
elligence community. And that's the assessment of Democratic and Republic=
an national security experts that for years have disagree with the approa=
ch of this Congress to prevent the closure of the prison.=20



Jordan.



 Q Thanks, Josh. Whats the White Houses reaction to Oversight Committee C=
hairman Jason Chaffetz filing a censure resolution against the IRS Commis=
sioner today?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I dont know that I saw that specific news. Obviously =
our views of the work of the IRS Commissioner are quite different than th=
e views of congressional Republicans. The fact is that John Koskinen has =
assumed a very difficult task. And that task has been made only more diff=
icult by the false accusations of Republicans and by the continued insist=
ence of Republicans to cut the budget for the IRS. So we know that over t=
he last five years or so -- yes, over the last five years that Congress h=
as cut the IRS budget by a billion dollars. And as a result, weve seen wa=
it times for customer service increase. Its had a not positive impact on =
enforcement. And then to have Republicans come back and say that hes not =
doing a very good job, its not on the level. And if they spent half as mu=
ch time trying to make sure that the IRS got the money that they needed t=
o do their job as they do undermining the commissioner of the IRS, the Am=
erican people would be better served.



 Q And to follow up on the Presidents lunch yesterday with Jack Ma, can y=
ou give us any more details on what the two men talked about over lunch?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont have a readout of the lunch. As I mentioned yesterda=
y, the President appeared at a forum in Malaysia with Mr. Ma around the A=
PEC Summit, and after the forum, the President had the opportunity to tal=
k to Mr. Ma and invited him to come to lunch at the White House next time=
 he was in the area. So this is just a follow-up on that public discussio=
n that they had had.



 Obviously theyve got -- as they discussed in the public forum, there are=
 a number of common interests that they have, particularly as they relate=
 to climate change and the international economy. So this is something th=
at is of interest to President Obama and thats why he was interested to h=
ave lunch with him.



 Q Hes the richest man in Asia, and so I think a lot of us were wondering=
 why that meeting wasnt put on the Presidents public schedule.



 MR. EARNEST: Because it was a private lunch. Its not uncommon for the Pr=
esident to have a private lunch with people that you might find notable. =
But obviously those are disclosed on the WAVES lists that are released re=
gularly. That is a transparency step that no previous President has agree=
d to, and, in fact, the previous administration went to the Supreme Court=
 to try to prevent the release of those lists. So I think our approach to=
 transparency here is well-documented.



 Julie.



 Q I wanted to just ask you about the raids that were hearing are going t=
o be coming in the next few weeks and months on the Central American migr=
ants who have crossed the southern border. Quite a few immigration advoca=
tes as well as some Democratic members of Congress have expressed very de=
ep concerns that some of the people affected here are women and children,=
 many of them who are not afforded due process in these immigration proce=
edings when they cross the border but are being sent back to very dangero=
us conditions. One of them said today that the Presidents decision to con=
duct these raids and use this approach to these people was nothing more t=
han a callous political calculation with real and grave humanitarian cons=
equences. So whats your response, first of all, to that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to correct=
 so many misconceptions. The first is what the Department of Homeland Sec=
urity has indicated is that the current operations are a continuation of =
operations that were announced back in January and in March. And these op=
erations are being conducted consistent with the enforcement priorities t=
hat President Obama and Secretary Johnson laid out back in the fall of 20=
14. That is these operations are focused on convicted criminals and other=
s who could pose a risk to local communities. The other enforcement prior=
ity are individuals that weve previously described as recent border-cross=
ers -- individuals who have been apprehended crossing the border illegall=
y since January 1st of 2014. Those are our enforcement priorities and the=
se operations are being conducted consistent with them.



 Now, in addition to that, thats not the only criteria. Operations are on=
ly being conducted to enforce orders from immigration courts. So only ind=
ividuals who have been given an order of removal are subject to these ope=
rations, and well make sure that these operations are only conducted afte=
r all pending claims for asylum or humanitarian relief have been exhauste=
d. There is a firm commitment to due process and thats just an important =
principle of living in the United States of America, and its certainly on=
e that this government is committed to.



 The last thing -- I guess the other one that I -- the other piece of inf=
ormation that I feel is important to share with you is that there is exis=
ting guidance that the DHS officers follow that avoids carrying out these=
 operations in sensitive locations like schools or hospitals or places of=
 worship. Whats also true, though, is this is a nation of laws and we hav=
e to enforce the laws. We can do all of that consistent with due process,=
 but I would also readily acknowledge that this whole process would be fa=
r more effective if Congress had followed through on comprehensive immigr=
ation reform legislation. There is no argument there. And thats why we co=
ntinue to make that case that thats something Congress should do and its =
why it is congressional Republicans who are ultimately responsible, becau=
se they were the ones who prevented House consideration of bipartisan leg=
islation that had already passed the Senate that we know would have passe=
d the House if a vote had been held. But it wasnt.



 So the administration is committed to enforcing the law. The side benefi=
t here is also this should send a pretty clear signal to everyone, partic=
ularly individuals who are considering having their children smuggled int=
o the country, that thats=20

a really bad idea. It's a dangerous journey. Theres all kinds of evidence=
 to indicate that these human traffickers have bad intentions and subject=
 people who have paid them to horrible dangers, that those who are traffi=
cked end up often being victimized themselves. So this should send a very=
 clear signal to everybody who might be contemplating this that the pitch=
 being peddled by human traffickers that they can get their child into th=
e United States and their child would be allowed to stay is false. That i=
s not an available option. And given the dangers in making that journey, =
it is not something that parents should even consider for their kids.



 And that is a principle that is rooted in a desire to try to protect peo=
ple in other countries who are in a pretty desperate situation. And there=
 are a host of other investments that our country is committed to making =
in places like Honduras and El Salvador to try to address the root causes=
 of this migration that we've seen over the last couple of years.



 Q Does the President regard these people primarily as economic migrants,=
 or as refugees? Because if the President regards them as refugees, the d=
eterrence message that you just recited that is clearly the intent of som=
e of the enforcement actions doesnt seem to apply.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the intent is to enforce the law. That is the primary=
 intent. But, again, for those who may be considering entrusting themselv=
es or the care of their children to human traffickers, this should be a v=
ery clear signal that the sales pitch from the human traffickers is a fal=
se one and it gives false hope to people who are in a desperate situation=
.



 What the administration has sought to do is to address some of the root =
causes of migration. Theres been a $700 million investment that was appro=
priated by Congress a year or two ago that is being used to invest in the=
 security situation in those countries. It's also being used to invest in=
 economic development efforts in those countries to try to address some o=
f those root causes.=20



Theres also been a discussion that has been initiated by the State Depart=
ment, working with the U.N., to try to establish a process where people w=
ith legitimate refugee claims can make them not in the United States or a=
t the U.S. border, but rather in their home countries. That is another wa=
y that we can give people access to refugee protection without having to =
embark on a dangerous journey.



So we're thinking about this creatively in a lot of ways. But there is a =
principle that's at play here about enforcing the law, and it's one that =
the administration takes quite seriously.



Q Doesnt this undermine the Presidents call for European countries to tak=
e in the flood of Syrian refugees that theyre facing at their borders? I =
mean, you're talking about refugees staying in their countries and going =
through the proceedings there instead of coming here. And we've seen the =
President speak pretty strongly about how it's the obligation of countrie=
s who are facing inflows like this to accept people who need to resettle.=
 So how is that consistent?



MR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think it's difficult to compare these situat=
ions. But I think the situation that I've just described in terms of tryi=
ng to give people with legitimate refugee claims a method of applying for=
 that status without having to embark on a dangerous journey. So I think =
we've tried to address these root causes in Central America in a way that=
's just not possible in a place like Syria. So I think that's why it's so=
 difficult to compare these two situations.



I think what is true in both instances is that we do have to consider tha=
t the people that we're talking about are human beings and they should be=
 afforded that kind of common decency, and afforded due process rights. A=
nd that's something that the Department of Homeland Security has indicate=
d theyre committed to, and that is an important part of this equation, th=
at individuals who are targeted in these operations are only subject to t=
hem once they have been ordered removed from the country by an Immigratio=
n court. And they are only subject to these operations once they have exh=
austed all of their humanitarian claims. So there is a commitment to due =
process, but theres also a commitment to enforcing the law.



 Ron.



 Q On the Zika standoff, the administration still says it's a $1.9 billio=
n request. That was from like January 25th or so that you got the documen=
t that you often show us.



 MR. EARNEST: It was technically February 22nd.



 Q Oh, I'm sorry. The question is, now that the Senate has taken some act=
ion, is there someplace where the administration is willing to compromise=
 on that position youve held to for so long, given the public health urge=
ncy of this matter, as you clearly outlined it?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, when we talk about compromise, at least the wa=
y that you have set it up, it contemplates not giving our public health p=
rofessionals everything that they say that they need so that they can do =
everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. S=
o it shouldnt have to come to that, I guess is my point. If our goal here=
 is to protect the public health and well-being of the American people, i=
f that is our top priority, then why wouldnt we just do what our public h=
ealth professionals suggest and pass the kind of proposal that they have =
said encapsulates the need?



 Q But the reality is that the country is mired in political gridlock and=
 things don't get done, and heres an example where apparently the public =
health is at risk because theres little compromise on both sides. So, yes=
, the same question for the other side, but is this --



 MR. EARNEST: I just reject that, Ron. This is not about the administrati=
on not being willing to compromise. This is the specific request that was=
 put forward by public health experts. Theyve been very clear about what =
is necessary. And the only thing that Republicans in the House have come =
forward on is funding at like a third of the level that our public health=
 experts recommend but taking every single penny of that money away from =
efforts to protect the American people from Ebola. So that doesnt make se=
nse at all. That is a dumb approach. And I don't really understand why on=
e would even consider an approach like that. =20



 Q A compromise that protects the interests of public health --



 MR. EARNEST: Like gutting our funding to protect the American people fro=
m the Ebola virus?



 Q Gutting is not the word I'd use. I'm saying --



 MR. EARNEST: That's the word that our public health professionals would =
use. I just went through this yesterday. There are 100 staff at the CDC -=
- 100 CDC staffers, government employees, that right now, as we speak, ar=
e in West Africa, processing 10,000 samples a month to try to fight the E=
bola virus. And Republicans are saying we should just gut funding for tha=
t. I don't think theres any reason -- I don't think there would be any ju=
stification for gutting funding for that just to -- as somebody who stood=
 up here in the fall of 2014 and explained what our government was doing =
to try to protect people from a deadly virus. But to say that we're going=
 to gut funding for that because that's the only way that we can pay to p=
rotect the American people from anther dangerous virus that could potenti=
ally infect pregnant women and their babies -- that doesnt make sense.



 So this doesnt have anything to do -- there are lots of things where Dem=
ocrats and Republicans need to just try to sit down and compromise, and m=
aybe they relate to things like taxes or the appropriate size of governme=
nt, or maybe even our approach to dealing with education reform or job tr=
aining, or something. That is something that should be subject to the pol=
itical process where there is debate, where theres advocacy, where theres=
 bargaining and then ultimately common ground where we can advance someth=
ing that represents a compromise. When it comes to the public health and =
safety of the American people, there should be no compromising.=20



 Q On the issue of the TSA lines that we talked about yesterday, there ha=
ve been a number of senators, Democrats, who have asked for the airlines =
to suspend or compromise -- or change, or compromise, again -- (laughter)=
 -- to suspend their baggage fees to move the process along. Is that some=
thing that the administration supports?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the individual business decisions of th=
e airlines is up to them. Frankly, the airlines and industry experts can =
speak to what impact that would have on lines at the airports. There are =
a number of steps that TSA has taken to try to address this serious probl=
em, and it does relate directly to the need to ensure that we are protect=
ing our aviation system, but also trying to minimize inconvenience for tr=
avelers. And that's something that the TSA takes quite seriously and they=
re working through some creative solutions to try to reduce those lines w=
ithout compromising safety.



 Q Does the President still have confidence in the Administrator, Peter N=
effenger?



 MR. EARNEST: Absolutely. And we've seen, like I said, some creative step=
s that TSA has taken. They have sought additional authority to use more r=
esources to pay overtime so that TSA officers can work longer hours and w=
ork more, spend more time process passengers. Theres this other solution =
they have floated, which is getting more airport personnel that don't hav=
e security functions to help expedite the process through security so tha=
t those security screeners that typically remind people to take off their=
 belts or to fill the bin can actually be used to do screening, and it ca=
n be airport staffers that can help people navigate the security line.=20=




 So there are a number of things that we can do to expand our capacity an=
d try to shorten those lines. But, look, this is a tough problem and the =
President absolutely has confidence that Mr. Neffenger can solve this pro=
blem.



 Q So obviously the summer travel season is coming. Given theres a proble=
m, given there are staffing shortages, given theres this 10-point plan, c=
an travelers reasonably expect that the situation is going to get better =
in the next couple of months? And if not, who is going to be held account=
able?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the TSA has indicated they expect the s=
ituation will improve as some of the staffing increases that they have au=
thorized start to have an impact on individual airports. The other thing =
that TSA is encouraging people to do is to apply for pre-check. If you're=
 a frequent traveler, you can get a background check in advance so that t=
he security screening that you have to go through is different. That pres=
umably would make it possible for you to go through a shorter line. But t=
hat's also going to have the effect of shortening the line for everybody =
else. So we certainly want people to be aware of that.=20



And we do anticipate, again, based on the solutions that TSA has been wor=
king to implement, I know that TSA has said that they expect that the sit=
uation should improve in the weeks and months ahead.



Q Two last housekeeping things. Before the Presidents upcoming trip, is t=
here going to be a more detailed briefing or backgrounder about what exac=
tly -- the goals, objective, timetables?



MR. EARNEST: Yes, we will have some more details about the Presidents tri=
p before he departs on Saturday. We're still working on putting together =
a plan for doing that, but we'll be in touch with you on that. But that's=
 something you can certainly look for before the trip.



Q You will obviously do it before that.



MR. EARNEST: Yes. Okay. But we can coordinate later and see if we can syn=
c up our schedules.



Margaret.



Q Josh, I want to go back to the conversation about Gitmo and Senator Rob=
erts.=20



MR. EARNEST: Okay.



Q Were you saying it's simply a false claim by him that the administratio=
n struck a deal to not transfer prisoners?



MR. EARNEST: I'm saying I can't account for the substance of private conv=
ersations that Senator Roberts had with the Department of Defense. And I =
recognize that that might be somewhat unsatisfying. The good news is, is =
that the Department of Defense official who had that conversation with Se=
nator Roberts has put out a statement making very clear exactly what was =
communicated to Senator Roberts. So I'd refer you to that statement so he=
 can walk you through it.



Q The Deputy Secretary of Defense -- I have that statement -- but it basi=
cally says all options are on the table, but we're running out of time to=
 make a decision. So it's not really a conclusive statement there. I mean=
, what you're saying is that you don't stand by -- if there was a promise=
 in private conversation, that's not the administrations position to prom=
ise and close off Kansas as a possible site.



MR. EARNEST: I'm not going to get into the private conversations that Sen=
ator Roberts had. I'm not privy to them. I wasnt on the phone. I haven't =
been briefed on those private conversations. What I can explain to you is=
 the position that the administration has taken with regard to closing th=
e prison at Guantanamo Bay. Our position hasnt changed. And it's the same=
 position that is strongly supported by a large bipartisan group of natio=
nal security experts, including people whove dedicated their lives to pro=
tecting this country, like General Powell and General Petraeus.=20



Q Right, but no decisions have been made on where these prisoners would b=
e transferred beyond the proposal as it was sent and approved by the Whit=
e House to the Hill.



MR. EARNEST: That's correct. We can't make that decision as long as Congr=
ess is preventing the transfer of any Gitmo detainees anywhere to America=
n soil. And that is a ridiculous policy because the truth of the matter i=
s there are already hardened convicted terrorists serving time in America=
n prisons on American soil right now. People like Richard Reid, the infam=
ous shoe bomber. Youve got Faisal Shahzad, who put a car bomb in Times Sq=
uare. Youve got Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab who tried to blow up an airplan=
e over Detroit. All of these are individuals who went through the court s=
ystem in the United States; they were convicted of their crimes and they =
are currently serving time in American prisons on American soil.=20



We know how to protect the country using our Article III courts and using=
 the American prison system.



Q Then anyone on the Hill who has a belief that sites have been ruled out=
 is simply misunderstanding the administrations position?



MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I dont understand much of what Republicans say =
when they advocate on this issue, so all I can do is try to explain as cl=
early as I possibly can exactly what our approach is. And the good news i=
s that the approach that we have been pursuing for the last several years=
 is the same approach that we are pursuing today.



Q And we're no closer?



MR. EARNEST: Unfortunately, not. Unfortunately, we continue to see obstac=
les that members of Congress have put in place.=20



Q Can I ask you on Nigeria, first? There were reports today the Nigerian =
military was claiming that they did find one of the so-called Chibok girl=
s, one of the schoolgirls that was taken by Boko Haram. Hundreds of them =
disappeared. The admin at the time had been very vocal in calling for the=
ir return. Do you have any comment on this, or confirmation? Have you see=
n these reports?



MR. EARNEST: I havent seen those reports, but let me see if we can get yo=
u some more information on that.



Q And can you clarify whether the administration has made a decision on w=
hether it is willing to sell certain weapons to the current President Buh=
ari of Nigeria?



MR. EARNEST: I've seen some reporting speculating about this. I'm not awa=
re of any decision that's been made, but we can follow up with you on tha=
t as well.



Michelle.



Q Thanks, Josh. You made some comparisons to this campaign season and 200=
8. And, yeah, there are some similarities, absolutely, but there are also=
 enormous differences. And in this case, you have a socialist running aga=
inst a former Secretary of State. You have debate over what the party sho=
uld stand for, what being a progressive even means. And we just heard Sen=
ator Feinstein say that she's worried that if Sanders stays in the race p=
ast June, you could see something like what happened in the 1968 conventi=
on. So that's kind of the comparison she's using. Do you think that's off=
 the mark to be worried about a risk like that?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that right now that's not something tha=
t we're concerned about. Again, this has been a vigorous primary contest,=
 and that ultimately has had the effect of mobilizing millions of America=
ns across the country who have gotten engaged in democratic politics and =
gotten engaged in the process of choosing the Democratic nominee. That's =
good for America. That's good for our democracy. I also happen to think t=
hat's probably pretty good for the Democratic Party. And in 2008, that pr=
ocess and that engagement across the country ended up being a harbinger o=
f Democratic success in the future, in the general election. Hopefully, t=
hat will be true this time, too.



Q But she's worried about the party being harmed if he stays in much long=
er. And the President himself not too long ago, at a private event, expre=
ssed concerns about party unity and it being about time for people to be =
behind one candidate. So do you not share her views that this could be de=
trimental to the Democratic Party much longer?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think at this point, no, I dont share those concerns=
. Obviously, there will be a need for Democrats to come together in the g=
eneral election, and the President will be making that case. But right no=
w we're still probably not in the middle of -- I think probably nearing t=
he end of a nationwide, competitive Democratic primary process that has e=
ngaged the American people from coast to coast. That's a good thing, and =
that kind of competition makes the candidates and makes the parties and m=
akes our democracy stronger. That's a good thing.



Q And maybe it's just about this one incident that happened most recently=
. But now there's a lot of talk about the threat of violence, and what Di=
anne Feinstein just said fits in with that, as well. But you're not conce=
rned about violence moving forward?



MR. EARNEST: Look, I dont think -- no, because --



Q Of riots, like in 1968 or something?



MR. EARNEST: No, that's not something that we're concerned about.



Q Okay, great. And you mentioned yesterday, on the 9/11 legislation, that=
 there was going to be some outreach now with the House. Can you describe=
 a little bit what that will look like? And will the President himself ge=
t involved in that outreach?



MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any presidential conversations that have oc=
curred at least in the last couple of days on this. I think what that out=
reach will look like is the White House seeking to engage Democrats and R=
epublicans who have expressed public concern about this legislation. So t=
here are a number of people that have indicated that they share our conce=
rns with this bill, and we'll work closely with them to try to prevent a =
legislative outcome that puts the United States at greater risk around th=
e world. We dont need to put our interests or our assets or our diplomats=
 or our servicemembers at greater risk. And that is a potential unintende=
d consequence of the legislation as currently drafted and passed by the S=
enate.



Q So are those conversations going to start soon, or now?



MR. EARNEST: I can tell you generally that the White House has already be=
en in touch with members of the House of the Representatives about this. =
I dont know that those conversations have occurred at the presidential le=
vel at this point, but I wouldnt rule that out.=20



Karen, nice to see you.



Q Thank you. Nice to see you. There's a report out from MapLight. It's an=
 organization that tracks money in politics. And it found that 15 of the =
39 main donors to the Obama Foundation have been invited to meetings here=
 at the White House with the President, and one of those meetings was in =
January of 2015, and there were two couples who had donated six figures, =
as well as the actress Julia Roberts was at that meeting. The report also=
 found that three-quarters of the contributors to the foundation that hav=
e been disclosed have been invited to the White House, including every do=
nor that's kicked in more than $100,000. Can you comment on this report? =
And are these meetings here at the White House, especially the ones with =
the President, are they specifically meant to raise money for the foundat=
ion?



MR. EARNEST: They are not. The President has made a commitment that he wi=
ll not be raising money for the foundation while he's still in office. Wh=
at we have said about donors to the campaign also applies to donors at th=
e foundation, and it's simply this: Donating in support of the President'=
s foundation does not guarantee you a meeting with the President of the U=
nited States. It also doesnt prevent you from getting a meeting with the =
President of the United States, and that's the approach that we've taken,=
 again, with regard to supporters of the President's campaign, and it's t=
he approach that we've taken with regard to supporters of the President's=
 foundation.



Q And one more. The Director of National Intelligence this morning, James=
 Clapper, said that there's been indication of attempted hacks on campaig=
n websites and campaign organizations. Can you expand on what those indic=
ations are and how severe they might have been?



MR. EARNEST: Unfortunately, Director Clapper was talking about intelligen=
ce information. And as the Director of National Intelligence, he's got gr=
eater latitude to discuss that information -- well, at least greater lati=
tude than I do. So I dont have anything I can say about that.



Kevin.=20



Q Thanks, Josh. You mentioned earlier the need to apply upward pressure o=
n wages. I'm curious, as it relates to the overtime rule, how concerned i=
s the White House on the economic pressure on small business in particula=
r as they have to take on obviously more salaries and make shifts -- some=
times major structural shifts -- to accommodate the new, or as you put it=
, revised, regulations?



MR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the approach that we have taken is one that is=
 consistent with the need to focus on fairness. Again, we're talking abou=
t people who are the hardest-working Americans. These are individuals who=
, by definition, they're working overtime, and they should be treated fai=
rly. And that should be good for business. And our view is that employers=
 have had ample time to consider these changes. This is something that ha=
s been in the works for more than two years. There were extensive comment=
s that were put forward. I believe it's more than 270,000 comments were r=
eceived on the rule -- some people advocating for a higher threshold, som=
e people advocating for a lower threshold. And we've taken into account t=
hose comments in designing this rule. And we expect that this will have a=
 positive impact on the economy. We anticipate this will have a positive =
impact on wages. And we believe that ultimately this will be good for bus=
iness as well.



Q Good for business in what way?



MR. EARNEST: Well, good for business in that they can ensure that their w=
orkers are being paid fairly. And it also, again, is going to put upward =
pressure on wages. Henry Ford, who at one point made a decision to raise =
the pay of his workers so he could make sure that the people who are work=
ing to build the cars could afford to buy them. So, ultimately, if youre =
looking to strengthen the economy, putting more money in the pocket of mi=
ddle-class workers and those workers that are trying to get into the midd=
le class is a good thing. And heres the thing, in this situation its not =
charity. In this situation, its about fairness. In this situation, its ab=
out making sure that people are being fairly compensated for their overti=
me. These are the hardest -- these are by definition the hardest-working =
Americans. Thats what wed like to see. We believe that will be good for t=
he economy overall, and a good economy is good for business.



 Q Interesting bit in Politico. Would you acknowledge that there is a bit=
 of a race against the clock to try to beat the 23rd so that Donald Trump=
 doesnt have a chance, were he to be elected, to sort of undo some of the=
se regulations that the President is sort of trying to push through?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, this is a rule thats been --=20



 Q This is a revision, I understand.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, its a revision but its also a rule thats been in the =
works for more than two years. So if we were rushing this rule through, w=
e didnt do a very good job of rushing because it took more than two years=
 to get it right. What is true -- and this is something I guess I acknowl=
edged in response to an earlier question -- obviously the next President =
will also have executive authority that they can wield and presumably the=
y can make changes to this threshold as well. We obviously hope that they=
 wont, but this is an executive action and is consistent with what the Pr=
esident believes is a smart strategy to try to grow our economy from the =
middle out and focus on expanding economic opportunity for middle-class w=
orkers and those workers that are trying to get into the middle class.



 Q Why Ohio?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously it is a place where these kinds of issues r=
elated to middle-class workers really resonates. Senator Brown, who is ho=
sting both the Vice President and Secretary Perez, has been a leading adv=
ocate for this change. And they are going to an Ohio business where many =
workers, many employees of that business will benefit from it and the peo=
ple who run that business think thats going to end up being good for the =
overall economy and good for their business prospects.



 Q You see what Im getting at. It could have been Wyoming, but its Ohio.



 MR. EARNEST: It could have been. I dont believe the two senators from Wy=
oming have been particularly aggressive advocates of the overtime rule.



 Q The old politics is what Im getting at. Theres no real sort of, hey, l=
isten, November -- Ohio is such a keystone state as it relates to -- with=
 respect to my friends in Pennsylvania -- its a major state, obviously, p=
olitically speaking. Theres got to be a little bit of that.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, look, Senator Brown is not on the ballot this time, a=
t least not yet. It was a joke. I have no idea. Come on. Im just trying t=
o get a little -- boost his prospects here. But, look, Senator Brown is n=
ot on the ballot but he is somebody who has aggressively advocated for th=
is rule. He is somebody who has urged the administration to raise this th=
reshold and its because he is somebody who has rightly earned the reputat=
ion as somebody who is committed to fighting for American workers and he =
is as interested as the administration is in making sure that people are =
paid fairly, particularly middle-class families.



 Q A couple more. Westinghouse. You mentioned -- I just -- it sort of piq=
ued my interest. Theyre building I guess new nuclear facilities over in C=
hina, correct?



MR. EARNEST: Mm-hmm.



Q Are they building any here? Is the President getting them to do sort of=
 that clean energy work here that might employ Americans? Its been decade=
s since weve had a major reactor built in the States.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, there is one that is going through the permitting proc=
ess that began early in the Presidents administration. Im not sure what t=
he -- I havent gotten a briefing on the latest status of what that is. Bu=
t what we certainly have seen here though is a dramatic growth in renewab=
le energy because of some of the policy decisions that President Obama ha=
s made. Since President Obama took office, weve seen that wind energy has=
 tripled and the amount of energy that is produced from solar has increas=
ed thirtyfold since President Obama took office. That is a result of inve=
stments that were made early on.=20



The Recovery Act included the largest-ever investment in renewable energy=
, and its already starting to pay dividends, both in terms of reducing ou=
r carbon footprint, but also in terms of business opportunities that are =
good for our broader economic growth but also good for job creation. And =
so youve got Westinghouse thats building nuclear plants in China because =
China is looking for ways that they can reduce their carbon footprint. Th=
ats good for economic growth back here in the United States because thats=
 a good American company. But we have also seen a wide variety of America=
n companies building wind turbines and installing solar panels, which has=
 the same positive economic impact on this country too.



 Q Last one. I want to give you another run at the comparison between peo=
ple who are coming over our borders -- often illegally, unfortunately -- =
and refugees in Europe. They both -- it would appear, at least from the o=
utside -- are attempting to escape devastating circumstances, and Im tryi=
ng to understand or square the difference from a policy perspective from =
the White Houses viewpoint, because they both would seem to be in despera=
te need of our help -- whether theyre in Europe and youre calling on othe=
r European countries to reach out and help them.=20



I know that you talked about -- I think you said 10,000 was originally th=
e number in terms of refugees, and I just sort of look at that number and=
 I say, good, that we should probably, from a policy perspective, if the =
President wants to make that argument, good, make that argument. But you =
cant make that argument I think (inaudible) and at the same time say, yea=
h, but we dont want to help these people. Does that make sense?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I can understand why people might be confused and her=
es the -- the commitment that weve made with regard to refugees is actual=
ly, for this fiscal year, I believe it is around 80,000. We can get you t=
he precise number. Its just 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year but a=
bout 80,000 overall.=20



 Now, that could potentially include refugees from Central America but th=
at would require them to go through the rigorous process that has been es=
tablished. And this is a process that includes intense background checks.=
 Its also a process that includes a careful vetting of their background t=
o determine whether or not they qualify for refugee status. And what we h=
ave sought to do is to make it easier for individuals in a handful of Cen=
tral American countries to apply for that status without even leaving the=
ir country. And the idea is that that would give them the opportunity to =
be considered for some form of humanitarian relief or refugee status that=
 would allow them to travel legally into the United States after having t=
heir background carefully vetted without having to risk the dangerous jou=
rney through Mexico, sometimes in the hands of a human smuggler to try to=
 get here.



 A process like that doesnt exist in Syria because nobody -- or hardly an=
ybody in the international community is able to work with the central gov=
ernment there, and the central government has demonstrated that they have=
 no ability to control a security situation in that country. The situatio=
n in a place like El Salvador or Honduras is also difficult and there are=
 people who face terrible life circumstances in that country, too. But at=
 least we have a central government there with whom the United States can=
 work to try to address that situation. So we have provided them substant=
ial resources to try to deal with the security situation there, to try to=
 deal with economic development in those countries that is lacking.=20



 So at least theres something to work with, something to build on when yo=
ure considering a place like El Salvador or Honduras. That kind of platfo=
rm doesnt currently exist in Syria right now, and thats one of the reason=
s -- this is sort of a creative way to make an argument that weve been ma=
king for a couple of years now, which is that the only way that we are re=
ally going to solve the problem of Syria is with a political solution whe=
re we see a political transition that has President Assad leaving power a=
nd somebody else coming into power in Syria that bears the legitimacy of =
the Syrian people. And then the rest of the international community can w=
ork with that person and that persons government to try to bring in the f=
oundation that will start to rebuild that country and give people who hav=
e been threatened there a reason to feel like they can remain home and no=
t be the victim of violence.



Pam.



Q Josh, can I just clarify something? You said recently that no federal f=
unds would be cut off to North Carolina while the legal process was ongoi=
ng over their transgender bill. Is the agency review still going on? And =
if so, is it possible that they could come out with at least a finding?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I cant speak to the work thats going on at ind=
ividual agencies. Presumably, there might be some consideration of the im=
pact of HB2 on the policies of the federal government. So that considerat=
ion may be ongoing. I think youd probably have to check with each individ=
ual agency on this. But what I can tell you is that no action will be tak=
en to block funding as long as the Department of Justice litigation is mo=
ving through the courts.=20



Q So what were the agencies? Education and --



MR. EARNEST: So I think there were a number of agencies that have underta=
ken these kinds of reviews, but the most prominent ones have been Educati=
on, Transportation. I believe HHS and the Department of Labor have also c=
onsidered whether or not this law would have an impact on federally funde=
d programs in North Carolina. I think those are the most prominent ones, =
but we can take a look at this and see if we can get you some other sugge=
stions of agencies to contact.



Q Okay. And just briefly, have you gotten any complaints or concerns or p=
rotests from veterans groups over the Presidents stop in Hiroshima?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Im always trepidacious about giving you this answer, b=
ecause presumably, somebody in this country of 300 million people doesnt =
support this decision.



But what I can tell you is that the overwhelming response that the admini=
stration has gotten has been either positive or at least sympathetic to w=
hat the President is trying to do. And I think thats true of even those w=
ho fought in World War II. Again, this is the Greatest Generation of Amer=
icans. That generation will go down in history for saving the United Stat=
es and the world from tyranny. They sacrificed greatly. But I think even =
many of those veterans would acknowledge that the relationship between th=
e United States and Japan has, before their eyes, been radically transfor=
med. And the United States and Japan are now able to cooperate on a wide =
range of issues, some of which have direct implications for U.S. national=
 security.



And the ability of our nations to cooperate and to coordinate, and to str=
engthen our alliance, is good for the United States and bodes well for th=
e future. And I think theres a large portion of even World War II veteran=
s who may have risked their lives fighting Japanese soldiers in World War=
 II who understand the potential that exists, and understands the argumen=
t that the President has made.



I will acknowledge Im not sure if Id feel the same way if I were them. I =
think in their -- as they think about their service to the country, I thi=
nk that demonstrates a profound depth of selflessness. But I think thats =
the kind of courage and patriotism that many of those Americans showed on=
 the battlefield, and many of them are showing it now -- here we are, sev=
en decades later -- even as they inhabit their role as citizen.



Byron.



Q Thanks, Josh. You said earlier theres a lot of passion in any primary p=
rocess, but it seems to me that were a little bit beyond that. A lot of S=
anders supporters seem to believe that the primary process is rigged agai=
nst him, and the integrity of the entire nominating process is being ques=
tioned. The Nevada situation aside, broadly speaking, does the President =
believe the rules the Democratic Party has laid out from the beginning ar=
e being followed and have been fair?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I havent closely examined the rules. I can say that th=
e White House believes in the integrity of the Democratic National Commit=
tee and their commitment to the fair implementation of the rules.=20



And I know that theyre working with state parties all across the country =
to implement their delegate selection plans to ensure that there is a fai=
r and transparent process for choosing state delegates to the Democratic =
National Convention.=20



The other thing, though, as you were asking, that occurs to me that I thi=
nk sort of helps to put in rather stark relief the intensity of the campa=
ign in 2008 and the impact that that could have had on the general electi=
on in 2008 -- there were not an insignificant number of Democrats in May =
of 2008 who were saying publicly that they were prepared to organize and =
raise money in support of the Republican presidential candidate. There wa=
s a lot of questions about whether or not there would be an aggressive De=
mocrats for McCain movement that would tip the balance of the election.



For all of the passion and ferocity and competitiveness of the Democratic=
 primary in 2016, I havent read too many public accounts of that happenin=
g in this general election.



Q Switching topics, a House committee passed a bill yesterday that would =
stop the District of Columbia from spending its own tax dollars without c=
ongressional approval. If this were to pass the full House and the Senate=
, would the President veto it?



MR. EARNEST: I have seen some of the reporting about this. I know that th=
ere is a -- not coincidentally, I assume -- a prominent story in The Wash=
ington Post about this. I dont yet know that our team has had a chance to=
 consider carefully the impact of the legislation. Its still working its =
way through the legislative process; obviously its just passed through th=
e committee. So well take a look at that proposal and get back to you in =
terms of a position.



JC.



Q Just to follow up on Pam Coulters question. Will there be both United S=
tates and Japanese veterans attending the service at Hiroshima?



MR. EARNEST: I dont know if there will be U.S. veterans there, but as we =
get closer to locking down the details of the trip, well keep you posted.=




Tom.



Q I just have a follow-up on the D.C. question. In 2003, the measure that=
 the House Republicans were trying to block with the support of Speaker R=
yan was endorsed by President Obama. So thats why its -- Im wondering if =
the White House would have a reaction.



MR. EARNEST: Let me dig into this and Ill make sure that we follow up wit=
h you on this as well. Im just not familiar with the details of this part=
icular bill. Theres still an opportunity, obviously, to have an impact on=
 what it would do as it works its way through the legislative process. Bu=
t let me see if I can get you a specific position on it.



Dave, Ill give you the last one.



Q Thanks, Josh. Since you came out to the podium, about a half hour ago, =
AP is reporting that Donald Trump has released his list of 11 potential S=
upreme Court nominees that he plans to vet. Im sorry you havent seen the =
list, but it includes Steven Colloton of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals=
; Judge Allison Eid of the Colorado Supreme Court; Thomas Hardiman of the=
 3rd Circuit; and William Pryor of the 11th Circuit. Obviously thats not =
the whole list, but do any of those names sound familiar to you from your=
 previous vettings?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I dont think that weve ever gotten into people that th=
e --



Q Theres always a first time.



MR. EARNEST: Yes, exactly, there is always a first time. Let me make this=
 observation. I would be surprised if there are any Democrats who would d=
escribe any of those 11 individuals as a consensus nominee. But the indiv=
idual that President Obama has put forward is somebody that Republicans h=
ave described as a consensus nominee. And I think that speaks to the wisd=
om of the Senate acting on the Presidents nomination, and I think it spea=
ks to the Presidents commitment to fulfilling his constitutional responsi=
bilities to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court in a way that is consiste=
nt with his desire to protect the Supreme Court from the kind of partisan=
 wars that its been subjected to of late.



Q I know the President -- youve said the President feels very strongly th=
at Trump will not be the next President, but he is about to become the ma=
jor party nominee. Can you give us a thumbnail sketch of what you think a=
 Supreme Court thats populated by Trump nominees, what direction that wou=
ld take the country?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Ill leave that to others to speculate what Mr. Trump w=
ould do as President of the United States. My responsibility here is to f=
orcefully advocate for what the President has done and what he is going t=
o do over the eight months that he has remaining in office. And theres a =
lot weve got to get done.



Thanks, everybody. Well see you tomorrow.

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Good aft=
ernoon, everybody.&nbsp; Nice to see you all.&nbsp; I do have a quick state=
ment at the top before we get to questions.&nbsp; As I'm sure you are aware=
, today Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are doing thei=
r
 jobs and fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities by reviewing Chi=
ef Judge Garland&#8217;s questionnaire and holding a public meeting to lear=
n more about this highly qualified nominee.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the individuals they=
 have invited to the Senate today to speak in support of Chief Judge Garlan=
d&#8217;s character and credentials is a man named Timothy Lewis.&nbsp; Mr.=
 Lewis is a retired former judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
 the 3rd Circuit.&nbsp; In his written remarks, Judge Lewis noted, &#8220;F=
or anyone who questions, as most Americans do, the Senate&#8217;s treatment=
 of Judge Garland&#8217;s nomination to the United States Supreme Court, I =
am living proof that it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way.&#8221;&nbsp;
 As Judge Lewis notes, he was nominated in the fall of 1992, weeks before a=
 presidential election.&nbsp; He was nominated by a Republican President to=
 serve on the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; He had a hearing before a Democratic-=
controlled Senate Judiciary Committee and
 was unanimously confirmed by a Democratic-controlled Senate on October 8th=
, just three weeks before the election.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's one way in which his=
 testimony today is interesting.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s a second.&nbsp; La=
ter in his career, Judge Lewis returned to Congress to testify on behalf of=
 his 3rd Circuit colleague, Sam Alito.&nbsp; At the time, Judge Lewis noted
 that he did not share Justice Alito&#8217;s &#8220;conservative ideology,&=
#8221; but that he &#8220;found him to be a good person and a fine judge, i=
ntellectually honest, highly principled, and well qualified to serve on the=
 Court.&#8221;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following Judge Lewis&#8217=
;s testimony that day, Senator Grassley noted that he found Judge Lewis&#82=
17;s testimony on behalf of then-Judge Alito &#8220;particularly compelling=
.&#8221;&nbsp; So today, we hope that Senator Grassley will be similarly co=
mpelled
 by Judge Lewis&#8217;s remarks.&nbsp; Otherwise, Senator Grassley&#8217;s =
continued obstruction amounts to what former Judge Lewis today called &#822=
0;dangerous political gamesmanship rooted in an unfortunate ideological fer=
vor that ultimately harms each branch of government and
 dilutes the effectiveness and capacity of the judiciary.&#8221;<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So before today I had not h=
ad the pleasure of ever having heard of Judge Lewis, but presumably all of =
you have.&nbsp; But obviously he has some interesting things to say and he =
comes to this issue from a unique perspective.&nbsp; So I commend
 his testimony to your attention.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with all that, we'll go =
straight to the birthday boy.&nbsp; Josh, you can begin.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; It seems like you were having fun with that last windup.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I enjoye=
d reading about Judge Lewis&#8217;s testimony today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wante=
d to start with Senator Pat Roberts&#8217;s comments about the confirmation=
 of Eric Fanning --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes.&nbs=
p; We last discussed him when he was crumbling the Gitmo paper in his hands=
 and filming himself throwing it into a wastebasket.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, h=
e essentially suggested that there was a quid pro quo between him and the D=
efense Department that he agreed to lift this hold because he was told by D=
eputy Defense Secretary Work that the clock had run out on transferring
 people to Leavenworth or really to the mainland.&nbsp; I know that the Dep=
uty Defense Secretary has put out his own statement despite this, but one t=
hing he doesn&#8217;t address in that statement is the specific language th=
at Senator Roberts brought up about the clock
 has run out on being able to do this in the time that's left in this admin=
istration.&nbsp; So I'm wondering if you can -- is the White House disputin=
g Senator Roberts&#8217;s account of what he was told by the Defense Depart=
ment about that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
going to get into any -- I don't have any insight to share about private co=
nversations between Senator Roberts and the Department of Justice.&nbsp; Th=
e good news is -- I'm sorry -- the Department of Defense.&nbsp; The good
 news is that the Department of Defense has explained exactly what was comm=
unicated to Senator Roberts.&nbsp; They were involved in those discussions,=
 and they can make clear exactly what was communicated to him.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing that I can just c=
onfirm for you is that nothing about the administration's position, with re=
gard to the need to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, has changed.&nbsp; =
We continue to believe that the most effective way to close
 the prison is to transfer all those individuals that can be safely transfe=
rred.&nbsp; We continue to work with our partners all around the world to d=
o that in a way that is consistent with our national security.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But we also believe that =
it's possible to transfer the remaining detainees at the prison at Guantana=
mo Bay to the United States to secure facilities where those detainees can =
be held without posing a threat to our
 national security.&nbsp; After all -- and Senator Roberts knows this quite=
 well -- that there are dangerous, convicted, hardened terrorists serving t=
ime on American soil, in American prisons, right now.&nbsp; That does not p=
ose a threat to our national security.&nbsp; In
 fact, detaining them, having brought them to justice through our Article I=
II courts, actually makes our country safer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So our argument on this is =
quite clear.&nbsp; This is an argument that has strong bipartisan support a=
mong national security experts.&nbsp; President Bush agreed with this posit=
ion.&nbsp; Both Colin Powell, General David Petraeus have also articulated
 their strong support for the priority that should be placed on closing the=
 prison at Guantanamo Bay explicitly for national security reasons.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think=
 the elephant in the room here is that even if Congress were to see the lig=
ht, in your view, and embrace what you've described as the most effective, =
direct way to close the prison by lifting these restrictions, that would
 be effective at the start of the new fiscal year.&nbsp; So you basically h=
ave October, November, December and part of January to select a location, p=
repare a location, transfer dozens of detainees from Gitmo to the United St=
ates, and then close the prison.&nbsp; So
 are you able to acknowledge at this point that even if President Obama is =
able to order the closure of Guantanamo Bay, that he won't be able to actua=
lly, because of these logistical constraints, close it by the time he leave=
s office?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I haven&=
#8217;t been presented with that conclusion.&nbsp; So we continue to believ=
e that it is possible and, in fact, should be a priority of the United Stat=
es government to succeed in closing that prison.&nbsp; And President Obama
 vowed to do it as soon as possible.&nbsp; He did that on I believe it was =
his second or third full day in office.&nbsp; And the President continues t=
o strongly believe that that should be a priority and that that would be po=
ssible if our efforts to achieve this goal
 were not being thwarted by obstructionists in the United States Congress.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I w=
anted to ask you about this dispute within the Democratic Party primary and=
 some of the comments from Senator Sanders just in the last day, saying, in=
 light of what happened in Nevada, the Democratic Party basically has
 a choice.&nbsp; It can open its doors, bring people in, or it can choose t=
o be -- its status-quo structure remain dependent on big-money contribution=
s and be a party with limited energy.&nbsp; And I'm wondering if you feel t=
hat, after seven and a half years of the Democratic
 Party being under the leadership of President Obama, if that's an accurate=
 description of the way the party stands.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, le=
t me make a couple of observations.&nbsp; The first is that I do feel confi=
dent -- though I did not specifically do this myself -- that if you were to=
 Google news coverage from May 18th, 2008, the tenor of the coverage
 would be quite similar to the tenor of the coverage today.&nbsp; There wou=
ld be all kinds of hand-wringing among party activists about whether or not=
 the party would come together after a divisive primary between Senator Oba=
ma and Senator Clinton.&nbsp; There would
 be pundits with decades of electoral experience posing difficult questions=
 about whether or not it is even possible given the passion of Clinton supp=
orters for even somebody with all the skills of Senator Obama to unite the =
Democratic Party.&nbsp; There would be
 Republicans salivating at the prospect of a divided Democratic Party limpi=
ng into a general election, giving an advantage to the Republican nominee.&=
nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess the point is that w=
e've seen a lot of this before.&nbsp; And that's not to diminish anybody's =
candidacy.&nbsp; It's not to diminish the passion and commitment of support=
ers for either candidate.&nbsp; But it is an indication that the Democratic
 Party in a general election will be focused on a different question.&nbsp;=
 Americans across the country will be focused on a very clear choice that t=
hey'll have in a general election, and there will be ample time over the ne=
xt six or seven months for candidates
 on either side to make their case.&nbsp; And President Obama will certainl=
y be weighing in to make his case.&nbsp; And I think all of that will serve=
 to motivate the American people to engage in this debate and to participat=
e in the election.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And President Obama and oth=
ers will certainly be making that case.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t have too ma=
ny doubts about the intensity of the debate that is likely to ensue or the =
degree to which voters on both sides and both parties will be highly
 motivated to participate.&nbsp; It's a good thing for our democracy.&nbsp;=
 And President Obama had an opportunity to speak about this at the commence=
ment ceremony at Rutgers University over the weekend.&nbsp; And the idea th=
at our electorate gets more engaged in these kinds
 of political debates is good for the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pri=
maries are always hard-fought, I think we acknowledge.&nbsp; But this seems=
 to be a different flavor here.&nbsp; I mean, we've got allegations of viol=
ence, of disenfranchisement; the DNC Chairwoman saying one of the candidate=
's campaigns
 is doing insufficient to address that.&nbsp; Does the President feel no ob=
ligation at this point to mediate or to try and resolve some of this?&nbsp;=
 He's basically just going to wait until the candidates do that amongst the=
mselves to get involved?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think, Josh, that we have seen that the party primaries typically are, part=
icularly ones that are contested as passionately as this one has been.&nbsp=
; There are going to be strong feelings on both sides.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think one of the less=
ons of the election in 2008 is not to confuse the passion in the primary fo=
r disinterest in the general election.&nbsp; I think, if anything, the reas=
on that people are so passionate about the current primary
 process is they understand the stakes in the general election.&nbsp; So th=
at certainly was true in 2008.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see if it&#8217;s true in =
2016.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m confident that the President&#8217;s engagement i=
n the general election will be useful in sharpening up that case and he
 certainly looks forward to the opportunity to do it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I also think that Presi=
dent Obama benefits from his own personal involvement in the last hotly con=
tested Democratic presidential primary; that yes, the issues are a little d=
ifferent and the debates are always a little bit different
 but no less intense.&nbsp; They certainly were intense, particularly in th=
is period, in May of 2008.&nbsp; So there&#8217;s probably an interesting s=
tory to be written there about sort of where things were at this stage eigh=
t years ago.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeff.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, D=
onald Trump said yesterday in an interview with Reuters that he would be wi=
lling to talk to North Korea&#8217;s leader, and that if he were successful=
 in winning the White House, that he would renegotiate the Paris climate de=
al.&nbsp;
 What&#8217;s your reaction to the first?&nbsp; And on the second, should U=
.S. allies be concerned that the Paris deal is not as strong or as bulletpr=
oof as the President did say when he helped to create it?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, on=
 the question related to North Korea, the President has been -- has had a n=
umber of opportunities recently to make clear exactly what our position is =
there.&nbsp; The United States has worked effectively with the internationa=
l
 community, including countries like Russia and China, to isolate North Kor=
ea because of their failure to abide by their international obligations whe=
n it comes to their nuclear program.&nbsp; And we have succeeded in ramping=
 up that pressure and ramping up that
 isolation.&nbsp; It has not yet had the desired effect on the North Korean=
 regime, but there&#8217;s ample evidence to indicate that they are feeling=
 that pressure.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what we have said is th=
at that pressure can be relieved and the international community is prepare=
d to engage with North Korea as soon as they make clear their commitment to=
 denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and ending the kind
 of provocative rhetoric and acts that are so destabilizing to the broader =
region.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ve been pretty clear about what the path out of t=
his isolation is for the North Korean government.&nbsp; Thus far, they have=
 declined to pursue it, but that&#8217;s the strategy
 that we have laid out and it is a strategy that is consistent with the joi=
nt pursuit of our interests in that region of the world, where the United S=
tates stands by our allies in South Korea and stands by our allies in Japan=
 and coordinates with China and
 Russia in pursuit of this goal.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it relates to the Paris =
climate agreement, I would just note that it&#8217;s more than 190 countrie=
s who signed on to this agreement, and each of them made specific commitmen=
ts with regard to how they would reduce carbon pollution in
 their countries.&nbsp; This is an agreement that took years to negotiate.&=
nbsp; It is an agreement that was only possible because of the leadership o=
f the United States -- this is something that Prime Minister Cameron mentio=
ned at the news conference that he did with
 President Obama in London a couple of weeks ago.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This agreement was catalyze=
d when President Obama announced alongside President Xi in China that both =
China and the United States were prepared to make commitments to cut carbon=
 pollution.&nbsp; The Republican talking point for years had
 been that it was folly for the United States to pursue an international cl=
imate agreement and to cut carbon pollution in the United States knowing th=
at China was going to only pollute more.&nbsp; The truth is because of prin=
cipled, effective diplomacy and the leadership
 of President Obama, we did reach an agreement where China agreed to cap th=
eir emissions and begin to bring them down.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s significant ab=
out that is not just the positive impact we anticipate that that will have =
on the climate and the positive impact it had on diplomacy in terms of brin=
ging other countries to the table, it&#8217;s also going to have a
 positive impact on the U.S. economy.&nbsp; We already know that Westinghou=
se, a fine American business, has committed to building four nuclear plants=
 in China.&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s a pretty good indication of -- a pret=
ty clear example of how the world&#8217;s commitment to
 a low-carbon future has a positive economic impact in the United States.&n=
bsp; The same is true of other countries -- I mean of other U.S. companies =
like General Electric that now have essentially a global market for renewab=
le energy.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As other countries have m=
ade a commitment to cutting their carbon pollution, they have to look to re=
newable energy to power their economy.&nbsp; And the United States -- in pa=
rt because of some of the historic investments
 that were made in this sector of the economy under President Obama&#8217;s=
 leadership, the United States is the leading edge of that industry.&nbsp; =
And a global commitment on the part of nations around the world to consider=
ing sources of renewable energy only creates
 good economic opportunities for American businesses and American workers.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the completion of the Pa=
ris agreement is a testament to President Obama&#8217;s leadership, the eff=
ectiveness of diplomacy, the positive impact it will have on the climate an=
d the positive impact it will have on the U.S. economy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But jus=
t to circle back to my questions, is the White House concerned that U.S. al=
lies may view comments like this as a sign that this agreement is not as ro=
bust as the President said when he signed it?&nbsp; And on the North Korea
 topic -- <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, le=
t me just do that one first.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s an=
ybody that&#8217;s losing sleep here at the White House about that.&nbsp; S=
o, no, that&#8217;s not a source of concern.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on =
North Korea, the President, when he was a candidate in 2008, also suggested=
 that he would talk to U.S. enemies.&nbsp; Does he consider it responsible =
or irresponsible for Donald Trump to be suggesting that about Kim Jong-un?<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t think I&#8217;m going to weigh in at this point on the pronouncements=
 or rhetoric of any of the candidates, particularly with regard to an issue=
 like North Korea.&nbsp; But we certainly have made clear what our approach
 to that situation is, and it is rooted in the President&#8217;s commitment=
 to working closely with our allies and partners around the world to ramp u=
p pressure on countries like North Korea.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should also note that Pre=
sident Obama, over the last several years, has also deployed additional mil=
itary assets to the Asia Pacific region, some of them oriented specifically=
 to counter North Korea&#8217;s missile program.&nbsp; And because
 of those investments and because of those strategic decisions that the Pre=
sident made in close consultation with our military leaders, believes that =
we&#8217;ve got sufficient protections in place.&nbsp; But that certainly h=
as not dampened our desire to work effectively
 with the international community to ramp up pressure on the North Koreans =
to get them to change course.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Briefly=
, on one other topic.&nbsp; The Vice President was unveiling the overtime -=
- details of the overtime rules that we&#8217;ve been expecting for some ti=
me.&nbsp; Is the White House confident that these will stand up to legal ch=
allenges from
 Republicans in the business community?&nbsp; And are you confident that th=
ey will stay in place if a Republican -- Donald Trump, in this case -- wins=
 the White House in November?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the short answer to your question is yes.&nbsp; I will elaborate on i=
t briefly.&nbsp; As it relates to sort of the legal questions, this is actu=
ally not the creation of a new rule.&nbsp; This is a rule that has been on
 the books governing overtime pay for decades now.&nbsp; So this is merely =
an update of an already-existing rule that will ensure that the hardest-wor=
king Americans are paid fairly for their overtime.&nbsp; So the principle i=
s quite simple.&nbsp; The impact is quite significant.&nbsp;
 We would anticipate that this executive action that would extend overtime =
protections to more than 4 million American workers -- again, by definition=
, these are 4 million of the hardest-working Americans.&nbsp; These are ind=
ividuals who are already working overtime.&nbsp;
 And the President believes that they should be paid fairly for their work.=
&nbsp; And the economic impact is also significant.&nbsp; The economic impa=
ct, according to our estimates, is that Americans&#8217; wages would increa=
se by $12 billion over the next 10 years as a result
 of this rule.&nbsp; So this an impactful way for us to ensure that America=
n workers are paid fairly, and to do something that many people have identi=
fied as an important goal, which is to put upward pressure on wages.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've seen strong economic =
growth in this country.&nbsp; We've seen strong trends related to job creat=
ion.&nbsp; But we haven't seen as much progress made on increasing wages in=
 this country.&nbsp; And this is a tangible example of how we can do
 that.&nbsp; And by the way, by definition, this is increasing wages for pe=
ople who make $47,000 or less.&nbsp; So this is consistent with the Preside=
nt&#8217;s strategy that our economy is going to be strongest when we're gr=
owing from the middle out and we're looking for
 opportunities to expand economic opportunity for middle-class families and=
 those families that are working hard to get to the middle class.<o:p></o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The que=
stion is, can they withstand legal challenges?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, the=
y can withstand legal challenges.&nbsp; Again, it's not a new rule.&nbsp; T=
his is a rule that's been on the books for a long time.&nbsp; It's just mer=
ely updated with new standards.&nbsp; And the next President will have to m=
ake
 their own choices with regard to the way that they choose to use executive=
 action.&nbsp; That's true on a whole range of things.&nbsp; But the legal =
foundation for making this argument is solid.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justin.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want =
to start with Zika.&nbsp; Yesterday, the Senate did not pass the President&=
#8217;s $1.9 billion request but did pass the $1.1 billion package.&nbsp; S=
tipulating everything that you've said many times before about public healt=
h experts
 wanting the full $1.9 billion, is the package that passed the Senate somet=
hing that you guys would be willing to accept?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 are going to continue to advocate for the $1.9 billion package.&nbsp; And =
we were pleased to see that that proposal, while it did not pass, did garne=
r some important bipartisan support.&nbsp; So Republicans like Marco
 Rubio and even Bill Cassidy from Louisiana -- two states that are on the G=
ulf Coast that I think are legitimately concerned about the potential impac=
t of the Zika virus on the populations in those two states -- supported the=
 $1.9 billion package.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And Senator Rubio, I thin=
k, said it in a way that I would strongly agree with for a change.&nbsp; He=
 said, yes, the proposal came from the White House.&nbsp; But &#8220;it's r=
eally the scientists&#8217; request, the doctors&#8217; request,
 the public health sector&#8217;s request for how to address this issue.&#8=
221;&nbsp; And he&#8217;s right.&nbsp; The President put forward this propo=
sal, but he did so based on the specific advice that he has received from o=
ur public health professionals. And we're going to continue
 to urge Congress to consider fully funding the request that our public hea=
lth professionals have made.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I'm no expert in math, bu=
t obviously the Senate proposal that was passed yesterday is larger than th=
e House Republican proposal that's under consideration.&nbsp; So obviously =
we've seen just in the last couple of weeks
 important progress in the right direction.&nbsp; For a while we saw Republ=
icans on Capitol Hill basically rejecting the need for this kind of funding=
, but now we've seen bipartisan legislation move through the Senate that wo=
uld fund our efforts for more than a
 billion dollars.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So obviously that's good =
progress, but it falls short of what our public health professionals believ=
e is necessary.&nbsp; And we're going to continue to advocate for what our =
public health professionals believe is necessary.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You s=
aid that you would veto the House bill, and so I'm wondering, I guess, does=
 that veto threat stand for anything less than the $1.9 billion?&nbsp; Or i=
s the $1.1 billion something that -- not exactly everything
 you want, but you're willing to take it?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
we're going to continue to advocate for the $1.9 billion.&nbsp; And I don't=
 have a veto threat to issue on the $1.1 billion.&nbsp; Our concerns about =
the Republican proposal in the House are many.&nbsp; It's
 not just that they are about $1.3 billion short of what our experts say is=
 necessary.&nbsp; It also demands that that emergency funding be paid for b=
y gutting investments in protecting the American people from the Ebola viru=
s.&nbsp; So the approach that Republicans
 have advocated for in the House is wrong, it's unwise, and it is inconsist=
ent with prioritizing the public health and wellbeing of the American peopl=
e.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Liby=
a, I'm wondering if you have a timeline to share for the U.S. and its allie=
s to secure the U.N. Security Council resolution that they want that would =
enable us to ship arms to the unity government there.&nbsp; And also, I kno=
w
 that you talked a little bit about how it would be designed to keep arms o=
ut of the hands of people that we don&#8217;t want to have them in the regi=
on, but I'm wondering if you could just maybe talk more broadly about if th=
ere's any risk that an infusion of arms
 is going to heighten tension or kind of fuel additional conflict just by t=
heir mere presence there.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
aware of a timeline that has been set out for the passage of a resolution.&=
nbsp; You can check with my colleagues in Ambassador Power's office.&nbsp; =
They would have a better sense of the mechanics of all of this.&nbsp; But
 the broader question is, what can the international community do to suppor=
t the government of national accord in Libya in their efforts to secure the=
 country and combat the ISIL presence that we know is there.&nbsp; And how =
can we do all of that in a way that prevents
 the arms from falling into the wrong hands.&nbsp; Libya is a dangerous pla=
ce, and there are a variety of factions that aren&#8217;t shy about resorti=
ng to violence to try to get their way inside of Libya.&nbsp; So the prospe=
ct of further militarizing the situation is a prospect
 that must be carefully considered.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But what's also clear is =
that the government of national accord needs sufficient resources and equip=
ment to get that situation under control.&nbsp; And so that's what our expe=
rts will be examining.&nbsp; And I recognize that
 they have to walk a fine line here, so it will be carefully considered.&nb=
sp; I don&#8217;t know if there is a timeline.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think th=
ere will be any desire to rush it.&nbsp; But at the same time, further dela=
ys are only going to create more space for some of those armed
 factions that aren&#8217;t shy about resorting to violence.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this is a difficult si=
tuation.&nbsp; We've made tremendous progress, though, when you sort of con=
sider where we were even three or four months ago.&nbsp; There was a lot of=
 doubt about whether or not we were going to be
 able to bring about the kind of political consensus among a variety of opp=
osition groups to even form a government.&nbsp; But the U.N. did a lot of i=
mportant work.&nbsp; The United States played a leading role in facilitatin=
g these conversations and bringing the international
 community together behind them.&nbsp; And we do now have a government of n=
ational accord, and that government of national accord now is in Tripoli.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we've made a lot of im=
portant progress that, frankly, a couple of months I don&#8217;t think I ev=
en would have believed was possible.&nbsp; And so we need to look for ways =
to keep that momentum going.&nbsp; And one way to do
 that is to consider international support for their security efforts there=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And l=
ast one.&nbsp; House Republicans are saying today that classified administr=
ation reports provided to Congress over the last three years show that the =
administration knowingly approved for the transfer of Gitmo
 detainees to countries that were incapable of preventing them from returni=
ng to terrorism, and argue that administration officials have given mislead=
ing testimony about that.&nbsp; So I was wondering how you respond to that =
sort of request from Republicans to correct
 the record on this issue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
look, I think the record is quite clear about what President Obama has work=
ed to do.&nbsp; When he took office in 2009, he instituted a new procedure =
for considering specific cases of individual Gitmo
 detainees.&nbsp; And that process included a review of individual case fil=
es to determine the best way to dispose of those cases.&nbsp; And what the =
idea has been is that, by carefully reviewing the individual cases, we can =
design the most effective way to prevent them
 from posing a threat to the United States or our allies.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And this has been a rigor=
ous process and it's been meticulous, and you'll recall that early in 2009 =
and 2010, it took a while to stand this process up and to move through all =
of the applications.&nbsp; But that process
 has paid significant dividends for our national security because it has al=
lowed us to succeed in transferring 144 individuals since January of 2009.&=
nbsp; And what we know is that less than 5 percent of them, of those indivi=
duals, have been confirmed as reengaging
 in the fight; 95 percent of them aren&#8217;t.&nbsp; And that's an indicat=
ion of the ability that the United States has to close the prison at Guanta=
namo Bay in a way that mitigates the risk that is posed to the American peo=
ple.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So this is a process that=
 is rigorous, that sometimes is not just exhaustive, but exhausting, but it=
 has demonstrated a track record of success.&nbsp; And the President believ=
es that we would be even more successful
 if Congress weren&#8217;t time and time again trying to throw sand in the =
gears of the process in a way that has only slowed down our efforts and mad=
e our efforts more difficult.&nbsp; And that's unfortunate.&nbsp; But our t=
rack record here is solid and it is one that the
 President is proud of.&nbsp; It's one that has bipartisan support in terms=
 of pursuing a goal that Democrats and Republicans share, and that is the n=
eed to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.&nbsp; This is often shaped up as=
 a fight between Democrats and Republicans,
 or Republicans on Capitol Hill in a Democratic administration.&nbsp; The t=
ruth is, the Republican administration supported closing the prison at Guan=
tanamo Bay.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I did have a chance to=
 take a look at the statement from the Speaker's office today, and there wa=
s a suggestion somehow that the Obama administration was prioritizing polit=
ics in this situation.&nbsp; Well, that's
 pretty rich.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think that General David Petraeus is prio=
ritizing politics when he says we should close the prison at Guantanamo Bay=
.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think that General Colin Powell is prioritizing polit=
ics when he suggests that we should close the prison at
 Guantanamo Bay.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think Senator McCain is playing politi=
cs when he suggests that we should close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.&nbsp=
; I don&#8217;t think that Senator Graham of South Carolina is playing poli=
tics when suggests that we close the prison at Guantanamo
 Bay.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think that Senator Collins is playing politics wh=
en she says that it would be a good idea to close the prison at Guantanamo =
Bay.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">You know who is playing p=
olitics with this?&nbsp; The RNC, who says that they actually want to run a=
ds against Democrats all across the country for wanting to close the prison=
 at Guantanamo Bay.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we know what's going o=
n here.&nbsp; And you have congressional Republicans that are cynically pla=
ying politics and playing on the fears of the American people in order to s=
core some cheap political points.&nbsp; The truth
 is, the American people would be safer if we succeeded in closing the pris=
on.&nbsp; And that's not just my assessment.&nbsp; That's the assessment of=
 the United States Department of Defense.&nbsp; That's the assessment of th=
e United States intelligence community.&nbsp; And that's
 the assessment of Democratic and Republican national security experts that=
 for years have disagree with the approach of this Congress to prevent the =
closure of the prison.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the White House&#8217;s reaction to Oversight Com=

Commissioner today?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
don&#8217;t know that I saw that specific news.&nbsp; Obviously our views o=
f the work of the IRS Commissioner are quite different than the views of co=
ngressional Republicans.&nbsp; The fact is that John Koskinen has assumed a
 very difficult task.&nbsp; And that task has been made only more difficult=
 by the false accusations of Republicans and by the continued insistence of=
 Republicans to cut the budget for the IRS.&nbsp; So we know that over the =
last five years or so -- yes, over the last
 five years that Congress has cut the IRS budget by a billion dollars.&nbsp=
; And as a result, we&#8217;ve seen wait times for customer service increas=
e.&nbsp; It&#8217;s had a not positive impact on enforcement.&nbsp; And the=
n to have Republicans come back and say that he&#8217;s not doing
 a very good job, it&#8217;s not on the level.&nbsp; And if they spent half=
 as much time trying to make sure that the IRS got the money that they need=
ed to do their job as they do undermining the commissioner of the IRS, the =
American people would be better served.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to =

:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t have a readout of the lunch.&nbsp; As I mentioned yesterday, the Pres=
ident appeared at a forum in Malaysia with Mr. Ma around the APEC Summit, a=
nd after the forum, the President had the opportunity to talk to Mr. Ma
 and invited him to come to lunch at the White House next time he was in th=
e area.&nbsp; So this is just a follow-up on that public discussion that th=
ey had had.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously they&#8217;ve got=
 -- as they discussed in the public forum, there are a number of common int=
erests that they have, particularly as they relate to climate change and th=
e international economy.&nbsp; So this is something that is of interest
 to President Obama and that&#8217;s why he was interested to have lunch wi=
th him.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#821=
7;s the richest man in Asia, and so I think a lot of us were wondering why =
that meeting wasn&#8217;t put on the President&#8217;s public schedule.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Because =
it was a private lunch.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not uncommon for the President to =
have a private lunch with people that you might find notable.&nbsp; But obv=
iously those are disclosed on the WAVES lists that are released regularly.&=
nbsp;
 That is a transparency step that no previous President has agreed to, and,=
 in fact, the previous administration went to the Supreme Court to try to p=
revent the release of those lists.&nbsp; So I think our approach to transpa=
rency here is well-documented.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julie.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wante=
d to just ask you about the raids that we&#8217;re hearing are going to be =
coming in the next few weeks and months on the Central American migrants wh=
o have crossed the southern border.&nbsp; Quite a few immigration advocates=
 as well
 as some Democratic members of Congress have expressed very deep concerns t=
hat some of the people affected here are women and children, many of them w=
ho are not afforded due process in these immigration proceedings when they =
cross the border but are being sent
 back to very dangerous conditions.&nbsp; One of them said today that the P=
resident&#8217;s decision to conduct these raids and use this approach to t=
hese people was nothing more than a callous political calculation with real=
 and grave humanitarian consequences.&nbsp; So what&#8217;s
 your response, first of all, to that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
appreciate you giving me the opportunity to correct so many misconceptions.=
&nbsp; The first is what the Department of Homeland Security has indicated =
is that the current operations are a continuation of operations
 that were announced back in January and in March.&nbsp; And these operatio=
ns are being conducted consistent with the enforcement priorities that Pres=
ident Obama and Secretary Johnson laid out back in the fall of 2014.&nbsp; =
That is these operations are focused on convicted
 criminals and others who could pose a risk to local communities.&nbsp; The=
 other enforcement priority are individuals that we&#8217;ve previously des=
cribed as recent border-crossers -- individuals who have been apprehended c=
rossing the border illegally since January
 1st of 2014.&nbsp; Those are our enforcement priorities and these operatio=
ns are being conducted consistent with them.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in addition to that, t=
hat&#8217;s not the only criteria.&nbsp; Operations are only being conducte=
d to enforce orders from immigration courts.&nbsp; So only individuals who =
have been given an order of removal are subject to these operations, and
 we&#8217;ll make sure that these operations are only conducted after all p=
ending claims for asylum or humanitarian relief have been exhausted.&nbsp; =
There is a firm commitment to due process and that&#8217;s just an importan=
t principle of living in the United States of America,
 and it&#8217;s certainly one that this government is committed to.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last thing -- I guess t=
he other one that I -- the other piece of information that I feel is import=
ant to share with you is that there is existing guidance that the DHS offic=
ers follow that avoids carrying out these operations in
 sensitive locations like schools or hospitals or places of worship.&nbsp; =
What&#8217;s also true, though, is this is a nation of laws and we have to =
enforce the laws.&nbsp; We can do all of that consistent with due process, =
but I would also readily acknowledge that this whole
 process would be far more effective if Congress had followed through on co=
mprehensive immigration reform legislation.&nbsp; There is no argument ther=
e.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why we continue to make that case that that&#8217=
;s something Congress should do and it&#8217;s why it is congressional
 Republicans who are ultimately responsible, because they were the ones who=
 prevented House consideration of bipartisan legislation that had already p=
assed the Senate that we know would have passed the House if a vote had bee=
n held.&nbsp; But it wasn&#8217;t.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the administration is co=
mmitted to enforcing the law.&nbsp; The side benefit here is also this shou=
ld send a pretty clear signal to everyone, particularly individuals who are=
 considering having their children smuggled into the country,
 that that&#8217;s <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">a really bad idea.&nbsp; It's a dangerous journey.&n=
bsp; There&#8217;s all kinds of evidence to indicate that these human traff=
ickers have bad intentions and subject people who have paid them to horribl=
e dangers, that those who are trafficked end up often
 being victimized themselves.&nbsp; So this should send a very clear signal=
 to everybody who might be contemplating this that the pitch being peddled =
by human traffickers that they can get their child into the United States a=
nd their child would be allowed to stay
 is false.&nbsp; That is not an available option.&nbsp; And given the dange=
rs in making that journey, it is not something that parents should even con=
sider for their kids.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is a principle tha=
t is rooted in a desire to try to protect people in other countries who are=
 in a pretty desperate situation.&nbsp; And there are a host of other inves=
tments that our country is committed to making in places like
 Honduras and El Salvador to try to address the root causes of this migrati=
on that we've seen over the last couple of years.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does th=
e President regard these people primarily as economic migrants, or as refug=
ees?&nbsp; Because if the President regards them as refugees, the deterrenc=
e message that you just recited that is clearly the intent of some of the
 enforcement actions doesn&#8217;t seem to apply.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e intent is to enforce the law.&nbsp; That is the primary intent.&nbsp; But=
, again, for those who may be considering entrusting themselves or the care=
 of their children to human traffickers, this should be a very clear
 signal that the sales pitch from the human traffickers is a false one and =
it gives false hope to people who are in a desperate situation.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the administration has=
 sought to do is to address some of the root causes of migration.&nbsp; The=
re&#8217;s been a $700 million investment that was appropriated by Congress=
 a year or two ago that is being used to invest in the security situation
 in those countries.&nbsp; It's also being used to invest in economic devel=
opment efforts in those countries to try to address some of those root caus=
es.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">There&#8217;s also been a=
 discussion that has been initiated by the State Department, working with t=
he U.N., to try to establish a process where people with legitimate refugee=
 claims can make them not in the United States
 or at the U.S. border, but rather in their home countries.&nbsp; That is a=
nother way that we can give people access to refugee protection without hav=
ing to embark on a dangerous journey.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we're thinking about t=
his creatively in a lot of ways.&nbsp; But there is a principle that's at p=
lay here about enforcing the law, and it's one that the administration take=
s quite seriously.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn=
&#8217;t this undermine the President&#8217;s call for European countries t=
o take in the flood of Syrian refugees that they&#8217;re facing at their b=
orders?&nbsp; I mean, you're talking about refugees staying in their countr=
ies
 and going through the proceedings there instead of coming here.&nbsp; And =
we've seen the President speak pretty strongly about how it's the obligatio=
n of countries who are facing inflows like this to accept people who need t=
o resettle.&nbsp; So how is that consistent?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
listen, I think it's difficult to compare these situations.&nbsp; But I thi=
nk the situation that I've just described in terms of trying to give people=
 with legitimate refugee claims a method of applying
 for that status without having to embark on a dangerous journey.&nbsp; So =
I think we've tried to address these root causes in Central America in a wa=
y that's just not possible in a place like Syria.&nbsp; So I think that's w=
hy it's so difficult to compare these two
 situations.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think what is true in b=
oth instances is that we do have to consider that the people that we're tal=
king about are human beings and they should be afforded that kind of common=
 decency, and afforded due process rights.&nbsp;
 And that's something that the Department of Homeland Security has indicate=
d they&#8217;re committed to, and that is an important part of this equatio=
n, that individuals who are targeted in these operations are only subject t=
o them once they have been ordered removed
 from the country by an Immigration court.&nbsp; And they are only subject =
to these operations once they have exhausted all of their humanitarian clai=
ms.&nbsp; So there is a commitment to due process, but there&#8217;s also a=
 commitment to enforcing the law.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the =
Zika standoff, the administration still says it's a $1.9 billion request.&n=
bsp; That was from like January 25th or so that you got the document that y=
ou often show us.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; It was t=
echnically February 22nd.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I'm=
 sorry.&nbsp; The question is, now that the Senate has taken some action, i=
s there someplace where the administration is willing to compromise on that=
 position you&#8217;ve held to for so long, given the public health urgency=
 of this
 matter, as you clearly outlined it?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, when we talk about compromise, at least the way that you have set it u=
p, it contemplates not giving our public health professionals everything th=
at they say that they need so that they can do everything possible
 to protect the American people from the Zika virus.&nbsp; So it shouldn&#8=
217;t have to come to that, I guess is my point.&nbsp; If our goal here is =
to protect the public health and well-being of the American people, if that=
 is our top priority, then why wouldn&#8217;t we just
 do what our public health professionals suggest and pass the kind of propo=
sal that they have said encapsulates the need?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the=
 reality is that the country is mired in political gridlock and things don'=
t get done, and here&#8217;s an example where apparently the public health =
is at risk because there&#8217;s little compromise on both sides.&nbsp; So,=
 yes, the same
 question for the other side, but is this --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I just r=
eject that, Ron.&nbsp; This is not about the administration not being willi=
ng to compromise.&nbsp; This is the specific request that was put forward b=
y public health experts.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve been very clear about what is =
necessary.&nbsp;
 And the only thing that Republicans in the House have come forward on is f=
unding at like a third of the level that our public health experts recommen=
d but taking every single penny of that money away from efforts to protect =
the American people from Ebola.&nbsp;
 So that doesn&#8217;t make sense at all.&nbsp; That is a dumb approach.&nb=
sp; And I don't really understand why one would even consider an approach l=
ike that. &nbsp; &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A compr=
omise that protects the interests of public health --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Like gut=
ting our funding to protect the American people from the Ebola virus?<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;=
Gutting&#8221; is not the word I'd use.&nbsp; I'm saying --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That's t=
he word that our public health professionals would use.&nbsp; I just went t=
hrough this yesterday.&nbsp; There are 100 staff at the CDC -- 100 CDC staf=
fers, government employees, that right now, as we speak, are in West
 Africa, processing 10,000 samples a month to try to fight the Ebola virus.=
&nbsp; And Republicans are saying we should just gut funding for that.&nbsp=
; I don't think there&#8217;s any reason -- I don't think there would be an=
y justification for gutting funding for that just
 to -- as somebody who stood up here in the fall of 2014 and explained what=
 our government was doing to try to protect people from a deadly virus.&nbs=
p; But to say that we're going to gut funding for that because that's the o=
nly way that we can pay to protect the
 American people from anther dangerous virus that could potentially infect =
pregnant women and their babies -- that doesn&#8217;t make sense.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this doesn&#8217;t have =
anything to do -- there are lots of things where Democrats and Republicans =
need to just try to sit down and compromise, and maybe they relate to thing=
s like taxes or the appropriate size of government, or maybe
 even our approach to dealing with education reform or job training, or som=
ething.&nbsp; That is something that should be subject to the political pro=
cess where there is debate, where there&#8217;s advocacy, where there&#8217=
;s bargaining and then ultimately common ground where
 we can advance something that represents a compromise.&nbsp; When it comes=
 to the public health and safety of the American people, there should be no=
 compromising.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the =
issue of the TSA lines that we talked about yesterday, there have been a nu=
mber of senators, Democrats, who have asked for the airlines to suspend or =
compromise -- or change, or compromise, again -- (laughter) -- to suspend
 their baggage fees to move the process along.&nbsp; Is that something that=
 the administration supports?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, lo=
ok, I think the individual business decisions of the airlines is up to them=
.&nbsp; Frankly, the airlines and industry experts can speak to what impact=
 that would have on lines at the airports.&nbsp; There are a number of
 steps that TSA has taken to try to address this serious problem, and it do=
es relate directly to the need to ensure that we are protecting our aviatio=
n system, but also trying to minimize inconvenience for travelers.&nbsp; An=
d that's something that the TSA takes
 quite seriously and they&#8217;re working through some creative solutions =
to try to reduce those lines without compromising safety.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does th=
e President still have confidence in the Administrator, Peter Neffenger?<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Absolute=
ly.&nbsp; And we've seen, like I said, some creative steps that TSA has tak=
en.&nbsp; They have sought additional authority to use more resources to pa=
y overtime so that TSA officers can work longer hours and work more,
 spend more time process passengers.&nbsp; There&#8217;s this other solutio=
n they have floated, which is getting more airport personnel that don't hav=
e security functions to help expedite the process through security so that =
those security screeners that typically remind
 people to take off their belts or to fill the bin can actually be used to =
do screening, and it can be airport staffers that can help people navigate =
the security line.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there are a number of th=
ings that we can do to expand our capacity and try to shorten those lines.&=
nbsp; But, look, this is a tough problem and the President absolutely has c=
onfidence that Mr. Neffenger can solve this problem.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So obvi=
ously the summer travel season is coming.&nbsp; Given there&#8217;s a probl=
em, given there are staffing shortages, given there&#8217;s this 10-point p=
lan, can travelers reasonably expect that the situation is going to get bet=
ter in the
 next couple of months?&nbsp; And if not, who is going to be held accountab=
le?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, lo=
ok, I think the TSA has indicated they expect the situation will improve as=
 some of the staffing increases that they have authorized start to have an =
impact on individual airports.&nbsp; The other thing that TSA is
 encouraging people to do is to apply for pre-check.&nbsp; If you're a freq=
uent traveler, you can get a background check in advance so that the securi=
ty screening that you have to go through is different.&nbsp; That presumabl=
y would make it possible for you to go through
 a shorter line.&nbsp; But that's also going to have the effect of shorteni=
ng the line for everybody else.&nbsp; So we certainly want people to be awa=
re of that.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we do anticipate, aga=
in, based on the solutions that TSA has been working to implement, I know t=
hat TSA has said that they expect that the situation should improve in the =
weeks and months ahead.<o:p></o:p></p>

 to you is the position that the administration has taken with regard to cl=

o enormous differences.&nbsp; And in this case, you have a socialist
 running against a former Secretary of State.&nbsp; You have debate over wh=
at the party should stand for, what being a progressive even means.&nbsp; A=
nd we just heard Senator Feinstein say that she's worried that if Sanders s=
tays in the race past June, you could see
 something like what happened in the 1968 convention. &nbsp;So that's kind =
of the comparison she's using.&nbsp; Do you think that's off the mark to be=
 worried about a risk like that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I can tell you that right now that's not something that we're concerned abo=
ut.&nbsp; Again, this has been a vigorous primary contest, and that ultimat=
ely has had the effect of mobilizing millions
 of Americans across the country who have gotten engaged in democratic poli=
tics and gotten engaged in the process of choosing the Democratic nominee.&=
nbsp; That's good for America.&nbsp; That's good for our democracy.&nbsp; I=
 also happen to think that's probably pretty good
 for the Democratic Party.&nbsp; And in 2008, that process and that engagem=
ent across the country ended up being a harbinger of Democratic success in =
the future, in the general election.&nbsp; Hopefully, that will be true thi=
s time, too.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But s=
he's worried about the party being harmed if he stays in much longer.&nbsp;=
 And the President himself not too long ago, at a private event, expressed =
concerns about party unity and it being about time for people
 to be behind one candidate.&nbsp; So do you not share her views that this =
could be detrimental to the Democratic Party much longer?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think at this point, no, I don&#8217;t share those concerns.&nbsp; Obviou=
sly, there will be a need for Democrats to come together in the general ele=

 But right now we're still probably not in the middle of -- I think probabl=
y nearing the end of a nationwide, competitive Democratic primary process t=
hat has engaged the American people from coast to coast.&nbsp; That's a goo=
d thing, and that kind of competition
 makes the candidates and makes the parties and makes our democracy stronge=

 not concerned about violence moving forward?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay,=

 and Republicans who have expressed public concern about this legislation.&=
nbsp; So there are a number of people that have indicated that they share o=
ur concerns with this bill, and we'll work closely with them to try to prev=
ent a legislative outcome that puts the
 United States at greater risk around the world.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t need =
to put our interests or our assets or our diplomats or our servicemembers a=

at 15 of the 39 main donors to the Obama Foundation have been invited to
 meetings here at the White House with the President, and one of those meet=
ings was in January of 2015, and there were two couples who had donated six=
 figures, as well as the actress Julia Roberts was at that meeting.&nbsp; T=
he report also found that three-quarters
 of the contributors to the foundation that have been disclosed have been i=
nvited to the White House, including every donor that's kicked in more than=
 $100,000.&nbsp; Can you comment on this report?&nbsp; And are these meetin=

 ones with the President, are they specifically meant to raise money for th=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; They a=
re not.&nbsp; The President has made a commitment that he will not be raisi=

said about donors to the campaign also applies to donors
 at the foundation, and it's simply this:&nbsp; Donating in support of the =
President's foundation does not guarantee you a meeting with the President =
of the United States.&nbsp; It also doesn&#8217;t prevent you from getting =
a meeting with the President of the United States,
 and that's the approach that we've taken, again, with regard to supporters=

ages.&nbsp; I'm curious, as it relates to the overtime rule, how concerned =
is the White House on the economic pressure on small business
 in particular as they have to take on obviously more salaries and make shi=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
listen, the approach that we have taken is one that is consistent with the =
need to focus on fairness.&nbsp; Again, we're talking about people who are =
the hardest-working Americans.&nbsp; These are individuals
 who, by definition, they're working overtime, and they should be treated f=
airly.&nbsp; And that should be good for business.&nbsp; And our view is th=
at employers have had ample time to consider these changes.&nbsp; This is s=
omething that has been in the works for more than
 two years.&nbsp; There were extensive comments that were put forward.&nbsp=
; I believe it's more than 270,000 comments were received on the rule -- so=
me people advocating for a higher threshold, some people advocating for a l=
ower threshold.&nbsp; And we've taken into account
 those comments in designing this rule.&nbsp; And we expect that this will =
have a positive impact on the economy.&nbsp; We anticipate this will have a=
 positive impact on wages.&nbsp; And we believe that ultimately this will b=
e good for business as well.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
good for business in that they can ensure that their workers are being paid=
 fairly.&nbsp; And it also, again, is going to put upward pressure on wages=
.&nbsp; Henry Ford, who at one point made a decision
 to raise the pay of his workers so he could make sure that the people who =
are working to build the cars could afford to buy them.&nbsp; So, ultimatel=
y, if you&#8217;re looking to strengthen the economy, putting more money in=
 the pocket of middle-class workers and those
 workers that are trying to get into the middle class is a good thing.&nbsp=
; And here&#8217;s the thing, in this situation it&#8217;s not charity.&nbs=
p; In this situation, it&#8217;s about fairness.&nbsp; In this situation, i=
t&#8217;s about making sure that people are being fairly compensated for
 their overtime.&nbsp; These are the hardest -- these are by definition the=
 hardest-working Americans.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we&#8217;d like to see.=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interes=

race against the clock to try to beat the 23rd so that Donald Trump doesn&#=
8217;t have a chance, were he to be elected, to sort of undo some of these =
regulations
 that the President is sort of trying to push through?&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, it=
&#8217;s a revision but it&#8217;s also a rule that&#8217;s been in the wor=
ks for more than two years.&nbsp; So if we were rushing this rule through, =
we didn&#8217;t do a very good job of rushing because it took more than two=
 years to get
 it right.&nbsp; What is true -- and this is something I guess I acknowledg=
ed in response to an earlier question -- obviously the next President will =
also have executive authority that they can wield and presumably they can m=
ake changes to this threshold as well.&nbsp;
 We obviously hope that they won&#8217;t, but this is an executive action a=
nd is consistent with what the President believes is a smart strategy to tr=
y to grow our economy from the middle out and focus on expanding economic o=
pportunity for middle-class workers and
 those workers that are trying to get into the middle class.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ob=
viously it is a place where these kinds of issues related to middle-class w=
orkers really resonates.&nbsp; Senator Brown, who is hosting both the Vice =
President and Secretary Perez, has been a leading advocate for this
 change.&nbsp; And they are going to an Ohio business where many workers, m=
any employees of that business will benefit from it and the people who run =
that business think that&#8217;s going to end up being good for the overall=
 economy and good for their business prospects.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; It could=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old=

, hey, listen, November -- Ohio is such a keystone state as it relates to -=
- with respect to my friends in Pennsylvania -- it&#8217;s a major state, o=

 speaking.&nbsp; There&#8217;s got to be a little bit of that.<o:p></o:p></=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, lo=

t was a joke.&nbsp; I have no idea.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just try=
ing to get a little -- boost his prospects here.&nbsp; But, look, Senator B=
rown is not on
 the ballot but he is somebody who has aggressively advocated for this rule=
.&nbsp; He is somebody who has urged the administration to raise this thres=
hold and it&#8217;s because he is somebody who has rightly earned the reput=

 for American workers and he is as interested as the administration is in m=

y because of some of the policy decisions that President Obama has made.&nb=
sp; Since President Obama took office, we&#8217;ve seen that wind energy ha=
s tripled and the amount of energy that is
 produced from solar has increased thirtyfold since President Obama took of=
fice.&nbsp; That is a result of investments that were made early on.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The Recovery Act included=
 the largest-ever investment in renewable energy, and it&#8217;s already st=
arting to pay dividends, both in terms of reducing our carbon footprint, bu=
t also in terms of business opportunities
 that are good for our broader economic growth but also good for job creati=
on.&nbsp; And so you&#8217;ve got Westinghouse that&#8217;s building nuclea=
r plants in China because China is looking for ways that they can reduce th=
eir carbon footprint.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good for economic growth
 back here in the United States because that&#8217;s a good American compan=
y.&nbsp; But we have also seen a wide variety of American companies buildin=
g wind turbines and installing solar panels, which has the same positive ec=
onomic impact on this country too.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last on=
e.&nbsp; I want to give you another run at the comparison between people wh=
o are coming over our borders -- often illegally, unfortunately -- and refu=
gees in Europe.&nbsp; They both -- it would appear, at least from the outsi=
de --
 are attempting to escape devastating circumstances, and I&#8217;m trying t=
o understand or square the difference from a policy perspective from the Wh=
ite House&#8217;s viewpoint, because they both would seem to be in desperat=
e need of our help -- whether they&#8217;re in Europe
 and you&#8217;re calling on other European countries to reach out and help=
 them.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I know that you talked ab=
out -- I think you said 10,000 was originally the number in terms of refuge=
es, and I just sort of look at that number and I say, good, that we should =
probably, from a policy perspective,
 if the President wants to make that argument, good, make that argument.&nb=
sp; But you can&#8217;t make that argument I think (inaudible) and at the s=
ame time say, yeah, but we don&#8217;t want to help these people.&nbsp; Doe=
s that make sense?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
can understand why people might be confused and here&#8217;s the -- the com=
mitment that we&#8217;ve made with regard to refugees is actually, for this=
 fiscal year, I believe it is around 80,000.&nbsp; We can get you the preci=
se
 number.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year but =
about 80,000 overall.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, that could potentially=
 include refugees from Central America but that would require them to go th=
rough the rigorous process that has been established.&nbsp; And this is a p=
rocess that includes intense background checks.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also
 a process that includes a careful vetting of their background to determine=
 whether or not they qualify for refugee status.&nbsp; And what we have sou=
ght to do is to make it easier for individuals in a handful of Central Amer=
ican countries to apply for that status
 without even leaving their country.&nbsp; And the idea is that that would =
give them the opportunity to be considered for some form of humanitarian re=
lief or refugee status that would allow them to travel legally into the Uni=
ted States after having their background
 carefully vetted without having to risk the dangerous journey through Mexi=
co, sometimes in the hands of a human smuggler to try to get here.<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A process like that doesn&#=
8217;t exist in Syria because nobody -- or hardly anybody in the internatio=
nal community is able to work with the central government there, and the ce=
ntral government has demonstrated that they have no ability
 to control a security situation in that country.&nbsp; The situation in a =
place like El Salvador or Honduras is also difficult and there are people w=
ho face terrible life circumstances in that country, too.&nbsp; But at leas=
t we have a central government there with
 whom the United States can work to try to address that situation.&nbsp; So=
 we have provided them substantial resources to try to deal with the securi=
ty situation there, to try to deal with economic development in those count=
ries that is lacking.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So at least there&#8217;s s=
omething to work with, something to build on when you&#8217;re considering =
a place like El Salvador or Honduras.&nbsp; That kind of platform doesn&#82=
17;t currently exist in Syria right now, and that&#8217;s one of the reason=
s -- this
 is sort of a creative way to make an argument that we&#8217;ve been making=
 for a couple of years now, which is that the only way that we are really g=
oing to solve the problem of Syria is with a political solution where we se=
e a political transition that has President
 Assad leaving power and somebody else coming into power in Syria that bear=
s the legitimacy of the Syrian people.&nbsp; And then the rest of the inter=
national community can work with that person and that person&#8217;s govern=
ment to try to bring in the foundation that
 will start to rebuild that country and give people who have been threatene=
d there a reason to feel like they can remain home and not be the victim of=
 violence.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh,=
 can I just clarify something?&nbsp; You said recently that no federal fund=
s would be cut off to North Carolina while the legal process was ongoing ov=

 on?&nbsp; And if so, is it possible that they could come out with at least=
 a finding?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I guess I can&#8217;t speak to the work that&#8217;s going on at individual=
 agencies.&nbsp; Presumably, there might be some consideration of the impac=
t of HB2 on the policies of the federal government.&nbsp; So that
 consideration may be ongoing.&nbsp; I think you&#8217;d probably have to c=
heck with each individual agency on this.&nbsp; But what I can tell you is =
that no action will be taken to block funding as long as the Department of =
Justice litigation is moving through the courts.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So wh=
at were the agencies?&nbsp; Education and --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; So I t=
hink there were a number of agencies that have undertaken these kinds of re=
views, but the most prominent ones have been Education, Transportation.&nbs=
p; I believe HHS and the Department of Labor have
 also considered whether or not this law would have an impact on federally =
funded programs in North Carolina.&nbsp; I think those are the most promine=
nt ones, but we can take a look at this and see if we can get you some othe=
r suggestions of agencies to contact.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.=
&nbsp; And just briefly, have you gotten any complaints or concerns or prot=
ests from veterans&#8217; groups over the President&#8217;s stop in Hiroshi=
ma?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I&#8217;m always trepidacious about giving you this answer, because presuma=
bly, somebody in this country of 300 million people doesn&#8217;t support t=
his decision.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But what I can tell you i=
s that the overwhelming response that the administration has gotten has bee=
n either positive or at least sympathetic to what the President is trying t=
o do.&nbsp; And I think that&#8217;s true of even
 those who fought in World War II.&nbsp; Again, this is the &#8220;Greatest=
 Generation&#8221; of Americans.&nbsp; That generation will go down in hist=
ory for saving the United States and the world from tyranny.&nbsp; They sac=
rificed greatly.&nbsp; But I think even many of those veterans would
 acknowledge that the relationship between the United States and Japan has,=
 before their eyes, been radically transformed.&nbsp; And the United States=
 and Japan are now able to cooperate on a wide range of issues, some of whi=
ch have direct implications for U.S.
 national security.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the ability of our na=
tions to cooperate and to coordinate, and to strengthen our alliance, is go=
od for the United States and bodes well for the future.&nbsp; And I think t=
here&#8217;s a large portion of even World War
 II veterans who may have risked their lives fighting Japanese soldiers in =
World War II who understand the potential that exists, and understands the =
argument that the President has made.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I will acknowledge I&#821=
7;m not sure if I&#8217;d feel the same way if I were them.&nbsp; I think i=
n their -- as they think about their service to the country, I think that d=
emonstrates a profound depth of selflessness.&nbsp; But I
 think that&#8217;s the kind of courage and patriotism that many of those A=
mericans showed on the battlefield, and many of them are showing it now -- =
here we are, seven decades later -- even as they inhabit their role as citi=
zen.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
s, Josh.&nbsp; You said earlier there&#8217;s a lot of passion in any prima=
ry process, but it seems to me that we&#8217;re a little bit beyond that.&n=
bsp; A lot of Sanders supporters seem to believe that the primary process
 is rigged against him, and the integrity of the entire nominating process =
is being questioned.&nbsp; The Nevada situation aside, broadly speaking, do=
es the President believe the rules the Democratic Party has laid out from t=
he beginning are being followed and have
 been fair?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I haven&#8217;t closely examined the rules.&nbsp; I can say that the White =
House believes in the integrity of the Democratic National Committee and th=
eir commitment to the fair implementation of the rules.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I know that they&#821=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The other thing, though, =
as you were asking, that occurs to me that I think sort of helps to put in =
rather stark relief the intensity of the campaign in 2008 and the impact th=
at that could have had on the general
 election in 2008 -- there were not an insignificant number of Democrats in=
 May of 2008 who were saying publicly that they were prepared to organize a=
nd raise money in support of the Republican presidential candidate.&nbsp; T=
here was a lot of questions about whether
 or not there would be an aggressive &#8220;Democrats for McCain&#8221; mov=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">For all of the passion an=

8217;t read too many public accounts of that happening in this general elec=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Switc=

 the individual that President Obama has put forward is somebody that Repub=

 to the wisdom of the Senate acting on the President&#8217;s nomination, an=
d I think it speaks to the President&#8217;s commitment
