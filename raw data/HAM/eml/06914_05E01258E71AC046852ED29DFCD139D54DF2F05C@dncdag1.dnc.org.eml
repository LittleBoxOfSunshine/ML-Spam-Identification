Can you call her and do the push back we did with the last BS anti-DWS stor=
y? Holly Shulman is being...Holly.

I want to make sure we touch this beyond my initial response.

Hi Luis,

My name is Lisa Hagen, and I'm a campaign reporter with The Hill newspaper =
in Washington. I reached out to both you and Mark yesterday and was hoping =
I could talk to one of you about the fallout from the Nevada convention and=
 the back-and-forth between Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz and the Sanders ca=
mpaign. I wanted to give you guys a chance to respond and be included in th=
e story. If you can email or call me back as soon as possible, that'd be gr=
eatly appreciated. My contact info is below in my signature. Thanks in adva=
nce!
