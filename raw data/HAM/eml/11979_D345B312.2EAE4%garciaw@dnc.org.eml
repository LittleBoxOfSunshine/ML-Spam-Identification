Trump passes Romney=92s popular vote total, likely to break GOP record<http=

With his five blowout wins Tuesday night, Donald Trump has passed Mitt Romn=
ey=92s popular vote total from four years ago and is on a trajectory that c=
ould land him more Republican votes than any presidential candidate in mode=
rn history =96 by a lot.

Trump surged to 9.86 million votes<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/=
2016/president/republican_vote_count.html>, according to totals that includ=
e Tuesday=92s preliminary results across the northeast. That=92s about 50,0=
00 votes more than Romney earned<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/20=
12/president/republican_vote_count.html> in the entire 2012 primary season =
and 40,000 less than John McCain earned<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/ep=
olls/2008/president/republican_vote_count.html> in 2008.

Trump is certain to pass McCain=92s total next week in Indiana, but more im=
portantly, he=92s positioned to easily pass the modern record-holder =96 Ge=
orge W. Bush =96 who collected 10.8 million<http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe200=
0/2000presprim.htm> votes in 2000.

That presents an uncomfortable reality for anti-Trump forces: they=92re att=
empting to thwart the candidate who is likely to win more Republican primar=
y votes than any GOP contender in at least the last 36 years, and maybe eve=
r.

In an email to POLITICO, University of Minnesota political science professo=
r (and Smart Politics blogger) Eric Ostermeier noted that only eight candid=
ates have won more than 7.5 million Republican primary votes since the adve=
nt of the modern primary and caucus system. Ronald Reagan won about 7.7 mil=
lion votes in 1980, the fewest other than George W. Bush=92s 7.6 million in=
 2004, when he didn=92t face a primary challenge.

George H. W. Bush clocked in at 8.2 million votes in 1988 and 9.2 million i=
n 1992, while Bob Dole earned 8.4 million in 1996.
