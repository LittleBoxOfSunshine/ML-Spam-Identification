From Trump team



Personally, Politically And Professionally, Trump Insults Our Veterans

IN 2015, DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT MCCAIN WAS "NOT A WAR HERO" BECAUSE "HE WAS CAPTURED"


Trump On John McCain: "I Like People That Weren't Captured, OK?" TRUMP: "[John McCain] hit me -- he's not a war hero... He's a war hero because he was captured.  I like people that weren't captured, OK?  I hate to tell you." [Family Leadership Summit, Ames IA, 7/18/15]

Trump On Sen. McCain: "He's Not A War Hero. He's A War Hero Because He Was Captured. I Like People Who Weren't Captured." "Mr. Trump upended a Republican presidential forum here, and the race more broadly, by saying of the Arizona senator and former prisoner of war: 'He's not a war hero. He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.' Mr. McCain, a naval aviator, was shot down during the Vietnam War and held prisoner for more than five years in Hanoi, refusing early release even after being repeatedly beaten." [New York Times, 7/19/15<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/us/politics/trump-belittles-mccains-war-record.html>]

TRUMP TRIED TO COMPARE HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF WOMANIZING AND MAKING MONEY TO HAVING SERVED IN THE MILITARY

Trump Said That Avoiding Contracting STDs While Sleeping Around Was "My Personal Vietnam. I Feel Like A Great And Very Brave Solider." STERN: "Now getting back to dating, and when you got to say to a woman, you gotta go to my personal doctor and I'm gonna have you checked out, is that a tough thing to say to a woman?" TRUMP: "It's amazing, I can't even believe it. I've been so lucky in terms of that whole world.  It is a dangerous world out there.  It's like Vietnam, sort of... It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave solider," [The Howard Stern Show, 1997]

Trump Said That Having Gone To Prep School At The New York Military Academy Gave Him "More Military Training Than A Lot Of Guys That Go Into The Military" And That He "Always Felt That [He] Was In The Military." "Donald J. Trump, who received draft deferments through much of the Vietnam War, told the author of a coming biography that he nevertheless 'always felt that I was in the military' because of his education at a military-themed boarding school. Mr. Trump said his experience at the New York Military Academy, an expensive prep school where his parents had sent him to correct poor behavior, gave him 'more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.'" [New York Times, 9/9/15<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/us/politics/donald-trump-likens-his-schooling-to-military-service-in-book.html>]

Trump In 1993: "We Have Our Own Vietnam. It's Called The Dating Game." TRUMP: "You know, if you're young, and in this era, and if you have any guilt about not having gone to Vietnam. We have our own Vietnam. It's called the dating game... Dating is like being in Vietnam. You're the equivalent of a soldier going over to Vietnam." [BuzzFeed, 4/28/16<https://www.buzzfeed.com/natemcdermott/trump-in-1993-the-dating-scene-is-like-vietnam?utm_term=.gevKnBKJdz#.njMM8NMRwn>; Howard Stern Show, 1993]

TRUMP WAS NOT DRAFTED FOR VIETNAM WAR BECAUSE OF STUDENT AND MEDICAL DEFERMENTS

Trump Received Four Student Deferments From Military Service Between 1964 And 1968. "Trump received four student deferments from military service between 1964 and 1968. In Ames, he told reporters another medical deferment he received after graduating was for a bone spur in his foot. When asked which foot, Trump told reporters to look up the records." [Politico, 7/18/15<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/trump-attacks-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured-120317.html#ixzz3gOZ6FK7r>]

Donald Trump Said He Received "Numerous Deferments" During The Vietnam War Because He Was In College And Also Had A "Foot Thing" That Prevented Him From Serving. "'What makes you just love this country in the way that you do?' the man asked. The Republican front-runner started to explain: 'I love the country,' he said. 'I have seen what it can do.' But Trump quickly acknowledged that he never served in the military. During the Vietnam War he received 'numerous deferments' because he was enrolled in college and had a disqualifying 'foot thing.' Meanwhile, Trump said some of his friends did serve and some died. 'I always felt a little guilty,' Trump said." [Washington Post, 12/2/15<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/02/donald-trump-takes-a-gentler-more-personable-tone-in-new-hampshire/>]


*         While Trump Received A Medical Deferment From The Draft Due To A Bone Spur In His Foot, He Could Not Recall Which Foot Had The Problem. "Asked about his own military draft status, Mr. Trump, 69, said that he received medical deferments from the Vietnam War because of a bone spur in his foot. Mr. Trump could not recall which foot was afflicted. Yet Mr. Trump's awkward and ill-suited remarks about religion and marriage here may have done more damage to his candidacy, at least with Christian conservatives." [New York Times, 7/19/15<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/us/politics/trump-belittles-mccains-war-record.html>]

TRUMP HELD A FUNDRAISER FOR VETERANS AS A POLITICAL PLOY

New York Times: Donald Trump's Event, Supposedly "About The Veterans" Was "Was Entirely About Him: His Hurt, His Feelings, His Vanity And His Revenge." "It was not really about the veterans. Donald J. Trump was putting on a show - and it was entirely about him: his hurt, his feelings, his vanity and his revenge. Separated from the Republican debate here by three miles and enough chutzpah to fill his own auditorium, Mr. Trump taunted, derided and laughed off the candidates who showed up to the Fox News forum that he so theatrically snubbed Thursday evening."

New York Times: During His Event During The 1/28 Republican Debate, Donald Trump Bragged About How Many More Cameras Were Covering His Event Than The Debate - "This Is Like The Academy Awards." "Separated from the Republican debate here by three miles and enough chutzpah to fill his own auditorium, Mr. Trump taunted, derided and laughed off the candidates who showed up to the Fox News forum that he so theatrically snubbed Thursday evening. ... At every turn, Mr. Trump bragged about how much more compelling his event was than the rumpus unfolding at the same time across town. 'This is like the Academy Awards,' he said, to laughs. 'We are told that we have more cameras than they do by quite a lot.'"

2/11/16: Over Two Weeks Later After Donald Trump's Fundraiser For Veterans, Some Of Promised Beneficiaries Were Just Beginning To Be Paid While The Majority Had Heard Nothing From Trump's Foundation. "The day after [Donald Trump's  fundraising event for veterans groups, which he claimed raised at least $ 6 million], his campaign promised to quickly send the cash to nearly two dozen groups and soon presented a handful of them oversize novelty checks for $100,000 from his foundation. But those big checks can't be cashed, and two weeks later some of the groups are just now beginning to get paid. The majority said they were unsure how or when the pledged donations would reach them, citing difficulties in communicating with the Trump campaign. Such appearances also raised questions about whether the groups' participation in a political event could jeopardize their nonprofit status."

Two Months After His Veterans Fundraising Event, Trump Had Only Distributed Roughly $2.4 Million Of The Promised $6 Million In Donations. "More than two months after Donald Trump skipped a Republican debate to hold a fundraiser for veterans, the targeted beneficiaries are still seeing a fraction of the promised money raised from the Republican's charitable foundation and his wealthy friends. A survey by The Wall Street Journal of 19 of the 22 groups originally listed by Mr. Trump's presidential campaign as the prospective recipients of the funds found that they had received roughly $2.4 million of the estimated $6 million in donations the campaign said the event generated. The total received by all of the groups is likely to be more." [Wall Street Journal, 4/7/16<http://www.wsj.com/articles/veterans-charities-await-funds-raised-by-donald-trump-1460069309>]

DONALD TRUMP WAS A VOCAL OPPONENT OF STREET VENDORS THAT OPERATED ALONG FIFTH AVENUE, MANY OF WHOM WERE DISABLED VETERANS

Donald Trump Accused Street Vendors On Fifth Avenue Of Pretending To Be Veterans In Order To Sell On Fifth Avenue. "Donald Trump blasted conditions on Fifth Avenue as 'deplorable' in a letter to Mayor Bloomberg complaining about street vendors who are "rapidly destroying" the street's ambience. The letter, addressed 'Dear Michael,' accuses vendors of pretending to be military veterans so they can peddle their wares on the high-rent street. Special regulations give veterans more leeway than other vendors." [New York Post, 6/18/04]


*         Donald Trump: "Whether They Are Veterans Or Not, They Should Not Be Allowed To Sell On This Most Important And Prestigious Shopping Street." "But Trump favors no special peddling privileges for veterans, either. 'Whether they are veterans or not, they [the vendors] should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street,' The Donald wrote." [New York Post, 6/18/04]


*         Donald Trump: "I Hope You Can Stop This Very Deplorable Situation Before It Is Too Late." "Trump implored the mayor to act quickly or the city's reputation will falter.  'The image of New York City will suffer,' Trump wrote. 'I hope you can stop this very deplorable situation before it is too late.'" [New York Post, 6/18/04]

A Member Of The Disabled Veteran Vendor Advisory Board, James Kushner, Said That Veteran Vendors "Pay Taxes Like Every Other Business ... Hopefully We Pay As Little As Possible. Just Like Donald Trump, I'm Sure." "Military veterans who peddle their wares along Fifth Avenue came out swinging at Donald Trump yesterday for his letter to Mayor Bloomberg saying the vendors were destroying the ambience of the prestigious shopping area.  'We pay taxes like every other business,' said James Kushner, a member of the Disabled Veteran Vendor Advisory Board.  'They won't renew our licenses if we don't file tax forms. Hopefully we pay as little as possible. Just like Donald Trump, I'm sure.'" [New York Post, 6/19/04]

Donald Trump Suggested Disabled Veterans Receiving Special Vendor Licenses To Sell Goods On Fifth Avenue Were Detrimental To "The City As A Whole [And] Its Tax Paying Citizens And Businesses." "But Trump has time and again pushed New York to limit laws on peddling - including by veterans, who can get special vendor licenses from the Department of Consumer Affairs in thanks for their service. 'While disabled veterans should be given every opportunity to earn a living, is it fair to do so to the detriment of the city as a whole or its tax paying citizens and businesses?' Trump wrote in a 1991 letter to John Dearie, then-chairman of the state Assembly's Committee on Cities. 'Do we allow Fifth Ave., one of the world's finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area?' Trump demanded."

2007: THE TRUMP INSTITUTE FIRED AN AIR FORCE RESERVES FOR "ABSENCES" WHILE HE WAS DEPLOYED IN AFGHANISTAN

2007: A Week After Returning From Serving In Iraq, Air Force Reservist Richard Wright Was Fired From The Trump Institute For Allegedly Missing Work And Contacting Clients To Let Them Know He Was Home. "Air Force reservist Richard Wright was just two months into what he said was his 'dream job" as a consultant for a firm marketing Donald Trump's get-rich techniques when he was called up and sent to Afghanistan. For six weeks in early 2007, Wright served in Kandahar as a master sergeant with the 920th Rescue Squadron, providing intelligence for helicopter missions. But just a week after returning home to Cooper City from the war, Wright, 41, was fired, allegedly for missing work and for contacting clients to let them know he was home. Now Wright has sued Xylophone, a Boca Raton company doing business as the Trump Institute, saying his dismissal violated the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, a federal law written to protect employees from losing jobs or promotions when called up for military duty."

"A year later, Wright sued the Trump Institute and its parent company, Xylophone, for wrongful termination under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act. That law, passed in 1972, requires that military service members called up to active duty from civilian jobs "be restored to the job and benefits you would have attained if you had not been absent due to military service." Under the law, the burden falls on the employer to prove that it did not fire a service member for absences related to his or her military service. The Trump Institute ultimately reached a settlement with Wright that forbids him from talking about the case."

DONALD TRUMP ONLY LICENSED HIS NAME TO TRUMP INSTITUTE

Trump Licensed His Name To The Trump Institute The Same Year He Opened Trump University, And Dozens Of Complaints About Both Schools Were Filed Across The Country. "As the American housing market climbed toward its peak, in 2005, Trump opened a for-profit school, called Trump University, to impart his wisdom about real estate and moneymaking to the general public.... The same year, Trump licensed his name to an affiliated program, called the Trump Institute, which offered similar classes. Dozens of complaints about both schools have rolled into the offices of attorneys general in Florida, Texas, New York and Illinois, officials said. And last year, the Better Business Bureau gave Trump University a D minus, the second-lowest grade on its scale, after it fielded 23 complaints, its chief executive said." [New York Times, 5/13/11]

Trump's Lawyer Claimed Trump Institute Was Only A Licensee Of Trump University And "Mr. Trump Had Nothing Whatsoever To Do With The Employment Of Any Of The Trump Institute's Employees Or Mentors." "Alan Garten, executive vice president and general counsel of the Trump Organization, provided a statement to HuffPost when asked about Wright's experience. 'The Trump Institute was a licensee of Trump University and was not owned or controlled by Mr. Trump or any of his companies,' Garten said. 'As such, Mr. Trump had nothing whatsoever to do with the employment of any of the Trump Institute's employees or mentors, had no involvement in the development or enforcement of any of the Trump Institute's employment policies and has no knowledge of this matter. Mr. Trump has always been a great supporter of the men and women who have served in this country's armed forces and has devoted much of his campaign to improving the lives of veterans.'"

Trump's "Plan" To Help Our Veterans Lacks Any Details

TRUMP'S VA REFORM PLAN HAS BEEN CALLED "PAINFULLY THIN ON SPECIFICS"

The Advocacy Group "Concerned Veterans For America" Criticized Donald Trump's Plan To Reform The Department Of Veterans Affairs For Being "Painfully Thin On Specifics." "A veterans advocacy group is criticizing the plan to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) released by Donald Trump. Concerned Veterans for America (CVA) said the plan was 'heavy of rhetoric, light on specifics' in a statement on Saturday. 'While Donald Trump rightly proposes more health care choices for veterans and long-overdue accountability for bad VA employees, his 'plan' is painfully thin on specifics about how he would implement those principles,' CVA CEO Pete Hegseth said in the statement." [The Hill, 11/1/15<http://thehill.com/policy/defense/258790-veterans-group-pans-trumps-unserious-va-plan>]

Donald Trump's Plan For Improving The Department Of Veterans Affairs Did Not Include Details About Its Cost And Funding Sources. "Trump's plan, however, does not include any details about how much it would cost to implement or how he would pay for it. He said in Virginia that the changes he'd propose would cost less than the system now in place because he would stamp out waste. A campaign spokeswoman did not respond to a request for additional details."

TRUMP HAS CALLED TO BUILD NEW VA FACILITIES AND INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES ...

Trump Claimed That Our Existing VA Hospitals Were "Outdated Dumps" And He Would "Build The Finest And Most Modern Veterans Hospitals In The World." "Our Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals are outdated dumps. I will build the finest and most modern veterans hospitals in the world. The current medical assistance to our veterans is a disaster. A Trump administration will provide the finest universal access health care for our veterans. They will be able to get the best care anytime and anywhere."

Trump's Veterans Plan Called To Embed Satellite VA Clinics In Hospitals And Other Care Facilities In Rural And Underserved Areas. "The Trump Plan Will... Embed satellite VA clinics in rural and other underserved areas. The Trump Administration will embed satellite VA clinics within hospitals and other care facilities in rural and other underserved areas. This step will ensure veterans have easy access to care and local hospitals and care facilities can handle the influx of patients without backlogs while tapping the specialized knowledge of VA health specialists." [Veterans Plan, DonaldJTrump.com, accessed 3/9/16<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/veterans-administration-reforms>]

The Trump Plan To Reform The Department Of Veterans Affairs Modernize The VA With Investments In State-Of-The-Art Technology. "The VA health care program is a disaster. ... That's why the Trump plan will: ... Modernize the VA. A VA with 20th century technology cannot serve 21st century service members and their needs. The VA has been promising to modernize for years without real results. The Trump plan will make it happen by accelerating and expanding investments in state of the art technology to deliver best-in-class care quickly and effectively. All veterans should be able to conveniently schedule appointments, communicate with their doctors, and view accurate wait times with the push of a button." [DonaldJTrump.com, Campaign Website, accessed 11/2/15<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/veterans-administration-reforms>]

... BUT ALSO TO COVER VETERANS GOING TO ANY DOCTOR OR CARE FACILITY THAT ACCEPTED MEDICARE

Trump's Veterans Plan Called To Allow Veterans To Go To Any Doctor Or Care Facility That Accepted Medicare. "Under a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran's ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately. Our veterans have earned the freedom to choose better or more convenient care from the doctor and facility of their choice." [Veterans Plan, DonaldJTrump.com, accessed 3/9/16<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/veterans-administration-reforms>]


Trump Called To Make It So Veterans Could Go To Private Hospitals Or Hospitals And "We'll Pay The Bill," Claiming That He Would Work Out A System That Would Make It A Lot Cheaper. TRUMP: "Two weeks ago on Wednesday, the veterans had the longest wait in the history, in waiting rooms in the history of the VA.  They are being treated worse than illegal immigrants in many cases.  It's a disaster for the veterans.  And what I would do is to break up that back jam.  They cannot wait seven days to see the doctor and the doctor tells them I'm going on vacation, we can't see you now, sorry.   We are going to open it up so they can go -- they don't have to wait, they can go to private doctors, they can go to private hospitals, they can go to public hospitals, and we'll pay the bill.  And that will end up being a lot cheaper than having them waiting forever.  And by the way, waiting and dying, because you have thousands that are dying waiting to be cured of things that can easily be fixed.  So I will open it up so they can go to private hospitals and private doctors, and, by the way, public hospitals and we'll pay the bill.  And frankly, that's going to be, and we'll work out a system, that will be a lot better and they love it, they love the concept, and I believe it's going to be a lot cheaper.  It's not a question of the money.  We're being run -- the whole country is incompetently run.  But the VA may be the top of the list.  They will be so happy if I get elected president.  Believe me." [Morning Joe, MSNBC, 9/24/15]


DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT PUT A PRICE TAG ON HIS VETERANS REFORM PLAN, BUT CLAIMS HE WILL ACTUALLY END UP WITH MONEY LEFT OVER

Trump Said He Would Pay For His VA Plan By Spending Money More Efficiently And That He Would "Have Money Actually Left Over." "With classic Trump braggadocio, he claimed simply spending money more efficiently would pay for his plan.

The Trump Plan To Reform The Department Of Veterans Affairs Would End Waste, Fraud, And Abuse At The VA. "The VA health care program is a disaster. ... That's why the Trump plan will: ... End waste, fraud and abuse at the VA. The Trump plan will ensure the VA is spending its dollars wisely to provide the greatest impact for veterans and hold administrators accountable for irresponsible spending and abuse. The days of $6.3 million for statues and fountains at VA facilities and $300,000 for a manager to move 140 miles are over.

 New York and Illinois, officials said. And last year, the Better Business Bureau gave Trump University a D minus, the second-lowest grade on its scale, after it fielded 23 complaints, its chief executive said.&#8221; [New York Times, 5/13/11]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 &#8220;A veterans advocacy group is criticizing the plan to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) released by Donald Trump. Concerned Veterans for America (CVA) said the plan was &#8216;heavy of rhetoric, light on specifics&#8217; in a statement on Saturday. &#8216;While
 Donald Trump rightly proposes more health care choices for veterans and long-overdue accountability for bad VA employees, his &#8216;plan&#8217; is painfully thin on specifics about how he would implement those principles,&#8217; CVA CEO Pete Hegseth said in the statement.&#8221;

 cheaper than having them waiting forever.&nbsp; And by the way, waiting and dying, because you have thousands that are dying waiting to be cured of things that can easily be fixed.&nbsp; So I will open it up so they can go to private hospitals and private doctors, and,
