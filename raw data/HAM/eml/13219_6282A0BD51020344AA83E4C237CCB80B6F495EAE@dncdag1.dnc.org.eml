Donald Trump: "American Foreign Policy in the Hands of a Dealmaker"<https://www.facebook.com/notes/ted-cruz/donald-trump-american-foreign-policy-in-the-hands-of-a-dealmaker/10153701806088520>

In the modern world you can't very easily draw up a simple, general foreign policy. I was busy making deals during the last decade of the cold war. Now the game has changed. The day of the chess player is over. Foreign policy has to be put in the hands of a dealmaker.

I know the outer world exists, and I'll be very cognizant of that, but at the same time, our country is disintegrating. The American dream is dead. I'm upset with our leaders for being so stupid. We were the big bully, but we were not smartly led. And we were the big bully who was the big, stupid bully.

I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. I know what I'm doing and I listen to a lot of people, I talk to a lot of people and at the appropriate time I'll tell you who the people are. But my primary consultant is myself and I have a good instinct for this stuff.

I understand what's going on around the world far better than these politicians do. I'm all over it.

And I have friends that are all over the world.

I think NATO is obsolete. NATO was done at a time you had the Soviet Union, which was obviously larger -- much larger than Russia is today.

And if you look at the Ukraine, we're the ones always fighting on the Ukraine. I never hear any other countries even mentioned and we're fighting constantly. We're talking about Ukraine, get out, do this, do that.

And I mean Ukraine is very far away from us.

I side with the group that says 'if Russia wants to go and fight ISIS, you should let them'.

I've always felt fine about Putin. He's a strong leader, he's a powerful leader. ... He's actually got popularity within his country. I think he's up in the 80s...It is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond.

And I say, very nicely, 'Wouldn't it be nice if actually we could get along with Russia?'

I like China very much, I like Chinese people. I respect the Chinese leaders. When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it...They put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak ... as being spit on by the rest of the world.

The Iran deal was so bad it's suspicious. Who would make that deal?

They're giving Russia big chunks of money for missiles. I don't even know if they are allowed to buy missiles. Why are they allowed to buy missiles? It's so unfair and so incompetent.

We'll sell them missiles that don't work correctly. Right? Let them sue us. Tell them to sue us. Oh, I'm sorry, they don't work. Gee, that's too bad. We'll take in about $12 billion for missiles and they'll say these missiles are terrible. And I'll say "Yup, that was the purpose of it."

I love Israel. I was the grand marshall down Fifth Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel. I've received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.

But it doesn't help if I start saying, "I am very pro-Israel." It doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.

If I win, I don't want to be in a position where I'm saying to you [my choice] and the other side now says, 'We don't want Trump involved'...Let me be sort of a neutral guy.

I'm going to renegotiate some of our military costs...We protect everybody and we don't get reimbursement.

I think Israel would do that also. There are many countries that can pay, and they can pay big-league.

The concept of opening with Cuba is fine. I think Cuba has a certain potential and I think it's OK to bring Cuba into the fold. I'm not knocking Castro...because they're making a deal.

I can't believe what our country is doing. Qaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we're sitting around we have soldiers all have the Middle East, and we're not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that's what it is: It's a carnage....You talk about things that have happened in history; this could be one of the worst. Now we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives. This is absolutely nuts.

[Cruz] said I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Qaddafi were in charge right now.

A lot of life is about survival of the fittest and adaption, as Darwin pointed out. It's not all there is, but it's an indication of how the world has evolved in historical terms. We've seen many empires come and go--the Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire- there have always been surges of power. Sometimes they last for centuries. Even so, some of us have never learned of them as of today. In other words, things change. We have to keep up with the changes and move forward.
