Subject: VPOTUS Pool report - Philadelphia campaign stop

Vice President Joe Biden pulled into the Mayfair Diner in northeast Phila=
delphia just after 12 on Monday, bringing along Senate candidate Katie Mc=
Ginty and trailed by Sen. Bob Casey.
The diner was only part full, but Biden stopped at every table and talked=
 with every member of the staff, talking to each at length and posing for=
 a variety of iPhone photos and selfies.
Immediately upon entering, he took a seat at one of the booths with three=
 older women.
Thanks for inviting me for breakfast, he said. Its awful nice of you to d=
o this.
He pulled McGinty in to introduce her.
I dont mean to interrupt you, he said. Actually, I did.

At the next table, Biden noted the similarities in appearance between McG=
inty, and his wife Dr. Jill Biden, wholl be with him at the event hes doi=
ng on community college tuition at the Community College in Philadelphia =
in the Spring Garden neighborhood.
Every time Im with Katie, I think, Oh god, another Jill, Biden said.

The third table was an elderly woman, her daughter and her grandson (the =
grandson was in from Battle Creek, Mich.). Biden spent most of his time t=
alking with the older woman, whom he repeatedly referred to as Mom. She w=
as wearing a necklace medallion of a saint, which Biden held in his hand =
and whispered with her about, saying something about his son.
Biden then introduced her to McGinty: Now Mom, you got to help her out.

At the third table, Biden sat for a long time with an elderly couple, tal=
king with them first about where they and McGinty went to high school, an=
d then getting into talking about food.
My first trip to Iraq, in the middle of the war, I called the then-owner =
of Tastykake, Biden said. I took over pallets of Tasty Cakes and pretzels=
, because I was visiting the Delaware and Pennsylvania National Guard uni=
ts. When those Tastykakes came off the truck My son was there for a year =
in Baghdad, and he said, Dad, you brought all these Tasty Cakes, thats gr=
eat!
If you could have just airlifted some cheesesteaks to go with them! McGin=
ty said.
When I was in law school, Id drive back and forth from my home in Delawar=
e to Syracuse Law School, Biden continued, and I would always bring back =
a really nice sub. Delaware makes good subs. Id buy a ton of them, and th=
eyd cost me $4.50 a piece, and Id sell them for $10. Im serious. They lov=
ed those subs.

The fourth table was a shorter stop. The woman at the table there looked =
up at him nervously and said, Im petrified right now. Biden tried to rela=
x her, but to no avail. Ill never come here on my day off again, she said=
.

Heading over to the other side of the dinerI hope I dont cost you any tip=
s, Biden said to the waitresses as he passed by, stopping for photos with=
 them tooBiden was introduced to McGintys brother, John, who gave him a h=
ug and then introduced him to his partner.
Biden referenced that they are two of 10 children.
Look, the 10 of you should have been able to win this on your own, he sai=
d with a laugh.
A minute later, he turned to one of the other waitresses and said, Her br=
other and I have something in commonwe both have sisters who are better l=
ooking and smarter than us.

McGinty trailed just behind him, saying to one excited customer, He came =
all the way from Washington just to tell you to vote for me.

He sat with a table of a younger couple, asking them their heritage. McGi=
nty sat in the booth with the man (who said he was Italian) and Biden sai=
d with the woman (who said she was Irish). They traded taking iPhone phot=
os  you get a picture with the Italian, Ill get a picture with the Irish,=
 Biden said to McGinty.

Then he pressed them to vote for her.
I hope youll look her over, Biden said to them. If you dont, Bob Casey an=
d I are going to come to your house.

At the next table, an older couple sat with a mentally disabled younger w=
oman. The older lady encouraged her to tell Biden that shed voted for him=
. He kneeled, grasped both her hands in his, said I love you. Then he urg=
ed her to vote for McGinty, as he asked her if he could grab a french fry=
 off her plate (he did).

The younger woman was wearing a blue Mickey Mouse T-shirt, prompting Bide=
n to recall a favorite memory of his when his daughter got to hug Mickey =
Mouse at Disney World. He said he keeps a picture of that moment on his d=
esk.

The man, whose name is Jeff, asked for an autographhe doesnt get to meet =
vice presidents that often he explained. Biden pulled out a piece of pape=
r and wrote, Thanks for taking the time, with a less legible second line =
about voting for McGinty, and signed it.

At the end of the stop, your pooler asked Biden whom he voted for in the =
Delaware primary for president (he and his wife early voted on Friday).

Biden smiled.

I voted, he said. I voted.

He wouldnt say any more than that.
