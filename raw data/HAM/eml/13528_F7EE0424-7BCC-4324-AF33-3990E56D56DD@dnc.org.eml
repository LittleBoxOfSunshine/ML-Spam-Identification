FWIW, Trump has made a regular talking point the past few weeks that states=
 have to compete with one another for companies. Not specifically mentionin=
g the minimum wage like today, but along the same lines.

Trump calls for end to federal minimum wage as views shift<http://www.thegu=
ardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/federal-minimum-wage-trump>
The Guardian =96 Alan Yuhas

Donald Trump has called for the elimination of the federal minimum wage, as=
 he retreated from primary promises and once again refused to release his t=
ax returns because of =93a link=94 to an audit.

The presumptive Republican nominee for president repeatedly said he would s=
upport a higher minimum wage, a reversal from his position when he had cons=
ervative opponents. But he insisted on Sunday that states should decide suc=
h wages.

=93I like the idea of =91let the states decide=92,=94 Trump told NBC=92s Me=
et the Press. =93But I think people should get more. I think they=92re out =
there. They=92re working. It is a very low number.=94

Asked =93should the federal government set a floor=94 =96 a national minimu=
m wage =96 Trump replied: =93No, I=92d rather have the states go out and do=
 what they have to do.

=93And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but th=
ey compete with each other.=94

In a November debate, the businessman, who claims his net worth is worth mo=
re than $10bn, said: =93Taxes too high, wages too high, we=92re not going t=
o be able to compete against the world.=94

He then told Fox News: =93We were talking about the minimum wage, and they =
said =91Should we increase the minimum wage?=92 And I=92m saying that if we=
=92re going to compete with other countries we can=92t do that because the =
wages would be too high.=94

But on Sunday he expressed sympathy for people who struggle to survive on t=
he current federal minimum wage.

=93I don=92t know how you live on $7.25 an hour,=94 he said. =93But I would=
 say: let the states decide.=94

Similarly, he told ABC=92s This Week: =93I haven=92t decided in terms of nu=
mbers. But I think people have to get more.=94

Trump readily admitted that he had given up his previous position.

=93Sure, it=92s a change,=94 he said, framing his willingness to abandon on=
e position as a negotiation tactic. =93I=92m allowed to change. You need fl=
exibility. But my real minimum wage is going to be I=92m going to bring com=
panies back into this country, and [people are] going to make a lot more th=
an the $15, even.=94

Looking toward a general election against Hillary Clinton, the prohibitive =
favorite to be the Democratic nominee, Trump similarly retreated from tax p=
roposals that would benefit the most wealthy Americans and heavily tax the =
poor. On Sunday, he said he intended to tax the wealthy.

=93For the wealthy, I think, frankly, it=92s going to go up,=94 he said, sa=
ying he would likely pay more taxes himself. =93When it comes time to negot=
iate, I feel less concerned with the rich than I do with the middle class.=
=94

But Trump was unwilling to discuss taxes he has already paid. He again refu=
sed to release his tax returns, citing an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) au=
dit into some of them and =93a link=94 between audited returns and returns =
not being investigated.

No law exists that forbids the release of tax returns under audit. The IRS =
has stated: =93Nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax info=
rmation.=94

=93I have very big tax returns,=94 Trump said on Sunday. =93They=92re extre=
mely complex.=94

He said he hoped to release the returns before the general election, but wo=
uld not pledge to do so.

=93I=92ll do it as fast as the auditors finish,=94 he said.

The former reality TV star insisted that =93you don=92t learn much from tax=
 returns=94 and that his =93financials=94 show a value of more than $10bn. =
His financial filings with federal officials, however, do not always corres=
pond with other declarations of his worth.

For instance, in a financial disclosure made when he announced his run for =
the White House last year, Trump listed a New York state golf club at $50m.=
 But in a lawsuit, as part of his argument that he should pay 90% less tax =
on the property, he told a judge the same club was worth only $1.4m.

Trump also shares an address with Hillary Clinton and more than 285,000 com=
panies in Delaware, at a building that has become famous for helping busine=
sses avoid taxes through the so-called =93Delaware loophole=94.

Presidential candidates have traditionally released tax returns to the publ=
ic, though sometimes with great reluctance. The 2012 Republican nominee, Mi=
tt Romney, worth an estimated $250m, eventually released two years of retur=
ns. He has since become one of Trump=92s most prominent adversaries, sugges=
ting in February that Trump is hiding =93a bombshell=94 in his returns.

=93Either he=92s not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is or he hasn=
=92t been paying the kind of taxes we would expect him to pay,=94 Romney sa=
id.

=93Or perhaps he hasn=92t been giving money to the vets or to the disabled =
like he=92s been telling us he=92s doing.=94
