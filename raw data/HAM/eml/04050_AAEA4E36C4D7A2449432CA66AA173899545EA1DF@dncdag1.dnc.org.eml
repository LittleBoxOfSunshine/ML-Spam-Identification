Take a look and then we can throw a title on there. It's a little bland


Just last week, Trump proudly announced endorsements from two "tough guys<http://www.bustle.com/articles/157523-these-brand-new-donald-trump-endorsers-should-horrify-you>" - Mike Tyson and Bobby Knight. Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992, and Bobby Knight once said "I think if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it."

After days of touting the endorsement of Mike Tyson, turns out that Donald Trump's misogynistic and backwards defense on violence against women, specifically related to Mike Tyson, steam decades back<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-in-1992-tyson-told-me-women-who-put-him-in-jail?utm_term=.xyw16DXgq#.qqDEJxNgo>:

Trump controversially suggested in 1992 Tyson could pay the victim with money from a fight to avoid serving a jail sentence and as reported earlier this week by BuzzFeed News said in the early '90s that Tyson was "railroaded" in his case, and that the victim had willingly entered Tyson's room.

In another instance in late 1992, Trump discussed the case at length in an interview with Charlie Rose. The topic centered around a New York magazine profile in which Trump said his mother was angry at him for defending Tyson. In the piece, Trump said Tyson told him the victim "wanted it real bad."

Donald Trump thinks he can fool us into how presidential he is going to be, and how much he loves women - but the warped and backwards view of violence and rape is who Donald Trump has been for years.

Now, sexual violence advocates are livid<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rape-china_us_572714c7e4b0b49df6abad17> that Donald Trump has been saying that China is going to "rape" America. When someone like Donald Trump uses a heinous crime like rape as a metaphor, it's an insult to all sexual assault victims and survivors.

Violence against women is an issue that has garnered widespread support across the country, and preventing violence against women and extending support to those who have been victims of the crimes are important step to which Democrats remain committed. Republicans like Donald Trump are showing no respect and dignity for those victims of sexual violence and rape - all the more reason why Donald Trump can never be the 45th president of the United States.
