Scott Walker Faulted for Failures of Wisconsin State Agency<http://www.nyti=

f-wisconsin-state-agency/>
NEW YORK TIMES // ALAN RAPPEPORT

If senators who run for president are cursed with defending every vote they=
 cast, governors must answer for their economic records.

As Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin edges closer to formalizing his White Hou=
se bid, Democrats and Republicans who hope to derail it think they have fou=
nd a potential Achilles' heel in the misfortunes of the Wisconsin Economic =
Development Corporation<http://inwisconsin.com/>, which he helped create.

Critics from both parties have been suggesting that Mr. Walker's mismanagem=
ent was responsible for the organization's failure to create as many jobs a=
s it was supposed to and for mishandling funds. A state audit released<http=
://legis.wisconsin.gov/lab/reports/13-7full.pdf> this month said the agency=
 "did not have sufficient policies, including some that are statutorily req=
uired, to administer its programs effectively."

Mr. Walker, who is chairman of the W.E.D.C.<http://inwisconsin.com/inside-w=
edc/board/members/>, said last week that the agency, created to provide loa=
ns to local businesses, would be overhauled. Instead of offering nearly $20=
 million a year in loans, it would turn to tax incentives and require busin=
esses to show they are making the most of the help.

Democrats are also seizing on a Wisconsin State Journal investigation<http:=
//host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/top-scott-walker-aides-=
pushed-for-questionable-wedc-loan/article_2a29333c-c3dd-50ac-a4b6-c33350653=
0e0.html> that found that under Mr. Walker's watch in 2011, the development=
 agency lent $500,000 of taxpayer money to Building Committee Inc, which ha=
d failed to pay taxes the previous year. The company, whose owner was a don=
or to Mr. Walker, later went out of business.

"Scott Walker's failed flagship jobs agency has been a disaster since its h=
asty inception," said Melissa Baldauff, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Dem=
ocratic Party.

According to a report in The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel<http://www.jsonline=
.com/news/statepolitics/joint-finance-to-deal-today-with-troubled-wedc-cuts=
-to-seniorcare-b99504512z1-304551231.html>, Republicans in Wisconsin are al=
so taking issue with Mr. Walker's handling of the agency. They have release=
d a plan to relieve him as chairman, aiming for more oversight over the age=
ncy.

As for Mr. Walker, he has acknowledged the agency's shortcomings but he con=
tinues to promote his economic record in the state. At a rally in Oklahoma =
City on Thursday, he said that his state's jobless rate had fallen to 4.4 p=
ercent in April<https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2015/unemploymen=
t/150521_april_state.pdf>.

While nearly 130,000 jobs have been created in the state under his watch si=
nce 2010, Mr. Walker's opponents point out that the total is only about hal=
f of the quarter of a million new jobs<http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepo=
litics/promise-of-250000-jobs-hasnt-changed-scott-walker-says-b9985606z1-22=
1486831.html> he promised.
