Pennsylvania
Voter Turnout Appears Heavier Than Usual in Pennsylvania
Observers say primary election turnout appears heavier than usual at polli=
ng places across the region. Early Tuesday morning when the polls first op=
ened=2C voters flocked to their polling places. A steady stream of voters=
 made their way into Hancock United Methodist Church in Springfield Townsh=
ip. Voters were happy to see they weren't alone at the polls. They were en=
couraged by those who showed up to perform their civic duty.Across town in=
 Overbrook Park the turnout has been strong since the polls opened.Folks i=
n the high turnout 34th ward never miss voting - presidential year or not.=
Ann Madden of Overbrook Park tells us=2C "I vote every time... because I e=
xercise my right as a citizen."Most voters we talked to mainly said it was=
 the presidential election that motivated them to come out=2C despite a nu=
mber of statewide and local races.

Rhode Island
The Rhode Island Primary Turnout Was Even Higher Than Most Could Have Expe=
cted
Rhode Island held its primary on Tuesday night=2C and the state=E2=80=99s=
 voters delivered resounding victories to Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.=
 Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton by about 10 points and came home with 13=
 of the state=E2=80=99s 24 delegates=2C while Trump trounced the GOP field=
 by 40 points and won nine delegates from the state. But how many people a=
ctually showed up at the polls? Around 125=2C846 Rhode Island Democrats vo=
ted in the primary on Tuesday=2C while 61=2C703 Republicans came out to th=
e polls. Those are really=2C really big numbers. The high turnout this yea=
r makes sense: Both parties are having very intense and competitive primar=
ies=2C and voter turnout tends to be higher during hotly contested nominat=
ion fights.Even in 2008=2C which saw unusually high voter turnout on both=
 sides=2C only 27=2C237 Republicans came out to the polls in Rhode Island.=
 The Democratic turnout was quite high this year as well=2C although it di=
d fall short of the 186=2C657 Democrats who voted in the state's 2008
primary.

eue,helvetica,sans-serif">Observers say primary election turnout appears he=
avier than usual at polling places across the region. Early Tuesday morning=
 when the polls first opened, voters flocked to their polling places. A ste=
ady stream of voters made their way into Hancock United Methodist Church in=
 Springfield Township. Voters were happy to see they weren't alone at the p=
olls. They were encouraged by those who showed up to perform their civic du=
ty.Across town in Overbrook Park the turnout has been strong since the poll=
s opened.Folks in the high turnout 34th ward never miss voting - presidenti=
al year or not.Ann Madden of Overbrook Park tells us, &quot;I vote every ti=
me... because I exercise my right as a citizen.&quot;Most voters we talked =
to mainly said it was the presidential election that motivated them to come=
 out, despite a number of statewide and local races.</span></span><br>

 Higher Than Most Could Have Expected</span></span></strong><br>
<span style=3D"font-size:14px"><span style=3D"font-family:arial,helvetica n=
eue,helvetica,sans-serif">Rhode Island held its primary on Tuesday night, a=
nd the state=E2=80=99s voters delivered resounding victories to Bernie Sand=
ers and Donald Trump. Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton by about 10 points a=
nd came home with 13 of the state=E2=80=99s 24 delegates, while Trump troun=
ced the GOP field by 40 points and won nine delegates from the state. But h=
ow many people actually showed up at the polls? Around 125,846 Rhode Island=
 Democrats voted in the primary on Tuesday, while 61,703 Republicans came o=
ut to the polls. Those are really, really big numbers. The high turnout thi=
s year makes sense: Both parties are having very intense and competitive pr=
imaries, and voter turnout tends to be higher during hotly contested nomina=
tion fights.Even in 2008, which saw unusually high voter turnout on both si=
des, only 27,237 Republicans came out to the polls in Rhode Island. The Dem=
ocratic turnout was quite high this year as well, although it did fall shor=
t of the 186,657 Democrats who voted in the state's 2008 primary.</span></s=
