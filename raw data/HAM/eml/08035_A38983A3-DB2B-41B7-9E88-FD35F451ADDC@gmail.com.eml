DWS Cuts Bernie's Influence Out of the Democratic National Convention
Submitted by Nancy Smith

Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Florida faithful might swear by her fair play tow=
ard Bernie Sanders, but the Democratic National Committee chair has shown he=
r stripes and is driving a wedge between both factions of the Democratic Par=
ty, according to a leading Bernie supporter.

Below is a Facebook post on Monday from Robert Reich, former secretary of la=
bor under President Bill Clinton, now devoted to the Bern:
"Apparently Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chair of the Democratic National Commi=
ttee, doesn=E2=80=99t care if she alienates Bernie followers. The Sanders ca=
mpaign had been hoping for a significant role at the Democratic convention, b=
ut Wasserman Schultz has picked 75 members of the convention=E2=80=99s key c=
ommittees -- rules, credentials and platform =E2=80=93 and accepted only 3 o=
f Bernie=E2=80=99s choices, failing to acknowledge the proportion of the vot=
e Bernie has won in the primaries and caucuses. Negotiations with the DNC ha=
ve failed to add any additional Bernie picks to any of the standing committe=
es. Worse yet, she=E2=80=99s named as chairs Hillary backers known for their=
 harsh criticism of Bernie (among them Barnie Frank, as co-chair of the infl=
uential Rules Committee).

"This is insider politics run amok, at the very time and in the very electio=

=99s vitally important to unite the Democratic Party. How can Debbie Wasserm=
an Schultz and the DNC be so obtuse?
What do you think?"

If we thought the Nevada Democratic Convention was bad, imagine what will go=
 down at the National Convention with staunch Bernie opponents like Barnie Fra=
nk running something as crucial as the rules committee. "The deck is stacked=
 against us," says Reich. "What do we plan to do if the National Convention e=
nds up as big of a corrupt shit show as Nevada? No way we will be voting for=
 Hillary and it doesn't even look like we will get influence on the platform=
