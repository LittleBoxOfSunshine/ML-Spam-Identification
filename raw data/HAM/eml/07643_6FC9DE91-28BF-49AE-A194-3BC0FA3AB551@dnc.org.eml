It might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief.  Does he believe in a God.  He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage.  I think I read he is an atheist.  This could make several points difference with my peeps.  My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.
