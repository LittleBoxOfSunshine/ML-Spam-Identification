Buzzfeed // Andrew K

Donald Trump, who repeatedly advocated for Mike Tyson during the boxer=92s =
1992 rape trial in Indiana, said on Monday that he knows nothing about it.

=93Do you still think Mike Tyson got a raw deal when he endorsed you?=94 Tr=
ump was asked.

=93I don=92t know anything about it. I know he endorsed me. I heard he endo=
rsed me,=94 Trump stated. =93I don=92t know anything about his trial. I rea=
lly don=92t.=94

Trump, a longtime friend of Tyson, opined at length about the trial on tele=
vision, in newspapers, and in magazines.

Trump has claimed Tyson was =93railroaded=94 in the case and on several occ=
asions offered criticism of Tyson=92s defense attorney. Trump said in 1992 =
that Tyson could pay the victim with money from a fight to avoid serving ti=
me in prison. Trump also called into question whether the victim had been r=
aped at all.

Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina have criticized Trump numerous times this week f=
or touting the endorsement of Tyson in Indiana, the state where Tyson was c=
onvicted in 1992.
