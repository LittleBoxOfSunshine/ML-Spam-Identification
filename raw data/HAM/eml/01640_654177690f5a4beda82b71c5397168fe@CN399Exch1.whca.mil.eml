	Hey Sri,
=09
	Per our other chain, wanted to get this to the top of your inbox.  Also Cc=
'd here is my colleague, Claire Olszewski, who is our Women's Leadership Fo=
rum Director.  The two of us are working together on female empowerment rou=
ndtables (1-pager attached here) across the country and would love to get T=
ina onboard.
=09
	Ideally, we would have Tina act as a (solo) surrogate in some cities and w=
e would pair her with another surrogate (i.e. Neera Tanden, Congresswoman B=
onnie Watson Coleman, et al) in other cities, pending your approval of the =
pairing of course.  We have already made contact with Neera's office and th=
e Congresswoman Coleman's staff; both have agreed to participate.
=09
	If you wouldn't mind letting us know dates in May and June that work well =
for Tina, we can coordinate with our respective hosts and other surrogates =
to make sure everyone is in sync.  We can also get you the other surrogates=
 availability if that's helpful.  My contact info is below if it's easier t=
o talk through everything.  Thanks for all your help!
