Jay,

Thanks for reaching out. The state visit weekend does complicate matters a =
bit. Let's try to find an alternative date over the next few months to make=
 this work. I apologize for the inconvenience.

Copying my colleague, Angelica Allen, who can work with you on a different =
date.

David

David,

My wife, Mindy, and I are attending the State Dinner on Friday, the 13th.  =
I am just writing to see if there is any chance we can take you up on that =
invite from quite a while ago, any time that day or even Saturday morning. =
 I understand if all the action surrounding the State visit makes it inconv=
enient and I'll try again another time.  If it is good, I would have my two=
 daughters and son-in-law fly down just for the tour. =20

On another note, I got together last Thursday with Mark Bergman who said yo=
u were a hit at his event in London a short while back. =20

All the best,

Jay

David,

You asked me to email you when we were planning to come to D.C. For a visit=
.  I just received an invite for my wife, Mindy and I to attend a reception=
 with the President at 4:30 on Wednesday the 19th of November.  We're delig=
hted to attend and I will RSVP accordingly.  You mentioned that my family c=
ould get a tour of the West Wing, if it worked out, and I was wondering whe=
ther that day could work.  If so, I would bring my two daughters with us.  =
While I know that it's a bit pushy - if that works out, can we possibly inc=
lude them in the reception at 4:30 with us as well?

=20

If it doesn't work out, I'll figure something else out for a later date.

=20

Thanks.

Jay Jacobs
