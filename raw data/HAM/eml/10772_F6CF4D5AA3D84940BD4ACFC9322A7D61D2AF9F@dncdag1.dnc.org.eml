DONALD TRUMP ROUNDUP

FOUR PINOCCHIOS - TRUMP CLAIMS THERE'S "NOTHING TO LEARN" FROM TAX RETURNS:=
 "Trump falsely claims that voters would learn nothing from his tax returns=
. To the contrary, voters would learn a lot of information that Trump has l=
ong tried to hide from the public. Tax returns would help lift a veil of se=
crecy about Trump's finances - and let voters know whether his claims about=
 his wealth and charitable giving are true, or if he's just a bombastic man=
 behind the curtain akin to the Wizard of Oz. Four Pinocchios." [Washington=

TIM O'BRIEN: I SAW TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS AND YOU SHOULD TOO: "The tax returns=
 my lawyers and I reviewed were sealed, and a court order prevents me from =
speaking or writing about the specifics of what I saw. I can say that Trump=
 routinely delayed -- for months on end -- producing those documents, and w=
hen they finally arrived they were so heavily redacted that they looked lik=
e crossword puzzles." [Tim O'Brien, Bloomberg, 5/12/16<http://www.bloomberg=

SAM CLOVIS CLAIMS HIS ECONOMIC PLAN WILL RESULTS IN $7 TRILLION BUDGET SURP=
LUS: "A top economic adviser to Republican presidential candidate Donald Tr=
ump said his policies would generate a surplus of as much as $7 trillion in=
 a decade, a wildly optimistic estimate that's unlikely to pan out. In a so=
metimes bewildering explanation of Trump's agenda, Sam Clovis said Wednesda=
y that increased economic growth would cover the vast majority of the cost =
of his plans, including a tax reform plan projected to cost $10 trillion ov=
er 10 years." [Politico, 5/11/16<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/dona=

ECONOMISTS REVISING TRUMP'S TAX PLAN WOULD INCREASE TAX RATES ACROSS ALL IN=
COME LEVELS: "Conservative economists Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore, tasked =
by Donald Trump's campaign to revise his tax plan, have called their change=
s 'tweaks' but what they submitted to the nonprofit Tax Foundation for a ne=
w deficit score amounts to a dramatic rewrite of Trump's original plan. The=
 new plan, compared against Trump's initial proposal, would increase tax ra=
tes across all income levels, dramatically reduce the number of people who =
would pay no income taxes at all and impose a new cap on charitable deducti=
ons for the wealthy." [Politico, 5/11/16<http://www.politico.com/story/2016=

rump spokesperson Hope Hicks gave a different explanation: 'A database erro=

avow an endorsement for former Klu Klux Klan leader David Duke... He later =
claimed that he couldn't hear what Tapper was asking. 'I was sitting in a h=
ouse in Florida, with a bad ear piece,' Trump told NBC's Today show... clos=

etent leadership at the highest level. They're tired of trade deals that ar=
e ripping our jobs apart and taking their wages.' Mandates are usually clai=
med after a presidential candidate wins a general election, not a party nom=
ination, but part of Mr. Trump's style and strategy is to project a supreme=
 confidence in himself and his popularity with voters. Several Republicans =
said they put little stock in his claim, arguing that he had won support fr=

Trump Explained His "Word Of Mouth" Campaign Strategy: "If People Love A Br=

o Go See It.' And, You Know, One Person Goes And They Talk About It To 20 P=

alled 'word of mouth,' ' said Mr. Trump, who once dabbled in theater produc=
ing. 'If people love a Broadway show, it's better than if you write a good =
review. Word of mouth is the No. 1 thing. And the word of mouth at my ralli=
es is like, 'You've got to go see it.' And, you know, one person goes and t=
hey talk about it to 20 people.' Over the coming weeks, Mr. Trump will offe=
r policy speeches, including one on law and order, and another on judges - =
the latter being, in part, a response to conservatives who have said he can=
not be trusted to pick Supreme Court justices. But Mr. Trump is reluctant t=
o trade in pitchfork populism for something more demure. He was gleeful, in=
 fact, that so much attention was being paid to his Capitol Hill meetings o=
n Thursday. 'Somebody said the paparazzi is going crazy over that meeting,'=
 he said." [New York Times, 5/11/16<http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/us=

ajor limits on executive power and a stingy Congress that would block him a=
t most every turn. POLITICO deployed its policy experts to study a week's w=
orth of Trump commentary and decipher what he's saying, how his ideas would=
 work and how far he could really go with positions that are unorthodox at =
best, and often heretical to his party's ideology. Here's what we found: Tr=
ump bounces across the political spectrum, sounding like John McCain on def=
ense spending, Ross Perot on trade, Joe Biden on crumbling roads and bridge=
s, and, well, Donald Trump on border security. He even has a little bit of =
Bernie Sanders in him when it comes to prescription drug prices. On other i=

 federal government doesn't have any say over the educational standards. Bu=
t there's also a tougher takeaway on Trump's policies: Many of his proposal=

National Foundation For American Policy Report: "Our Analysis Finds That Th=

ld cost the average U.S. household more than $6,000 a year if carried to it=
s logical extreme, with the burden falling hardest on households with the l=
owest income, according to a new report from the National Foundation for Am=
erican Policy, which describes itself as a nonpartisan research group. 'We =
find that a Trump tariff proposal against all countries would cost U.S. con=
sumers $459 billion annually and $2.29 trillion over five years,' David Tue=
rck and Paul Bachman, a pair of economists at Suffolk University in Boston,=

The National Foundation For American Policy Found That 45% Tariffs On China=
 And Japan, And A 35% Tariff On Mexico, As Trump Has Suggested, Would Cost =
The Average American Household Over $2,200 Annually. "The economists looked=
 at two scenarios to arrive at their calculations. First, based on statemen=
ts Trump has made in the campaign, they modeled the effect of a 45 percent =
tariff on imports from China and Japan and a 35 percent tariff on imports f=
rom Mexico. That would cost the average American household more than $2,200=
 annually with those households in the lowest income brackets feeling the g=
reatest pinch. U.S exports to the three countries also would fall by about =
78 percent as a result of the damage done by Trump's proposed tariffs to co=
mpanies in China, Japan and Mexico that buy American goods, the report said=
. If the countries actively retaliated against U.S. exports, the impact wou=
ld be even worse. However, tariffs on just three countries likely would be =
ineffective in protecting American workers from foreign competition because=
 importers could simply turn to other suppliers, the economists said. So th=
e team examined a second scenario in which a Trump-proposed tariff of 45 pe=
rcent is applied to imports from all countries. 'Then the results would be =
truly catastrophic for the poor,' the report said. 'It would be as if the U=
nited States imposed a new tax of 53 percent on the lowest 10 percent incom=
e decile and a 20 percent tax on the next lowest decile. It would be the eq=
uivalent to an 11 percent flat tax on the after-tax income of U.S. workers.=
' The economists estimated the total burden on consumers from higher prices=
 and reduced consumption opportunities would be about $760 billion annually=
." [Politico, 5/12/16<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/report-trump-ta=

Former Chief Economic Adviser, Austan Goolsbee, Said Trump's Idea Of Not Fu=

Last week on CNBC, Trump said, of dealing with the national debt: 'I would =
borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.' 'Treas=
uries are the opposite of junk bonds,' Goolsbee said. 'It's the safest asse=

 and actually our interest rates go down when there's a crisis. To propose =
anything that would threaten that is, it sounds extreme... It really doesn'=

Trump Senior Policy Adviser: "After The Administration Has Been In Place, T=

 on Wednesday, muddling the candidate's previous positions. 'After the admi=

 Peter G. Peterson Foundation in Washington. 'We'll start taking a hard loo=

 now, we're not going to touch anything because we can't predict the growth=
,' he said. 'We have to start taking a look not just at Medicare and Social=
 Security but every program we have out there, because the budgetary discip=
line that we've shown over the last 84 years has been horrible.' Mr. Clovis=
 suggested that Mr. Trump's tax plan and other policies could generate sign=
ificant economic growth and that entitlement cuts would be something a Trum=
p administration could consider after a few years of seeing the results of =
the policies. Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman, said in an e-mail that Mr=

Clovis did not remotely suggest anything having to do with cuts,' Ms. Hicks=
 said. 'I read his statements as though we need to examine budgetary discip=

Timothy O'Brien Suggested Trump's Tax Returns May Show The Extent To Which =
Trump Exaggerated His Income. "So despite Trump's statements to the contrar=
y, here are some general questions that a full release of at least several =
years of his tax returns might usefully answer: 1) Income: Trump has made t=
he size of his fortune a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, implying=
 that it's a measure of his success as a businessman. He has also correctly=
 noted that the income shown on his tax returns isn't a reflection of his t=
otal wealth. Even so, income is a basis for assessing some of the foundatio=
ns of any individual's wealth -- and would certainly reflect the financial =
wherewithal of the businesses in which Trump is involved. After Fortune's S=
hawn Tully dug into Trump's financial disclosures with the Federal Election=
 Commission and an accompanying personal balance sheet his campaign release=
d, he noted in March that Trump 'appears to have overstated his income, by =
a lot, which could be the reason he has so far tried to avoid releasing his=
 returns.' Tully said that Trump apparently boosted his income in the docum=
ents by conflating his various businesses' revenue with his personal income=
. Trump didn't respond to Tully's assessment, but he could clear up all of =
that by releasing his tax returns." [Timothy O'Brien, Bloomberg, 5/12/16<ht=

Trump Said Hillary Clinton Has "A Lot Of Problems. She's Lost A Lot Of The =

her for Hillary because she's lost a lot of the, even if she's, you know, b=
ecause it's a rigged deal. She's got these super delegates that were handed=
 to her. She should win anyway, but she's losing every week. I mean, every =
single week she loses. It's a rigged deal. Then if she doesn't get, if she =
doesn't have to go through the process with respect to the email scandal, t=
hat's a rigged deal too-- You know, I mean, she's got a lot of problems. Sh=
e's lost a lot of the mojo. You know, it would be hard for her with all of =

the other one too. Um, you know I can tell you they want me on. That I can =

onald Trump says the Department of Veterans Affairs' health-care system is =
badly broken, and this week his campaign released some guidelines that woul=
d steer changes he would implement if he wins the presidency. While short o=
n details, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee would likely push VA he=
alth care toward privatization and might move for it to become more of an i=

 That 45% Tariffs On China And Japan, And A 35% Tariff On Mexico, As Trump =
Has Suggested, Would Cost The Average American Household Over $2,200 Annual=
ly.</b> &#8220;The economists looked at
 two scenarios to arrive at their calculations. First, based on statements =
Trump has made in the campaign, they modeled the effect of a 45 percent tar=
iff on imports from China and Japan and a 35 percent tariff on imports from=
 Mexico. That would cost the average
 American household more than $2,200 annually with those households in the =
lowest income brackets feeling the greatest pinch. U.S exports to the three=
 countries also would fall by about 78 percent as a result of the damage do=
ne by Trump&#8217;s proposed tariffs to
 companies in China, Japan and Mexico that buy American goods, the report s=
aid. If the countries actively retaliated against U.S. exports, the impact =
would be even worse. However, tariffs on just three countries likely would =
be ineffective in protecting American
 workers from foreign competition because importers could simply turn to ot=
her suppliers, the economists said. So the team examined a second scenario =
in which a Trump-proposed tariff of 45 percent is applied to imports from a=
ll countries. &#8216;Then the results
 would be truly catastrophic for the poor,&#8217; the report said. &#8216;I=
t would be as if the United States imposed a new tax of 53 percent on the l=
owest 10 percent income decile and a 20 percent tax on the next lowest deci=
le. It would be the equivalent to an 11 percent
 flat tax on the after-tax income of U.S. workers.&#8217; The economists es=
timated the total burden on consumers from higher prices and reduced consum=
ption opportunities would be about $760 billion annually.&#8221; [Politico,

 called Donald Trump&#8217;s idea of not fully repaying investors in U.S. T=

 he&#8217;s confused or he&#8217;s completely off-base&#8230;or both.&#8217=
; In an interview at the SALT Conferences in Las Vegas, Goolsbee noted that=
 while so called &#8220;haircutting&#8221; may have worked for the presumpt=
ive Republican presidential nominee while he was a businessman, particularl=
y
 in the junk bond market, U.S. Treasuries are a very different kind of anim=
al and that treating them like junk bonds would have dire consequences. Las=
t week on CNBC, Trump said, of dealing with the national debt: &#8216;I wou=
ld borrow, knowing that if the economy
 crashed, you could make a deal.&#8217; &#8216;Treasuries are the opposite =
of junk bonds,&#8217; Goolsbee said. &#8216;It&#8217;s the safest asset on =
the planet. Whenever anything goes wrong, money floods into Treasuries and =
actually our interest rates go down when there&#8217;s a crisis. To
 propose anything that would threaten that is, it sounds extreme... It real=

 And New Jersey Gaming Officials In The Process Of Acquiring Casino License=
s.</b> &#8220;Donald Trump insists he won't release his tax returns during =
his 2016 presidential run because those
 returns are the subject of ongoing Internal Revenue Service audits. When h=
e's had casinos on the line, it's been a different story. Trump has handed =
over tax returns in the midst of audits before -- to state gambling officia=
ls in Pennsylvania and New Jersey,
 as part of the process of seeking casino licenses in those states. The ret=
urns haven't been publicly accessible, but they were used by the state inve=
stigators who reviewed those applications. In Pennsylvania, Trump's attorne=
ys included tax returns from 2000
 through 2004 in a set of documents that the state's Gaming Control Board s=
tamped as &#8216;received&#8217; on February 9, 2006. It came as Trump atte=
mpted to build a casino in Philadelphia -- a project that state officials u=
ltimately rejected amid fears he'd use it to
 lure gamblers across state lines to his properties in Atlantic City, New J=
ersey, where the tax rate is lower. He was required to turn over tax return=
s in New Jersey, as well, where state law requires five years' worth of tax=
 returns from casino license applicants.
 A spokesman for the New Jersey Casino Control Commission confirmed that Tr=
ump's tax returns were mandatory, but said they'd only have been made publi=
c if they were introduced as evidence in court proceedings over casino lice=
nses -- which didn't happen in Trump's

 in which he sued me for libel (the suit was later dismissed), I think ther=
e probably are some things to be learned from them. The tax returns my lawy=

 -- producing those documents, and when they finally arrived they were so h=

<p class=3D"DNCBullet"><b>Timothy O&#8217;Brien Suggested Trump&#8217;s Tax=
 Returns May Show The Extent To Which Trump Exaggerated His Income.
</b>&#8220;So despite Trump&#8217;s statements to the contrary, here are so=
me general questions that a full release of at least several years of his t=
ax returns might usefully answer: 1) Income: Trump has made the size of his=
 fortune a centerpiece of his presidential campaign,
 implying that it&#8217;s a measure of his success as a businessman. He has=
 also correctly noted that the income shown on his tax returns isn&#8217;t =
a reflection of his total wealth. Even so, income is a basis for assessing =
some of the foundations of any individual&#8217;s
 wealth -- and would certainly reflect the financial wherewithal of the bus=
inesses in which Trump is involved. After Fortune&#8217;s Shawn Tully dug i=
nto Trump&#8217;s financial disclosures with the Federal Election Commissio=
n and an accompanying personal balance sheet
 his campaign released, he noted in March that Trump &#8216;appears to have=
 overstated his income, by a lot, which could be the reason he has so far t=
ried to avoid releasing his returns.&#8217; Tully said that Trump apparentl=
y boosted his income in the documents by conflating
 his various businesses&#8217; revenue with his personal income. Trump didn=
&#8217;t respond to Tully&#8217;s assessment, but he could clear up all of =
that by releasing his tax returns.&#8221; [Timothy O&#8217;Brien, Bloomberg=

ainst immigration, trade liberalization and offshoring, but also favors rig=
ht-to-work laws and opposes a federal
 minimum wage increase. The new PAC won&#8217;t start spending money until =
a Democratic candidate secures the nomination. A launch date for the super =
PAC is still under discussion. Sources say the PAC will be led by Paul Tewe=
s, a highly respected operative in the
 union world who also has extensive ties within the Democratic Party as a f=
ormer political director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee an=
d a top director of President Barack Obama&#8217;s 2008 campaign.&#8221; [P=
