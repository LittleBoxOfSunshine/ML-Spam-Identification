President Trump is apparently going to consider just sending in Exxon Mobile to defeat ISIS


Trump On Taking Middle Eastern Oil: "I Try And Take The Oil Fields But I Will Say I Know Exxon Mobile. I Know Many Of The Great Oil Companies. They Can Get In There. It's Amazing How Quickly They Can Get That Stuff." O'REILLY: "But there is an implication to your policy and if I'm wrong in the implication, you need to tell me. For Libya, example, when you say that I say if you are elected president, then you are going to send in American bombers and bomb those oil fields, so they are useless to ISIS. Would I be wrong in thinking that as a voter?" TRUMP: "Maybe a little bit wrong. I try and take the oil fields but I will say I know Exxon Mobile. I know many of the great oil companies. They can get in there. It's amazing how quickly they can get that stuff." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]

This one was a real humdinger



Donald Trump On Afghanistan: "That's One Place, Frankly, Instead Of Going To Iraq We Should Have Gone There First." O'REILLY: ... "Now for the top story tonight. Donald Trump giving a big foreign policy address yesterday in Washington. He joins us now from Evansville, Indiana. First of all, you did not mention Afghanistan in the address. We have got about 10,000 troops there right now. The place is still in chaos after 13 years. What exactly will you do about Afghanistan?" DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: "I would stay in Afghanistan. It's probably the one place we should have gone in the Middle East because it's adjacent and right next to Pakistan which has nuclear weapons. So I think you have to stay and do the best you can, not that it's ever going to be great but I don't think we have much of a choice. That's one place, frankly, instead of going to Iraq we probably should have gone there first. I would say in Afghanistan and only, again, because of its location next to Pakistan." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump Said He Would Get A Pakistani Doctor Who Assisted With The Bin Laden Raid Out Of Pakistani Prison "In Two Minutes. I Would Tell [Pakistan] To Let Them Out And I'm Sure They Would Let Them Out." O'REILLY: "Yes. But Pakistan is no friend to the U.S.A. In fact, the guy who helped us, the doctor who helped us the Pakistani get Bin Laden, they put him in prison. Do you think you could get that doctor out?" TRUMP: "Yes, I do. I think I would get him out in two minutes. I would tell them let them out and I'm sure they would let them out. Because we give a lot of aid to Pakistan. We give a lot of money to Pakistan. And frankly, they will do -- they don't have any respect for our president. But when you say they take advantage or they are no friend." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



*         Trump: "Nobody Is A Friend To Us. They Just Take Us Like A Bunch Of Suckers ... Pakistan Certainly Takes Advantage Like Everybody Else. Nobody Is Different." TRUMP: ... "Nobody is a friend to us. They just take us like a bunch of suckers, Bill. And that's what my speech was about to a certain extent. It was also economic in terms of economic, relative to aid and the military. But Pakistan certainly takes advantage like everybody else. Nobody is different." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump: "I Didn't Want To Say Take The Oil ... But In Our Country With The System That We Have, Eventually You Have To Start Saying What You Would Do." TRUMP: ... "But in all fairness, I didn't want to say about the oil. I'm the one that's been saying it, I didn't want to say take the oil. Keep the oil. Bomb the oil. We never did it and we are not doing it in Libya either. They just took over the Libyan oil and this, and they get out, we're not doing a thing about it. They're becoming richer and richer. Because we have people that don't know what they're doing. But, you in know I have been saying the oil. I didn't want to say that either. I would like to get them by surprise. But in our country with the system that we have, eventually you have to start saying what you would do." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump On Taking Middle Eastern Oil: "I Try And Take The Oil Fields But I Will Say I Know Exxon Mobile. I Know Many Of The Great Oil Companies." O'REILLY: "But there is an implication to your policy and if I'm wrong in the implication, you need to tell me. For Libya, example, when you say that I say if you are elected president, then you are going to send in American bombers and bomb those oil fields, so they are useless to ISIS. Would I be wrong in thinking that as a voter?" TRUMP: "Maybe a little bit wrong. I try and take the oil fields but I will say I know Exxon Mobile. I know many of the great oil companies. They can get in there. It's amazing how quickly they can get that stuff." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump: "We Will Have To Bomb And We May Have To Do Something But We'll Have To Bomb And We Will Have To Get People In The Region Or We'll Have To Bomb And Just Keep The Oil." O'REILLY: "But they can't defeat these ISIS people private companies, so you would have to send in American ground troops which I think you'll going to have to do anyway." TRUMP: "Yes. We will have to bomb and we may have to do something but we'll have to bomb and we will have to get people in the region or we'll have to bomb and just keep the oil. I have been saying keep the oil for years." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Asked About Committing American Ground Troops To Capture ISIS-Controlled Oil Fields, Trump Said The United States Could Use Its "So-Called Allies." O'REILLY: "OK. But in order to get the oil, you have to defeat the guys on the ground who are now running the oil fields." TRUMP: "That is correct." O'REILLY: "And that is going to require American Special Forces, paratroopers, airborne, all of that to go in. And beat these guys on the ground. So, again, implication, I'm thinking you are saying you are going to send in ground troops to defeat ISIS in Syria and Libya, no?" TRUMP: "Bill, or we are going to use our so-called allies. We don't have such great allies between us, okay?" [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump Said That "We're Going To Have Such Great Allies," Then Criticized American Allies For Running After "The First Shot Is Fired In The Air." TRUMP: ... "We're going to have such great allies. In theory, they are always saying, oh, we will use our allies. But our allies, we give them all the equipment, we give them the beautiful Humvees and the new rifles and everything else. And the first shot is fired in the air and they start running. So, that's our allies. But we are going to have to do something. At least with oil we have something tangible. We should have never gone to Iraq. But when we got out we should have kept the oil." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump On ISIS: "Number One, I Want The Oil. Number Two, I Would Send As Few [Troops] In As Possible. And I Would Try And Use Other People If Possible." O'REILLY: "Yes. It sounds to me like a President Trump would use ground troops to some extent to, a, seize oil from ISIS and, B, kill them." TRUMP: "Well, two things. Number one, I want the oil. Number two, I would send as few in as possible. And I would try and use other people if possible -" O'REILLY: "Okay, if possible." TRUMP: "-- except they just don't seem to have the capability. They don't seem to have the capability." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump Said That ISIS Also Had "A Lot Of Wealth Through The Banking Channels" And That "You Have To Comb The Dark Banking Channels ... But The Oil Is The Main Thing." TRUMP: "Yes. We have got to get the oil. We have got to get the oil." O'REILLY: "Right." TRUMP: "Because that's their source of wealth. Now, they also have a lot of wealth through the banking channels. You have comb the dark banking channels. And they're getting a lot of wealth through them. People don't even know about it but they are. But the oil is the main thing. "[O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump: "I Am Saying That I Think I Would Possible Have A Good Relationship [With Putin]. ... I Think He Said Some Really Nice Things. He Called Me A Genius. He Said Trump's A Genius. Okay. So, You Know, That's Nice." O'REILLY: "All right. Now, Putin, you are on record at saying that you believe you can convince him to be a friend of America. But obviously he is expanding -" TRUMP: "No, I'm not saying that. I am saying that I think I would possibly have a good relationship. I don't know. I think he said some really nice things. He called me a genius. He said Trump's a genius. Okay. So, you know, that's nice. That's not going to persuade me one way or the other." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



*         Trump Said That Putin "Has Been Very Nice To Me." TRUMP: ... "I have people on the debate stage that said, get him to disavow it. Get him. And I said, why would I do that? But no, no, he has been very nice to me. But let me just tell you. I have no idea, Bill. Maybe we will, maybe we won't. If we can make a great deal for our country and get along with Russia, that would be a tremendous thing." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump On Putin: "We Always Have A Stick. We Have The Economy. We Have Certain Things That Are Advantages." O'REILLY: "Do you have a stick in case Putin is unreasonable which he is known to be? Do you have a stick?" TRUMP: "Well, you know, we always have a stick. We have the economy. We have certain things that are advantages. I mean, we do have this -" O'REILLY: "All right. All we have to do is cut off American banking credit cards and he is done." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump Said He Would Get China To Work With The United States On North Korea "By Telling Them If You Don't Help Us, It's Going To Be Over." O'REILLY: "But here's the deal. If you tee the Chinese off by a trade war or slapping tariffs on their products coming in here, they will be less incline to do help with you North Korea and that was one of the things you mentioned in your policy address that you are going to mobilize China." TRUMP: "They don't help us now." O'REILLY: "I know. But how are you ever going to get China to help us neutralize North Korea if you saber rattle in the trade area? TRUMP: By telling them if you don't help us, it's going to be over. We're just not going to -" O'REILLY: "So, you are going to threaten them?" TRUMP: "Well, we have a trade deficit bill. It's not a threat. It's a fact. Oka? We have a trade deficit of $505 billion a year with China. They are just ripping us, left and right." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]

Trump: "North Korea Is - Should Behave And China Can Make Them Behave. China Doesn't Do It Because They Are Tweaking Us. ... Yet We Are The Ones That Really Created China." TRUMP: "China has power over North Korea. North Korea could solve that problem in one day, in one meeting. Probably in one phone call. North Korea is -- should behave and China can make them behave. China doesn't do it because they are tweaking us. They have no respect for President Obama and they have no respect for our country. And, yet, we are the ones that really we created China, economically they took our money, they took our jobs. You know, we owe them right now $1.8 trillion." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Donald Trump Said Didn't Care Whether Savannah Guthrie Was Offended By His Comments On Hillary Clinton And That "[Clinton] Is Playing The Woman Card And It's The Only Thing She Has Got Going. That's It." O'REILLY: "Now, do you think Miss Guthrie was offended by your statement about Hillary Clinton?" TRUMP: "It doesn't really matter to me. I mean, she is perfectly nice but I don't really care. I mean, it's a fact. She is playing the woman card and it's the only thing she has got going. That's it." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump Said That Hillary Clinton "Raises Her Voice Much More Than I Raise Mine, Believe Me." TRUMP: "And she is playing as much as she can. I mean, I've been watching it. I mean, all she does, every time she raises if you raise your voice, it's like oh, look what he is saying and look at the way he talks. Give me a break. I mean, she raises her voice much more than I raise mine, believe me." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump Said That He Wasn't Worried About Hillary Clinton Accusing Him Of Being A Sexist Because In Recent Primaries "I Just Absolutely Killed Everybody With The Women. The Women Came Out In Droves. And I Won The Women Category." O'REILLY: "What about this sexism thing? I don't really know what this is. Any time I say or criticize a woman I'm accused of being a sexist. But any time I criticize the African-American community in any way or that I'm a racist. If I criticize illegal immigrants, then I'm anti-poor and anti- Hispanic, I think that's going to be a major team directed against you, any time you criticize Hillary Clinton you are a sexist. Are you ready for that?" TRUMP: "No. I don't think it will. And I will tell you why. She is going to try and play it but I'm going to bring jobs back to this country. Nobody respects women more than I do by the way. And I see it at the rallies. And you saw just the other day in New York and Pennsylvania. I won all these states in landslides. And I just absolutely killed everybody with the women. The women came out in droves. And I won the women category. I won African-American. I won -- I won virtually every category. I won landslides. And that means the five that we just won and in New York the week before. But I won with women and just about every group. In fact, every other group." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Donald Trump Said That He Would "Win Against Hillary" Because He Was "Better At The Military Than She Is. All The Military People Are All Voting For Trump." TRUMP: I think in my mind I do. I haven't been focused on it yet for a different reason. I have had 17 people and 16 of which who came at me, governors and senators and very smart people. People like Dr. Ben Carson who is a fantastic guy who endorsed me and Chris Christie who endorsed me. They, you know, they were all coming at me. And now I have two left. And they are not really left they're hanging by a thread. They will be gone soon and then I will focus on Hillary. And I will win against Hillary because I am going to have a stronger military. I'm better at the military than she is. The military people are all voting for Trump." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



Trump: "The Military People Are All Voting For Trump. ... And Women Are Going To Vote For Trump Because They Want Security. They Want Safety. They Want To Have Women's Health Issues Taken Care Of Properly." TRUMP: ... "You look at the different groups and the different subgroups, and women are going to vote for Trump because they want security. They want safety. They want to have women's health issues taken care of properly." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]



On The FBI Investigation Of Hillary Clinton, Trump Said He Had Heard "Fantastic Things" About FBI Director James Comey But "With That Being Said, I Just Don't Know What Goes On Behind The Scenes." O'REILLY: "I asked you this last time and I'm sure you have thought about it, do you think the FBI is straight up? Do you think that Comey, the director, is playing politics or is he going to do an honest investigation and tell the folks what really happened?" TRUMP: "Well, I hear fantastic -- I don't know him. I hear fantastic things, beyond fantastic. Now, with that being said, I just don't know what goes on behind the scenes. I can say that I hope he is straight up. I think if he is straight up that she is not going to be able to run. I hope she can run in one way because I would love to run against her. I will beat her. And Cruz can't beat her and Kasich, I mean, give me a break he is one for 44." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]

 there right now. The place is still in chaos after 13 years. What exactly will you do about Afghanistan?&#8221; DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: &#8221;I would stay in Afghanistan. It's probably the one place we should have gone in the Middle East because it's
 adjacent and right next to Pakistan which has nuclear weapons. So I think you have to stay and do the best you can, not that it's ever going to be great but I don't think we have much of a choice. That's one place, frankly, instead of going to Iraq we probably
 should have gone there first. I would say in Afghanistan and only, again, because of its location next to Pakistan.&quot; [O&#8217;Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]<o:p></o:p></p>

 out in two minutes. I would tell them let them out and I'm sure they would let them out. Because we give a lot of aid to Pakistan. We give a lot of money to Pakistan. And frankly, they will do -- they don't have any respect for our president. But when you

</b>TRUMP: I think in my mind I do. I haven't been focused on it yet for a different reason. I have had 17 people and 16 of which who came at me, governors and senators and very smart people. People like Dr. Ben Carson who is a fantastic guy who endorsed me
 and Chris Christie who endorsed me. They, you know, they were all coming at me. And now I have two left. And they are not really left they're hanging by a thread. They will be gone soon and then I will focus on Hillary. And I will win against Hillary because
 I am going to have a stronger military. I'm better at the military than she is. The military people are all voting for Trump.&#8221; [O&#8217;Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]<o:p></o:p></p>

</b>O'REILLY: &#8220;I asked you this last time and I'm sure you have thought about it, do you think the FBI is straight up? Do you think that Comey, the director, is playing politics or is he going to do an honest investigation and tell the folks what really happened?&#8221;
 TRUMP: &#8220;Well, I hear fantastic -- I don't know him. I hear fantastic things, beyond fantastic. Now, with that being said, I just don't know what goes on behind the scenes. I can say that I hope he is straight up. I think if he is straight up that she is not
 going to be able to run. I hope she can run in one way because I would love to run against her. I will beat her. And Cruz can't beat her and Kasich, I mean, give me a break he is one for 44.&#8221; [O&#8217;Reilly Factor, Fox News, 4/28/16]<o:p></o:p></p>
