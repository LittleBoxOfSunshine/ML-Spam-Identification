Can we sit down today to discuss? With Sean gone we are missing a step. He was on both the leg and DNC side and was able to pull remarks together for PAC events without blinking. Our operation shifted after he left and we need to find a way to ensure we are all communicating a little earlier about PAC events. Not a big deal just getting everyone on the same page.
