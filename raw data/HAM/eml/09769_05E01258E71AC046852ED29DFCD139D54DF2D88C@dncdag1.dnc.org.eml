DNC to offer Sanders a convention concession
By Abby Phillip<http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/abby-phillip> and Anne=
 Gearan<http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/anne-gearan> May 19 at 8:56 PM

In an attempt to head off an ugly conflict at its convention this summer, t=
he Democratic National Committee plans to offer a concession to Sen. Bernie=
 Sanders =97 seats on a key convention platform committee =97 but it may no=
t be enough to stop Sanders from picking a fight over the party=92s policy =
positions.

Allies of both Clinton and Sanders have urged Democratic leaders to meet so=
me of Sanders=92s more mundane demands for greater inclusion at the Philade=
lphia convention. Their decision to do so is expected to be finalized by th=
e end of the week, according to two people familiar with the discussions. B=
ut growing mistrust between Sanders supporters and party leaders have threa=
tened to undermine that effort.

Even with the committee assignments, Sanders plans an aggressive effort to =
extract platform concessions on key policies that could prompt divisive bat=
tles at a moment when front-runner Hillary Clinton will be trying to unify =
the party. Among other issues, he plans to push for a $15 national minimum =
wage and argue that the party needs a more balanced position regarding Isra=
el and Palestinians, according to a Sanders campaign aide who requested ano=
nymity to speak candidly.

Much like their view that the economy has been =93rigged=94 to benefit the =
wealthy more than the middle and working classes, Sanders supporters have b=
ecome increasingly convinced that national Democrats have stacked the polit=
ical deck with rules that have made it difficult for Sanders to win enough =
delegates to threaten Clinton=92s nomination.

Party leaders, meanwhile, have grown more frustrated with Sanders, who they=
 say has unfairly fueled that perception.

=93I don=92t think they=92ve handled it very well and I think they=92ve los=
t the moral high ground on this,=94 said Ken Martin, chairman of Minnesota=
=92s Democratic-Farmer Labor Party. =93It=92s very clear now that the longe=
r they stay in this race the more damage they=92re doing.=94

The mistrust hit a boiling point in Nevada over the weekend, when a ruckus =
caused by Sanders supporters<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp=
/2016/05/15/heres-what-happened-at-saturdays-dramatic-nevada-democratic-con=
vention/> prompted security officials to cut short the state party conventi=
on. The incident worried party leaders impatient with the prolonged Democra=
tic primary and looking to avoid drama in Philadelphia. Their impatience sp=
read to Sanders when he issued a defiant statement<https://www.washingtonpo=
st.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/17/nevada-democratic-party-accuses-bernie-sa=
nders-campaign-of-inciting-violence/>accusing Nevada Democrats of preventin=
g a =93fair and transparent process.=94

Separately, the composition of three convention committees =97 platform, ru=
les and credentials =97 has become key. Earlier this month, in a letter to =
DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Sanders threatened to bring the fi=
ght to the floor of the convention if she did not appoint more of his loyal=
ists to the each of the three committees.

Martin and other Democratic chairmen urged national leaders to give Sanders=
 the concessions he seeks =97 especially when it comes to the platform, whi=
ch in the long run does not have a material impact on Democrats=92 electora=
l chances in November.

=93There are other chairs who probably feel that way and feel like this is =
my party and f--- Bernie Sanders,=94 said Martin, a Clinton supporter. =93I=
=92m not one of those.

=93I feel very passionately that we have to open up that party and make sur=
e that those voices are heard,=94 he said.

One of Sanders=92s demands was the composition of the 15-person drafting co=
mmittee, whose members are appointed at Wasserman Schultz=92s discretion an=
d write the party=92s platform.

One Democratic Party official requesting anonymity said Wasserman Schultz a=
sked for recommendations from both campaigns in an effort to be inclusive.

But Sanders had sought to split the committee evenly between his and Clinto=
n=92s allies =97 plus one =93neutral=94 appointment from Wasserman Schultz.

Weeks of negotiations followed, and the DNC eventually agreed to add more S=
anders representatives. According to two people familiar with the conversat=
ions, the DNC and the campaigns will reach a final agreement =97 probably l=
ess than Sanders wanted but more than the DNC originally offered =97 by the=
 end of the week.

A spokesman for the DNC declined to comment on the negotiations.

Sanders=92s aides have also publicly and privately complained about the app=
ointment of two Clinton loyalists =97 former congressman Barney Frank of Ma=
ssachusetts to head the Rules Committee and Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy to =
lead the Platform Committee =97 as chairmen of two of the convention=92s st=
anding bodies.

Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign, said this week that t=
hey may yet seek to have Frank and Malloy removed from their posts.

In an interview with CNN Thursday, Clinton noted pointedly that she believe=
s Sanders no longer has a shot at the nomination. She also said that Sander=
s will need to encourage his supporters to unify behind her, just as she di=
d in 2008 when running against Barack Obama.

=93I have every confidence that we=92re going to be unified,=94 Clinton sai=
d. =93I think what brings us together is Donald Trump.=94

That hasn=92t happened yet. A Sanders spokesman disputed Clinton=92s assert=
ion that the nomination is hers. And Sanders has ramped up the rhetoric in =
recent days, saying after Clinton won Kentucky that he still intends to win=
 the nomination despite an overwhelming disadvantage in delegates.

Even if he doesn=92t, he still intends to pick a platform fight at the conv=
ention, according to a campaign aide who requested anonymity to discuss str=
ategy.

Clinton aides have said that on a slew of issues, Sanders is not far from t=
he party. But the issue of U.S. policy toward Israel =97 which a Sanders ad=
viser said =93absolutely, legitimately will be a point of conversation=94 =
=97 has made some of Clinton=92s backers nervous.

Sanders is seeking a more =93even-handed=94 U.S. approach to Israeli occupa=
tion of land Palestinians claim for a future state. The current platform do=
es not address the nearly five-decade occupation directly, but it endorses =
=93a just and lasting Israeli-Palestinian accord, producing two states for =
two peoples.=94

Speaking last month during a contentious debate with Clinton, Sanders =97 w=
ho declared himself =93100 percent pro-Israel=94 =97 said that Israel=92s 2=
014 military assault on the Gaza Strip was =93disproportionate=94 to the th=
reat posed by Hamas rockets launched from the Palestinian territory into Is=
rael.

Behind his words is a long debate among U.S. and international policymakers=
 =97 one that divides the Democratic base and could pose a challenge for Cl=
inton when she must bring her party together: how to weigh Palestinian inte=
rests when dealing with Israel, and whether resolute U.S. backing for Israe=
l diminishes leverage to promote peace and fair treatment of Palestinians.

=93On one hand there is not an enormous amount of difference between them. =
They are both pro-Israel, they are both pro-peace,=94 said one longtime Cli=
nton supporter. =93But in the context of the campaign terms like =91even-ha=
nded=92 can come to mean that the United States is signaling a shift=94 =97=
 and Clinton would oppose that.
