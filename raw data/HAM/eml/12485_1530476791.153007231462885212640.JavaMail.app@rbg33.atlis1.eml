ity Doubles its Board of Directors
New members include principal authors of the ADA Steve Bartlett and Tony Co=
elho, as well as inventor of reality television, Jonathan Murray
=20
Rockville, Md., May 10 &ndash; RespectAbility, a nonprofit organization wor=
king to empower Americans with disabilities to achieve the American Dream, =
is proud to announce that we have added major leaders to our boards of dire=
ctors and advisors. Our diverse board of directors now includes the Congres=
sional co-authors of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the inventor of r=
eality television, and major leaders in philanthropy, communications, manag=
ement and business. Our board of advisors includes experts who are steeped =
in disability issues and nonprofit management.
=20
Founded in 2013, RespectAbility works to educate, sensitize and engage Amer=
icans to focus on what people with disabilities can do, rather than on what=
 they cannot. RespectAbility seeks to increase the number and percentage of=
 Americans with disabilities who engage in competitive, integrated employme=
nt, start and sustain their own businesses, lift themselves into the middle=
 class and participate in their communities. In its first two-and-a-half ye=
ars, RespectAbility met one-on-one with 43 of the nation&rsquo;s governors =
and all of the presidential candidates, including those who have since susp=
ended their campaigns, to discuss issues of concern to people with disabili=
ties &ndash; especially employment and stigma. Collaborating with Jonathan =
Murray and A&amp;E, RespectAbility promoted Born This Way through an event =
on Capitol Hill and social media, helping to get the show renewed for a sec=
ond season. RespectAbility&rsquo;s social media channels continue to grow, =
with more than 57,000 fans on Facebook and nearly 5,000 followers on Twitte=
r.
=20
&ldquo;We are thrilled to add a wonderful group of leaders to our boards,&r=
dquo; RespectAbility Co-Founder and Chair Donn Weinberg said. &ldquo;For de=
cades, approximately 70 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities =
have been outside the workforce. We are building a strong, coordinated and =
bipartisan voice for the 1-in-5 Americans who have a disability.&rdquo;
=20
In order to further this work, RespectAbility's board of directorswelcomes =
five new members http://links.grassrootstargeting.mkt7273.com/ctt?kn=3D32&m=
s=3DMjU0NDY2NTgS1&r=3DMjI2MzE1OTQzOTEyS0&b=3D2&j=3DODAxNDU2MTYxS0&mt=3D1&rt=
=3D0, bringing the total size to 10 directors. We also have five leaders on=
 our board of advisors. Our board of directors recently welcomed our new me=
mbers:The Honorable Steve Bartlett was the principal author of 18 major pie=
ces of legislation &mdash; including many legislative initiatives on advanc=
ing the cause of independence for people with disabilities &mdash; while se=
rving as a member of Congress from 1983 to 1991. In addition to being a pri=
ncipal author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, legislation included =
Medicaid eligibility, Section 1619 for Medicare eligibility, supported empl=
oyment, assistive technology, creation of Towards Independence, the Preside=
nt&rsquo;s Council on Handicapped 1984 report, and mainstreaming reforms fo=
r IDEA. He currently serves as a Senior Advisor with Treliant Risk Advisors=
 and has more than 30 years of experience in financial services, business s=
trategy, corporate governance, ethics and compliance, and public policy at =
the highest levels of the private sector and government.=09=09The Honorable=
 Anthony &ldquo;Tony&rdquo; Coelho has spent his entire adult life helping =
advance the lives of people with disabilities. He calls this his &ldquo;min=
istry&rdquo; while those in the disability community call him their &ldquo;=
voice&rdquo; and &ldquo;champion.&rdquo; Diagnosed with epilepsy when he wa=
s 22 years old, Coelho&rsquo;s ministry is marked by significant milestones=
: primary author and sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) &=
mdash; the most important piece of civil rights legislation in the last 30 =
years; advocating for the ratification of the U.N. Convention on the Rights=
 of Persons with Disabilities; and convincing President Clinton to establis=
h the Office of Disability Employment Policy at the U.S. Department of Labo=
r. Coelho continues to advocate for civil rights for individuals with disab=
ilities by convincing President Obama to issue an executive order enforcing=
 Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requiring federal contractor=
s and subcontractors to hire people with disabilities as they have been doi=
ng since 1973 for women and minorities.=09=09Judith Creed is an accomplishe=
d business and healthcare professional with more than 45 years of working e=

arities, as well as Israeli, educational and disabilities organizations. JC=
HAI provides supportive, inclusive independent living and vocational traini=
ng for people with disabilities. JCHAI serves more than 100 people with dis=
abilities. Seventy percent of the JCHAI members are employed in competitive=
 employment. All live independently with JCHAI supports.=09=09Jonathan Murr=
ay is widely credited with helping to usher in the modern reality televisio=
n genre with his late partner Mary-Ellis Bunim. He continues to inspire, in=
fluence and entertain television audiences worldwide. Since the launch of T=
he Real World on MTV in 1992 through Bunim/Murray Productions (BMP), Murray=
 has created and executive produced some of the industry&rsquo;s most innov=
ative, unscripted, entertainment television programs from The Real World to=
 Born This Way (A&amp;E), which documents the lives of young adults with Do=
wn Syndrome and their families. In 2007, his company launched BMP Films, wh=
ich sold its first critically acclaimed documentary, Autism: The Musical, t=
o HBO.=09=09Robert Schwartz is the President and CEO of Food Sciences, Inc.=
, which is a corporation that manufactures and sells weight loss programs a=
nd nutritional supplements to hospitals, diet clinics, individual doctors a=
nd weight loss companies. He personally funds The Schwartz Foundation and s=
upports nonprofits who serve underserved children, after-school education, =
Israel, people with disabilities and the Jewish Community. Fifteen years ag=
o, Schwartz established and personally funded a national after-school progr=
am called Foundations, Inc. that still provides services to school-age, und=
erserved children.&ldquo;Our new board members represent different areas of=
 our work and are poised to enhance RespectAbility&rsquo;s level of experti=
se,&rdquo; Weinberg said. &ldquo;Change will require strong bipartisan coop=
eration, and we are so pleased to have both Steve Bartlett and Tony Coelho =
join our board, bringing bipartisan support to an issue important for all. =
In addition, as we ramp up our efforts to reach out to Hollywood and the me=
dia, we welcome Jonathan Murray&rsquo;s critical support. Judith Creed and =
Robert Schwartz have expertise in running their own foundation as well as f=
aith inclusion.&rdquo;
