Was asked a question by Chad Pergram (FOX News Capitol Hill) about the Dem.
primary and consolidation. Here are my notes - no big flags. Crowley spoke
after her and ID'd himself as an HRC endorser - notes below as well.


*Chad:* HRC del count - shouldn't ppl be moving on?

*DWS: *Primaries willl run through june 7. Preparing for general and we can
walk & chew gum at the same time. Working with our state parties to set up
coordinated campaigns and have made big strides on the voter file and have
a big digital advantage.

*Crowley: *TY to DWS who does a really tough job as Chair & MoC. I've
endorsed HRC. Maybe it is time to move onto issues. Sanders not going to
withdraw and not calling on him to do that but it is time to focus on
unifying issues for all Democrats. The House is in play thanks to Trump &
Cruz.
