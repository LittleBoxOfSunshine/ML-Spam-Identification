Good Saturday morning. The 141st Preakness Stakes is tonight; post time is 6:45 p.m.

DRIVING THE WEEK: Obama departs at 12:55 p.m. for a week in Vietnam and Japan (16,000 miles, per AP) - "Obama's Asian nuclear nightmare: Fueled by Trump's rhetoric and North Korea's threats, Japan and South Korea are eyeing nuclear weapons of their own," by Michael Crowley: "Obama's visit next Friday to Hiroshima, which was incinerated by a U.S. atomic bomb in August 1945, will promote a message diametrically opposite from Trump's. 'It's an opportunity to focus the world's attention on the need to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and seek a world without them,' said deputy national adviser Ben Rhodes. ...

"[A]fter the Iran deal averted what Obama predicted would be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, Asia suddenly looms large as an atomic danger zone. ... Recent satellite imagery suggests that North Korea may be building a new tunnel in preparation for its fifth nuclear test. Officials in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are losing patience with international efforts to thwart Pyongyang's program. ... And those governments increasingly fret that the U.S. ... may become a less reliable ally." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0b53906161b8d0c87ee0f9d05571c2cce74a4ba2adc274c75e44775ab9c56b13

TOP TALKER - "Review: 'Weiner' is riveting fly-on-the-wall filmmaking," by AP National Writer Jocelyn Noveck: "new film about Anthony Weiner and the implosion of his 2013 New York mayoral run amid a revival of his sexting scandal ... Director Josh Kriegman once worked for Weiner ... Weiner clearly hoped Kriegman and co-director Elyse Steinberg would be documenting an inspiring comeback. ... Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin[,] ... let the filmmakers keep going. ... 

"[I]t makes for riveting filmmaking -- as a portrait of a campaign in crisis, of a fascinatingly flawed politician, and especially of a marriage. Watch Abedin's face as she stares at Weiner on the day the scandal breaks anew, disappointed and stunned, with no words spoken and none necessary. ... 'Weiner,' an IFC Films release, is rated R ... 'for language and some sexual material.' Running time: 100 minutes." Review http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0b53906161b8d0c82f6dfdc380759f81f8b3a4009421e37e5f6b5c04ffa8e055 ... Trailer  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0b53906161b8d0c89441667ab2add1f63f82e04497f9ab5f21a9061a7f37df5c 

THE NARRATIVE - "Why Donald Trump's poll numbers are surging: He makes major gains among Republicans, while Clinton drops among Democrats," by Steven Shepard: "The Trump Bump has arrived. ... The main reason for Trump's surge over the past few weeks? ... [R]ank-and-file Republican voters are lining up behind Trump in large numbers, closing the gap with Clinton's support among Democrats, which had been higher." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0b53906161b8d0c84f841a9b2d6f496fc769d8ddf59fb16f33bd3f5c9b7600a7

--WSJ A1, bottom of page, "Trump Is Closing Deal With Republican Elite," by Kristina Peterson and Siobhan Hughes, with Rebecca Ballhaus: "'You're better off riding the beast than trying to ignore it,' said Stewart Verdery, the founder of lobbying and public-affairs firm Monument Policy Group and a former Senate Republican aide. ... On Capitol Hill, attendance is growing at a weekly meeting of Mr. Trump's House GOP supporters and his campaign advisers." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0b53906161b8d0c8edf028aa1d279ee7065ee28b39431630af37fac9bb3dda99

CHASER - "Trump's campaign dwarfed by Clinton's: New FEC reports show that the likely Democratic nominee will start with a huge infrastructure advantage," by Ken Vogel and Isaac Arnsdorf: "Through the end of last month, ... Trump's campaign had spent less than a third as much Clinton's ($57 million to $182 million) and had assembled a staff about one-tenth the size of her (70 employees to 732), with a fraction as many offices (Trump last month paid $101,000 in rent vs. $328,000 for Clinton)." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0b53906161b8d0c86cc0be53d3d3117e934793a97feae2385b04f005a63669a1

--"Sanders outraised Clinton in April after all: New FEC reports contradict earlier claims, but also show Clinton building towards the general election," by Isaac Arnsdorf and Ken Vogel: "Clinton entered this month with a healthy $30 million in the bank, but her campaign did not take in more money than Bernie Sanders' in April, contradicting earlier assessments and calling into question suggestions that her fundraising had overtaken his small-dollar fundraising juggernaut. Clinton's main campaign committee directly received $25.1 million last month, compared with $26.9 million raised by Sanders' campaign." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0b53906161b8d0c8988ef92a464050cf14f059423c512bc971035d83af9b205d 

"TRUMP CASH ... campaign investment tops $43 million," by AP's Chad Day and Julie Bykowicz: "Trump ... reported spending about $56 million during the primary [$43 million of his own] ... Trump's largest expense in April, about $2.6 million, was for advertisements. The campaign also spent more than $930,000 on direct mail. Other big-ticket items included roughly $585,000 in airfare paid to Trump's TAG Air ... [H]e reported about $1.7 million in donations last month ... largely from people buying Trump's campaign merchandise, including the red 'Make America Great Again' ball caps, and giving online through his campaign website.

"[T]he filings ... show that when Cruz dropped out, money wasn't the issue: He had $9.4 million in his campaign coffers at the end of April, just days before his defeat May 3 in the Indiana primary prompted him to end his bid. At the time, Cruz said he left the race because he saw no path forward." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=b212a1ad561262c6e3bd6cdf59ecacbe819ea750619b9676169091b0ce8e6b49 

--"Trump once revealed his income tax returns. They showed he didn't pay a cent," by WashPost's Drew Harwell: "The disclosure, in a 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators, revealed that [he] had for at least two years ... taken advantage of a tax-code provision popular with developers that allowed him to report negative income. ... A few years earlier, he had told the New York Times he was worth more than $200 million." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=b212a1ad561262c6c427c020ced552154ed6120b9527c8ec68ef69b7b061f81a 

UPDATE: Paul Manafort says that his comment about change and Trump - made Thursday at a meeting of top GOP congressional officials, and cited in yesterday's Playbook -- referred to Trump's negatives, during an exchange about the candidate's favorable-unfavorable numbers. Manafort said the point he made was: "His negatives are going to be changing over the course of the next couple of weeks, as Republicans come home. They're changing as we speak."

** A message from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.: Giving small business owners a real shot at success matters-to them, their neighborhoods and the economy as a whole.

POST-PRESIDENCY PLANNING -- "Obama records destined for library could go into storage in Hoffman Estates," by Chicago Tribune's Katherine Skiba: "A federal agency could move into an old furniture store in Hoffman Estates in October to start processing records and artifacts from the Obama White House ... In its new incarnation, it would be the workplace of employees with the National Archives and Records Administration who are processing Obama presidential records and artifacts. Archivists would work at the old furniture store as the Obama Presidential Center is being built on Chicago's South Side. The center is expected to open in 2021." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=b212a1ad561262c61ffa3043ce274d53b80c41601338043db645070c8c953ac3

BITE DU JOUR -- Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid sat down with MSNBC's Joy Reid for her new 10 a.m. weekend program "AM Joy," with a two-part interview airing this weekend. Reid said Sanders is "coming back to the Senate. ... I think that he has the ability to be a tremendously more powerful Senator in our caucus than he was. He was not patsy to begin with. He can be something much more than what he was." 

TOP TWEETS -- @BuzzFeedAndrew: "The candidate running for president who once said in an ideal world no one would have guns just got endorsed by the NRA. ... "'The Republicans walk the @NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions,' - @realDonaldTrump, late 1999." ... @KatyTurNBC: "LaPierre: If bad guy w gun came into *this room*, he'd find out what good guys w guns could do. **note: no guns allowed in this room." ... @realDonaldTrump, Dec. 17, 2012: "President Obama spoke for me and every American in his remarks in #Newtown Connecticut." ... Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna): "NRA plays clip of Hillary Clinton speaking about gun control -- but 'accidentally' plays the clip of her barking during
 their first try" ... 

... @betsy_klein: "Attendees for Trump at NRA convention can't bring their guns to the Hall. 'Leave them in your car,' volunteer says + there's a knife check" ... @samsteinhp: "Just called up Trump's Mar-a-Lago. Receptionist tells me it's a gun-free club" ... @politico: ".@realDonaldTrump on his sons: 'They have so many rifles and so many guns that sometimes even I get concerned.'" 9-sec. video http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=b212a1ad561262c64409f77a1408aa46c2b984ffd24b6c88ac7955031f1bbd2f 

COMING ATTRACTIONS: L.A. Times A1, below fold, "U.N. may pick its first woman to lead" beginning Jan. 1 (with possible Hillary inauguration that month) -- Tracy Wilkinson at United Nations: "For the first time since the U.N. was founded in 1945, the 193 member states will choose a new secretary-general in a relatively open and apparently transparent election. ... Voting ... starts later this year, and the new term starts Jan. 1 ...

"Those vying for the post include at least four women ... [N]ine candidates have thrown their hats in the ring, and a few more are expected ... Speculation is rampant that someone of the stature of, say, Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, could be recruited." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=b212a1ad561262c663017667734392452da8e76f8d5ae4091508382a3053cb85

SNEAK PEAK - JANE MAYER's "Political Scene" feature in next week's New Yorker, "Sting of Myself: Amateurish spies like James O'Keefe III attempt to sway the 2016 campaign": "With cash streaming into dark-money groups, negative campaigning is a growth industry." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=b212a1ad561262c6a62db69a89a8897f67a0634bcfc484f3a3fc6965fd0af14f ...

DAVID PETRAEUS/MICHAEL O'HANLON op-ed in WSJ, "Take the Gloves Off Against the Taliban": "Some might reasonably ask, after 15 years of war in Afghanistan, why do we need to keep at it? The answer is simple-because Afghanistan, effectively the eastern bulwark in our broader Middle East fight against extremist forces, still matters. ... Simply waging the Afghanistan air-power campaign with the vigor we are employing in Iraq and Syria ... will very likely make much of the difference between some version of victory and defeat." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=b212a1ad561262c6f67ec573f829b0bf75f01ace4c62691eb88659a15b8e26ad

THE TALK OF WALL STREET ... "Unloved bull market: It's been a year since latest record," by AP Business Writer Stan Choe in N.Y.: Today "is the one-year anniversary of the stock market's record high [when the] Standard & Poor's 500 index reached its latest high of 2,130.82 ... Since then, it's come close to beating it, only to veer lower ... Last month it came within about 1 percent of the record ... After a horrendous start to the year, the worst on record for the market, stocks have clawed back the ground they lost ... since 2016 began. 

"As of [yesterday], the S&P 500 was barely positive for 2016. It would need to gain another 4 percent to match the high it reached a year ago. More gains may be on the way, strategists along Wall Street say, though the forecasts are largely for only modest gains, and rocky ones at that."  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5b6455b6a1b7e85cf4762d1a11c9b4e0c4907f83d76464a4a2fc78e30e46db66

** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Two years ago, we announced our $100 million investment in Detroit's recovery, but already the city offers lessons in creating inclusive growth. At the heart of the turnaround? Collaboration-between the public sector, nonprofits and private companies. "Businesses need to be involved, and they need to think differently about how they contribute," notes Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO. For minority-owned small businesses like House of Pure Vin, that means we've got their future in mind when we forge innovative funding partnerships. Learn more about the partnerships that are working in Detroit, and what they can teach us about creating more widely shared
 economic opportunity in cities around the world. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=5b6455b6a1b7e85cec4a3abf2454225639607e391eff0cf6971c9bd606afe6b3 **
