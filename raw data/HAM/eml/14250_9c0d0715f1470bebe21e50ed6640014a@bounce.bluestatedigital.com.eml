			America is literally falling apart. In Flint, children were poisoned by =
the lead contamination of the water. In Washington, the subway system is pl=
agued by fires and delays. Arlington Memorial Bridge =E2=80=94 which connec=
ts the North to the South, the Capitol to Arlington National Cemetery =E2=
=80=94 may have to be closed soon. Kennedy=E2=80=99s eternal flame may burn=
 forever, but the bridge is on its last legs.</p>
		<p>
			The American Society of Civil Engineers released a report last week once=
 more warning the country of a massive investment deficit =E2=80=94 an esti=
mated $1.4 trillion shortfall over the next ten years =E2=80=94 coming on t=
op of years of underfunding and neglect.</p>
		<p>
			This isn=E2=80=99t a matter of money. The Obama administration has annou=
nced it plans to spend over $1 trillion to build a new generation of nuclea=
r weapons and the planes, missiles and submarines that deliver them. These =
are weapons that can never be used. We have spent over $2 trillion on the w=
ars in Afghanistan and Iraq to date, with the final costs estimated at $4 t=
o $6 trillion. The war in Afghanistan =E2=80=94 an impoverished country whe=
re we have no strategic interest =E2=80=94 is already the longest in our hi=
story and continuing.</p>
		<p>
			We have the money. U.S. corporations stash trillions abroad to avoid pay=
ing taxes. If they paid what they owe =E2=80=94 now estimated to be $700 bi=
llion =E2=80=94 it would provide a down payment on rebuilding America. The =
federal tax on gasoline =E2=80=94 dedicated to paying for infrastructure =
=E2=80=94 has not been raised since 1993, even though gas prices have plumm=
eted.</p>
		<p>
			Interest rates on U.S. bonds are now so low that the Treasury could issu=
e Rebuild America bonds, put people to work to rebuild the country =E2=80=
=94 and the growth and increased productivity that results would generate r=
evenues to repay the bonds. Even establishment economists like Lawrence Sum=
mers argue that the program would literally pay for itself. And it would re=
spond to the pleas of the bastion of economic conservatism =E2=80=94 the In=
ternational Monetary Fund =E2=80=94 that is pleading with the U.S. and othe=
r advanced countries to expand public investment to forestall a return to r=
ecession. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that the U.S. w=
ill suffer a stunning $4 trillion in lost GDP by 2025 from the costs of dec=
aying tunnels, railways, waterways and other basic infrastructure. It will =
cost us more to decay than it would to rebuild.</p>
		<p>
			But Washington is frozen. The Republican Congress rejects President Obam=
a=E2=80=99s modest plans for infrastructure investment, though they are sup=
ported by a massive coalition that includes the conservative Chamber of Com=
merce as well as the AFL-CIO. All three presidential candidates call for ex=
panding investment in infrastructure (although only Bernie Sanders comes cl=
ose to meeting the shortfall that the civil engineers warn about). But it w=
ill require a wave election =E2=80=94 a sweeping rebuke to the obstructioni=
st Republican Congress =E2=80=94 for anything to happen.</p>
		<p>
			This is how great nations decline. Investments that are essential to any=
 modern civilized nation =E2=80=94 from schools and bridges to electric gri=
ds and clean water systems =E2=80=94 are neglected. Money is squandered on =
foreign adventures or lost to the tax evasions of corporations and the rich=
. Private speculators profit from privatizing public services. We build the=
 most modern and powerful military in the world but are ever more crippled =
by decaying services that we depend on every day.</p>
		<p>
			Politics as usual won=E2=80=99t change this. It will change only if peop=
le rise up and hold their politicians accountable. How many bridges must co=
llapse or children must be poisoned or businesses must be shuttered before =
that happens?</p>
