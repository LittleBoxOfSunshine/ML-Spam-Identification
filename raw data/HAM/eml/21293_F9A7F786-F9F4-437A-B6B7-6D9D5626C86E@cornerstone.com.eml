Hi Jon,



I hope the timing works out, it would be great to have you there! As for th=
e ticket levels, we=92ve found this election season that some folks have wa=
nted to max out in light of our opposition. The difference is mostly in nam=
e only, but it also allows your name to be listed on the invitation as part=
 of the host committee. In your case, attending at the co-host level would =
also qualify you for the Main Line convention package. I=92ve attached our =
convention package descriptions for your reference, but please feel free to=
 reach out if you have any questions.



I hope that helps!



Thanks,

Dan

between cohost and guest levels?

with President Obama  on the evening of June 8th. We will be advertising th=

re among the first to know. Ken Lerer and Katherine Sailer are hosting what=
 promises to be an intimate evening with remarks from the President and the=
 chance to ask any questions you may have. We are expecting no more than 60=
 guests and each person will have the opportunity for a photo with the Pres=
ident.



We=92d love to see you there if you are available. I=92ve included the invi=
tation for your reference and you can RSVP here<https://finance.democrats.o=

ons about the event. I hope we=92ll see you in June!



Best,
