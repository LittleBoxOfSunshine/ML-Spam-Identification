THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate ReleaseMay 3, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20







1:18 P.M. EDT



 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Ill just do a quick statement at=
 the top and then well get to your questions.



 As you all know, the President will travel to Flint, Michigan tomorrow. =
He will stop first at the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan to receive a brie=
fing on the response of the crisis from federal officials and members of =
the Unified Command group. The food bank has helped more than 300,000 peo=
ple in the last year, and it has become a critical hub in the response to=
 the crisis. The facility coordinates the intake of basic supplies like w=
ater and food, and packages meals and hygienic products for distribution =
to the community.



 The President will then take part in a neighborhood roundtable discussio=
n, where he will hear from Flint residents dealing firsthand with the imp=
act of the crisis. The President will also deliver remarks to a crowd of =
about a thousand people at Northwestern High School, which is located in =
predominantly African American North Flint.



 At the direction of President Obama, a wide variety of federal agencies =
have been on the front lines responding to this crisis. FEMA has distribu=
ted more than 9 million liters of water and 50,000 water filters. Medicai=
d coverage has been expanded to everyone under the age of 21 in Flint. HH=
S has extended funding to expand capacity at Head Start centers and commu=
nity health care centers in Flint. The EPA has surged resources to signif=
icantly expand water testing and to offer addition technical advice as ne=
eded. And agencies like SBA and HUD have stepped up their support to the =
community thats weathering a pretty significant economic fallout from the=
 crisis as well.



 As the President noted in his letter last week to Mari Copeny, known aro=
und town as Little Miss Flint, Flint residents need to know that when the=
 cameras are gone, the administrations support for the state and local re=
sponse efforts will continue. And the President looks forward to meeting =
with Mari and her family while he is in Flint tomorrow, as well.



 With all of that -=20



 Q What about the governor? Any meeting?



 MR. EARNEST: I do anticipate that the President will have an opportunity=
 to visit with the governor when hes in Flint. As is customary, the gover=
nor was invited to greet the President on the tarmac when he arrives. I a=
lso understand that the governor and the mayor are likely to be included =
in conversations with those who have been on the frontlines of the respon=
se -- this is the meeting at the food bank. And I wouldnt be surprised if=
 the President also has an opportunity to visit with both the governor an=
d mayor outside the context of that larger meeting as well.



 Darlene, do you want to get us started?



 Q Sure, thank you. On the death of the U.S. Navy SEAL in Iraq, is there =
any reaction from the President to that, or expression of condolence? And=
 can you tell us when he was informed about that?



 MR. EARNEST: Darlene, I can tell you that the President has been briefed=
 on this incident, and everyone here at the White House, including the Fi=
rst Family, extends our condolences to the family of the servicemember th=
at was killed today in northern Iraq. This individual is the third U.S. s=
ervicemember killed in action since the beginning of Operation Inherent R=
esolve, and this servicemembers death reminds us of the risks our brave m=
en and women in uniform face every single day.



 The Department of Defense has indicated that initial reports are that th=
is servicemember died when ISIL terrorists penetrated a checkpoint that w=
as manned by Iraqi forces. Those terrorists, after breaking through the l=
ine, went on to attack a Peshmerga position, where this U.S. servicemembe=
r was advising our partners on the ground. U.S. forces responded right aw=
ay with airpower to stop the attack, and our Iraqi partners are engaging =
the remnants of those forces.



 Q As you mentioned, this is now the third death of a U.S. servicemember =
since troops went back to Iraq in 2014. Is this death today any sort of a=
n indication that U.S. forces are moving closer to the fight against the =
Islamic State group in Iraq? Are they getting closer to combat and danger=
?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is true is that Iraq and Syria are dange=
rous places. And our men and women in uniform who are engaged in a missio=
n to offer training, advice and assistance to Iraqi forces that are fight=
ing for their own country, are doing dangerous work. They are taking grav=
e risks to protect our country and we owe them a deep debt of gratitude.



 Todays incident is a vivid reminder of the risks that our servicemembers=
 are taking. And some of them, three of them now, have made the ultimate =
sacrifice for our country. But the President has been clear, time and tim=
e again, exactly what their mission is. That mission is to support Iraqi =
forces on the ground who are taking the fight to ISIL on the frontlines. =
Iraqi forces must fight for their own country. United States forces canno=
t be a substitute for those Iraqi forces. The United States can use our m=
ilitary firepower. And some of our special operators, in fact, are offeri=
ng them important support, but that support comes in the form of offering=
 advice and assistance. And this is the core of our strategy, which is to=
 build up the capacity of local forces to fight for their own country.



 We have learned important lessons in the last decade. We know that the U=
nited States will not be successful if it's U.S. troops acting essentiall=
y as a substitute for local forces, fighting for the security situation i=
n Iraq. Iraqi security forces must be do that for themselves. They can co=
unt on the support of the United States, they can count on the support of=
 the 65 nations that have signed on to this coalition to degrade and ulti=
mately destroy ISIL. This is a fight that the United States is committed =
to because we under the consequences for our national security.



 But, ultimately, it is Iraqi forces that are on the frontlines. Its Iraq=
i forces that must fight for the security situation in their own country.=




 Q Thanks. My question on Flint was asked and answered. Thanks, Mark.



 MR. EARNEST: Thanks, Mark.



 Roberta.



 Q The U.N. Syria envoy said today that peace talks could resume if the c=
easefire, such as it is, extends to Aleppo. But the rebels launched a new=
 assault on that city. And so Im wondering, does that assault today preve=
nt that from happening? And where does the administration see any road to=
 a diplomatic solution that does not require the kind of more aggressive =
response, U.S. response that some officials and allies in the Gulf have b=
een calling for?



 MR. EARNEST: Roberta, it is true that the United States is concerned by =
the continued escalation of violence in and around Aleppo. The security s=
ituation there, as bad as its been for some time now, is deteriorating. I=
ts an indication that the cessation of hostilities is continuing to fray,=
 particularly in some areas in and around Aleppo.=20



And that's why the United States has been working so tenaciously through =
diplomatic channels to try to refresh the cessation of hostilities. And t=
hat involves working through the U.N.-led process to try to bring both si=
des to the table. It involves working with our allies and directly with o=
pposition forces to persuade them to live up to the commitments that they=
've made in the context of cessation of hostilities.=20



 It also involves senior diplomatic officials in the U.S. government urgi=
ng the Russian government to use the influence that they have with the As=
sad regime to persuade the Syrian government to abide by the cessation of=
 hostilities.=20



 So we're working this from a variety of perspectives because it is centr=
al to resolving the situation in Syria. We have to bring about a politica=
l transition in Syria in order to address all of the chaos there. And tha=
t political transition will not occur while innocent people are getting m=
assacred on the ground in Syria by the government.=20



 So we are trying to bring about the cessation of hostilities -- both to =
nurture continuing political talks, but also to allow for humanitarian re=
lief supplies to be delivered. And we've made some important progress in =
that regard in just the last few weeks, but there are some areas that con=
tinue to be deprived of badly needed humanitarian supplies. So there is a=
 lot of work being done to try to refresh the cessation of hostilities al=
l across the country.=20



 Q So, yesterday, Secretary Kerry said that a deal was close and that he =
signed today on a "regime of calm," I think was the term. So did the rebe=
l assault today prevent that from happening?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have an update for you in terms of an agreeme=
nt that hasnt been reached or announced at this point. But I think this c=
omments are an indication of just how deeply involved the United States S=
ecretary of State and other U.S. diplomats have been in trying to broker =
the cessation of hostilities -- or a refreshing of a cessation of hostili=
ties in those parts of the country where we've seen it break down.



 And Aleppo is certainly an area where we've seen too much violence, and =
the continued escalation of that violence is troubling. So we're working =
diligently through a variety of channels to persuade both sides to go bac=
k to observing the cessation of hostilities that had largely held until j=
ust a few weeks ago.



 So I think part of that, as I referred to this yesterday, we know that t=
he Russian government has sufficient influence with the Assad regime to p=
ersuade them to abide by a cessation of hostilities. They were able to ac=
tually convince them to do that earlier this year. But in just the last c=
ouple of weeks, we've seen the cessation of hostilities begin to fray. An=
d the truth is we need the Russians to do again what they did once before=
, which is go back to the Assad regime and make clear that abiding by the=
 cessation of hostilities is critical.



 Q And in this case today, my understanding is that its not the Russians,=
 its the -- or the Assad regime, its the opposition fighters that had lau=
nched the assault. So I guess that's specifically what I was asking about=
.=20



 MR. EARNEST: And what Im saying is that its both sides that are responsi=
ble here. And our strategy has been to work through the U.N.-led process =
to support the efforts of the U.N. envoy, Mr. de Mistura, as he tries to =
bring both sides to the table. The United States has reached out directly=
 to our allies that have influence with opposition figures. And there has=
 been some direct work that we've done with opposition groups, as well, t=
o persuade them to abide by the cessation of hostilities and come to the =
table for political talks.



 We've also worked through the Russians to persuade the Assad regime to l=
ive up to the commitments that they've made, as well. And that's our stra=
tegy, and its one that provided a path to the successful implementation -=
- the largely successful implementation of a cessation of hostilities ear=
lier this year. And we're trying to get back to that point.



 Michelle.

=20

 Q Josh, when the ceasefire first was agreed upon, administration officia=
ls said that this would be a big test for Russia to see if they're seriou=
s about this and we're following through. And at that time, the ceasefire=
 was going better than expected. It was just a short time into it. So now=
 that it's frayed and now that we're seeing too many serious violations b=
y the Assad regime, and you keep mentioning that Russia should have this =
influence over them, would you say that Russia has passed this test, or n=
ot?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think it is fair to say that the Russians have prev=
iously been successful in persuading the Assad regime to abide by the ces=
sation of hostilities, and it's clear they just need to do that again. Th=
ey've done it once before, even earlier this year. So they have the capac=
ity to do it, and we're hopeful that they will.=20

=20

 Q Do they deserve some of the blame for the fraying and that state that =
things are in now?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think as is clear from Roberta's line of questionin=
g, both sides have contributed to the escalation of violence in and aroun=
d Aleppo. But look, when you have government forces that are under the co=
mmand and control of the central government, and you have government forc=
es that have much more firepower than opposition fighters on the ground, =
there's a significant responsibility that is borne by the government when=
 it comes to living up to commitments that they have made in the context =
of a cessation of hostilities.=20



 So we're concerned about the escalation of violence, and there has been =
violence carried out by both sides. But we're going to go back to both si=
des and urge them to live up to the commitments that they previously made=
 even just a couple of months ago.



 Q Are you satisfied with Russia's level of cooperation so far?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly believe that there is more that Russia c=
an and should do. Russia has succeeded in their efforts in the past to pl=
ay an important role in the largely successful implementation of a cessat=
ion of hostilities. The Russian government has the capacity to persuade t=
he Assad regime to live up to their commitments, and we hope that they wi=
ll use that capacity one more time to refresh the cessation of hostilitie=
s, particularly in the areas around Aleppo where it's been fraying with v=
ery bad consequences.

=20

 Q And on the same day that the White House is honoring these great teach=
ers, there's another large-scale sickout in Detroit. How closely is the W=
hite House watching that situation? And what are your thoughts on the sit=
uation there?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the White House is obviously aware of the situation, =
but it's the Secretary of Education, John King, that's been in touch with=
 state and local officials as the city of Detroit works through some sign=
ificant financial problems.=20



 Look, the point of honoring the National Teacher of the Year is to lift =
up the efforts of people who dont often get a lot of attention. But teach=
ers that are showing up in classrooms on a daily basis are educating the =
next generation of Americans. They're critical to the future of our count=
ry and to the success of our country. And teachers have a job that's not =
glamorous, that's not high-paying, but I think many of them would tell yo=
u that it's enormously rewarding.=20



 And the President believes that it's worth recognizing the important con=
tribution that they're making to our country and to our country's future.=
 So as politicians are making choices about where to invest resources, th=
e President believes that prioritizing the pay of teachers is a good plac=
e to start.



 Q We're really hearing Donald Trump and Ted Cruz going at it with these =
accusations and names flying --



 MR. EARNEST: Because they've been so well-behaved before? (Laughter.)=20=




 Q Well, better-behaved, perhaps. But in the past we talked a lot about t=
he rhetoric in here and how it affects the country, how it affects either=
 side. You've welcomed the robust debate, but the White House has been pr=
etty serious in saying that the kind of rhetoric that has come from the R=
epublican Party is bad for the country and bad for democracy. But when yo=
u're seeing the rhetoric now directed at each other on the Republican sid=
e, are you seeing that as bad for the country and bad for democracy? Or a=
re you seeing that as good for Democrats and good for what you want to ha=
ppen?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President certainly does believe that living up t=
o some standard of decorum when it comes to our political debates is valu=
able. And the President had an opportunity to talk about this both in his=
 State of the Union address but also in the speech that he delivered in S=
pringfield, Illinois -- that leaders, regardless of -- sort of setting as=
ide what office you're running for or even what party you represent, that=
 running for elective office means that voters are prepared to entrust yo=
u with significant responsibilities. And with those responsibilities come=
s the need to elevate the public debate. People who hold elective office =
are making important decisions that have an impact on citizens in their c=
ommunities, and, in some cases, citizens across the country.



 And when making the case publicly for why they should be entrusted with =
that responsibility, politicians have a responsibility to engage as much =
as possible in a debate about the issues, to lay out their priorities, to=
 describe what it is that is motivating them to run for office in the fir=
st place. And that is the kind of debate that makes for a vibrant democra=
cy. And the President has acknowledged that he has not always lived up to=
 the high standard that he has set for himself. But I think over the last=
 eight or nine years, this President has done an extraordinary job of lea=
ding the kind of debate that, first of all, he can be proud of -- one tha=
t accurately reflects the kinds of values and priorities that promoted hi=
m to seek public office in the first place -- but it's also the kind of d=
ebate that engages the American public in the governing of our country. A=
nd having campaigns that are filled with debates about the issues ultimat=
ely means that we have government that is more focused on the issues.

=20

 Q But surely you wouldnt admonish the opposing side's candidates from at=
tacking each other. Wouldnt the White House agree that the uglier things =
get, the better for Democrats?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think as you and I discussed at one point in the br=
iefing last week, if you're looking for somebody to defend a Republican f=
rom the attacks of another Republican, you should probably ask somebody o=
ther than me. But what's also true is that the individual candidates are =
going to have decide for themselves exactly what kind of campaign they wa=
nt to run, and they'll have to make the case to the voters that what they=
're saying on the campaign trail -- or what that says about what kind of =
elective official they would be.



 Q Or another way of asking: Does the White House welcome the fierce atta=
cks from one candidate to the other?



 MR. EARNEST: Look, individual candidates -- again, whether they're Democ=
rats or Republicans -- are going to have to decide how they want to spend=
 their time on the campaign trail. And the President certainly made his c=
hoices and has tried to live up to a very high standard that he has set f=
or himself. I think, by and large, the President has been enormously succ=
essful in meeting that standard -- not flawless, but enormously successfu=
l. But other candidates will have to set their own standard for their cam=
paign. And I think voters will consider whether or not they've lived up t=
o it.

 Q Thanks, Josh. Senator Warren sent a letter to OMB Director Shaun Donov=
an, essentially pressuring the administration to finish up work on the ov=
ertime rule. So I was wondering if you guys have an update on where the p=
rocess stands in finalizing that rule.



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have an update for you in terms of where that stand=
s. I know that's something that's being considered by OMB right now. But =
I don't have an update for you in terms of when that review is likely to =
be completed.



 Q Im not sure if you've read the letter. But she --



 MR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the letter. You can describe it to me if you=
 want, and Ill do my best.



 Q Well, she was saying that the comments -- she expressed concern that t=
he administration might weigh comments from lobbyists and those type of f=
olks over comments from workers. And I was wondering if you can shed some=
 light on how the administration is considering the comments from the pub=
lic in finalizing the rule.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has been very clear about what =
his economic strategy is, and that is to ensure that our economy is growi=
ng from the middle out. That's the most -- that's the way that we can ens=
ure that we have sustained economic growth over the long term. And I thin=
k there are a variety of ways to examine whether or not the President has=
 lived up to that kind of commitment.



 Lets talk one example. We can do the conflict-of-interest rule. This is =
a rule that would require financial planners who are offering retirement =
advice to do so with the best interests of their customers in mind. We sa=
w the financial industry unleash a significant lobbying campaign to try t=
o water down that rule, and we rebuffed their efforts to do so. We succee=
ded in moving forward with a rule that is certainly fair to financial pla=
nners. I don't think its placing too high of a burden on them to suggest =
that they need to put their customers interests ahead of their own financ=
ial interests.



 But that was a subject of intense debate, and this administration clearl=
y came down on the side of working families who were trying to save for r=
etirement. I think the same could be said of -- at least a similar story =
could be told when it comes to implementing Wall Street reform; that impl=
ementing regulations as a result of Wall Street reform was the source of =
significant conflict between Wall Street lobbyists and a Democratic admin=
istration that's committed to fighting for working families.=20



 And I think by just about any measure, time and time again, as Wall Stre=
et reform got implemented, we were faithful to the commitment that this P=
resident made to make sure that taxpayers would not be on the hook for ba=
iling out big banks when they made risky bets, and to make sure that midd=
le-class families had an independent representative in Washington who was=
 looking out for them.



 So I think when it comes to this administrations track record of rebuffi=
ng the efforts of lobbyists and staying true to the commitments that have=
 been made by this President to working families, our batting average is =
quite high.

 Q The U.N. Human Rights Office said today that they're considering filin=
g a complaint over the Flint water contamination crisis. They said it rai=
ses human rights issues that this wouldnt have happened in a predominantl=
y white neighborhood. Is the White House aware of this development? And d=
o you have any reaction to it?=20



 MR. EARNEST: I have seen those reports. There are a number of -- there a=
re at least a couple of independent investigations that are ongoing right=
 now, taking a look at what contributed to this crisis. So Ive refrained =
from talking at much length about accountability.=20



 There have been a couple of findings that have already been released by =
people, like the Michigan attorney general and the independent blue-ribbo=
n commission that was established by the Michigan governor, who did raise=
 concerns about the conduct of state regulators. But the independent inve=
stigations are ongoing, and so I think it would be premature for me to ta=
lk a whole lot about the Presidents view of accountability in this instan=
ce.



 Q In general, is the President concerned that this happened in a poorer =
community and that that might have contributed to the problem?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again -- look, I think the President is concerned tha=
t there was a failure on the part of government officials to ensure that =
the people of Flint were protected. And there is a lot of work that's gon=
e into determining exactly how and why that happened. That work is ongoin=
g. But I think the fact that something like this happened in a community =
that is so economically disadvantaged is something that troubles the Pres=
ident.=20



 Q If I could go back to Trump for just one quick moment. The President s=
aid yesterday he doesn't think Trump is equipped to handle the challenges=
 of this office, the presidency. What exactly did he mean by that?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has himself said before that he=
 does not expect that the American people are likely to choose him to be =
the next President. So I think the President was merely repeating that be=
lief.



 Q Its not the same thing, though, really. I mean, it sounds like hes say=
ing hes not smart enough or doesn't have the capacity to deal with the ch=
allenges of the office. That's different from saying I don't think hell g=
et elected.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think that the President is referring to the judgme=
nt that ultimately the American people will have to make. But in terms of=
 elaborating on his comments in the television interview yesterday, Ill l=
et him do that if he chooses to do so.



 Olivier.



 Q Thanks, Josh. The President has now given the green light for the U.S.=
 deployment to Syria to grow to about 500 special operators. At what poin=
t does that deployment in Syria meet the Presidents definition of endurin=
g offensive combat operations?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Olivier, weve used that phrase to describe the kind of mili=
tary strategy that was employed in the context of the first invasion of I=
raq, back in 2003. And I think any impartial evaluation of the strategy t=
hat President Obama has employed to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL w=
ould reveal that our strategy is a lot different.



 One way you can take a look at that is that when President Obama took of=
fice, there were 144,000 U.S. servicemembers on the ground in Iraq. The n=
umber now on the ground in Iraq is 4,000 or 5,000 -- a small fraction of =
the footprint that was ordered by the previous President in the context o=
f the invasion of Iraq.



 Our strategy is predicated on building the capacity of local forces on t=
he ground to fight for their own country. The situation in Syria is obvio=
usly somewhat more challenging because we do not have a central governmen=
t with whom we can partner. So the United States has been working with ou=
r coalition partners to build up the capacity of Syrian forces on the gro=
und, and these often are forces that are drawn largely from the countrysi=
de, but have proved to be effective in taking the fight to ISIL.



 Now, their effectiveness has been greatly enhanced by U.S. servicemember=
s who have offered them some advice and assistance on the ground. Our coa=
lition partners have been involved in the effort to train some of these f=
ighters, and these fighters have been backed by airstrikes that have made=
 it easier for them to operate effectively on the ground against ISIL. So=
 there is a lot that the United States can do to support these Syrian fig=
hters, but ultimately its these Syrian fighters who are responsible for c=
ombatting ISIL and for providing for the security situation in their own =
part of the country.



 The point is, that is a very different mission than the deployment of th=
ousands of U.S. troops on the ground who are responsible for seeking out =
and directly engaging the enemy. That is not the mission of the much smal=
ler number of forces on the ground in Syria.



 Q But my understanding is that this was never -- I mean, the definition =
-- the wording you have in your AUMF proposal implies time; it doesnt imp=
ly scale, right? "Enduring," to me, suggests that theres some amount of t=
ime after which it has endured, it has lasted. Youre answering with scale=
. I understand that these are different missions. I well remember the lar=
ge-scale deployment in Iraq. Im just curious about -- so theres no time e=
lement? Theres no -- they could be in there years and it wouldnt count as=
 an enduring operation?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the reference to "enduring" is a reference to=
 the idea of an enduring presence on the ground -- the building of bases,=
 a large physical presence on the ground. So thats why I do think this no=
tion of the time commitment and the number of troops involved are not unr=
elated.



 Richard.



 Q Id like to go back to Secretary Carters comments on the formation of a=
 NATO ground force that would be put in Balkan States and eventually Pola=
nd. Does the administration seriously fear a Russian military interventio=
n?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Richard, whats true is that the President has long re=
garded NATO as a cornerstone of U.S. national security. This is an allian=
ce that is critical to our national security and is critical to our abili=
ty to advance our interests around the world.



 But NATO is, at its core, a defensive alliance. NATO does not seek a pro=
vocation with Russia. In fact, NATO seeks a cooperative relationship with=
 Russia. Unfortunately, Russia has undertaken a number of provocative act=
s, not the least of which is destabilizing the nation of Ukraine by repea=
tedly violating their territorial integrity.=20



 Now, Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but Ukraine is awfully close to a =
number of NATO countries. And that has unsettled some members of our alli=
ance. And the President has laid out a number of proposals for how the Un=
ited States can reassure our European allies in the face of these Russian=
 provocations.



 So I think the best example of this is actually the budget request that =
was included in the budget proposal that the administration put forward a=
t the beginning of this year. Unfortunately, there hasnt been much discus=
sion of it because Republicans, for the first time in more than 40 years,=
 have refused to even have a hearing to discuss that proposal. Apparently=
 they dont feel like its worth a discussion to discuss what the United St=
ates can and should do to reassure our European allies in the face of Rus=
sian provocation. That is rather unfortunate. So that irresponsible gover=
ning on the part of Republicans notwithstanding, President Obama has demo=
nstrated a serious commitment to our European allies and our NATO allianc=
e. And Im confident that there will be additional detailed discussion of =
what else the United States can do when President Obama travels to Poland=
 in July to meet with our NATO allies.



 Rest assured, while our NATO allies may have some suggestions for what m=
ore the United States can do, the President will arrive with some additio=
nal suggestions about what our European allies can do. The most important=
 of those, I feel confident in saying, is that our European allies can me=
et the commitment that was made a couple of years ago at a previous NATO =
summit where each country committed to spending 2 percent of their GDP on=
 national defense. If every country thats a member of our alliance invest=
s sufficiently in their own defense capabilities, that will have the effe=
ct of enhancing the national security of all of the nations that weve col=
lectively pledged to defend if they come under attack.



 Q How would you answer to Russias perception that NATO is feeding into t=
he Cold War minding with bringing troops, like concrete troops on the gro=
und close to their borders?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I would answer that question by beginning whe=
re I began my last answer, which is making clear that NATO is the corners=
tone of U.S. national security, but the NATO alliance is, at its core, a =
defensive one. NATO seeks no provocation. NATO is not seeking to antagoni=
ze any other country or any other alliance. NATO was formed to ensure for=
 the collective defense of the members of our alliance. The President tak=
es the U.S. commitments to that alliance quite seriously.=20



The United States has invested robustly in our defense capabilities. The =
United States military works on a daily basis with our allies and partner=
s in Europe to ensure that we can effectively operate together to confron=
t shared threats. And that interoperability, that ability to coordinate a=
nd share information is critical to our national security and critical to=
 the national security of our allies. Thats why the President is seeking =
to increase the resources that are dedicated to that effort. We would wel=
come congressional attention and support for that commitment, because it =
is, after all, critical to the national security of the United States. Bu=
t it should not in any way signal to anybody a change in NATOs orientatio=
n of being a defensive alliance.



 Q Very last question, Josh. You referred to the Russian provocation in U=
kraine. Is it still the idea of bringing troops and reassuring allies and=
 having a defensive position, isnt it in anyway somehow an acknowledgemen=
t of the limits or even the inefficiency of the sanctions that have been =
put on Russia for the last two years without concrete results? Even if yo=
ull -- Im sure youre going to come up with saying, oh, the ruble is going=
 down, and the economy is slowing down. Still, I mean, you need to send t=
roops to reassure the neighbors of Russia to show that they can feel secu=
re.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, what is true is that the United States and our Europe=
an allies have been able to coordinate effectively by imposing sanctions =
and imposing costs on Russia for their destabilizing activities inside of=
 Ukraine.



 Q And the impact?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the impact has been negative when it comes to their e=
conomy. I read a story in the New York Times either today or yesterday ta=
lking about the significant economic challenges that are facing Russia. N=
ow, a significant chunk of that economic weakness is a result of falling =
energy prices, but Russias ability to respond -- or the ability of the Ru=
ssian economy to adapt to those weaknesses in the energy sector have been=
 constrained by these sanctions.



 So there have been costs that have been imposed on Russia. Thus far, Pre=
sident Putin has been willing to bear those costs. But as the New York Ti=
mes points out, the cost to the Russian economy and the impact that it ha=
s on the Russian government is not insignificant.=20



 But, yes, it has not -- I would acknowledge some part of your question, =
which is we have not yet seen the change in strategy that wed hope for. A=
nd theres still time for President Putin to make that decision, to change=
 his strategy in Ukraine to abide by the commitments that his country has=
 made in the context of the Minsk talks. And if hes willing to follow thr=
ough on those commitments, President Obama has made clear literally from =
day one that the United States would be prepared to relax those sanctions=
 as soon as Russia demonstrates a commitment to fulfilling the commitment=
s that they made in the Minsk talks. The President delivered that stateme=
nt on the very day that the Minsk talks were -- or that the sanctions wer=
e imposed.



 So weve been very clear about what our strategy is thus far. It has had =
an economic impact. It has not yet resulted in the kind of strategic chan=
ge on the ground that wed like to see, but every day that goes by, the ef=
fect of the sanctions becomes tougher and more concentrated. So its Presi=
dent Putin here that has to make a decision.



 And at the same time, yes, the United States is committed to ramping up =
our investment where necessary to demonstrate to our NATO allies that the=
 attention of the United States has not lingered or wandered, and that th=
e United States takes very seriously our investment and our commitment to=
 the mutual defense of our NATO allies.



 Ron.



 Q For all the wording about the Iraq mission, is the bottom line now tha=
t the American public should expect that theres a much higher likelihood =
of more casualties?



 MR. EARNEST: Ron, whats been true from the very beginning is that our se=
rvicemembers serving in Iraq are doing dangerous things. They are putting=
 themselves in harms way for our national security. Their ability to offe=
r support, training, advice, and assistance to Iraqi forces on the ground=
 in Iraq is critical to our strategy for degrading and ultimately destroy=
ing ISIL.



 Now, weve gone to great lengths to try to describe with precision exactl=
y what their mission is. Our men and women on the ground in Iraq do not h=
ave a combat mission, but they do have a dangerous mission to operate in =
a dangerous country, to support Iraqi forces who are taking the fight to =
ISIL in their own country.



 Q So the number now is about 4,000 or 5,000 or so.



 MR. EARNEST: Thats correct, its just over 4,000, I believe.



 Q How many of those 4,000 are in this position of greater danger now as =
the tempo of the mission increases, or however you want to describe it --=
 now that things have changed in the last month or so and the pace of ope=
rations has picked up? Is it a smaller -- a few hundred? Or is it most of=
 these 5,000, or 4,000 or so?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think for a detailed breakdown of this, Id refer yo=
u to the Pentagon. They can sort of give you the best assessment here.=20=




 What I know to be true is that our forces are moving around quite a bit.=
 And so there are times where they will -- based on the new authority tha=
t the President has given, that the Commander-in-Chief has given to our t=
roops, that some of them are now even operating down to the battalion lev=
el. And that's dangerous work.



 This individual who unfortunately was killed today in northern Iraq was =
operating about two miles behind this line that was maintained by Iraqi f=
orces just north of Mosul. So I think that's a pretty good illustration o=
f whats happening. He was not on the front lines, but he was two miles wa=
y, and it turns out that being two miles away from the front lines betwee=
n Iraqi forces and ISIL is a very dangerous place to be.



 Q This is a fairly intense battle that went on for some time -- airstrik=
es and so forth.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, its not uncommon for U.S. airstrikes to be summoned o=
n very short notice to try to provide for force protection. That's exactl=
y what happened here. So I wouldnt describe -- I wouldnt quibble with tha=
t description that this was an intense situation. But its not an uncommon=
 one.



 Q Right. But I guess the concern, the perception is that, again, not try=
ing to go back to the words the President may have uttered so many, many =
months ago that things have changed, but I think the public is just tryin=
g to understand exactly what our troops are doing there, and to what exte=
nt we are involved in combat, war, danger, high likelihood of fatalities,=
 or this much more benign-sounding train-and-assist posture.



 MR. EARNEST: I don't mean to make it sound benign because its not. Its d=
angerous. What I am trying to do, though, is trying to be as precise as p=
ossible with you and the American public about what exactly our Commander=
-in-Chief has asked our servicemembers to do.=20



 Secretary Carter earlier today described this death as a combat death. T=
hat's accurate. This was an individual who was not in a combat mission, b=
ut he was in a dangerous place. And his position came under attack. He wa=
s armed, trained, and prepared to defend himself. Unfortunately, he was k=
illed. And he was killed in combat. But that was not part of his mission.=
 His mission was specifically to offer advice and assistance to those Ira=
qi forces that were fighting for their own country.=20



 Q And all that is still in keeping with what the President said to the p=
ublic about what we would be doing in Iraq?=20



 MR. EARNEST: It is precisely in line with the way that the President has=
 described what our strategy is. And I know that I keep going back to thi=
s, but its the best way that I can think of to try to describe to you and=
 to the American people exactly whats happening.=20



 The mission that our men and women in Iraq have right now is different t=
han the mission that our servicemembers had during the 2003 invasion of I=
raq. In 2003, there was a combat operation, forces on the ground -- U.S. =
forces on the ground -- that were given the mission to go and seek out an=
d engage the enemy in combat.



 Tens of thousands -- and at its peak, more than 100,000 -- U.S. forces w=
ere given that mission. This mission is much different. We're talking abo=
ut 4,000 U.S. servicemembers. Their mission is a dangerous one, but it is=
 one that is predicated on building up the capacity of Iraqi forces to go=
 and take the fight to ISIL.



I think this might be a relevant point for me to highlight one other thin=
g, which is that we have seen the performance of Iraqi security forces on=
 the ground improve. And despite the tragic news that we received earlier=
 today, the last several days have been characterized by important progre=
ss that's been made by Iraqi security forces.



Let me just describe a couple of them to you right now. In just the last =
couple of days, Iraqi forces retook Bashir, in Kirkuk province. These Ira=
qi -- or another contingent of Iraqi forces have succeeded in pushing ISI=
L out of Hit. And another contingent, a separate contingent of Iraqi forc=
es are continuing to apply pressure to ISIL terrorists in and around Hadi=
tha. If Iraqi forces are successful in finally pushing ISIL out of the vi=
cinity of Haditha, they will have effectively cleared ISIL terrorists out=
 of the Euphrates River Valley. This will be an important strategic gain.=




All of that progress that Iraqi forces made on the ground against ISIL fi=
ghters was only possible because of the important support that they have =
received from the United States and our coalition partners. That came in =
the form of training before they even took the battlefield. In some cases=
, that took the form of U.S. forces offering advice and assistance. And i=
n each of these cases, Im told, they were backed by U.S. and coalition mi=
litary airpower. So this is evidence, Ron, that we're making important pr=
ogress.=20



 But its also undeniable that the small number -- the relatively small nu=
mber of U.S. servicemembers that are involved in these operations are not=
 in combat, but they are in a dangerous place.



 Q And the President -- just to clarify, he says that Mosul will be recap=
tured by the end of the year?



 MR. EARNEST: What the President has said is that Iraqi forces are hoping=
 to be successful enough that they could lay the conditions for the succe=
ssful retaking of Mosul by the end of the year.



 Q (Inaudible.)



 MR. EARNEST: Correct, correct. And theres -- and to be clear about that,=
 there is still a lot of important work that needs to be done to lay the =
groundwork for that. So we're a ways away from accomplishing that part.



 Q And just to clarify on the Flint situation, does the President think t=
he water in Flint is now safe for the residents to drink?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, most importantly its the EPA that has done extensive =
testing. And what they have concluded is that filtered water in Flint is =
safe to drink. And that's the advice that they have shared with the publi=
c, and that's certainly the advice that the President believes the public=
 should follow.



 Q Only the filtered water, not water straight out of the tap?



 MR. EARNEST: That's my understanding that the situation on the ground in=
 Flint is that -- what the EPA has communicated to the public in Flint is=
 that filtered tap water in Flint is safe to drink and safe to use for ot=
her purposes like cooking and bathing and those other basic activities.=20=




 Kevin.



 Q Thank you, Josh. Can you give me the latest numbers on Gitmo detainees=
 and any news that you might have about possible transfers coming out?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have any news to make about potential transfers at =
this point. The most recent transfer was the transfer of nine individuals=
 from the prison at Guantanamo Bay to Saudi Arabia. That was a transfer t=
hat occurred shortly before the President traveled to Saudi Arabia. And I=
 believe that that brought the number down below 90. So I think it's in t=
he low eighties now, but we can get you the precise number after the brie=
fing.



 Q I asked you yesterday about the 28 pages of the congressional 9/11 rep=
ort, and we just had a bit of a conversation about the fact that the Pres=
ident has a great deal of material that he reads on a daily basis, and ce=
rtainly I think the American public understands that. But I think there's=
 still a curiosity, given the interest in those 28 pages and given its re=
levance, especially to such an important event in American history, that =
it would seem to me to be the President's responsibility to take a look a=
t that. He's not an incurious person. So I'm just wondering, from that pe=
rspective, would he not then read the 28 pages? Have you had a conversati=
on with him about that? I'm sure he's been reading the news reports as we=
ll.



 MR. EARNEST: The President has been reading the news reports, and the Pr=
esident has been briefed on the contents of those 28 pages. But as has be=
en described by people like Director Brennan and by the leaders of the 9/=
11 Commission, that those 28 pages are essentially unvetted law enforceme=
nt and investigative materials. So the President -- I think as is common =
for most people -- is mostly interested in the conclusions. And that's wh=
y the President has looked at the 9/11 Commission report, and the 9/11 co=
mmissioners have indicated that they were able to review the 28 pages and=
 follow up on the leads that were contained therein.=20



They conducted investigations and interviews -- not just in the United St=
ates, but even overseas -- to ensure they were running down the leads tha=
t were presented in those 28 pages. And the conclusion that they reached =
is that even after conducting those interviews, and even after following =
up on the leads that were included there, that they did not find any evid=
ence that the Saudi government as an institution had been supportive of t=
he 9/11 terrorists.



 Q So is he not curious to read them for himself?



 MR. EARNEST: The President basically feels he has sufficient information=
 about what's included in the 28 pages, based on the briefings that he ha=
s received and based on the conclusions that were reached by the 9/11 Com=
mission that has made those conclusions public.



 Q Any update on the nomination of Rhett Jepson over at the Mint?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of the status of that specific nomination, bu=
t we can certainly look into it and get back to you.



 Q Okay, and last one. I wanted to ask you again about the difference bet=
ween combat and advising and assisting. I think, if I'm understanding you=
 correctly, if I were to put them side by side on a full screen, they're =
both in combat. One has a combat mission; one does not. Is that the best =
way I can describe the difference between what you're suggesting -- which=
 is, previously American forces had a combat mission and were in combat, =
and now they're in a combat but they dont have combat mission.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the way that I would describe it to you is th=
at individuals who are in a train, advise and assist mission are equipped=
 for combat. They've been trained for combat. And the reason for that is,=
 simply, they're in a dangerous place. In some cases, they're just a coup=
le of miles behind the front lines.=20



And in this tragic situation in northern Iraq that transpired earlier tod=
ay, you had an individual who was not in a combat mission come under with=
ering attack from enemy forces. He was in a combat situation. He was prep=
ared to deal with. But unfortunately, under a complex attack, he was kill=
ed. And it's tragic. And it is a testament to the bravery and courage and=
 sacrifice not just of this individual, who gave his life for his country=
, but for the 4,000 other U.S. servicemembers who are operating every day=
 in Iraq. They are not in a combat mission, but they are in a dangerous s=
ituation and they're in a dangerous place fighting for our country and fi=
ghting for our security.=20



And the President does not make decisions about deploying them into those=
 circumstances lightly. The President has been conscientious about making=
 sure that our strategy is sound. And I just described to Ron exactly wha=
t impact these brave servicemembers are having in building up the capacit=
y of local forces in Iraq to take the fight to ISIL in their own country.=
 So this is a strategy that involves our men and women in uniform, assumi=
ng greater personal risk. They do that for our country, and we are indebt=
ed to them. But this strategy has yielded important progress. In Iraq alo=
ne, with the support of U.S. servicemembers, Iraqi forces have retaken ab=
out 40 percent of the populated areas that ISIL previously controlled. Th=
at is notable progress. That is making America safer. That would not be p=
ossible without the bravery and heroism of American servicemembers.



But what I have tried to do and what the President has tried to do is to =
be as precise as possible in describing to you and to the American people=
 exactly what mission the Commander-in-Chief has asked our servicemembers=
 to carry out.



Q If I can follow really quickly on number -- 4,000 to 5,000 Americans, g=
ive or take. Do you have a sense of how many Iraqi forces are fighting fo=
r their country?



MR. EARNEST: I dont have an update on that, but I think the Department of=
 Defense can give you some kind of -- at least a ballpark estimate of the=
 number of Iraqi forces that we're working with.



Toluse.



Q On the Syria cessation, the Russian foreign minister said earlier today=
 that we're hours away from a new ceasefire in Aleppo. I'm wondering, doe=
s the White House -- does the U.S. government share that optimism about a=
 potential new cessation? And will the President be calling President Put=
in to talk about how to bring that about?



MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any phone call that is planned at this poin=
t. If a phone call like that occurs, then we'll let you know. I dont have=
 any announcements to make about a deal that's been reached or a deal tha=
t's being prepared to an announcement. If an agreement like that has been=
 reached, then we'll obviously want to announce that in advance, as well,=
 so people know that there's a ceasefire to abide by.=20



Right now, we're in the phase of working with the U.N. to try to bring bo=
th the opposition and the regime back in line with the commitments that t=
hey made in the context of a cessation of hostilities. When that was init=
ially implemented, it was more successful than we previously expected. Bu=
t we have seen it start to fray in some areas, particularly in and around=
 Aleppo. And that's why we're seeking to refresh our efforts in that regi=
on of the country. And we've made clear, both directly and through our pa=
rtners and allies, that it's important for both the government and for op=
position fighters to live up to their commitments.



Q They said it was more successful than previously expected, and the Pres=
ident said that it lasted longer than he thought it would. So what was th=
e original goal? Was the goal that during this five or six weeks that the=
 President thought it would last, that a political transition would have =
been able to get solidified? I mean, it seems like a short period of time=
 to think that if the cessation is only going to last for a couple of wee=
ks, that it will make a major difference --



MR. EARNEST: That's a totally fair question. There are two goals that we =
had in mind. The first was the provision of humanitarian assistance. Whil=
e the fighting was raging, before the implementation of cessation of host=
ilities, there were communities that were essentially cut off from the ou=
tside world. And that prevented the delivery of basic supplies, like food=
, water, medicine. And in the context -- when the cessation of hostilitie=
s was implemented, we did see important progress made in terms of the del=
ivery of humanitarian assistance. And I have some statistics about that, =
if that's useful to you.



There are about 57 humanitarian assistance convoys that have been mobiliz=
ed by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent since February 14th. That includes abo=
ut 700 trucks delivering life-saving assistance to about 678,000 people 2=
3 hard-to-reach and besieged locations.=20



 In addition to that, the U.N. World Food Program conducted about 16 aird=
rops that delivered about 284 metric tons of food assistance to about 100=
,000 people in one particular community in Syria. That was an airdrop tha=
t occurred at the end of April -- or there was a series of airdrops that =
occurred at the end of April. So that is evidence that the cessation of h=
ostilities did create space for that kind of humanitarian relief to be de=
livered.



 The second goal is that opposition figures had essentially said its very=
 difficult for us to participate in any form of political negotiations wh=
ile our constituents are being slaughtered by the government. And the goa=
l of the cessation of hostilities was to get both sides to hold their fir=
e against each other, because the cessation of hostilities did not apply =
to extremist groups like Nusra or ISIL. But if the cessation of hostiliti=
es could be successful in getting both sides to hold their fire, that mig=
ht build in some momentum into political talks.



 And there were a series of political talks that were convened while the =
cessation of hostilities was in effect. But there was a pause that was ta=
ken in those talks as we saw the cessation of hostilities begin to fray. =
And so our hope is that by refreshing the cessation of hostilities in tho=
se areas where we saw fraying, we can give another boost to the ongoing p=
olitical negotiations. I dont think anybody expects that those political =
negotiations would be completed in just a couple of weeks, but we are hop=
ing that those talks can build a little momentum so that they can make mo=
re progress than they have thus far in bringing about the political trans=
ition that everybody acknowledges is necessary.



 Q And one on the Iraqi security forces. Is there any concern that since =
ISIL was able to sort of break through this checkpoint and get two miles =
-- basically have a casualty two miles away, that the security forces may=
 not be as effective as they should be in fighting on the frontlines?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, as I detailed to Ron, there are a number of areas whe=
re weve made important progress just in the last few days. So we have see=
n the performance of Iraqi security forces improve dramatically in just t=
he last 18 months. There are important reasons for that. The first is, th=
e Iraqi security forces have gotten important equipment from the United S=
tates and our coalition partners; theyve essentially been resupplied. The=
 United States and our coalition partners have undertaken extensive train=
ing operations to enhance the fighting ability of Iraqi security forces. =
And since the beginning of the campaign, the United States and our coalit=
ion partners have carried out about 12,000 airstrikes, I believe is the l=
atest number.



 Many of those airstrikes were conducted in support of operations on the =
ground, and those airstrikes have greatly enhanced the performance of Ira=
qi security forces on the ground. So weve seen a steady improvement, and =
thats the reason that you have seen ISIL driven out of 40 percent of the =
populated territory that they previously controlled. So we are pleased wi=
th the improvements that weve seen over the last 18 months or so.=20



And I will say the other thing that has been a welcome development is a m=
ore consistent commitment on the part of Iraqi security forces to be will=
ing to defend their country. And that was called into question when ISIL =
made their rapid advance across the Iraqi desert. There was a sense that =
many Iraqi forces were not willing to fight for their country. But the re=
silience and commitment of Iraqi security forces has also been enhanced. =
Thats led to their improved performance. It also has led to an improvemen=
t in terms of what their prospects are likely to be moving forward.



 Mark.



 Q Back on Detroit. Can you say if the White House supports the actions t=
he teachers there are taking?



 MR. EARNEST: What I can say is that the Education Secretary has been the=
 administration official most directly involved in encouraging both sides=
 to resolve the situation. Obviously when you have now two days in a row =
where school kids in Detroit are not going to school, thats a significant=
 problem thats going to have a broader economic impact. The parents are g=
oing to have to stay home to take care of their kids who would otherwise =
be in school. It raises some public-safety issues. There are some parents=
 who may not be able to stay home with their kids, and those kids are now=
 operating or moving around unsupervised.=20



To say nothing of the most important thing, which is these kids arent get=
ting educated, and that is a real problem, and one that the President is =
deeply concerned about. And the administration is prepared to do whatever=
 we can to encourage both sides to come to an agreement that can put teac=
hers and, most importantly, students back in the classroom.



 Q But is the administration urging the teachers to end their sickout?



 MR. EARNEST: I think what were urging both teachers and local officials =
to do is to resolve their differences so that kids can get back to school=
.



 Q Is this a subject the President might mention in his teacher remarks t=
oday?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont know at this point, but stay tuned.



 Megan.



 Q Thank you, Josh.



 MR. EARNEST: Nice to see you.



 Q Yesterday, an independent think tank, IHS, reported that the tempo and=
 intensity of ISIS operations in Iraq and Syria has actually been increas=
ing over the past three months. Attack figures for the first quarter of 2=
016 were the highest since ISIS took Mosul in 2014. The past quarter also=
 saw the highest number of fatalities since the second quarter of 2015. S=
o how do you square those figures with the administrations argument and t=
he argument that youve been making that ISIS is on the retreat in Iraq?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I havent seen the study, so its hard for me to direct=
ly rebut it. But I would at least posit that some of those statistics are=
 a direct result of ISIL encountering much greater pressure from Iraqi se=
curity forces than they have before.



 Theres a reason that ISIL has lost control of 40 percent of the territor=
y in populated areas that they used to previously control. Thats because =
the Iraqi security forces on the ground are applying significant pressure=
 to drive them out of those areas. So thats at least part of the equation=
.



 But Ill have to get back to you if theres a more specific answer that we=
 can give to help you understand those numbers.



 Q Will the assessment -- and I guess the assessment that ISIS is in retr=
eat -- how often is that being assessed? Will it be adjusted at all?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President is getting regular updates from his mil=
itary commanders that includes input from people who are on the ground, s=
eeing firsthand exactly whats happening there. The President meets every =
two or three weeks with his national security team to review the progress=
 that weve made against ISIL, and the President regularly gets battlefiel=
d assessments -- not just in the context of those meetings, but in someti=
mes even in the context of the presidential daily briefing that he begins=
 his day with. So this is something that were regularly looking at the si=
tuation on the ground and assessing the impact of the strategies and tact=
ics that we have used to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.



 But based on the 40 percent figure that I cited before, based on those a=
reas around Bashir and Hit and Haditha, where we have seen Iraqi forces m=
ake progress just in the last few days, that continues to build our confi=
dence in our ability to continue to pressure ISIL. And when I say our, Im=
 using that word intentionally, because Im not just talking about the Uni=
ted States -- Im talking about the Iraqi forces that are on the frontline=
s of this fight, and theyre backed by the United States and our coalition=
 partners that are committed to their success.



 Q So was it a surprise to hear that -- for the President to hear that IS=
IS fighters were on the attack, got two miles beyond the frontlines, and =
killed this U.S. Navy SEAL?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously whats happened in the context of this incid=
ent is very tragic and it does underscore how dangerous the situation is =
there, and it underscores the risk that our servicemembers are taking to =
protect our national security.



 But look, I think there is always a danger of drawing minute-by-minute c=
onclusions about whats happening on the battlefield in the context of a l=
ong-term military campaign. The President talked about this from the very=
 beginning -- that there would be important progress that we would enjoy =
and there would be periods of setback. And that has been true for the las=
t almost two years now, and Im confident that will be true moving forward=
.



 I think recently theres no denying -- this terrible tragedy notwithstand=
ing -- that we made important progress recently. And we are hoping that b=
y working with our coalition partners and by providing additional advice =
and assistance and additional equipment to Iraqi forces, we can help them=
 build additional momentum and build additional pressure on ISIL terroris=
ts in their country.



 Q And while the President is on the ground in Michigan, will he be addre=
ssing the Detroit teachers concerns there at all? Do you expect that hell=
 raise that issue with the governor when he speaks with the governor?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't know if the President will raise this with the gove=
rnor, but well try and get you a readout of their conversations.=20



All right, well do one or two more. Taka.=20



 Q Hey, Josh. North Korea announced its Workers' Party congress will begi=
n this Friday. So do you expect theyll announce any new policy direction?=
 Also, do you also expect theyll conduct another nuclear test before its =
party congress?=20



 MR. EARNEST: At this point I would refrain from hazarding a guess or off=
ering up any predictions about what the North Korean regime may do. Their=
 track record of provocative actions and destabilizing activities on the =
Korean Peninsula is lengthy. And there has been a troubling, increasing f=
requency of those provocative acts just in the first few months of this y=
ear.



 The United States remains committed to working with the international co=
mmunity to further isolate North Korea in an attempt to persuade them to =
abandon those tactics. The United States is certainly committed to the sa=
fety and security of our allies in South Korea and Japan. And our commitm=
ent to our allies will not waver.



 Q On Japan, you say there is no update about President Obamas trip to po=
ssible Hiroshima. But just in case -- I wanted to ask the question today =
-- if the President is considering to make a speech when he goes to Japan=
?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates in terms of the Presidents itinera=
ry when he travels to Japan. Well certainly keep you posted if any stops =
are added beyond the Presidents visit to the G7 meeting there later this =
month.



 Q Mrs. Obama is also going to Japan with the President?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't believe that she is planning to accompany him on th=
is trip.



 Jared, Ill give you the last one.



 Q Thanks, Josh. After the Presidents interviews yesterday on the Supreme=
 Court, does the White House consider it a victory either if Merrick Garl=
and -- if Chief Judge Merrick Garland is given a hearing? Or barring that=
, as Senate Republicans seem to be wont to do, to make Republicans pay a =
political price for it in November?



 MR. EARNEST: Jared, our goal here is to confirm Merrick Garland to the S=
upreme Court. He is the most experienced nominee in terms of his 19 years=
 on the federal bench than any other Supreme Court nominee in American hi=
story. That experience I think is an indication that he is more than prep=
ared to assume the significant responsibilities associated with a lifetim=
e appointment to the Supreme Court.



 Over his 19-year career, he has established a strong track record of int=
erpreting the law and not using his position to advance a political agend=
a. I think for all of the acrimonious charges and counter-charges that ar=
e traded back and forth between Democrats and Republicans, that principle=
 I think is something that does enjoy bipartisan support.



 Chief Judge Garland also enjoys bipartisan support, by the way. I think =
that's why many Republicans -- at least one high-profile Republican -- ha=
s acknowledged that he is a consensus nominee. We just need to see Republ=
icans actually do their job and step up to the plate and fulfill their co=
nstitutional responsibilities. And that is to give Chief Judge Garland a =
hearing and a vote. After all, to deny him a hearing or a vote would be t=
he first time that any Supreme Court nominee has been denied a hearing or=
 a vote since 1875 -- 1875.



 So what Republicans are preparing to do and have begun to do is an unpre=
cedented escalation of partisanship. And I don't think the American peopl=
e are pleased about that because the expectations, when it comes to the S=
upreme Court, is that constitutional responsibilities and a commitment to=
 justice and fairness and equality all ahead of politics is what people w=
ant from their Congress. But its not what they're getting from this set o=
f Republicans in Congress.



 Q Josh, as you so often remind us, you're not a spokesman for any those =
other entities, just for the White House. So what Im asking you is, is it=
 the White Houses position that barring hearings, votes, et cetera for Me=
rrick Garland is, as you said, and I think you alluded to it in the answe=
r, but I didn't really get an answer to my original question, which was: =
If you're saying its up to the American people, and they're not happy abo=
ut it, is that the White Houses essentially backup plan to say that makin=
g Republicans pay a political price for this, as you say, unprecedented, =
as the President has said unprecedented position -- is that what the Whit=
e House is seeking to do? It certainly seems that way given the President=
s stance on both official and political events.



 MR. EARNEST: Theres no backup plan. There is only one goal, and that's t=
o confirm Chief Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. And that's th=
e reason that we're engaged in this effort.



 Now, what is true is that there is ample public data out there that migh=
t lead one to conclude that if Republicans do refuse to do their job, tha=
t voters may have something to say about that. But ultimately --=20



 Q So the White House is agnostic as to whether voters should -- I mean, =
it can't be true that the White House is agnostic that voters should or s=
houldnt judge Republicans on this issue.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think whether or not we want it to be true, it is c=
lear from that data that the American public -- and Im not just talking a=
bout Democrats, Im not even just talking about independents -- there is a=
mple data to indicate that Republican voters are uncomfortable with the p=
osition that Republican senators have taken to not do their job.



 I think some of that stems from the explanation that we've heard from a =
lot of Republicans senators. Republicans senators, when confronted with t=
he fact that they have a constitutional obligation to uphold, have said t=
hat they're not going to do that because Senator Mitch McConnell, the Rep=
ublican leader in the Senate, has told them not to.=20



 I don't even think Republicans think that's a good explanation. And agai=
n, I think individual voters are going to have to decide for themselves h=
ow and whether they're going to hold their representatives to the United =
States Senate accountable to for their actions in the Senate.=20



 But what is clear right now is that the position that Republican senator=
s have taken in refusing to do their job puts them on the wrong side of t=
his issue in the view of the vast majority of Americans in both parties.



 Q Should we take your hesitation to embrace this as a political issue th=
at the President wont be campaigning on this eventually when he gets more=
 on the stump when theres a Democratic nominee? Is he going to stand down=
 and not take a position that this is an issue that voters should care ab=
out in the next few months?



 MR. EARNEST: First of all, I do anticipate that at some point this year,=
 the President will be campaigning in support of Senate Democrats, includ=
ing individual Senate Democratic -- including individual Democratic candi=
dates for the United States Senate. And, yes, this is entirely a relevant=
 issue. It certainly --=20



 Q Its entirely relevant?



 MR. EARNEST: This is an entirely relevant issue. But individual voters a=
re ultimately going to have to decide for themselves exactly whether or n=
ot this is going to affect which candidate they support. If this does hav=
e an impact on their vote, Republican senators are in trouble. Because ag=
ain, the polls indicate that in many states even a majority of Republican=
s are concerned about this position that Republican senators have taken -=
- again, primarily because of the explanation.



 Voters in states all across the country didn't send their representative=
s in Congress to go and do what Mitch McConnell told them to do. They sen=
t their representatives to go there and fulfill their constitutional duty=
 and represent the interests of their constituents. And I think most peop=
le believe that their interests are best represented when the Supreme Cou=
rt of the United States has the full complement of justices.=20



 All right? Thanks, everybody.=20

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Good aft=
ernoon, everybody.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll just do a quick statement at the top an=
d then we&#8217;ll get to your questions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you all know, the Presid=
ent will travel to Flint, Michigan tomorrow.&nbsp; He will stop first at th=
e Food Bank of Eastern Michigan to receive a briefing on the response of th=
e crisis from federal officials and members of the Unified
 Command group.&nbsp; The food bank has helped more than 300,000 people in =
the last year, and it has become a critical hub in the response to the cris=
is.&nbsp; The facility coordinates the intake of basic supplies like water =
and food, and packages meals and hygienic
 products for distribution to the community.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President will then tak=
e part in a neighborhood roundtable discussion, where he will hear from Fli=
nt residents dealing firsthand with the impact of the crisis.&nbsp; The Pre=
sident will also deliver remarks to a crowd of about a thousand
 people at Northwestern High School, which is located in predominantly Afri=
can American North Flint.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the direction of Preside=
nt Obama, a wide variety of federal agencies have been on the front lines r=
esponding to this crisis.&nbsp; FEMA has distributed more than 9 million li=
ters of water and 50,000 water filters.&nbsp; Medicaid coverage
 has been expanded to everyone under the age of 21 in Flint.&nbsp; HHS has =
extended funding to expand capacity at Head Start centers and community hea=
lth care centers in Flint.&nbsp; The EPA has surged resources to significan=
tly expand water testing and to offer addition
 technical advice as needed.&nbsp; And agencies like SBA and HUD have stepp=
ed up their support to the community that&#8217;s weathering a pretty signi=
ficant economic fallout from the crisis as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the President noted in h=
is letter last week to Mari Copeny, known around town as &#8220;Little Miss=
 Flint,&#8221; Flint residents need to know that when the cameras are gone,=
 the administration&#8217;s support for the state and local response effort=
s
 will continue.&nbsp; And the President looks forward to meeting with Mari =
and her family while he is in Flint tomorrow, as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all of that &#8211;- <=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What ab=
out the governor?&nbsp; Any meeting?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I do ant=
icipate that the President will have an opportunity to visit with the gover=
nor when he&#8217;s in Flint.&nbsp; As is customary, the governor was invit=
ed to greet the President on the tarmac when he arrives.&nbsp; I also under=
stand
 that the governor and the mayor are likely to be included in conversations=
 with those who have been on the frontlines of the response -- this is the =
meeting at the food bank.&nbsp; And I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the Pr=
esident also has an opportunity to visit with
 both the governor and mayor outside the context of that larger meeting as =
well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darlene, do you want to get=
 us started?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, t=
hank you.&nbsp; On the death of the U.S. Navy SEAL in Iraq, is there any re=
action from the President to that, or expression of condolence?&nbsp; And c=
an you tell us when he was informed about that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Darlene,=
 I can tell you that the President has been briefed on this incident, and e=
veryone here at the White House, including the First Family, extends our co=
ndolences to the family of the servicemember that was killed
 today in northern Iraq.&nbsp; This individual is the third U.S. servicemem=
ber killed in action since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve, and=
 this servicemember&#8217;s death reminds us of the risks our brave men and=
 women in uniform face every single day.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Defense h=
as indicated that initial reports are that this servicemember died when ISI=
L terrorists penetrated a checkpoint that was manned by Iraqi forces.&nbsp;=
 Those terrorists, after breaking through the line, went on
 to attack a Peshmerga position, where this U.S. servicemember was advising=
 our partners on the ground.&nbsp; U.S. forces responded right away with ai=
rpower to stop the attack, and our Iraqi partners are engaging the remnants=
 of those forces.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you =
mentioned, this is now the third death of a U.S. servicemember since troops=
 went back to Iraq in 2014.&nbsp; Is this death today any sort of an indica=
tion that U.S. forces are moving closer to the fight against the Islamic St=
ate
 group in Iraq?&nbsp; Are they getting closer to combat and danger?<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think what is true is that Iraq and Syria are dangerous places.&nbsp; And o=
ur men and women in uniform who are engaged in a mission to offer training,=
 advice and assistance to Iraqi forces that are fighting for their
 own country, are doing dangerous work.&nbsp; They are taking grave risks t=
o protect our country and we owe them a deep debt of gratitude.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today&#8217;s incident is a=
 vivid reminder of the risks that our servicemembers are taking.&nbsp; And =
some of them, three of them now, have made the ultimate sacrifice for our c=
ountry.&nbsp; But the President has been clear, time and time again, exactl=
y
 what their mission is.&nbsp; That mission is to support Iraqi forces on th=
e ground who are taking the fight to ISIL on the frontlines.&nbsp; Iraqi fo=
rces must fight for their own country.&nbsp; United States forces cannot be=
 a substitute for those Iraqi forces.&nbsp; The United
 States can use our military firepower.&nbsp; And some of our special opera=
tors, in fact, are offering them important support, but that support comes =
in the form of offering advice and assistance.&nbsp; And this is the core o=
f our strategy, which is to build up the capacity
 of local forces to fight for their own country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have learned important l=
essons in the last decade.&nbsp; We know that the United States will not be=
 successful if it's U.S. troops acting essentially as a substitute for loca=
l forces, fighting for the security situation in Iraq.&nbsp; Iraqi
 security forces must be do that for themselves.&nbsp; They can count on th=
e support of the United States, they can count on the support of the 65 nat=
ions that have signed on to this coalition to degrade and ultimately destro=
y ISIL.&nbsp; This is a fight that the United
 States is committed to because we under the consequences for our national =
security.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, ultimately, it is Iraq=
i forces that are on the frontlines.&nbsp; It&#8217;s Iraqi forces that mus=
t fight for the security situation in their own country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roberta.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.N=
. Syria envoy said today that peace talks could resume if the ceasefire, su=
ch as it is, extends to Aleppo.&nbsp; But the rebels launched a new assault=
 on that city.&nbsp; And so I&#8217;m wondering, does that assault today pr=
event that
 from happening?&nbsp; And where does the administration see any road to a =
diplomatic solution that does not require the kind of more aggressive respo=
nse, U.S. response that some officials and allies in the Gulf have been cal=
ling for?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Roberta,=
 it is true that the United States is concerned by the continued escalation=
 of violence in and around Aleppo.&nbsp; The security situation there, as b=
ad as it&#8217;s been for some time now, is deteriorating.&nbsp; It&#8217;s=
 an indication
 that the cessation of hostilities is continuing to fray, particularly in s=
ome areas in and around Aleppo.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that's why the United=
 States has been working so tenaciously through diplomatic channels to try =
to refresh the cessation of hostilities.&nbsp; And that involves working th=
rough the U.N.-led process to try to bring
 both sides to the table.&nbsp; It involves working with our allies and dir=
ectly with opposition forces to persuade them to live up to the commitments=
 that they've made in the context of cessation of hostilities.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also involves senior dip=
lomatic officials in the U.S. government urging the Russian government to u=
se the influence that they have with the Assad regime to persuade the Syria=
n government to abide by the cessation of hostilities.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we're working this from =
a variety of perspectives because it is central to resolving the situation =
in Syria.&nbsp; We have to bring about a political transition in Syria in o=
rder to address all of the chaos there.&nbsp; And that political
 transition will not occur while innocent people are getting massacred on t=
he ground in Syria by the government.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we are trying to bring a=
bout the cessation of hostilities -- both to nurture continuing political t=
alks, but also to allow for humanitarian relief supplies to be delivered.&n=
bsp; And we've made some important progress in that regard
 in just the last few weeks, but there are some areas that continue to be d=
eprived of badly needed humanitarian supplies.&nbsp; So there is a lot of w=
ork being done to try to refresh the cessation of hostilities all across th=
e country.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, yes=
terday, Secretary Kerry said that a deal was close and that he signed today=
 on a &quot;regime of calm,&quot; I think was the term.&nbsp; So did the re=
bel assault today prevent that from happening?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
don't have an update for you in terms of an agreement that hasn&#8217;t bee=
n reached or announced at this point.&nbsp; But I think this comments are a=
n indication of just how deeply involved the United States Secretary of
 State and other U.S. diplomats have been in trying to broker the cessation=
 of hostilities -- or a refreshing of a cessation of hostilities in those p=
arts of the country where we've seen it break down.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Aleppo is certainly an =
area where we've seen too much violence, and the continued escalation of th=
at violence is troubling.&nbsp; So we're working diligently through a varie=
ty of channels to persuade both sides to go back to observing
 the cessation of hostilities that had largely held until just a few weeks =
ago.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think part of that, as=
 I referred to this yesterday, we know that the Russian government has suff=
icient influence with the Assad regime to persuade them to abide by a cessa=
tion of hostilities.&nbsp; They were able to actually convince
 them to do that earlier this year.&nbsp; But in just the last couple of we=
eks, we've seen the cessation of hostilities begin to fray.&nbsp; And the t=
ruth is we need the Russians to do again what they did once before, which i=
s go back to the Assad regime and make clear
 that abiding by the cessation of hostilities is critical.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in =
this case today, my understanding is that it&#8217;s not the Russians, it&#=
8217;s the -- or the Assad regime, it&#8217;s the opposition fighters that =
had launched the assault.&nbsp; So I guess that's specifically what I was a=
sking about.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; And what=
 I&#8217;m saying is that it&#8217;s both sides that are responsible here.&=
nbsp; And our strategy has been to work through the U.N.-led process to sup=
port the efforts of the U.N. envoy, Mr. de Mistura, as he tries to bring bo=
th
 sides to the table.&nbsp; The United States has reached out directly to ou=
r allies that have influence with opposition figures.&nbsp; And there has b=
een some direct work that we've done with opposition groups, as well, to pe=
rsuade them to abide by the cessation of hostilities
 and come to the table for political talks.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've also worked through t=
he Russians to persuade the Assad regime to live up to the commitments that=
 they've made, as well.&nbsp; And that's our strategy, and it&#8217;s one t=
hat provided a path to the successful implementation -- the largely
 successful implementation of a cessation of hostilities earlier this year.=
&nbsp; And we're trying to get back to that point.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, w=
hen the ceasefire first was agreed upon, administration officials said that=
 this would be a big test for Russia to see if they're serious about this a=
nd we're following through.&nbsp; And at that time, the ceasefire was going
 better than expected.&nbsp; It was just a short time into it.&nbsp; So now=
 that it's frayed and now that we're seeing too many serious violations by =
the Assad regime, and you keep mentioning that Russia should have this infl=
uence over them, would you say that Russia
 has passed this test, or not?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think it is fair to say that the Russians have previously been successful i=
n persuading the Assad regime to abide by the cessation of hostilities, and=
 it's clear they just need to do that again.&nbsp; They've done
 it once before, even earlier this year.&nbsp; So they have the capacity to=
 do it, and we're hopeful that they will.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do they=
 deserve some of the blame for the fraying and that state that things are i=
n now?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think as is clear from Roberta's line of questioning, both sides have contr=
ibuted to the escalation of violence in and around Aleppo.&nbsp; But look, =
when you have government forces that are under the command and control
 of the central government, and you have government forces that have much m=
ore firepower than opposition fighters on the ground, there's a significant=
 responsibility that is borne by the government when it comes to living up =
to commitments that they have made
 in the context of a cessation of hostilities. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we're concerned about th=
e escalation of violence, and there has been violence carried out by both s=
ides.&nbsp; But we're going to go back to both sides and urge them to live =
up to the commitments that they previously made even just a
 couple of months ago.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you=
 satisfied with Russia's level of cooperation so far?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 certainly believe that there is more that Russia can and should do.&nbsp; =
Russia has succeeded in their efforts in the past to play an important role=
 in the largely successful implementation of a cessation of hostilities.&nb=
sp;
 The Russian government has the capacity to persuade the Assad regime to li=
ve up to their commitments, and we hope that they will use that capacity on=
e more time to refresh the cessation of hostilities, particularly in the ar=
eas around Aleppo where it's been
 fraying with very bad consequences.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on =
the same day that the White House is honoring these great teachers, there's=
 another large-scale sickout in Detroit.&nbsp; How closely is the White Hou=
se watching that situation?&nbsp; And what are your thoughts on the situati=
on there?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e White House is obviously aware of the situation, but it's the Secretary o=
f Education, John King, that's been in touch with state and local officials=
 as the city of Detroit works through some significant financial
 problems.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, the point of honoring=
 the National Teacher of the Year is to lift up the efforts of people who d=
on&#8217;t often get a lot of attention.&nbsp; But teachers that are showin=
g up in classrooms on a daily basis are educating the next generation
 of Americans.&nbsp; They're critical to the future of our country and to t=
he success of our country.&nbsp; And teachers have a job that's not glamoro=
us, that's not high-paying, but I think many of them would tell you that it=
's enormously rewarding.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the President believes =
that it's worth recognizing the important contribution that they're making =
to our country and to our country's future.&nbsp; So as politicians are mak=
ing choices about where to invest resources, the President
 believes that prioritizing the pay of teachers is a good place to start.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're r=
eally hearing Donald Trump and Ted Cruz going at it with these accusations =
and names flying --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Because =
they've been so well-behaved before?&nbsp; (Laughter.)
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, b=
etter-behaved, perhaps.&nbsp; But in the past we talked a lot about the rhe=
toric in here and how it affects the country, how it affects either side.&n=
bsp; You've welcomed the robust debate, but the White House has been pretty=
 serious
 in saying that the kind of rhetoric that has come from the Republican Part=
y is bad for the country and bad for democracy.&nbsp; But when you're seein=
g the rhetoric now directed at each other on the Republican side, are you s=
eeing that as bad for the country and
 bad for democracy?&nbsp; Or are you seeing that as good for Democrats and =
good for what you want to happen?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e President certainly does believe that living up to some standard of decor=
um when it comes to our political debates is valuable.&nbsp; And the Presid=
ent had an opportunity to talk about this both in his State of the
 Union address but also in the speech that he delivered in Springfield, Ill=
inois -- that leaders, regardless of -- sort of setting aside what office y=
ou're running for or even what party you represent, that running for electi=
ve office means that voters are
 prepared to entrust you with significant responsibilities.&nbsp; And with =
those responsibilities comes the need to elevate the public debate.&nbsp; P=
eople who hold elective office are making important decisions that have an =
impact on citizens in their communities, and,
 in some cases, citizens across the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when making the case pu=
blicly for why they should be entrusted with that responsibility, politicia=
ns have a responsibility to engage as much as possible in a debate about th=
e issues, to lay out their priorities, to describe what
 it is that is motivating them to run for office in the first place.&nbsp; =
And that is the kind of debate that makes for a vibrant democracy.&nbsp; An=
d the President has acknowledged that he has not always lived up to the hig=
h standard that he has set for himself.&nbsp; But
 I think over the last eight or nine years, this President has done an extr=
aordinary job of leading the kind of debate that, first of all, he can be p=
roud of -- one that accurately reflects the kinds of values and priorities =
that promoted him to seek public
 office in the first place -- but it's also the kind of debate that engages=
 the American public in the governing of our country.&nbsp; And having camp=
aigns that are filled with debates about the issues ultimately means that w=
e have government that is more focused
 on the issues.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But sur=
ely you wouldn&#8217;t admonish the opposing side's candidates from attacki=
ng each other.&nbsp; Wouldn&#8217;t the White House agree that the uglier t=
hings get, the better for Democrats?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think as you and I discussed at one point in the briefing last week, if you=
're looking for somebody to defend a Republican from the attacks of another=
 Republican, you should probably ask somebody other than me.&nbsp;
 But what's also true is that the individual candidates are going to have d=
ecide for themselves exactly what kind of campaign they want to run, and th=
ey'll have to make the case to the voters that what they're saying on the c=
ampaign trail -- or what that says
 about what kind of elective official they would be.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or anot=
her way of asking:&nbsp; Does the White House welcome the fierce attacks fr=
om one candidate to the other?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Look, in=
dividual candidates -- again, whether they're Democrats or Republicans -- a=
re going to have to decide how they want to spend their time on the campaig=
n trail.&nbsp; And the President certainly made his choices and
 has tried to live up to a very high standard that he has set for himself.&=
nbsp; I think, by and large, the President has been enormously successful i=
n meeting that standard -- not flawless, but enormously successful.&nbsp; B=
ut other candidates will have to set their
 own standard for their campaign.&nbsp; And I think voters will consider wh=
ether or not they've lived up to it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; Senator Warren sent a letter to OMB Director Shaun Donovan, es=
sentially pressuring the administration to finish up work on the overtime r=
ule.&nbsp; So I was wondering if you guys have an update on where the proce=
ss stands
 in finalizing that rule.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have an update for you in terms of where that stands.&nbsp; I know that's s=
omething that's being considered by OMB right now.&nbsp; But I don't have a=
n update for you in terms of when that review is likely to be completed.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217=
;m not sure if you've read the letter.&nbsp; But she --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I haven'=
t seen the letter.&nbsp; You can describe it to me if you want, and I&#8217=
;ll do my best.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, s=
he was saying that the comments -- she expressed concern that the administr=
ation might weigh comments from lobbyists and those type of folks over comm=
ents from workers.&nbsp; And I was wondering if you can shed some light on
 how the administration is considering the comments from the public in fina=
lizing the rule.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the President has been very clear about what his economic strategy is=
, and that is to ensure that our economy is growing from the middle out.&nb=
sp; That's the most -- that's the way that we can ensure that we
 have sustained economic growth over the long term.&nbsp; And I think there=
 are a variety of ways to examine whether or not the President has lived up=
 to that kind of commitment.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&#8217;s talk one exampl=
e.&nbsp; We can do the conflict-of-interest rule.&nbsp; This is a rule that=
 would require financial planners who are offering retirement advice to do =
so with the best interests of their customers in mind.&nbsp; We saw the fin=
ancial
 industry unleash a significant lobbying campaign to try to water down that=
 rule, and we rebuffed their efforts to do so.&nbsp; We succeeded in moving=
 forward with a rule that is certainly fair to financial planners.&nbsp; I =
don't think it&#8217;s placing too high of a burden
 on them to suggest that they need to put their customers&#8217; interests =
ahead of their own financial interests.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that was a subject of i=
ntense debate, and this administration clearly came down on the side of wor=
king families who were trying to save for retirement.&nbsp; I think the sam=
e could be said of -- at least a similar story could be told
 when it comes to implementing Wall Street reform; that implementing regula=
tions as a result of Wall Street reform was the source of significant confl=
ict between Wall Street lobbyists and a Democratic administration that's co=
mmitted to fighting for working
 families.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think by just about a=
ny measure, time and time again, as Wall Street reform got implemented, we =
were faithful to the commitment that this President made to make sure that =
taxpayers would not be on the hook for bailing out big
 banks when they made risky bets, and to make sure that middle-class famili=
es had an independent representative in Washington who was looking out for =
them.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think when it comes to=
 this administration&#8217;s track record of rebuffing the efforts of lobby=
ists and staying true to the commitments that have been made by this Presid=
ent to working families, our batting average is quite high.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.N=
. Human Rights Office said today that they're considering filing a complain=
t over the Flint water contamination crisis.&nbsp; They said it raises huma=
n rights issues that this wouldn&#8217;t have happened in a predominantly w=
hite
 neighborhood.&nbsp; Is the White House aware of this development?&nbsp; An=
d do you have any reaction to it?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I have s=
een those reports.&nbsp; There are a number of -- there are at least a coup=
le of independent investigations that are ongoing right now, taking a look =
at what contributed to this crisis.&nbsp; So I&#8217;ve refrained from talk=
ing
 at much length about accountability.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been a couple of=
 findings that have already been released by people, like the Michigan atto=
rney general and the independent blue-ribbon commission that was establishe=
d by the Michigan governor, who did raise concerns about
 the conduct of state regulators.&nbsp; But the independent investigations =
are ongoing, and so I think it would be premature for me to talk a whole lo=
t about the President&#8217;s view of accountability in this instance.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In gene=
ral, is the President concerned that this happened in a poorer community an=
d that that might have contributed to the problem?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain -- look, I think the President is concerned that there was a failure on=
 the part of government officials to ensure that the people of Flint were p=
rotected.&nbsp; And there is a lot of work that's gone into determining
 exactly how and why that happened.&nbsp; That work is ongoing.&nbsp; But I=
 think the fact that something like this happened in a community that is so=
 economically disadvantaged is something that troubles the President.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I co=
uld go back to Trump for just one quick moment.&nbsp; The President said ye=
sterday he doesn't think Trump is equipped to handle the challenges of this=
 office, the presidency.&nbsp; What exactly did he mean by that?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the President has himself said before that he does not expect that th=
e American people are likely to choose him to be the next President.&nbsp; =
So I think the President was merely repeating that belief.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#821=
7;s not the same thing, though, really.&nbsp; I mean, it sounds like he&#82=
17;s saying he&#8217;s not smart enough or doesn't have the capacity to dea=
l with the challenges of the office.&nbsp; That's different from saying I d=
on't think he&#8217;ll get elected.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think that the President is referring to the judgment that ultimately the A=
merican people will have to make.&nbsp; But in terms of elaborating on his =
comments in the television interview yesterday, I&#8217;ll let him do
 that if he chooses to do so.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; The President has now given the green light for the U.S. deplo=
yment to Syria to grow to about 500 special operators.&nbsp; At what point =
does that deployment in Syria meet the President&#8217;s definition of endu=
ring offensive
 combat operations? <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Olivier,=
 we&#8217;ve used that phrase to describe the kind of military strategy tha=
t was employed in the context of the first invasion of Iraq, back in 2003.&=
nbsp; And I think any impartial evaluation of the strategy that President
 Obama has employed to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL would reveal tha=
t our strategy is a lot different.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way you can take a look=
 at that is that when President Obama took office, there were 144,000 U.S. =
servicemembers on the ground in Iraq.&nbsp; The number now on the ground in=
 Iraq is 4,000 or 5,000 -- a small fraction of the footprint
 that was ordered by the previous President in the context of the invasion =
of Iraq.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our strategy is predicated =
on building the capacity of local forces on the ground to fight for their o=
wn country.&nbsp; The situation in Syria is obviously somewhat more challen=
ging because we do not have a central government with whom
 we can partner.&nbsp; So the United States has been working with our coali=
tion partners to build up the capacity of Syrian forces on the ground, and =
these often are forces that are drawn largely from the countryside, but hav=
e proved to be effective in taking the
 fight to ISIL.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, their effectiveness ha=
s been greatly enhanced by U.S. servicemembers who have offered them some a=
dvice and assistance on the ground.&nbsp; Our coalition partners have been =
involved in the effort to train some of these fighters, and
 these fighters have been backed by airstrikes that have made it easier for=
 them to operate effectively on the ground against ISIL.&nbsp; So there is =
a lot that the United States can do to support these Syrian fighters, but u=
ltimately it&#8217;s these Syrian fighters
 who are responsible for combatting ISIL and for providing for the security=
 situation in their own part of the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point is, that is a ver=
y different mission than the deployment of thousands of U.S. troops on the =
ground who are responsible for seeking out and directly engaging the enemy.=
&nbsp; That is not the mission of the much smaller number of
 forces on the ground in Syria.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But my =
understanding is that this was never -- I mean, the definition -- the wordi=
ng you have in your AUMF proposal implies time; it doesn&#8217;t imply scal=
e, right?&nbsp; &quot;Enduring,&quot; to me, suggests that there&#8217;s so=
me amount of time after
 which it has endured, it has lasted.&nbsp; You&#8217;re answering with sca=
le.&nbsp; I understand that these are different missions.&nbsp; I well reme=
mber the large-scale deployment in Iraq.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just curious about=
 -- so there&#8217;s no time element?&nbsp; There&#8217;s no -- they could =
be in
 there years and it wouldn&#8217;t count as an enduring operation?<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the reference to &quot;enduring&quot; is a reference to the idea of a=
n enduring presence on the ground -- the building of bases, a large physica=
l presence on the ground.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s why I do think this notion =
of the
 time commitment and the number of troops involved are not unrelated.<o:p><=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217=
;d like to go back to Secretary Carter&#8217;s comments on the formation of=
 a NATO ground force that would be put in Balkan States and eventually Pola=
nd.&nbsp; Does the administration seriously fear a Russian military interve=
ntion?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ri=
chard, what&#8217;s true is that the President has long regarded NATO as a =
cornerstone of U.S. national security.&nbsp; This is an alliance that is cr=
itical to our national security and is critical to our ability to advance
 our interests around the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But NATO is, at its core, a=
 defensive alliance.&nbsp; NATO does not seek a provocation with Russia.&nb=
sp; In fact, NATO seeks a cooperative relationship with Russia.&nbsp; Unfor=
tunately, Russia has undertaken a number of provocative acts, not the
 least of which is destabilizing the nation of Ukraine by repeatedly violat=
ing their territorial integrity.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Ukraine is not a membe=
r of NATO, but Ukraine is awfully close to a number of NATO countries.&nbsp=
; And that has unsettled some members of our alliance.&nbsp; And the Presid=
ent has laid out a number of proposals for how the United States
 can reassure our European allies in the face of these Russian provocations=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think the best example=
 of this is actually the budget request that was included in the budget pro=
posal that the administration put forward at the beginning of this year.&nb=
sp; Unfortunately, there hasn&#8217;t been much discussion of it
 because Republicans, for the first time in more than 40 years, have refuse=
d to even have a hearing to discuss that proposal.&nbsp; Apparently they do=
n&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s worth a discussion to discuss what the Unite=
d States can and should do to reassure our European
 allies in the face of Russian provocation.&nbsp; That is rather unfortunat=
e.&nbsp; So that irresponsible governing on the part of Republicans notwith=
standing, President Obama has demonstrated a serious commitment to our Euro=
pean allies and our NATO alliance.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m
 confident that there will be additional detailed discussion of what else t=
he United States can do when President Obama travels to Poland in July to m=
eet with our NATO allies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rest assured, while our NAT=
O allies may have some suggestions for what more the United States can do, =
the President will arrive with some additional suggestions about what our E=
uropean allies can do.&nbsp; The most important of those, I
 feel confident in saying, is that our European allies can meet the commitm=
ent that was made a couple of years ago at a previous NATO summit where eac=
h country committed to spending 2 percent of their GDP on national defense.=
&nbsp; If every country that&#8217;s a member
 of our alliance invests sufficiently in their own defense capabilities, th=
at will have the effect of enhancing the national security of all of the na=
tions that we&#8217;ve collectively pledged to defend if they come under at=
tack.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How wou=
ld you answer to Russia&#8217;s perception that NATO is feeding into the Co=
ld War minding with bringing troops, like concrete troops on the ground clo=
se to their borders?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
guess I would answer that question by beginning where I began my last answe=
r, which is making clear that NATO is the cornerstone of U.S. national secu=
rity, but the NATO alliance is, at its core, a defensive one.&nbsp;
 NATO seeks no provocation.&nbsp; NATO is not seeking to antagonize any oth=
er country or any other alliance.&nbsp; NATO was formed to ensure for the c=
ollective defense of the members of our alliance.&nbsp; The President takes=
 the U.S. commitments to that alliance quite seriously.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The United States has inv=
ested robustly in our defense capabilities.&nbsp; The United States militar=
y works on a daily basis with our allies and partners in Europe to ensure t=
hat we can effectively operate together to
 confront shared threats.&nbsp; And that interoperability, that ability to =
coordinate and share information is critical to our national security and c=
ritical to the national security of our allies.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why the =
President is seeking to increase the resources that
 are dedicated to that effort.&nbsp; We would welcome congressional attenti=
on and support for that commitment, because it is, after all, critical to t=
he national security of the United States.&nbsp; But it should not in any w=
ay signal to anybody a change in NATO&#8217;s orientation
 of being a defensive alliance.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very la=
st question, Josh.&nbsp; You referred to the Russian provocation in Ukraine=
.&nbsp; Is it still the idea of bringing troops and reassuring allies and h=
aving a defensive position, isn&#8217;t it in anyway somehow an acknowledge=
ment of the
 limits or even the inefficiency of the sanctions that have been put on Rus=
sia for the last two years without concrete results?&nbsp; Even if you&#821=
7;ll -- I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re going to come up with saying, oh, the r=
uble is going down, and the economy is slowing down.&nbsp; Still,
 I mean, you need to send troops to reassure the neighbors of Russia to sho=
w that they can feel secure.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, wh=
at is true is that the United States and our European allies have been able=
 to coordinate effectively by imposing sanctions and imposing costs on Russ=
ia for their destabilizing activities inside of Ukraine.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the=
 impact?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e impact has been negative when it comes to their economy.&nbsp; I read a s=
tory in the New York Times either today or yesterday talking about the sign=
ificant economic challenges that are facing Russia.&nbsp; Now, a significan=
t
 chunk of that economic weakness is a result of falling energy prices, but =
Russia&#8217;s ability to respond -- or the ability of the Russian economy =
to adapt to those weaknesses in the energy sector have been constrained by =
these sanctions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there have been costs th=
at have been imposed on Russia.&nbsp; Thus far, President Putin has been wi=
lling to bear those costs.&nbsp; But as the New York Times points out, the =
cost to the Russian economy and the impact that it has on the Russian
 government is not insignificant.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, yes, it has not -- I w=
ould acknowledge some part of your question, which is we have not yet seen =
the change in strategy that we&#8217;d hope for.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s st=
ill time for President Putin to make that decision, to change his strategy
 in Ukraine to abide by the commitments that his country has made in the co=
ntext of the Minsk talks.&nbsp; And if he&#8217;s willing to follow through=
 on those commitments, President Obama has made clear literally from day on=
e that the United States would be prepared
 to relax those sanctions as soon as Russia demonstrates a commitment to fu=
lfilling the commitments that they made in the Minsk talks.&nbsp; The Presi=
dent delivered that statement on the very day that the Minsk talks were -- =
or that the sanctions were imposed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&#8217;ve been very cl=
ear about what our strategy is thus far.&nbsp; It has had an economic impac=
t.&nbsp; It has not yet resulted in the kind of strategic change on the gro=
und that we&#8217;d like to see, but every day that goes by, the effect of =
the
 sanctions becomes tougher and more concentrated.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s Presi=
dent Putin here that has to make a decision.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at the same time, yes, =
the United States is committed to ramping up our investment where necessary=
 to demonstrate to our NATO allies that the attention of the United States =
has not lingered or wandered, and that the United States
 takes very seriously our investment and our commitment to the mutual defen=
se of our NATO allies.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all=
 the wording about the Iraq mission, is the bottom line now that the Americ=
an public should expect that there&#8217;s a much higher likelihood of more=
 casualties?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Ron, wha=
t&#8217;s been true from the very beginning is that our servicemembers serv=
ing in Iraq are doing dangerous things.&nbsp; They are putting themselves i=
n harm&#8217;s way for our national security.&nbsp; Their ability to offer =
support,
 training, advice, and assistance to Iraqi forces on the ground in Iraq is =
critical to our strategy for degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we&#8217;ve gone to gr=
eat lengths to try to describe with precision exactly what their mission is=
.&nbsp; Our men and women on the ground in Iraq do not have a combat missio=
n, but they do have a dangerous mission to operate in a dangerous
 country, to support Iraqi forces who are taking the fight to ISIL in their=
 own country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the =
number now is about 4,000 or 5,000 or so.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That&#82=
17;s correct, it&#8217;s just over 4,000, I believe.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How man=
y of those 4,000 are in this position of greater danger now as the tempo of=
 the mission increases, or however you want to describe it -- now that thin=
gs have changed in the last month or so and the pace of operations has
 picked up?&nbsp; Is it a smaller -- a few hundred?&nbsp; Or is it most of =
these 5,000, or 4,000 or so?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think for a detailed breakdown of this, I&#8217;d refer you to the Pentagon=
.&nbsp; They can sort of give you the best assessment here.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I know to be true is t=
hat our forces are moving around quite a bit.&nbsp; And so there are times =
where they will -- based on the new authority that the President has given,=
 that the Commander-in-Chief has given to our troops, that
 some of them are now even operating down to the battalion level.&nbsp; And=
 that's dangerous work.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This individual who unfortu=
nately was killed today in northern Iraq was operating about two miles behi=
nd this line that was maintained by Iraqi forces just north of Mosul.&nbsp;=
 So I think that's a pretty good illustration of what&#8217;s happening.&nb=
sp;
 He was not on the front lines, but he was two miles way, and it turns out =
that being two miles away from the front lines between Iraqi forces and ISI=
L is a very dangerous place to be.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is=
 a fairly intense battle that went on for some time -- airstrikes and so fo=
rth.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, it=
&#8217;s not uncommon for U.S. airstrikes to be summoned on very short noti=
ce to try to provide for force protection.&nbsp; That's exactly what happen=
ed here.&nbsp; So I wouldn&#8217;t describe -- I wouldn&#8217;t quibble wit=
h that description
 that this was an intense situation.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s not an uncommon o=
ne.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&=
nbsp; But I guess the concern, the perception is that, again, not trying to=
 go back to the words the President may have uttered so many, many months a=
go that things have changed, but I think the public is just trying to under=
stand
 exactly what our troops are doing there, and to what extent we are involve=
d in combat, war, danger, high likelihood of fatalities, or this much more =
benign-sounding train-and-assist posture.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
mean to make it sound benign because it&#8217;s not.&nbsp; It&#8217;s dange=
rous.&nbsp; What I am trying to do, though, is trying to be as precise as p=
ossible with you and the American public about what exactly our Commander-i=
n-Chief
 has asked our servicemembers to do. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary Carter earlier to=
day described this death as a combat death.&nbsp; That's accurate.&nbsp; Th=
is was an individual who was not in a combat mission, but he was in a dange=
rous place.&nbsp; And his position came under attack. &nbsp;He was armed,
 trained, and prepared to defend himself.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he was kille=
d.&nbsp; And he was killed in combat.&nbsp; But that was not part of his mi=
ssion.&nbsp; His mission was specifically to offer advice and assistance to=
 those Iraqi forces that were fighting for their own
 country. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all=
 that is still in keeping with what the President said to the public about =
what we would be doing in Iraq?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; It is pr=
ecisely in line with the way that the President has described what our stra=
tegy is.&nbsp; And I know that I keep going back to this, but it&#8217;s th=
e best way that I can think of to try to describe to you and to the America=
n
 people exactly what&#8217;s happening. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mission that our men an=
d women in Iraq have right now is different than the mission that our servi=
cemembers had during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.&nbsp; In 2003, there was a =
combat operation, forces on the ground -- U.S. forces on the
 ground -- that were given the mission to go and seek out and engage the en=
emy in combat.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tens of thousands -- and at=
 its peak, more than 100,000 -- U.S. forces were given that mission.&nbsp; =
This mission is much different.&nbsp; We're talking about 4,000 U.S. servic=
emembers.&nbsp; Their mission is a dangerous one, but it is one that
 is predicated on building up the capacity of Iraqi forces to go and take t=
he fight to ISIL.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think this might be a r=
elevant point for me to highlight one other thing, which is that we have se=
en the performance of Iraqi security forces on the ground improve.&nbsp; An=
d despite the tragic news that we received
 earlier today, the last several days have been characterized by important =
progress that's been made by Iraqi security forces.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Let me just describe a co=
uple of them to you right now.&nbsp; In just the last couple of days, Iraqi=
 forces retook Bashir, in Kirkuk province.&nbsp; These Iraqi -- or another =
contingent of Iraqi forces have succeeded in pushing
 ISIL out of Hit.&nbsp; And another contingent, a separate contingent of Ir=
aqi forces are continuing to apply pressure to ISIL terrorists in and aroun=
d Haditha.&nbsp; If Iraqi forces are successful in finally pushing ISIL out=
 of the vicinity of Haditha, they will have
 effectively cleared ISIL terrorists out of the Euphrates River Valley.&nbs=
p; This will be an important strategic gain.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All of that progress that=
 Iraqi forces made on the ground against ISIL fighters was only possible be=
cause of the important support that they have received from the United Stat=
es and our coalition partners.&nbsp; That
 came in the form of training before they even took the battlefield.&nbsp; =
In some cases, that took the form of U.S. forces offering advice and assist=
ance.&nbsp; And in each of these cases, I&#8217;m told, they were backed by=
 U.S. and coalition military airpower.&nbsp; So this
 is evidence, Ron, that we're making important progress.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it&#8217;s also undenia=
ble that the small number -- the relatively small number of U.S. servicemem=
bers that are involved in these operations are not in combat, but they are =
in a dangerous place.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the=
 President -- just to clarify, he says that Mosul will be recaptured by the=
 end of the year?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; What the=
 President has said is that Iraqi forces are hoping to be successful enough=
 that they could lay the conditions for the successful retaking of Mosul by=
 the end of the year.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudi=
ble.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Correct,=
 correct. &nbsp;And there&#8217;s -- and to be clear about that, there is s=
till a lot of important work that needs to be done to lay the groundwork fo=
r that.&nbsp; So we're a ways away from accomplishing that part.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And jus=
t to clarify on the Flint situation, does the President think the water in =
Flint is now safe for the residents to drink?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, mo=
st importantly it&#8217;s the EPA that has done extensive testing.&nbsp; An=
d what they have concluded is that filtered water in Flint is safe to drink=
.&nbsp; And that's the advice that they have shared with the public, and th=
at's
 certainly the advice that the President believes the public should follow.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only th=
e filtered water, not water straight out of the tap?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That's m=
y understanding that the situation on the ground in Flint is that -- what t=
he EPA has communicated to the public in Flint is that filtered tap water i=
n Flint is safe to drink and safe to use for other purposes
 like cooking and bathing and those other basic activities.&nbsp; <o:p></o:=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou, Josh.&nbsp; Can you give me the latest numbers on Gitmo detainees and a=
ny news that you might have about possible transfers coming out?<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have any news to make about potential transfers at this point.&nbsp; The mo=
st recent transfer was the transfer of nine individuals from the prison at =
Guantanamo Bay to Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; That was a transfer that occurred
 shortly before the President traveled to Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; And I believe=
 that that brought the number down below 90.&nbsp; So I think it's in the l=
ow eighties now, but we can get you the precise number after the briefing.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked=
 you yesterday about the 28 pages of the congressional 9/11 report, and we =
just had a bit of a conversation about the fact that the President has a gr=
eat deal of material that he reads on a daily basis, and certainly I
 think the American public understands that.&nbsp; But I think there's stil=
l a curiosity, given the interest in those 28 pages and given its relevance=
, especially to such an important event in American history, that it would =
seem to me to be the President's responsibility
 to take a look at that.&nbsp; He's not an incurious person.&nbsp; So I'm j=
ust wondering, from that perspective, would he not then read the 28 pages?&=
nbsp; Have you had a conversation with him about that?&nbsp; I'm sure he's =
been reading the news reports as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The Pres=
ident has been reading the news reports, and the President has been briefed=
 on the contents of those 28 pages.&nbsp; But as has been described by peop=
le like Director Brennan and by the leaders of the 9/11 Commission,
 that those 28 pages are essentially unvetted law enforcement and investiga=
tive materials.&nbsp; So the President -- I think as is common for most peo=
ple -- is mostly interested in the conclusions.&nbsp; And that's why the Pr=
esident has looked at the 9/11 Commission
 report, and the 9/11 commissioners have indicated that they were able to r=
eview the 28 pages and follow up on the leads that were contained therein.&=
nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">They conducted investigat=
ions and interviews -- not just in the United States, but even overseas -- =
to ensure they were running down the leads that were presented in those 28 =
pages.&nbsp; And the conclusion that they
 reached is that even after conducting those interviews, and even after fol=
lowing up on the leads that were included there, that they did not find any=
 evidence that the Saudi government as an institution had been supportive o=
f the 9/11 terrorists.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is h=
e not curious to read them for himself?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The Pres=
ident basically feels he has sufficient information about what's included i=
n the 28 pages, based on the briefings that he has received and based on th=
e conclusions that were reached by the 9/11 Commission that
 has made those conclusions public.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any upd=
ate on the nomination of Rhett Jepson over at the Mint?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
aware of the status of that specific nomination, but we can certainly look =
into it and get back to you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, a=
nd last one.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you again about the difference between c=
ombat and advising and assisting.&nbsp; I think, if I'm understanding you c=
orrectly, if I were to put them side by side on a full screen, they're both=
 in
 combat.&nbsp; One has a combat mission; one does not.&nbsp; Is that the be=
st way I can describe the difference between what you're suggesting -- whic=
h is, previously American forces had a combat mission and were in combat, a=
nd now they're in a combat but they don&#8217;t
 have combat mission.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the way that I would describe it to you is that individuals who are i=
n a train, advise and assist mission are equipped for combat.&nbsp; They've=
 been trained for combat.&nbsp; And the reason for that is, simply, they're
 in a dangerous place.&nbsp; In some cases, they're just a couple of miles =
behind the front lines.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And in this tragic situat=
ion in northern Iraq that transpired earlier today, you had an individual w=
ho was not in a combat mission come under withering attack from enemy force=
s.&nbsp; He was in a combat situation.&nbsp; He
 was prepared to deal with.&nbsp; But unfortunately, under a complex attack=
, he was killed.&nbsp; And it's tragic.&nbsp; And it is a testament to the =
bravery and courage and sacrifice not just of this individual, who gave his=
 life for his country, but for the 4,000 other
 U.S. servicemembers who are operating every day in Iraq.&nbsp; They are no=
t in a combat mission, but they are in a dangerous situation and they're in=
 a dangerous place fighting for our country and fighting for our security.&=
nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the President does no=
t make decisions about deploying them into those circumstances lightly.&nbs=
p; The President has been conscientious about making sure that our strategy=
 is sound.&nbsp; And I just described to Ron exactly
 what impact these brave servicemembers are having in building up the capac=
ity of local forces in Iraq to take the fight to ISIL in their own country.=
&nbsp; So this is a strategy that involves our men and women in uniform, as=
suming greater personal risk.&nbsp; They do
 that for our country, and we are indebted to them.&nbsp; But this strategy=
 has yielded important progress.&nbsp; In Iraq alone, with the support of U=
.S. servicemembers, Iraqi forces have retaken about 40 percent of the popul=
ated areas that ISIL previously controlled.&nbsp;
 That is notable progress.&nbsp; That is making America safer.&nbsp; That w=
ould not be possible without the bravery and heroism of American servicemem=
bers.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But what I have tried to =
do and what the President has tried to do is to be as precise as possible i=

 was initially implemented, it was more successful than we previously expec=
ted.&nbsp; But we have seen it start to fray in some areas, particularly in=
 and around Aleppo.&nbsp; And that's why we're seeking to refresh our effor=
ts in that region of the country.&nbsp; And we've
 made clear, both directly and through our partners and allies, that it's i=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That's=
 a totally fair question.&nbsp; There are two goals that we had in mind.&nb=
sp; The first was the provision of humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; While the=
 fighting was raging, before the implementation of cessation
 of hostilities, there were communities that were essentially cut off from =
the outside world.&nbsp; And that prevented the delivery of basic supplies,=
 like food, water, medicine.&nbsp; And in the context -- when the cessation=
 of hostilities was implemented, we did see
 important progress made in terms of the delivery of humanitarian assistanc=
e.&nbsp; And I have some statistics about that, if that's useful to you.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">There are about 57 humani=
tarian assistance convoys that have been mobilized by the Syrian Arab Red C=
rescent since February 14th.&nbsp; That includes about 700 trucks deliverin=
g life-saving assistance to about 678,000
 people 23 hard-to-reach and besieged locations.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to that, the U.=
N. World Food Program conducted about 16 airdrops that delivered about 284 =
metric tons of food assistance to about 100,000 people in one particular co=
mmunity in Syria.&nbsp; That was an airdrop that occurred at
 the end of April -- or there was a series of airdrops that occurred at the=
 end of April.&nbsp; So that is evidence that the cessation of hostilities =
did create space for that kind of humanitarian relief to be delivered.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second goal is that opp=
osition figures had essentially said it&#8217;s very difficult for us to pa=
rticipate in any form of political negotiations while our constituents are =
being slaughtered by the government.&nbsp; And the goal of the cessation
 of hostilities was to get both sides to hold their fire against each other=
, because the cessation of hostilities did not apply to extremist groups li=
ke Nusra or ISIL.&nbsp; But if the cessation of hostilities could be succes=
sful in getting both sides to hold their
 fire, that might build in some momentum into political talks.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there were a series of =
political talks that were convened while the cessation of hostilities was i=
n effect.&nbsp; But there was a pause that was taken in those talks as we s=
aw the cessation of hostilities begin to fray.&nbsp; And so our
 hope is that by refreshing the cessation of hostilities in those areas whe=
re we saw fraying, we can give another boost to the ongoing political negot=
iations.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think anybody expects that those political neg=
otiations would be completed in just a couple
 of weeks, but we are hoping that those talks can build a little momentum s=
o that they can make more progress than they have thus far in bringing abou=
t the political transition that everybody acknowledges is necessary.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one=
 on the Iraqi security forces.&nbsp; Is there any concern that since ISIL w=
as able to sort of break through this checkpoint and get two miles -- basic=
ally have a casualty two miles away, that the security forces may not be as
 effective as they should be in fighting on the frontlines?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, as=
 I detailed to Ron, there are a number of areas where we&#8217;ve made impo=
rtant progress just in the last few days.&nbsp; So we have seen the perform=
ance of Iraqi security forces improve dramatically in just the last 18
 months.&nbsp; There are important reasons for that.&nbsp; The first is, th=
e Iraqi security forces have gotten important equipment from the United Sta=
tes and our coalition partners; they&#8217;ve essentially been resupplied.&=
nbsp; The United States and our coalition partners have
 undertaken extensive training operations to enhance the fighting ability o=
f Iraqi security forces.&nbsp; And since the beginning of the campaign, the=
 United States and our coalition partners have carried out about 12,000 air=
strikes, I believe is the latest number.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of those airstrikes we=
re conducted in support of operations on the ground, and those airstrikes h=
ave greatly enhanced the performance of Iraqi security forces on the ground=
.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ve seen a steady improvement, and that&#8217;s the
 reason that you have seen ISIL driven out of 40 percent of the populated t=
erritory that they previously controlled.&nbsp; So we are pleased with the =
improvements that we&#8217;ve seen over the last 18 months or so.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I will say the other =
thing that has been a welcome development is a more consistent commitment o=
n the part of Iraqi security forces to be willing to defend their country.&=
nbsp; And that was called into question when
 ISIL made their rapid advance across the Iraqi desert.&nbsp; There was a s=
ense that many Iraqi forces were not willing to fight for their country.&nb=
sp; But the resilience and commitment of Iraqi security forces has also bee=
n enhanced.&nbsp; That&#8217;s led to their improved
 performance.&nbsp; It also has led to an improvement in terms of what thei=
r prospects are likely to be moving forward.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back on=
 Detroit.&nbsp; Can you say if the White House supports the actions the tea=
chers there are taking?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; What I c=
an say is that the Education Secretary has been the administration official=
 most directly involved in encouraging both sides to resolve the situation.=
&nbsp; Obviously when you have now two days in a row where school
 kids in Detroit are not going to school, that&#8217;s a significant proble=
m that&#8217;s going to have a broader economic impact.&nbsp; The parents a=
re going to have to stay home to take care of their kids who would otherwis=
e be in school.&nbsp; It raises some public-safety issues.&nbsp;
 There are some parents who may not be able to stay home with their kids, a=
nd those kids are now operating or moving around unsupervised.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">To say nothing of the mos=
t important thing, which is these kids aren&#8217;t getting educated, and t=
hat is a real problem, and one that the President is deeply concerned about=
.&nbsp; And the administration is prepared to do
 whatever we can to encourage both sides to come to an agreement that can p=
ut teachers and, most importantly, students back in the classroom.<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But is =
the administration urging the teachers to end their sickout?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
what we&#8217;re urging both teachers and local officials to do is to resol=
ve their differences so that kids can get back to school.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this=
 a subject the President might mention in his teacher remarks today?<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t know at this point, but stay tuned.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou, Josh.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Nice to =
see you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterd=
ay, an independent think tank, IHS, reported that the tempo and intensity o=
f ISIS operations in Iraq and Syria has actually been increasing over the p=
ast three months.&nbsp; Attack figures for the first quarter of 2016 were
 the highest since ISIS took Mosul in 2014.&nbsp; The past quarter also saw=
 the highest number of fatalities since the second quarter of 2015.&nbsp; S=
o how do you square those figures with the administration&#8217;s argument =
and the argument that you&#8217;ve been making that ISIS
 is on the retreat in Iraq?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
haven&#8217;t seen the study, so it&#8217;s hard for me to directly rebut i=
t.&nbsp; But I would at least posit that some of those statistics are a dir=
ect result of ISIL encountering much greater pressure from Iraqi security f=
orces
 than they have before.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s a reason that=
 ISIL has lost control of 40 percent of the territory in populated areas th=
at they used to previously control.&nbsp; That&#8217;s because the Iraqi se=
curity forces on the ground are applying significant pressure to drive
 them out of those areas.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s at least part of the equati=
on.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I&#8217;ll have to get =
back to you if there&#8217;s a more specific answer that we can give to hel=
p you understand those numbers.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will th=
e assessment -- and I guess the assessment that ISIS is in retreat -- how o=
ften is that being assessed?&nbsp; Will it be adjusted at all?<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e President is getting regular updates from his military commanders that in=
cludes input from people who are on the ground, seeing firsthand exactly wh=
at&#8217;s happening there.&nbsp; The President meets every two or three
 weeks with his national security team to review the progress that we&#8217=
;ve made against ISIL, and the President regularly gets battlefield assessm=
ents -- not just in the context of those meetings, but in sometimes even in=
 the context of the presidential daily
 briefing that he begins his day with.&nbsp; So this is something that we&#=
8217;re regularly looking at the situation on the ground and assessing the =
impact of the strategies and tactics that we have used to degrade and ultim=
ately destroy ISIL.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But based on the 40 percent=
 figure that I cited before, based on those areas around Bashir and Hit and=
 Haditha, where we have seen Iraqi forces make progress just in the last fe=
w days, that continues to build our confidence in our
 ability to continue to pressure ISIL.&nbsp; And when I say &#8220;our,&#82=
21; I&#8217;m using that word intentionally, because I&#8217;m not just tal=
king about the United States -- I&#8217;m talking about the Iraqi forces th=
at are on the frontlines of this fight, and they&#8217;re backed by the Uni=
ted
 States and our coalition partners that are committed to their success.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So was =
it a surprise to hear that -- for the President to hear that ISIS fighters =
were on the attack, got two miles beyond the frontlines, and killed this U.=
S. Navy SEAL?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ob=
viously what&#8217;s happened in the context of this incident is very tragi=
c and it does underscore how dangerous the situation is there, and it under=
scores the risk that our servicemembers are taking to protect our
 national security.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But look, I think there is =
always a danger of drawing minute-by-minute conclusions about what&#8217;s =
happening on the battlefield in the context of a long-term military campaig=
n.&nbsp; The President talked about this from the very beginning
 -- that there would be important progress that we would enjoy and there wo=
uld be periods of setback.&nbsp; And that has been true for the last almost=
 two years now, and I&#8217;m confident that will be true moving forward.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think recently there&#821=
7;s no denying -- this terrible tragedy notwithstanding -- that we made imp=
ortant progress recently.&nbsp; And we are hoping that by working with our =
coalition partners and by providing additional advice and assistance
 and additional equipment to Iraqi forces, we can help them build additiona=
l momentum and build additional pressure on ISIL terrorists in their countr=
y.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whi=
le the President is on the ground in Michigan, will he be addressing the De=
troit teachers&#8217; concerns there at all?&nbsp; Do you expect that he&#8=
217;ll raise that issue with the governor when he speaks with the governor?=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
know if the President will raise this with the governor, but we&#8217;ll tr=
y and get you a readout of their conversations.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All right, we&#8217;ll do=
 one or two more.&nbsp; Taka.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Jo=
sh.&nbsp; North Korea announced its Workers' Party congress will begin this=
 Friday.&nbsp; So do you expect they&#8217;ll announce any new policy direc=
tion?&nbsp; Also, do you also expect they&#8217;ll conduct another nuclear =
test before its party
 congress? <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; At this =
point I would refrain from hazarding a guess or offering up any predictions=
 about what the North Korean regime may do.&nbsp; Their track record of pro=
vocative actions and destabilizing activities on the Korean Peninsula
 is lengthy.&nbsp; And there has been a troubling, increasing frequency of =
those provocative acts just in the first few months of this year.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States remains c=
ommitted to working with the international community to further isolate Nor=
th Korea in an attempt to persuade them to abandon those tactics.&nbsp; The=
 United States is certainly committed to the safety and security
 of our allies in South Korea and Japan.&nbsp; And our commitment to our al=
lies will not waver.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Japa=
n, you say there is no update about President Obama&#8217;s trip to possibl=
e Hiroshima.&nbsp; But just in case -- I wanted to ask the question today -=
- if the President is considering to make a speech when he goes to Japan?<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have any updates in terms of the President&#8217;s itinerary when he travel=
s to Japan.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll certainly keep you posted if any stops are ad=
ded beyond the President&#8217;s visit to the G7 meeting there later this m=
onth.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Ob=
ama is also going to Japan with the President?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
believe that she is planning to accompany him on this trip.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jared, I&#8217;ll give you =
the last one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; After the President&#8217;s interviews yesterday on the Suprem=
e Court, does the White House consider it a victory either if Merrick Garla=
nd -- if Chief Judge Merrick Garland is given a hearing?&nbsp; Or barring t=
hat, as Senate
 Republicans seem to be wont to do, to make Republicans pay a political pri=
ce for it in November?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Jared, o=
ur goal here is to confirm Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; He i=
s the most experienced nominee in terms of his 19 years on the federal benc=
h than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history.&nbsp; That
 experience I think is an indication that he is more than prepared to assum=
e the significant responsibilities associated with a lifetime appointment t=
o the Supreme Court.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over his 19-year career, he=
 has established a strong track record of interpreting the law and not usin=
g his position to advance a political agenda.&nbsp; I think for all of the =
acrimonious charges and counter-charges that are traded back
 and forth between Democrats and Republicans, that principle I think is som=
ething that does enjoy bipartisan support.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief Judge Garland also en=
joys bipartisan support, by the way.&nbsp; I think that's why many Republic=
ans -- at least one high-profile Republican -- has acknowledged that he is =
a consensus nominee.&nbsp; We just need to see Republicans actually
 do their job and step up to the plate and fulfill their constitutional res=
ponsibilities.&nbsp; And that is to give Chief Judge Garland a hearing and =
a vote.&nbsp; After all, to deny him a hearing or a vote would be the first=
 time that any Supreme Court nominee has been
 denied a hearing or a vote since 1875 -- 1875.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what Republicans are pre=
paring to do and have begun to do is an unprecedented escalation of partisa=
nship.&nbsp; And I don't think the American people are pleased about that b=
ecause the expectations, when it comes to the Supreme Court,
 is that constitutional responsibilities and a commitment to justice and fa=
irness and equality all ahead of politics is what people want from their Co=
ngress.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s not what they're getting from this set of Repu=
blicans in Congress.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, a=
s you so often remind us, you're not a spokesman for any those other entiti=
es, just for the White House.&nbsp; So what I&#8217;m asking you is, is it =
the White House&#8217;s position that barring hearings, votes, et cetera fo=
r Merrick Garland
 is, as you said, and I think you alluded to it in the answer, but I didn't=
 really get an answer to my original question, which was:&nbsp; If you're s=
aying it&#8217;s up to the American people, and they're not happy about it,=
 is that the White House&#8217;s essentially backup
 plan to say that making Republicans pay a political price for this, as you=
 say, unprecedented, as the President has said unprecedented position -- is=
 that what the White House is seeking to do?&nbsp; It certainly seems that =
way given the President&#8217;s stance on both
 official and political events.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; There&#8=
217;s no backup plan.&nbsp; There is only one goal, and that's to confirm C=
hief Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; And that's the reaso=
n that we're engaged in this effort.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, what is true is that t=
here is ample public data out there that might lead one to conclude that if=
 Republicans do refuse to do their job, that voters may have something to s=
ay about that.&nbsp; But ultimately --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the =
White House is agnostic as to whether voters should -- I mean, it can't be =
true that the White House is agnostic that voters should or shouldn&#8217;t=
 judge Republicans on this issue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think whether or not we want it to be true, it is clear from that data that=
 the American public -- and I&#8217;m not just talking about Democrats, I&#=
8217;m not even just talking about independents -- there is ample data
 to indicate that Republican voters are uncomfortable with the position tha=
t Republican senators have taken to not do their job.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think some of that stems =
from the explanation that we've heard from a lot of Republicans senators.&n=
bsp; Republicans senators, when confronted with the fact that they have a c=
onstitutional obligation to uphold, have said that they're
 not going to do that because Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leade=
r in the Senate, has told them not to.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't even think Republic=
ans think that's a good explanation.&nbsp; And again, I think individual vo=
ters are going to have to decide for themselves how and whether they're goi=
ng to hold their representatives to the United States Senate
 accountable to for their actions in the Senate. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what is clear right now=
 is that the position that Republican senators have taken in refusing to do=
 their job puts them on the wrong side of this issue in the view of the vas=
t majority of Americans in both parties.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should =
we take your hesitation to embrace this as a political issue that the Presi=
dent won&#8217;t be campaigning on this eventually when he gets more on the=
 stump when there&#8217;s a Democratic nominee?&nbsp; Is he going to stand =
down and not
 take a position that this is an issue that voters should care about in the=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; First of=
 all, I do anticipate that at some point this year, the President will be c=
ampaigning in support of Senate Democrats, including individual Senate Demo=
cratic -- including individual Democratic candidates for the
 United States Senate.&nbsp; And, yes, this is entirely a relevant issue.&n=
bsp; It certainly --

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#821=
7;s entirely relevant?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; This is =
an entirely relevant issue.&nbsp; But individual voters are ultimately goin=
g to have to decide for themselves exactly whether or not this is going to =
affect which candidate they support.&nbsp; If this does have an impact
 on their vote, Republican senators are in trouble.&nbsp; Because again, th=
e polls indicate that in many states even a majority of Republicans are con=
cerned about this position that Republican senators have taken -- again, pr=
imarily because of the explanation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voters in states all across=
 the country didn't send their representatives in Congress to go and do wha=
t Mitch McConnell told them to do.&nbsp; They sent their representatives to=
 go there and fulfill their constitutional duty and represent
 the interests of their constituents.&nbsp; And I think most people believe=
 that their interests are best represented when the Supreme Court of the Un=
ited States has the full complement of justices.
