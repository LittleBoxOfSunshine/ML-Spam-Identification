CASTING A PAUL: Paul Ryan says he'd be willing to stand aside as chairman of the Republican National Convention if DONALD TRUMP were to ask, another sign of escalated tensions between the billionaire and the GOP speaker of the House.

POLITICO's Rachael Bade reports Ryan made the offer while doing a round of local press to kick off the week. He told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he would stand down at Trump's request. The comments come after Ryan said last week he couldn't currently support Trump as his party's nominee: "He's the nominee. I'll do whatever he wants with respect to the convention," Ryan told the newspaper.

Trump and Ryan are set to meet in person on Thursday in Washington. Thus far, there's been little sign that tensions have cooled ahead of the t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te. Read more at: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=926908e288a0e87681d52a62cf78daa79fbe0810c1f1aba697bc9eeba8031cf5 

It's Monday. We'd never stand down from your 2016 Blast. You will have to demand our ouster. Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through the day's campaign news, so send your tips, complaints and your most scalding takes to: hjackson@politico.com. 

BREAKING BLAST: MARCO RUBIO has formally ruled himself out of serving as DONALD TRUMP's vice president, CNN reports. 

Here are four more things we're watching today.

2) NO APOLOGIES: Huh, this sounds familiar: HILLARY CLINTON's campaign is test driving a message against DONALD TRUMP that sure seems like the first step in the MITT ROMNEY-fication of the presumptive GOP nominee. POLITICO's Nolan D. McCaskill reports that Clinton's campaign today sought to portray Trump as a ruthless tycoon. Clinton's campaign convened a conference call to slam the presumptive GOP nominee's economic proposals. Clinton's top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, said Trump's tax plan "places him squarely on the side of the super wealthy and corporations at the expense of the middle class and working families." Where have we heard this before? 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=926908e288a0e876fffd64b4d0e808f47663306da5ec70fd123e564d3ca39c39 

3) FORWARD PLANNING: DONALD TRUMP named Chris Christie as the chairman of his presidential transition - a role that would take on outsize importance if Trump wins in November. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=926908e288a0e876c57e69afdad5334af89b54d8e9994f5820e66e7f88ed6f27 But, as POLITICO's Ben White and Darren Samuelsohn report, Christie's assignment is already quite difficult: A vast number of GOP administration veterans have said they'll take a pass on a Trump administration. Dozens of potential appointees said in interviews with POLITICO they wouldn't serve unless Trump changed his tone on a variety of issues. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31dd3807cbc571d2f95c8259da7e78b79c6e8e927ff3dcd7499 

4) MONDAY TIRADE: How did DONALD TRUMP spend his Monday? As he has spent many other days this campaign cycle: lashing out at multiple targets, particularly the media. POLITICO's Nick Gass reports Trump pivoted toward a general election by referring to "Crooked Hillary" on Twitter, getting into a sarcastic back-and-forth with a CNN anchor and conducting himself with a generally combative tone in a series of TV interviews. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31dc63be761def9d3077942d392109a426497840b710b92d106 For good measure, Trump also reignited a feud with the hosts of "Morning Joe." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31da3d5efb0bc92441f48a642489da963b271ad05ddaeedfd22 

5) IT, PHONE HOME: The State Department says it can't find any text messages sent by HILLARY CLINTON, nor any she received during her tenure as secretary of state. And, POLITICO's Josh Gerstein reports, Foggy Bottom can't locate any emails received or sent by a key information technology staffer during her tenure. That's according to lawyers for the Republican Party in a court filing on Monday. The State Department disputes this - saying they have at least some emails from computer specialist, Bryan Pagliano, although the messages were found in other people's accounts.This comes in response to a RNC lawsuit, filed in March seeking Clinton's text or Blackberry messages. 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31dd227b94f19d9d00ee73fdb4708457c08e77adc7641e1a395 

TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, there are a lot of "Democrats" who do not like HILLARY CLINTON. But she's riding a midnight train in Georgia. Mark Salter explains. TED CRUZ supporters want control. And Jon Stewart goes off.

STILL BERNING HERE: Ahead of West Virginia voting tomorrow, BERNIE SANDERS emphasized that he still has a chance during a rally in Atlantic City. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31d939d76016304bba6ad777179596f4256231f35ec20d569a6 Sanders also managed to rouse DONALD TRUMP supporter Carl Ichan who disputed his portrayal of Atlantic City. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31def8c63c268a506db78e1d83f306c761b8e8f62f7b7631775 

MOUNTAINEER MATH: For the record, there are 29 delegates on the line tomorrow. They are proportionally distributed. The Real Clear Politics average has Sanders up about 6 points in the state. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31dc9c74ec60e17213a01c4a7d756d4941550d5a850701d2b84 

NOT WITH HER: These are the places, besides Vermont, where Democrats least like HILLARY CLINTON. (The New York Times) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31de4b78e432642700cbc395dc76c7d9424e82ec9493c90abcc 

MOORE OR LESS: Michael Moore says he'll be backing HILLARY CLINTON - if she's the Democratic nominee. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31d3e7ddb9e6428597fef460494710ee5a3b4b1c586b70449a1 

MIDNIGHT TRAIN TO GEORGIA: A new poll has HILLARY CLINTON and DONALD TRUMP statistically tied in Georgia. Yes, Georgia. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31d6ea9e6428b3796f14f5599cd70edc87664bf2bb759c3562c 

BLAST NOTE: Did you think we'd pass up an opportunity to link to Gladys Knight and the Pips? http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31de838ae5ef2dfc1b50d2807166aa4901011b93441b260f259 At the Blast we're always looking for a simpler place and time.

BERN AFTER READING: A meme making its way around the Internet does not tell BERNIE SANDERS supporters how to make glowsticks, but rather chlorine bombs. Yikes. (Mic) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31df04d628852984d73f4954f90ea26cd9970f210f788c8d556  

STILL SALT(ER)Y: POLITICO's Glenn Thrush talks to former McCain adviser Mark Salter about why the adviser won't back DONALD TRUMP. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31d623947f89d20b5f3e9871da27729fa45b037f13ab213f7f8 

PLATFORM PUSH: TED CRUZ supporters want to control the RNC platform in Cleveland. (The New York Times) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31d86f6f1668fe0c4a1b4fd8c707aba1bd6e89cfa90c35d7012 

TRUST ME: Reince Priebus says DONALD TRUMP doesn't want to change the Republican Party's platform. (BuzzFeed) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31d26e6b426b4190b99a81f2372c45cb42ee41344b6b951410a 

"DAILY" BOW: Former "Daily Show" host Jon Stewart goes on anti-Trump tirade, calls him a "man baby." Yup. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31dccf42d9f1b4b9fbb471cfbdb36165196443501d7a7cc10b6 

MONOPOLY MONEY: DONALD TRUMP says the U.S. can't default because it can just print more money. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=34c19e191b5ac31d77280a6a3a0eee14bd3aa5141d86e30f4c0a17b125c0fb64 

WHAT'S NEXT: BERNIE SANDERS rallies in Sacramento, Calif., tonight. West Virginia holds its primary tomorrow. 

THEY SAID IT: "I'm not a constitutional scholar, so I can't necessarily say, but are you eligible to run if you are a man-baby, or a baby-man?" - Jon Stewart, in reference to DONALD TRUMP. 

MAGIC NUMBER: 33 trillion. That's how much, in dollars, a new report pegs the cost of BERNIE SANDERS' policy proposals.
