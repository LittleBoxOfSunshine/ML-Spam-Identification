BULLETIN -- East Wing statement at 10:59 a.m.: "The President and Mrs. Obama announced today that their daughter Malia will attend Harvard University in the fall of 2017 as a member of the Class of 2021. Malia will take a gap year before beginning school."

INSIDE THE CAMPAIGNS - "Inside Cruz's camp, confidence crumbles: The candidate is projecting strength, but a string of discouraging signs has his advisers worried," by Alex Isenstadt in Burlingame, Calif.: "[S]everal aides ... expressed growing alarm that Cruz would lose Indiana's primary on Tuesday ... One senior aide said there had been no discussion about dropping out before the final primary contests are held on June 7 but noted that Cruz wouldn't be eager to prolong a campaign he was convinced he couldn't win. ... 

"'A Cruz loss in Indiana means lights out,' said Scott Reed, the chief political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 'Game, set, match.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9403a1ff697ecc6f9e7ded0820fbd574b324094eac475a5c2ff8fc122066b05 

OVERHEARD: Paul Manafort, to a guest at last night's White House Correspondents' Dinner, re Ted Cruz: "He's desperate." ... When the crowd was asked to get quiet for Michelle Obama, Jay Carney repeatedly clinked his glass to try to help silence the press but without much success: "They used to listen to me."

SUNDAY BEST ... Hillary Clinton to Jake Tapper on CNN's "State of the Union" (taped Friday at the 21 Club in Manhattan), re Trump: "I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak. I'm not gonna deal with their temper tantrums or their bullying or their efforts to try to provoke me. He can say whatever he wants to say about me. I could really care less. I'm gonna stand up for what I think the American people need and want in the next president." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9403a1ff697ecc66268eedda7067631a355397f21acaf3078dc390a6b36dbf3

HAPPY SUNDAY, and welcome to May! PRESIDENT OBAMA took the podium of last night's White House Correspondents' Association Dinner to Anna Kendrick singing, "You're gonna miss me when I'm gone." As the music faded, he began: "You can't say it, but you know it's true. (Laughter.) ... It is an honor to be here at my last -- and perhaps THE last -- White House Correspondents' Dinner. You all look great. The end of the Republic has never looked better. (Laughter and applause.) I do apologize -- I know I was a little late tonight. I was running on C.P.T. -- (laughter) -- which stands for 'jokes that white people should not make.' (Laughter and applause.) ... 

"My eighth and final appearance at this unique event. And I am excited. If this material works well, I'm going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year. (Laughter and applause.) Earn me some serious Tubmans. That's right. (Laughter and applause.) My brilliant and beautiful wife, Michelle, is here tonight. (Applause.) She looks so happy to be here. (Laughter.) That's called practice - it's like learning to do three-minute planks. (Laughter.) She makes it look easy now. (Laughter.) Next year at this time, someone else will be standing here in this very spot, and it's anyone's guess who she will be. ... 

"Eight years ago, I said it was time to change the tone of our politics. In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific. (Laughter.) Eight years ago, I was a young man, full of idealism and vigor, and look at me now. (Laughter.) I am gray and grizzled, just counting down the days till my death panel. (Laughter and applause.) ... And yet, somehow, despite all this, despite the churn, in my final year, my approval ratings keep going up. (Laughter.) The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major. (Laughter and applause.)

"And here's the thing: I haven't really done anything differently. So it's odd. Even my aides can't explain the rising poll numbers ... [SLIDE with side-by-side pics of snarling Trump and Cruz] (Laughter and applause.) Puzzling. ... 

"GOP Chairman Reince Priebus is here as well. (Applause.) Glad to see you that you feel that you've earned a night off. (Laughter.) Congratulations on all your success. The Republican Party, the nomination process -- it's all going great. Keep it up. (Laughter and applause.) ... 

"Bernie's slogan has helped his campaign catch fire among young people: 'Feel the Bern.' ... Hillary's slogan has not had the same effect. Let's see this. (SLIDE: "Trudge Up the Hill.") (Laughter.) Look, I've said how much I admire Hillary's toughness, her smarts, her policy chops, her experience. You've got to admit it, though: Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative just signed up for Facebook. (Laughter.) 'Dear America, did you get my poke?' (Laughter.) 'Is it appearing on your wall?' (Laughter.) 'I'm not sure I am using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.' (Laughter and applause.) It's not entirely persuasive. ... 

"I am a little hurt that [Trump's] not here tonight. We had so much fun the last time. (Laughter.) And it IS surprising: You've got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he says no? (Laughter.) Is this dinner too tacky for The Donald? (Laughter.) What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home, eating a Trump Steak -- (laughter) -- tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? (Laughter.) What's he doing? (Laughter.) 

"The Republican establishment is incredulous that he is their most likely nominee ... They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president. But, in fairness, he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan. ... 

"And with that, I just have two more words to say: 'Obama out.' [Drops mike.] (Laughter and applause.) Thank you. (Applause.)" Full video http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9403a1ff697ecc6aa23fe04a13993638c089939f43002f9bdc020f5741b5159

LARRY WILMORE, host of Comedy Central's "The Nightly Show," followed Obama, finishing off the night: "Nice to be here ... at the White House Correspondents' Dinner - or, as ... they're gonna call it next year: 'Donald Trump Presents a Luxurious Evening Paid for by Mexico.' I'm VERY scared of that. ... Seriously, you gotta give Mitch McConnell credit: At this point, he could block LeBron James. ... And I have to admit: It's not easy to follow the president, man. You got some JOKES, Mr. President. President's funny. Stay in your lane, man. You don't see me goin' around, presidentin' all the time, right? I don't go around passin' health care and signin' executive orders, pardoning turkeys, NOT
 closing Guantanamo. ... 

"But I have to say it's great: It looks like you're really enjoying your last year of your presidency. I saw you hanging out with NBA players like Steph Curry, Golden State Warriors. That was cool. That was cool, yeah. You know, it kinda makes sense, too, because both of you like RAINING DOWN BOMBS on people from long distances, right? [President makes 'Oooo' face.] What? Am I wrong? ... You guys are TOUGH, man. [Laughing.] 

"Senator Bernie Sanders is here tonight! Senator? Which I'm surprised: You never come to these things. He usually goes to the White House Correspondents' EARLY BIRD Dinner. ... But, man, you have to admit it IS a really tough race between Senator Bernie Sanders and Democrat Nominee Hillary Clinton. ... But I have to say, when it's all said and done, Mr. President after eight years in the White House, we are REALLY going to miss Michelle. We really are. Thank you for being a good sport, Mr. President.

"But all jokes aside, let me just say how much it means for me to be here tonight. ... When I was kid, I lived in a country where people couldn't accept a black QUARTERBACK. ... And NOW, to live in YOUR time, Mr. President, when a black man can lead the entire free world."

DAILY DONALD - N.Y. Times p. A1, top of col. 1, "Run on Ticket Beside Trump? Big Names Flee: In a Rarity, Politicians Are Seeking a Snub," by Patrick Healy and Ashley Parker: "'Never,' said Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Gov. John Kasich of Ohio ... 'No chance.' 'Hahahahahahahahaha,' wrote Sally Bradshaw, a senior adviser to Jeb Bush, when asked if he would consider it. 'Scott Walker has a visceral negative reaction to Trump's character,' said Ed Goeas, a longtime adviser ... Or, as Senator Lindsey Graham put it, 'That's like buying a ticket on the Titanic.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9403a1ff697ecc6d5c784394d30850deac0239cba31e5cfb07623db32638925

TRUMP'S MESSAGE: I WIN -- L.A. Times 2-col. lead, "Presidential hopefuls woo state GOP: Trump, Kasich and Cruz make their cases in terms of unity, electability and fish," by Cathleen Decker in Burlingame, Calif. (near SFO): "As if he were the political reincarnation of the late Oakland Raiders owner Al 'Just Win, Baby' Davis, Trump insisted that the point was a November victory - and that his campaign has proved he's a winner. His speech at the three-day state GOP convention had almost nothing to do with California. ... 

"The convention seemed to lean toward Trump's inevitability; no giant groundswell rose on behalf of Cruz, despite his red-meat speech that touched on the environment, immigration and the 2nd Amendment, or for Kasich's more laid-back approach." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9403a1ff697ecc649c3592e3faf43f4c60be7a9bdc59f2a3e0598e165f5992c

OUT AND ABOUT: Dozens of Politico reporters and editors, including publisher and editor-in-chief John Harris, descended on The Sovereign in Georgetown Friday night to bid au revoir to Nirvi Shah, who's departing for Politico Europe's HQ in Brussels. The group enjoyed a wide array of Belgian beers and classic Belgian style frites with mayonnaise.

MAYOR OF THE WORLD - Mike Bloomberg's commencement address to the University of Michigan's class of 2016, adapted into a Bloomberg View op-ed, "Here's Your Degree. Now Go Defeat Demagogues": "The most useful knowledge that you leave here with today [is] how to study, cooperate, listen carefully, think critically and resolve conflicts through reason. Those are the most important skills in the working world, and it's why colleges have always exposed students to challenging and uncomfortable ideas. The fact that some university boards and administrations now bow to pressure and shield students from these ideas through 'safe spaces,' 'code words' and 'trigger warnings' is, in my view, a
 terrible mistake. 

"The whole purpose of college is to learn how to deal with difficult situations -- not run away from them. A microaggression is exactly that: micro. And one of the most dangerous places on a college campus is a safe space, because it creates the false impression that we can insulate ourselves from those who hold different views. We can't do this, and we shouldn't try -- not in politics or in the workplace. In the global economy, and in a democratic society, an open mind is the most valuable asset you can possess." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9403a1ff697ecc672d519b5080d3ac4df8b26ea15e8a711557417f41b3d7c0d ...

REMEMBERING JULIE SODERLAND - Sacramento Bee's Dan Smith and Alexei Koseff: "Soderlund, a communications specialist who worked for former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carly Fiorina and other Republican causes in a career spent largely in Sacramento, died Thursday evening after a nine-month battle with melanoma. She was 38. Soderlund was known at the Capitol as a cheerful, skilled and respected communicator, working in Schwarzenegger's press office and helping with his political pursuits outside the government. ... In 2011, Soderlund took a job as a vice president with Philip Morris International, for which she worked extensively in Europe and Asia."

FROM THE FRONT ... "Nerdy fight breaks out at WHCD afterparty between Fox News and Huffington Post reporters," by WashPost's Emily Heil: At the MSNBC afterparty in "the early-morning hours of Sunday, a scuffle broke out between Fox News correspondent Jesse Watters and Ryan Grim, the Huffington Post's Washington bureau chief. ... Grim and Watters were ... in a heated tent just outside the main party area. ... Grim realized who Watters was and recalled a beef he had with the 'O'Reilly Factor' correspondent that dated back to 2009, when Watters, known as an 'ambush journalist,' had engineered an on-camera confrontation of writer Amanda Terkel, now a HuffPo colleague of Grim. ... 

"Grim decided to give Watters a taste of his own medicine, whipping out his camera phone and filming him. Watters didn't take well to this, eventually snatching the phone away from Grim and putting it in his pocket. Grim set out to retrieve it, and a scuffle ensued. ... 

"[T]he two flailed around a bit, upending a table and bumping into several people. 'Punches were definitely thrown,' said one witness. Before any damage was done, several bystanders, including RNC [chief strategist and comms director] Sean Spicer [and Politico's Ken Vogel], separated the two. ... Grim was unrepentant. 'Ambush guy can't take getting ambushed,' he said. 'Maybe he should think about his life choices.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=e9403a1ff697ecc6cd5d3c704d819d291dca512b22db466bb44db73b9004f955

#WHCD PARTY CIRCUIT: The highlight for Bloomberg and Vanity Fair guests who stayed to the end of the party came at around 2:45 a.m., when Mother Jones' David Corn played the piano, while remaining partiers gathered around and sang songs like "Purple Rain" and "Let It Be." Darren Criss from Glee, The Daily Beast's John Avlon, who used to sing in bands, Jamie Kirchick, and Bloomberg's Sahil Kapur sang along next to piano accompaniment from David; Darren had played earlier.

</b> took the podium of last night's White House Correspondents' Association Dinner to Anna Kendrick singing, &quot;You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.&quot; As the music faded, he began: &quot;You can't say it, but you know it's true. (Laughter.) ... It is an honor to be here at my last -- and perhaps THE last -- White House Correspondents' Dinner. You all look great. The end of the Republic has never looked better. (Laughter and applause.) I do apologize -- I know I was a little late tonight. I was running on C.P.T. -- (laughter) -- which stands for 'jokes that white people should not make.' (Laughter and applause.) ... </p><p><b>&quot;My eighth and final appearance
</b> at this unique event. And I am excited. If this material works well, I'm going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year. (Laughter and applause.) <b>Earn me some serious Tubmans.</b> That's right. (Laughter and applause.) My brilliant and beautiful wife, Michelle, is here tonight. (Applause.) She looks so happy to be here. (Laughter.) That's called practice - it's like learning to do three-minute planks. (Laughter.) She makes it look easy now. (Laughter.) Next year at this time, someone else will be standing here in this very spot, and it's anyone's guess who <b>she</b> will be. ... </p><p><b>&quot;Eight years ago, 
</b>I said it was time to change the tone of our politics. In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific. (Laughter.) Eight years ago, I was a young man, full of idealism and vigor, and look at me now. (Laughter.) I am gray and grizzled, just counting down the days till my death panel. (Laughter and applause.) ... And yet, somehow, despite all this, despite the churn, in my final year, my approval ratings keep going up. (Laughter.) <b>The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major.</b> (Laughter and applause.)</p><p><b>&quot;And here's the thing:
</b> I haven't really done anything differently. So it's odd. Even my aides can't explain the rising poll numbers ... [SLIDE with side-by-side pics of snarling Trump and Cruz] (Laughter and applause.) Puzzling. ... </p><p><b>&quot;GOP Chairman Reince Priebus</b> is here as well. (Applause.) Glad to see you that you feel that you've earned a night off. (Laughter.) Congratulations on all your success. The Republican Party, the nomination process -- it's all going great. Keep it up. (Laughter and applause.) ... </p><p><b>&quot;Bernie's slogan 
</b>has helped his campaign catch fire among young people: 'Feel the Bern.' ... Hillary's slogan has not had the same effect. Let's see this. (SLIDE: &quot;Trudge Up the Hill.&quot;) (Laughter.) Look, I've said how much I admire Hillary's toughness, her smarts, her policy chops, her experience. You've got to admit it, though: Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative just signed up for Facebook. (Laughter.) 'Dear America, did you get my poke?' (Laughter.) 'Is it appearing on your wall?' (Laughter.) 'I'm not sure I am using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.' (Laughter and applause.) It's not entirely persuasive. ... </p><p><b>&quot;I am a little hurt
</b> that [Trump's] not here tonight. We had so much fun the last time. (Laughter.) And it IS surprising: You've got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he says no? (Laughter.) Is this dinner too tacky for The Donald? (Laughter.) What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home, eating a Trump Steak -- (laughter) -- tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? (Laughter.) What's he doing? (Laughter.) </p><p><b>&quot;The Republican establishment
</b> is incredulous that he is their most likely nominee ... They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president. But, in fairness, he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan. ... </p><p><b>&quot;And with that,</b> I just have two more words to say: 'Obama out.'
