PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20





1:18 P.M. EDT





 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. It's nice to see you all. I gues=
s many of you are attending the briefing because your colleagues were ove=
r on the trip last week, but obviously it was an opportunity that the Pre=
sident had to do a lot of important work with our allies and partners aro=
und the world on a range of issues. So it was a successful trip, and I'm =
happy to talk about that or anything else that may be on your mind today.=




 So, Josh, do you want to start?



 Q Sure. Welcome back, Josh.



 MR. EARNEST: Thank you.



 Q South Korea says that North Korea is on the verge of a fifth nuclear t=
est. I was wondering whether the U.S. can confirm that you're seeing thos=
e preparations take place, and what kind of a U.S. response there would b=
e to such an action.



 MR. EARNEST: Josh, at this point I don't have a new assessment to share =
in terms of potential steps that North Korea could potentially take. Over=
 the last several months, we've seen them engage in a series of actions t=
hat are in direct contradiction to U.N. Security Council resolutions. We =
have expressed our strong concern about those provocative actions. We hav=
e marshalled the international community to respond accordingly. And earl=
ier this year, there was a response from the United Nations that actually=
 put in place the farthest-reaching sanctions against North Korea that ta=
rgeted specific elements of their economy, such as it is, that we know ar=
e used to fund these illicit activities.



 So we're going to continue to ramp up the pressure on the North Korean r=
egime. We're going to continue to work closely with the Chinese governmen=
t that has more influence with the North Korean government than any other=
 country in the world. And we're going to continue to make clear that the=
 path that North Korea must choose to rejoin the international community =
is one that involves them committing to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula=
 and come into compliance with their international obligations.



 Q I wanted to ask you about a letter that Senators Gillibrand and Grassl=
ey sent to the President asking them to -- asking the White House to inve=
stigate why Pentagon officials misled Congress about sexual assault cases=
. Essentially, the information that's come to light shows that the way th=
at the Pentagon characterized the cases undermined efforts to try and per=
form that process -- it takes the power away from commanders. Is there an=
y follow-up in the White House to that letter? Do you guys plan to heed t=
he senators' call for an investigation?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific response to the letter to share at =
this point. Obviously this question is the subject of some disagreement b=
etween officials at the Department of Defense and members of Congress. I =
know leading up to the production of this information there were extensiv=
e negotiations between members of Congress and the Department of Defense =
about this data. So this dispute and the way it's being characterized dif=
ferently by the two parties is not new.



 The President has made clear that this is a top priority of the Commande=
r-in-Chief. You've heard the President speak on a number of occasions qui=
te powerfully about the need to eradicate sexual assault from the militar=
y. The President has talked movingly about how victims in the United Stat=
es military should understand that the Commander-in-Chief has their back,=
 and the President has made clear to the civilian and military leadership=
 at the Department of Defense that eradicating sexual assault from the mi=
litary is a top priority.=20



 The President had an opportunity to reinforce that priority at the meeti=
ng that he convened with combatant commanders from around the world here =
at the White House earlier this month. The President convened that meetin=
g on April 6th in the Cabinet Room, and this was a conversation that the =
President had with the Secretary of Defense that all of the Joint Chiefs =
of Staff and the combatant commanders. And this continues to be a top pri=
ority. And the President anticipates and expects that the leadership will=
 follow through on reforms and other appropriate steps based on the Presi=
dent making this a priority.



 Q But, Josh, I mean, misleading members of Congress is a pretty serious =
charge. Does the White House have any concerns about the veracity of the =
information that Pentagon officials provided in testimony to members of C=
ongress?



 MR. EARNEST: Based on what I have read in the reports is that members of=
 Congress have expressed concerns about the way that the information was =
presented. At the same time, I've seen in in those reports that Departmen=
t of Defense officials have characterized that material as accurate.=20



 Q So you're siding with the Pentagon that --=20



 MR. EARNEST: What I'm observing at this point is that this information h=
as been the subject of long-running controversy between Congress and the =
Department of Defense. And while this is an important issue, the differen=
ce of agreement about the presentation of this information is something t=
hat they're going to have to resolve between Congress and the Department =
of Defense.



 It's important that this bureaucratic dispute not overshadow the way tha=
t the President has made this a top priority when it comes to military po=
licy. And the President has spoken on this publicly on a number of occasi=
ons, and even in his private meetings with the top leaders in the militar=
y, the President time and time again makes clear that the Commander-in-Ch=
ief has made this a priority and expects military leadership to follow th=
rough with the necessary steps to eliminate sexual assault from the milit=
ary.



 Q And on the campaign trail, Donald Trump said today that Hillary Clinto=
n has only gotten to where she's gotten because she's played the woman ca=
rd. Any thoughts about that statement from the White House?



 MR. EARNEST: Not really. I think Secretary Clinton and her team can cert=
ainly speak to her qualifications and her credentials, and I don't need t=
o weigh in.



 Tim.



 Q I wanted to ask about a division between the two governments in Libya.=
 Evidently, today, the government in eastern Libya shipped a cargo of cru=
de oil, much to the chagrin of the government in Tripoli. Does the admini=
stration have a reaction to that?



 MR. EARNEST: I haven't seen those specific reports. I can tell you that =
the United States was strongly supportive of the U.N. process that led to=
 the creation of the Government of National Accord that does now reside i=
n Tripoli. We've also been pretty candid about the significant challenges=
 that are facing that newly created government.=20



 Libya is a unique country. It was one that was presided over by an autoc=
ratic dictator for four decades. And the Qaddafi regime succeeded in esse=
ntially eroding any pillar of civil society or of government inside that =
country. And so when he was deposed, the country was struggling and conti=
nues to struggle with rebuilding those institutions that are critical to =
governing a large country like Libya.=20



And part of what the Government of National Accord is facing is building =
support among the variety of groups that have sprouted up to try to fill =
that vacuum. Some of them are armed groups. In other cases, there are fle=
dgling attempts to form some substance or some entity that looks like a g=
overnment. And the international community, including the United States, =
continues to support the effort of the GNA to unify that country. And tha=
t obviously is going to raise significant questions about security and pr=
oviding security for the country. It also is going to raise important eco=
nomic questions like how to effectively manage the oil supply in Cuba -- =
I'm sorry -- in Libya that obviously has significant consequences for tha=
t country's economy.



 So these are just some of the significant challenges that are facing the=
 government. And the United States, the United Nations, and other countri=
es around the world are strongly supportive of the GNA's efforts. We do n=
ot anticipate that they're going to succeed in unifying that country and =
restoring order to the chaos overnight. But over time, and with a commitm=
ent to basic principles, they will be successful.



 Q U.S. Special Forces have stopped another cargo -- before coming from t=
hat government. Is that an option here?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of a discussion about that, but, again, I did=
n't have a debriefing on this today because I hadn't seen the report.



 Q Turning to refugee issues in Kansas. Governor Brownback told the admin=
istration today that Kansas will withdraw from the U.S. relocation progra=
m for refugees. Do you have a reaction to that? And what would this mean,=
 practically? That no refugees would end up in Kansas?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen his letter, so we'll have to take a lo=
ok at the letter and get back to you on that.



 Q And just one more on Iran. Heavy-water purchase last week. The Departm=
ent of Energy said at the time that it's not going to be -- the U.S. is n=
ot going to be the customer for the heavy-water forever. And Tom Cotton, =
Senator Cotton has introduced an amendment saying no U.S. dollars would g=
o to another purchase. How confident is the U.S. that another country wil=
l step up and make more of these purchases?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I'm certainly not an expert on the global market for =
heavy-water. But I can tell you that the United States, through the Depar=
tment of Energy, did make this properly licensed purchase of about 32 met=
ric tons of heavy-water. There is a market for heavy-water, particularly =
when it comes to applications related to industry and research here in th=
e United States. And that's how that material will be used by the Departm=
ent of Energy -- to essentially sell it at market prices to entities that=
 would use it for industrial or research purposes here in the United Stat=
es.



 I should underscore that there this is no -- that heavy-water is not rad=
ioactive. It doesn't pose any sort of public health concern. But it is va=
luable in terms of its use in these particular technical applications.=20=




 More generally, I can say that this is consistent with Iran fulfilling t=
heir obligations as a part of their Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. T=
his was the international deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear w=
eapon. Part of the prescribed steps that they had to take was to reduce t=
heir nuclear stockpile and that involved reducing their technological nuc=
lear capabilities. So Iran did have to ship a bunch of its heavy-water ou=
t of the country, and that's what they've done and now they're selling of=
f the stockpile. And the United States has purchased some of it for resal=
e to entities in the United States that would use it for research purpose=
s or even industrial purposes in some cases.



 As it relates to Senator Cotton's amendment, I'm not aware of what sort =
of impact this could potentially have. I guess I would suggest that if he=
 has genuine concerns about this, maybe he can just write another letter =
to the Supreme Leader and see how far that gets him. (Laughter.)



 On that note, Jon.



 Q Thanks. What was the President's reaction to the brutal killing in Ban=
gladesh of the Foreign Service national who worked for USAID? Did he shar=
e that with you?



 MR. EARNEST: Jon, I can tell you that this is a murder that the United S=
tates government strongly condemns. The individual who was killed was the=
 employee of the U.S. Agency for International Development in Bangladesh.=
 His name was Xulhaz Mannan. Mr. Mannan served the U.S. embassy in Dhaka =
with distinction, and he worked on behalf of his fellow Bangladeshis as a=
 voice for justice, equality, human rights for all, including for the loc=
al LGBT community. And while his death is obviously a significant tragedy=
, there are also reports that indicate that he was targeted because of hi=
s advocacy for these human rights, and that makes his death even more tra=
gic than it seems.



 Mr. Mannan set an example of dignity, courage, and selflessness, and his=
 legacy will live on in the causes that he championed. We extend our deep=
est sympathies to Mr. Mannan's loved ones as they mourn his loss. And we =
strongly encourage the government of Bangladesh to ensure that the perpet=
rators of this senseless crime are brought to justice. I can tell you tha=
t the U.S. government has already been in touch with the government of Ba=
ngladesh to make it clear that this investigation is a priority. And we a=
re pleased to see that, so far, the government is moving forward with the=
 kind of thorough criminal investigation that we would expect them to con=
duct.



 Q Does the President believe that the government of Bangladesh should ta=
ke a stronger public stance against these high-profile crimes? It seems l=
ike there have been a few, not just this one.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, our expectation is that the government=
 of Bangladesh should engage in a serious criminal investigation to deter=
mine who is responsible and to bring those individuals to justice. Theyve=
 committed a heinous crime and they should be held accountable for it.



 Q One more question on Judge Garland. I believe it's been 4i days since =
he was nominated. Is the pressure that the White House is putting on Repu=
blicans, is it making any sort of impact on Capitol Hill? What do you see=
 developing over the last several weeks?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think in the last week or so we have seen some sign=
s that Republicans continue to feel pressure from the American public as =
they refuse to do their job. This is a convenient opportunity for me to s=
ay that Chief Judge Garland will be participating in a number of other me=
etings on Capitol Hill over the course of this week. Tomorrow, Wednesday,=
 he has meetings scheduled with Senator Lankford of Oklahoma, Senator Inh=
ofe of Oklahoma, Senator Rounds of South Dakota, and Senator Nelson of Fl=
orida. And on Thursday, he'll meet with Senator Peters of Michigan and Se=
nator Widen of Oregon.=20



 So hes going to continue to have meetings with individual senators. This=
 is consistent with the way the process usually works. And the way the pr=
ocess usually works is that after these private meetings are completed th=
at theres an open hearing that is scheduled. And the kinds of issues that=
 are discussed in private by the Chief Judge and individual members of th=
e Senate are then discussed publicly. And that's appropriate.=20



 And there are certainly a number of Republicans -- 11 -- who have alread=
y met with -- 11 Republican senators who have already met with Chief Judg=
e Garland and many of them have had nice things to say about the Judge. W=
e heard Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina indicate that Chief Ju=
dge Garlands reputation is beyond reproach. Senator Portman described Chi=
ef Judge Garland as an impressive guy. Senator Toomey described Chief Jud=
ge Garland as very, very smart, very knowledgeable. And Senator Flake not=
ed that Chief Judge Garland is obviously a man of accomplishment and keen=
 intellect.=20



 I think the question for all of these senators who have made a strong ca=
se that the American public should have a voice in this process -- I thin=
k the question is why are they denying the American public the opportunit=
y to hear directly from Chief Judge Garland? Why wouldn't they support a =
hearing, particularly when they have nice things to say about him? I also=
 understand that Senator Toomey had some criticisms to lodge against Chie=
f Judge Garlands record. I would actually make the case that that is all =
the more reason to hold a hearing.=20



 Even across party lines, I think most Americans subscribe to this genera=
l notion of fairness, and for Senator Toomey to criticize Chief Judge Gar=
land and his record without giving Chief Judge Garland the opportunity to=
 answer questions about it, that's just unfair. And it's even worse when =
you consider that it's Senator Toomeys job to ensure that Chief Judge Gar=
land has an opportunity to discuss these issues in public. So it's not ju=
st unfair, it is a classic example of Washington obstruction that, frankl=
y, I think the American people are going to be pretty dissatisfied with. =
And theres plenty of public polling to indicate that that's the case.



 And, look, the message has gotten through at least in the state of Flori=
da; you have a Republican candidate for the United States Senate who, I u=
nderstand, just yesterday said, I do think he should have a hearing and I=
 would like to see a vote. That's not a Democrat saying that. That is a R=
epublican candidate for the United States Senate. And I think that is a p=
retty good piece of evidence that somebody who is obviously making a pret=
ty direct appeal to the people of Florida that he should be the represent=
ative of their state and that legislative body that his view is consisten=
t with the expectations of most of his -- most of the citizens in his sta=
te.=20



 And I think it's notable that we're not talking about a candidate for th=
e United States Senate that's a Democrat. We're not even talking about a =
candidate for the United States Senate that's a Republican that's running=
 in a blue state. We're talking about a Republican candidate that's runni=
ng in the biggest swing state in the country, and even he is making the c=
ase that Chief Judge Garland deserves a hearing and a vote.=20



So I think that's a pretty good piece of evidence that Republicans contin=
ue to feel pressure from the public. And they should. Theyve taken a posi=
tion that's stands in stark contrast to the expectations not just of a ma=
jority of Democrats and independents, but in plenty of polls theres stron=
g indications that the position that theyve taken is not even approved of=
 by a majority of Republicans.



Q Just one more, quick question. This is on a different topic. But Senato=
r Durbin and a couple others are on Capitol Hill today calling for a ban =
on powered caffeine -- just one teaspoon of this can kill somebody -- doe=
s the White House support a ban on powered caffeine?



MR. EARNEST: I am not aware of the policy position that we've taken on th=
is. But let me check with our Domestic Policy Council staff and see if th=
eres a position that we can particularly take.



Luke.



Q Thank you. Recent reports that the White House is considering releasing=
 the 28 pages of the joint inquiry from Congress regarding 9/11 sources o=
f foreign support. Is there any update on that and when those 28 pages co=
uld be released?



MR. EARNEST: Well, to be clear, this would not be released from the White=
 House.=20



Q But if you approved the release from Congress.=20



MR. EARNEST: Well, it's material that is currently being reviewed by the =
Office of the Director of National Intelligence, so Director Clappers off=
ice is currently conducting a review to determine how or whether this mat=
erial could be released without compromising national security. Obviously=
 it's classified right now and they are engaged in a process to determine=
 if we can declassify that information so that it could be released.=20



This is consistent with the process that the Directors office undertakes =
whenever a piece of information is considered for declassification, and t=
his is obviously something that theyve been working on for a long time. I=
 think this has been going through the process for over a year now. And I=
 think that's an indication of just how seriously theyre taking this matt=
er.



I saw that Director Clapper had an opportunity just yesterday to discuss =
it, and he indicated that he viewed a June time frame as a realistic goal=
 from completing the process of reviewing this information. You will have=
 to check with his office to see whether or not -- what that actually mea=
ns about the process, but I think it is an indication that Director Clapp=
er is approaching this with the seriousness that is required and that we =
would all expect.



Q Can this be expedited at all because of a bill that while it doesnt dir=
ectly address that -- the Schumer-Cornyn bill -- which would essentially =
allow the families of victims of terrorists killed on American soil to su=
e foreign governments, and Saudi Arabia has been brought up. Is that expe=
dited this at all as sort of a carrot in a way in this ongoing discussion=
?



MR. EARNEST: What I can say is this. For the process and for the timeline=
 that's been established, I'd encourage you to check with Director Clappe=
r's office. I can tell you the White House has not made a request of Dire=
ctor Clapper with regard to the process as a result of the legislation be=
ing filed.



 Q And lastly, a recent announcement -- 250 more troops to Syria to comba=
t ISIS. The President saying to "keep up the momentum." Is there a possib=
ility for more troops to be deployed in the near future?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Luke, the President's approach to this situation has =
been to direct his national security team to consider the range of elemen=
ts in our strategy. And you'll recall that it was a few months ago that t=
he President initially announced that there would be this commitment of 5=
0 Special Operators to Syria to see if we could deepen our coordination w=
ith the forces in Syria that are fighting ISIL. And what the Department o=
f Defense has found is that the efforts of the preliminary commitment of =
Special Operators proved to be quite useful.

=20

And through deepened coordination and better organization on the ground, =
we saw improved performance of those forces on the battlefield. And we sa=
w that the United States and our coalition partners were better able to c=
oordinate our efforts with them. And the judgment that was reached by the=
 United States military is that an additional contingent of Special Opera=
tors moving into Syria would advance that coordination and that cooperati=
on even further, and that that would yield even more progress on the grou=
nd. That's why the President approved the request that the Department of =
Defense brought forward for that additional contingent of troops.

=20

So, to answer your question directly, I think what that means is that if =
this additional commitment of additional troops yields positive results, =
and the Department of Defense concludes that, again, additional results c=
ould be generated with an additional commitment, then that's something th=
at the President would consider.=20



Obviously this is something that both the Department of Defense and the C=
ommander-in-Chief would consider quite carefully given the significant ri=
sk that these Special Operators are facing. They're not in a combat role,=
 but they are in a role that puts them in harm's way. They are armed for =
combat. They are armed to defend themselves if necessary. But the role th=
at they have is to offer advice and assistance to forces on the ground fi=
ghting ISIL in their own country. And that has proved to be a valuable to=
ol and one that the President is seeking to intensify.



Q Considering we dont have a formal AUMF for Syria, are there any geograp=
hic limitations on this time of deployment? Libya has ISIS factions. We s=
ee some in Africa, as well. Is this something that the American people co=
uld expect to see in other parts of the world?



MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any geographic limitations that have been p=
ut in place. Obviously, each country is different, though. Libya is a goo=
d example. There are military operations that the Commander-in-Chief has =
ordered against ISIL targets in Libya. There have been a couple of report=
s of airstrikes carried out against ISIL targets that have -- back in Nov=
ember took off the battlefield the individual who at the time was describ=
ed as the most senior ISIL official in the country. There have been other=
 strikes carried out against ISIL targets that included -- or at least on=
e instance in which a military strike was taken against an ISIL target wh=
ere fighters had congregated in one location.=20



So the President has not hesitated to order military action in Libya, whe=
n necessary, to protect the American people and to further advance our ca=
mpaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. There are other places in =
Africa where the United States is working closely with host governments t=
o help them combat extremism within their own country. I think the most p=
rominent example of this is a concern that we have about Boko Haram. And =
there are U.S. forces -- U.S. personnel in Nigeria that are working close=
ly with the Nigerian government as they fight those extremist elements in=
 their own country.



So we've been clear about what our strategy is, and that strategy is to b=
uild up the capacity of local forces in countries around the world to fig=
ht extremism. And there are a variety of ways that we do that. In the sit=
uation in Iraq, we obviously work closely with the Iraqi central governme=
nt and support the efforts of Iraqi forces. In Syria, we obviously dont h=
ave a situation where we can coordinate with the central government in Sy=
ria. We certainly would like to see that, and that's why we believe that =
a political transition in that country is overdue. But since we can't coo=
rdinate directly with the central government in Syria, we're working with=
 those forces on the ground with whom we are able to cooperate, and we ar=
e seeing some progress against ISIL targets in Syria.



So each of these countries has taken -- is considered individually for th=
e appropriate strategy that will protect the American people -- that is o=
bviously the first priority -- to advance our campaign to degrade and des=
troy ISIL, but also to build the capacity of fighters to take the fight t=
o ISIL in their own country. And the reason for that is that the United S=
tates cannot be a substitute for those kinds of forces. We cannot impose =
a military solution on ISIL in any country around the world. And, in some=
 cases, it may require military involvement to build the capacity of loca=
l fighters to take the fight to ISIL, but the President has made clear th=
at the United States military will not be a substitute for the effectiven=
ess of local fighters.

Mike.



Q The Senate Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, said he was blaming the Oba=
ma administration for delays in Puerto Rico on a solution, saying that th=
e cause of the delays is questions raised by the Treasury Department. I w=
as wondering what your response was to that. Do you agree with him, or di=
sagree with him? What's your feeling?



MR. EARNEST: I strongly disagree. And fortunately, the facts are on my si=
de in this one. You may recall, Mike -- I think you've been covering this=
 story closely, so you will recall this -- somewhere there's a Bloomberg =
story out there, possibly with your byline on it, that dates back to Octo=
ber 21st, 2015. For those of you scoring along at home, that is 188 days =
ago. And that story included a summarization of our legislative proposal =
for addressing the situation in Puerto Rico. So we put forward our propos=
al 188 days ago. It's a little ironic for Leader McCarthy or any other Re=
publican to come forward after 188 days and suggest that somehow the Obam=
a administration has been slow to act to address the situation in Puerto =
Rico.



Q What is your assessment of the risk that there will not be some sort of=
 solution in place by July 1st, when Puerto Rico has to make a $2 billion=
 payment?



MR. EARNEST: Look, I go to great lengths to avoid putting myself in a sit=
uation of predicting a positive outcome from Congress, particularly becau=
se there are plenty of common-sense things that Congress should do that t=
hey dont. In many cases, there are a variety of explanation for that. Som=
etimes that is just run-of-the-mill congressional dysfunction. Sometimes =
it is the fact that Republicans allow ideology and partisan politics and =
political considerations to get in front of core American priorities. In =
some cases, it's because the issues that they're working through are real=
ly complicated and really hard. As it relates to Puerto Rico, it's probab=
ly some combination of all three of those things.

=20

And so I can tell you that at least we are encouraged by the fact that th=
e Republican Leader of the House has finally acknowledged that there's so=
mething that needs to be addressed here. For most of the last 188 days, w=
e havent seen much responsiveness from Republicans in Congress. We havent=
 seen much of a sense of urgency about needing to act on this. So if he f=
eels the need to come out and criticize the Obama administration, even if=
 it's false, because he's feeling some political pressure to act, that mi=
ght be evidence of potential movement in the future. And we certainly wou=
ld like to see it. We've been very clear about what we believe needs to b=
e part of the solution.

=20

We do believe that the Puerto Rican government should be given access to =
an orderly restructuring regime. We believe that the Puerto Rican governm=
ent should also be held accountable for following through on financial re=
forms, including through an independent fiscal oversight body that would =
-- or at least some form of independent fiscal oversight that would ensur=
e and hold the government accountable for following through on the reform=
s.=20



We also believe that a reform of the Medicaid program in Puerto Rico woul=
d have positive benefits both for Puerto Rico's fiscal situation but also=
 for the health of the Puerto Rican people. We also believe that providin=
g Puerto Rico access to the earned income tax credit could have a positiv=
e impact on Puerto Ricos economy in a way that would also further their e=
fforts to dig out of a pretty deep fiscal hole.=20



 Q Related somewhat to Lukes question, in the meeting with the European l=
eaders on Monday, was more substantial intervention in Libya discussed?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have a whole lot more to describe about that =
meeting beyond what you saw on the readout. I can just tell you in genera=
l that there is concern among our European allies about the situation in =
Libya. And as I mentioned in response to Lukes question, President Obama =
has already demonstrated a commitment and a willingness to order U.S. mil=
itary action in Libya where necessary to protect the United States. And h=
e continues to recognize that that's a priority and hes willing to take a=
dditional military action, if necessary, to protect the United States.=20=




 There is a strong sense, however, that like in Syria, a military solutio=
n cannot be imposed on Libya. And that's why you've seen the United State=
s and our European allies be so strongly supportive of the Government of =
National Accord and hopeful that that fledgling government can succeed in=
 unifying the country, in trying to restore some order to the chaos that =
they have sustained, try to institute some order over the security situat=
ion, some control over the security situation in Libya, and also begin to=
 address the wide range of economic questions.=20



When you have sustained the kind of damage to their infrastructure -- bot=
h governmental and physical -- in Libya, that's going to have some pretty=
 significant negative consequences for the economy. And that's why there =
are important decisions that need to be made the GNA about restoring the =
strength of their economy.



 Q Lastly in the context of the Presidents remarks on being prepared prob=
ably by the end of the year for an assault on Mosul, I was really struck =
by The New York Times article yesterday on the situation in now Anbar Pro=
vince and in Fallujah where, as you know, your allies, the Iraqi governme=
nt is laying siege to Fallujah. And many of the civilians are not getting=
 much food. In the Times story, their reporting showed that the price of =
a bag of flour in Baghdad at $15 would cost you $750 in Fallujah because =
of the siege. Is that a tactic the administration feels comfortable with?=
 And would you like to see it replicated against the Sunni civilian popul=
ation in Mosul?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, Mike, when you are encountering a situatio=
n where you have extremists that have essentially set up shop in some of =
the largest cities in your country, that's going to have a profound and p=
rofoundly negative impact on the local population. And one of the things =
that President Obama spent some time talking about in Saudi Arabia is the=
 need for additional economic support to the Iraqi government for those a=
reas that have been liberated from ISIL.



Ramadi is a good example. That's a country where -- that is a community i=
n Iraq that is still trying to rebuild and recover after enduring many mo=
nths of ISILs reign of terror. And for the central government in Iraq to =
succeed in rebuilding and restoring those communities, they're going to n=
eed some economic resources.



 And this is a good example of where countries in the region can step up =
and offer economic assistance to the central government in Iraq that will=
 have a tangible, positive impact on our campaign against ISIL.



 Q But still in Fallujah, which the government hasnt retaken, they're ess=
entially laying siege to the city, which starves the civilian population.=
=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, my point is that obviously the central government in =
Iraq is dealing with a very difficult situation, and trying to root out I=
SIL fighters is, of course, going to have a negative impact on the local =
population. That's the reason it is so important for the Iraqi government=
, once they have succeeded in driving ISIL out of these communities, to h=
ave the support from other countries in the region and other countries ar=
ound the world for rebuilding and restoring those communities that have e=
ndured such great loss.



 Suzanne.



 Q Josh, Speaker Ryan says he hasn't read the 28 pages that are currently=
 being considered to be declassified from the 9/11 Commission, but he bel=
ieves that it would not be detrimental for the U.S. and Saudi relationshi=
p, saying "There's the Saudi Arabia then, and now there's the Saudi Arabi=
a now." And he also -- he brings up the example of the Saudis cooperating=
 in tracking financing of terrorists. Does the President agree with that =
assessment that there would not be a negative impact? And if so, is that =
because the role of the Saudis has changed, or when you take a look at th=
ose 28 pages, there really is no there there in terms of them contributin=
g to the 9/11 attacks?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, let me say a couple of things about this. The first t=
hing that comes to mind is that we have made the point that we have seen =
an improvement in the way the Saudi government has confronted extremism b=
oth in their country and around the world since 9/11. That prior to 9/11,=
 there was a sense that the Saudi government didn't recognize the risk of=
 extremist groups operating either in Saudi Arabia or around the world, b=
ut since 9/11, we have seen the Saudi government engage with a greater se=
nse of purpose in efforts to counter those extremist activities, and to c=
ounter the activities of extremist organizations that are trying to propa=
gate a hateful extremist ideology.=20



That is part of what has made Saudi Arabia a valuable partner of the Unit=
ed States. We have seen tangible Saudi contributions to efforts that stre=
ngthen American national security. And the basis of that coordination and=
 cooperation is the basis of the important relationship the United States=
 and Saudi Arabia have today. It's why President Obama has traveled to Sa=
udi Arabia four times as President of the United States -- more than any =
other President in American history.



 And this is a relationship that, while complicated because of the obviou=
s differences between our two countries, there are areas of common ground=
, particularly as it relates to taking the steps to protect our national =
security. And the President has worked hard to cultivate that relationshi=
p even further.



 I haven't read the 28 pages, so I can't offer up my own assessment about=
 what impact it would have on the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia. Sp=
eaker Ryan is certainly entitled to his own opinion, but, as he pointed o=
ut, it's an opinion that he has offered up without having read the 28 pag=
es.=20



The process that we're engaged in now is a process whereby people who hav=
e read the 28 pages can consider the range of ramifications of releasing =
that material and declassifying it so that it can be read by the American=
 public. And that's what they're doing. And that's what I think the Ameri=
can people would expect, which is carefully consider how transparent it's=
 possible to be without posing undue risk to our national security.



 I think the other thing that's relevant is that the conclusions of the 9=
/11 Commission have been made public. They have been declassified. And yo=
u saw the -- I don't know if you saw the statement from Governor Kaine an=
d from former Congressman Hamilton about the work of the 9/11 Commission.=
 They indicated that they did read the 28 pages. They described those 28 =
pages as being "almost entirely raw, unvetted material that came to the F=
BI." And this is material that the 9/11 Commission did have an opportunit=
y to vet. It is material they did have an opportunity to follow up on. An=
d they discussed the range of interviews that they conducted to pursue th=
e leads that were included in that material.=20



 And the conclusions of the 9/11 Commission is something that we've talke=
d about in here quite extensively. The conclusion of the 9/11 Commission =
is that Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of al Qa=
eda funding, but we have found no evidence that the Saudi government, as =
an institution, or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organiz=
ation.



 So I think the point is, there is an outside blue ribbon commission that=
 was established to take a look at what contributed to the 9/11 attacks a=
nd what reforms we could put in place to prevent an attack like that from=
 ever happening again. They had an opportunity to look carefully at the 2=
8 pages. They had an opportunity to follow up carefully on the informatio=
n that was included in the 28 pages. And they reached the declassified co=
nclusion that they did not find evidence that the Saudi government as an =
institution, or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organizati=
on.



 Q And just coming off this trip with Saudi Arabia, does the President fe=
el more reassurances that this is not going to be something that is going=
 to impact the relationship?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the best way to describe that -- well, let me=
 say it this way. When the President had an opportunity to sit down with =
King Salman in Saudi Arabia -- as you know, he spent about two hours talk=
ing to him about a range of issues that are critically important to both =
of our countries -- and King Salman never raised this question about the =
28 pages. I think in some ways that is a testament to the wide range of o=
ther important issues that the two leaders had to discuss. But I think it=
 also is an indication that there are a range of other things that are mo=
re important to the relationship between our two countries than just thes=
e 28 pages.



 Q Should we read into that that the President didn't bring it up, either=
? The 28 pages?



 MR. EARNEST: That's correct. The President did not bring it up, either.



 Q And just on another thing. The Senate race here in Maryland -- Van Hol=
len and Donna Edwards. There are some people who are saying this is turni=
ng into identity politics as opposed to based on ideology -- that the way=
 people are voting in Maryland are along racial lines. Does the President=
 have an opinion or an assessment of how that's playing out here --



MR. EARNEST: I think it's too early to draw that kind of conclusion becau=
se people are voting right now, even as we speak. So we can take a look a=
t the results tomorrow and determine whether or not that's an appropriate=
 conclusion to draw, and whether or not there's any evidence to substanti=
ate that claim.



 Gardiner.



 Q Another question for Leader McCarthy. He says that Republicans still h=
ave not been given all the answers to their questions on Zika. And so I'm=
 just wondering, is the White House aware of any outstanding questions fr=
om Congress on Zika funding? And if so, is there a timeline for answering=
 them? And then just in addition to that -- I might as well just add it n=
ow -- there's a complaint that you guys have not stipulated how the money=
 needs to be apportioned between a supplemental for Fiscal Year '16 and t=
he regular appropriations process for Fiscal Year '17.



 MR. EARNEST: To the extent there is a regular appropriations process in =
Congress.



 Q But I mean, have you guys -- do you guys have sort of -- how much, spe=
cifically, do you need for supplemental in '16 and how much can wait for =
the '17 approps?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, let me take your question about providing information=
 to Congress first. As I've noted previously, there have been 48 open pub=
lic hearings in Congress where questions about Zika have been asked and a=
nswered by administration officials. I think that's an indication that th=
ere have been a variety of venues where any member of Congress, Democrat =
or Republican, has had an opportunity to ask a senior administration offi=
cial a question about Zika.=20



So if there are any unanswered questions about the strategy that the admi=
nistration has put forward to fight Zika and to protect the American peop=
le from Zika, I think it's members of Congress themselves who are respons=
ible for not having answers to those questions because they've had ample =
opportunity to ask them.



 That being said, if, after 48 open public hearings, some Republican who =
hasn't shown up to the hearings continues to have outstanding questions, =
I'm confident that we can find a way to try to answer the question. That'=
s the first thing.



 I think the second thing is, and I've --=20



 Q Just to be clear, you don't know of any outstanding questions, like so=
me list of questions they've sent you that you guys haven't responded to?=




 MR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. But, look, I wouldn't put it past so=
me Republican that I've never heard of producing a detailed list of quest=
ions that they say has been residing on their website for a couple of wee=
ks.=20



 So I think my point is, send the questions over; we'll take a look. But =
there's no excuse for them having those unanswered questions when you con=
sider that we've already put forward a detailed legislative proposal more=
 than two months ago now. We've already participated in 48 hearings in wh=
ich questions about Zika have been raised. There have been briefings that=
 have been convened by senior administration officials for both the House=
 and the Senate to discuss this issue.=20



So I guess what I would say for members of Congress who say that they hav=
e questions about the administration's Zika strategy, that ignorance is n=
ot an excuse. They've had opportunities to ask their questions. There's a=
mple information that's been provided by the administration. And I don't =
think their constituents are going to find it an acceptable response when=
 there is a widespread media freak-out about the Zika virus that Republic=
ans haven't acted because they didn't get their questions answered.



 Your second question was about?



 Q Supplemental.



MR. EARNEST: Supplemental. Well, you've heard from public health professi=
onals that they don't have all the resources that they need right now to =
do everything that they believe they could do to protect the America peop=
le from the Zika virus. Now, part of that is because -- particularly as i=
t relates to our efforts to develop a vaccine -- the government needs to =
demonstrate a long-term commitment to funding these efforts. The efforts =
to develop a vaccine and to manufacture that vaccine will include a robus=
t role for the private sector. And the private sector will only fully eng=
age when they see that they have a customer that's committed to buying th=
e product.=20



And so that's why the delay that we've seen thus far is already problemat=
ic. And its also why the suggestion that Republicans are just going to ti=
e Zika funding to a totally inept budget process is also destined to fail=
.



 This is an emergency. Our public health professionals have said as much.=
 And the American people are counting on the Congress to act. And instead=
, we've gotten bureaucratic excuses from Congress about why theyve done n=
othing. And right now they havent paid a significant price for that. But =
at some point, there are going to be direct, specific, serious questions =
asked to members of Congress -- particularly Republicans -- about why the=
y havent done anything. And Im not sure exactly what their explanation wi=
ll be.=20



And that's also why, Gardiner, we don't take a lot of solace in Republica=
n proposals to say that theyll attach an emergency appropriation to a reg=
ular appropriations bill. What evidence is there that regular appropriati=
ons bills are going to pass either house of Congress, let alone both? Rep=
ublicans in the House havent even passed a budget, despite the fact that =
the deadline passed a couple of weeks ago. And Leader McConnell has indic=
ated that its not clear to him when a budget is ever going to pass the Un=
ited States Senate.=20



 So, again, its pretty simple exactly what we need here. There is no reas=
on it should be bogged down in partisan politics. Theres no question of i=
deology or principle at stake, other than the basic public health and wel=
l-being of the American public. And right now that has fallen victim to a=
 Republican refusal to govern.=20



 Q Josh, the Democrats have suggested a supplemental that also includes f=
unding for Flint water, as well as for the opioid crisis. Obviously, thes=
e are three crises. But if the Zika virus is truly -- the opioid epidemic=
, obviously, has been going on for 15 years. If the Zika crisis is truly =
this summers public health emergency, why not just a supplemental just ab=
out Zika? Why not tell your allies in Congress, look, this goes to the he=
ad of the line, just a clean Zika bill, we need it to pass right away?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think ultimately members of Congress are goi=
ng to have to decide how this moves through the legislative process. We'v=
e talked about the urgency that Congress should feel about giving our pub=
lic health professionals the resources that they need to fight Zika. And =
we've even presented our own proposal for how we believe Congress should =
do that, what those resources should look like.=20



 But, look, we've also acknowledged that there is a role for Congress to =
play in helping Flint deal with the situation with their water supply. Th=
at's a pretty urgent situation, too. There are some other things that we =
can do to manage that situation. But there is a role for Congress to play=
 here, and Congress has been AWOL on this one, as well.=20



 As it relates to opioids, this is a -- I guess in some ways, the way I w=
ould differentiate the opioid crisis from the Zika situation is that weve=
 long passed the point at which the opioid crisis has taken effect. This =
is a problem that reached crisis proportions quite a while ago. And I do =
think that's why you've seen bipartisan rhetoric, at least, to making thi=
s public health question a priority. The administration has put forward a=
 very specific proposal for how we believe additional resources could be =
used to fight the opioid epidemic. And wed encourage Democrats and Republ=
icans to work together on that, as well.=20



 So, ultimately, members of Congress are going to have to decide how to a=
ddress these priorities. This what governing is all about. And the irony =
of the situation that you've raised is that there is a reason that we can=
 have legitimate discussions and even debates about the appropriate fundi=
ng levels for the Department of Education. There are some basic questions=
 that go to core political beliefs about the proper role of government. T=
hat's not an excuse for congressional inaction, but it is an explanation =
for why you would have long-running debates about appropriate levels of f=
unding for that agency.



 But when it comes to giving our public health professionals the resource=
s that they need to fight Zika, or fighting the opioid epidemic, or even =
helping an American city rebuild their water supply, I don't understand w=
hy that would get bogged down in partisanship. Theres no reason that shou=
ld come into conflict with the ideology of anybody who has got the best i=
nterests of the American people at heart. It shouldnt. And, unfortunately=
, in the fact of a Republican Congress that time and time again refuses t=
o do its job, it has.=20



 Q Im sorry to say that The Washington Post had a very good story today a=
bout this crisis and how the juggling of funds that has happened within t=
he administration is causing ripple effects and problems across states, a=
cross the country. Is that -- can you confirm that? Is that, indeed, happ=
ening -- because you have not gotten this emergency funding from Congress=
 specifically from Zika, you are having to do a juggling act that is havi=
ng ripple effects that is causing problems around the country?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Yes. I happened to see the story, too. And I do think that =
it did chronicle the significant challenge that our public health profess=
ionals and that our emergency responders are facing right now. And they'r=
e not getting any help from Congress. In fact, Congress is making the pro=
blem worse. Congress has put our emergency response officials in a situat=
ion of choosing which oncoming potential disaster to prepare for, as oppo=
sed to doing the responsible thing and making sure that our emergency res=
ponders have all the resources that they need to protect us.=20



Knowing that there's -- here's the thing. When you're an emergency manage=
r, you're often in a situation in which you are responding to a situation=
 that nobody could have ever predicted. No one can predict the exact path=
 of a tornado. Nobody knows exactly how powerful a hurricane will strike =
the American coast this summer, if at all. Those are emergency situations=
 that can't be predicted in advance, but yet our expectation is that our =
emergency managers are going to have the necessary resources to deploy a =
flexible response and to keep us all safe.



 The question with Zika is, in some ways, not quite as complicated. We ha=
ve known for months that this was a virus that could threaten the America=
n people, particularly as it relates to pregnant women. And we've known f=
or months what kinds of steps we can take to fight it. There's nothing th=
at we can do on this short of notice to make sure the Zika virus never en=
ters the United States, but there are a whole bunch of things that we can=
 do to blunt its impact. We can better fight the mosquito population -- t=
hat by personnel that can quickly respond in certain situations to go and=
 kill mosquitos, that can actually have the effect of protecting an entir=
e community.



 One of the things that our public health professionals have talked about=
 is that if they detect that an individual has tested positive for Zika, =
that essentially a strike team should go into that person's neighborhood =
and try to eradicate as many mosquitos as possible around that person's h=
ouse to prevent a mosquito from biting that person and spreading the dise=
ase to someone else. That's kind of a common-sense approach.=20



We have some strategies to protect people, but they require resources. An=
d that's to say nothing of the kinds of resources that could be invested =
in diagnostics that would make sure that an individual like I just descri=
bed has access to a test and can get the results of that test quickly. In=
 some cases, people may not be able to get tested and we won't know wheth=
er or not they have the Zika virus.=20



As we've discussed in here before, the vast majority of people who contra=
ct the Zika virus won't have any symptoms. But for those who do, they can=
 get a diagnostic test in many situations. But because of constrained lab=
 capacity, it could take them a couple of weeks to get the results. So, a=
gain, that couple of weeks' delay could expedite the spread of the diseas=
e.=20

So, again, there are a number of things that we know we can do to better =
protect the American people from the Zika virus, and Congress hasnt given=
 us the resources to do any of them. And to make matters worse, they have=
nt just restrained resources when it comes to fighting Zika, the governme=
nt has been forced to try to look for other accounts where our fight agai=
nst Zika can be enhanced. And that has meant that there are other worthy =
government programs that are critical to our homeland security that have =
been negatively affected.

=20

And I can't speak to confirm any of the individual details in that story,=
 but I suspect that those kinds of impacts arent just being felt in the h=
andful of states that are mentioned in that story, they're having an impa=
ct in states all across the country.



Q Last one on this, Josh. If there is a child that gets microcephaly from=
 a domestically acquired infection, will that be on the Republicans' watc=
h and their responsibility?=20



MR. EARNEST: I think what will be true is what you heard Dr. Fauci say wh=
en he stood at this podium a couple of weeks ago. He said made clear that=
 they dont have -- that our public health professionals do not have all o=
f the resources that they need to do everything that they can and should =
be doing right now to prepare for Zika. And that's going to have conseque=
nces.



Now, as I said before, Gardiner, I dont think there's a strategy that wou=
ld prevent every incident of Zika in the United States. But there are sur=
ely steps that we should already be taking to minimize the spread of the =
disease later this year. And every day that goes by, where Congress makes=
 excuses, that's a day lost to preparing for the Zika fight.=20



And I've said this a couple of times, and it's true -- there will be a da=
y when I'm going to come out here and I'm going to do a briefing, and the=
 headlines in the newspapers and the breaking news alerts from all the te=
levision stations are going to be worrying about the impact of the Zika v=
irus in the United States. And we're going to spend a lot of time talking=
 about all the steps that our public health professionals have taken to t=
ry to fight this disease. We're going to talk about all the steps that th=
e administration has proposed, dating back to February, to prepare for th=
is situation. And I dont know what Republicans are going to say when they=
 come face-to-face with their constituents who are wondering why Congress=
 hasnt done a thing.



Bill.



Q Did the 28 pages come up in any of the conversations between administra=
tion officials, including the President, and any other members of the Sau=
di delegation?



MR. EARNEST: I think, Bill, it would be hard for me to account for all of=
 those conversations. Obviously there were -- even in just the one bilate=
ral meeting that the pool had the opportunity to briefly observe when we =
first arrived in Saudi Arabia, there were about 20 U.S. and Saudi officia=
ls in the same room. So that's a lot of different conversations to accoun=
t for. What I can tell you is that it did not come up between the Preside=
nt and the King, and I'm not aware of it coming up between any other seni=
or U.S. official and their Saudi counterpart.



Q You didnt hear it discussed?



MR. EARNEST: I did not.



Rich.



Q Josh, in regards to North Korea, when the President said to CBS that th=
e United States is spending time positioning our missile defense systems,=
 is that in response to recent provocations to the last few months, or is=
 that part of this broader pivot to Asia?



 MR. EARNEST: That's a good question, Rich. This is actually something th=
at our Department of Defense has been doing on the orders of the Presiden=
t for at least a couple of years now. There were a number of anti-ballist=
ic missile capabilities that were moved to Alaska in 2014. We have increa=
sed the deployment of naval assets in the Asia Pacific as a part of the A=
sia pivot, but that also has enhanced our ability to counter ballistic mi=
ssiles in that region of the world.=20



 Over the last several years, there's been equipment that's been deployed=
 to places like Japan and Guam that could be effective in protecting the =
United States and our allies from ballistic missiles. The United States i=
s in discussions right now with our allies in South Korea about the poten=
tial deployment of something called a THAAD battery. This is essentially =
an anti-ballistic missile system that could be useful in protecting our a=
llies in South Korea from a ballistic missile fired by the North Koreans.=




 So this is not a response to recent provocations from North Korea, but r=
ather a response to the threat that has emanated from North Korea for qui=
te some time now. I think it's an indication of the value in planning ahe=
ad and the strategic approach that President Obama and his national secur=
ity team have taken to protecting the American people in the face of the =
North Korean threat.



 Q Has that strategic approach changed at all since the fourth nuclear te=
st in January and then the submarine or the apparent submarine launch of =
a ballistic missile this past weekend?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any -- let me take that back. I can think =
of one change. It was only in response to a more recent test from the Nor=
th Koreans that the United States and South Korea began our dialogue abou=
t the potential deployment of an anti-ballistic missile battery in South =
Korea. That was -- the beginning of those conversations was a response to=
 a specific and recent event.



 But other than that, I can't think of any other responses that I can tel=
l you about. Obviously, there are a number of things that our national se=
curity apparatus is engaged in on a daily basis to protect the American p=
eople. And when necessary, they can make changes that reflect the threat =
emanating from anywhere around the world, including in North Korea. But a=
s it relates to things that I can talk about publicly, I don't have any o=
ther examples for you other than discussions about the deployment of this=
 THAAD battery to South Korea.



 Q Is the administration confident in its ability to defend allies in the=
 region on the Korean Peninsula? And are sanctions working here?



 MR. EARNEST: Rich, I can tell you that the President is quite confident =
in the defense capabilities that we have to protect the American people a=
nd to protect our allies in the Asia Pacific.



 It means we need to continue to monitor the threat that's emanating from=
 North Korea. It means that we need to be nimble and adjust our strategy =
accordingly. But there has been a significant commitment of resources and=
 a lot of time spent considering how we can best arrange those resources =
to protect our allies and protect the American people, and that work is o=
ngoing.



 As it relates to the impact of sanctions, we have not yet seen the desir=
ed change in behavior that is long overdue. But what we have succeeded in=
 doing is working with the international community to ramp up the pressur=
e on the North Korean government even further. And that includes by targe=
ting specific aspects of the North Korean economy that we know were used =
to fund their ballistic missile program. And we did succeed in working cl=
osely with the Chinese and other members of the U.N. Security Council to =
pass those sanctions and to implement them in a way that maximizes the im=
pact on the North Koreans.



 So the North Korean government has been isolated for quite some time. Th=
at's had a terrible impact on the North Korean population, and it is sole=
ly as a result of the management decisions that are being made by the Nor=
th Korean government that that pressure has only tightened in recent mont=
hs as a result of the stepped-up provocations from the North Koreans.



 Dave.



 Q Thanks, Josh. The House plans to vote this week to reauthorize the D.C=
. School Choice program, something the President has opposed. Will he vet=
o that legislation if it reaches him?



 MR. EARNEST: Dave, I know we have expressed our concerns about similar l=
egislation in the past, but I haven't seen the specific proposal that has=
 been put forward. I know that our team has taken a look at it. But hopef=
ully in the next couple of days we can give you a better answer in terms =
of our final position on it.



 Q On another matter, the House Armed Services chairman has floated a pro=
posal to rein in the size of the National Security Council and to possibl=
y make the NSC director subject to congressional confirmation. It look li=
ke it wouldn't affect your administration by the time it was enacted, but=
 do you have thoughts on it? Do you have a reaction to it?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly makes me think that Republicans in Congr=
ess aren't too bullish about the prospects of a Republican succeeding Pre=
sident Obama. But you can ask them about that, I guess.



 I did see that the proposal includes limiting the size of the National S=
ecurity Council. I think it warrants mentioning that under the leadership=
 of the current National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, the size of the Na=
tional Security Council has actually shrunk 10 percent in just the last 1=
8 months or so. And that's based on her own initiative to try to streamli=
ne the National Security Council and make its actions even more efficient=
 than it already is.



 So this is something that we're already focused on here. I have also see=
n that -- those proposals suggest that the National Security Council staf=
f should be capped at 50 people. I might note that the staff of the Senat=
e Armed Services Committee is larger than that. That seems like a rather =
curious apportionment of resources when you consider the important work t=
hat's done at the National Security Council every day. So obviously we've=
 got some concerns with their proposals.



 Q Im sure you've seen that the rationale for this proposal is to give th=
e Congress and the Pentagon more leverage in policy disputes with the Whi=
te House over military policy. Do you have a comment on that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, considering that this Congress doesn't seem like they=
're at all prepared to pass a budget for our military this year; consider=
ing that Congress has for the last two years refused to even consider ser=
iously an authorization for the use of military force; and considering th=
at there are a range of spending reforms that the Department of Defense h=
as repeatedly put forward only to see them be denied by Congress -- I saw=
 a story while we were traveling about continued opposition in Congress t=
o considering another round of base closures. These are base closures tha=
t the Department of Defense assesses would have a positive impact on our =
national security because it would allow for the more efficient deploymen=
t of military resources around the country. But Republicans, and some Dem=
ocrats, probably, have voiced some opposition to those reforms.=20



I think all of that makes clear that there are too many members of Congre=
ss that don't take very seriously their responsibility to engage in a leg=
itimate debate about policies that are critical to our national security.=
 That's why Im surprised to hear that some of them are seeking more autho=
rity over those decisions that they have thus far refused to make.=20



 JC.



 Q How concerned is Chancellor Merkel -- or did she express her concerns =
to the President while he was there that Schengen agreement regarding tra=
vel within the EU, an essential part of the entire EU, that would remain =
in place despite some of the reactions had by some of the political activ=
ities that have gone on in terms of -- vis--vis the refugee crisis going =
on right now?



 MR. EARNEST: JC, I don't have more details to share. They're private con=
versations. And for her governments view of that policy, Id refer you to =
my German counterpart. Hes a nice guy. I got a chance to see him over the=
 weekend. (Laughter.) So Im sure hed be happy to try to answer your quest=
ion.=20



 I think what I can tell you more generally, though, is that Chancellor M=
erkel and the President had an opportunity to consult with the leaders of=
 the UK, France, and Italy yesterday. And part of those discussions focus=
ed on the need for greater information-sharing to ensure that we're worki=
ng together to combat homeland security threats to all of our nations. An=
d that level of information-sharing can and should improve. And doing so =
would improve our national security. Okay?



 Pam, Ill give you the last one.



 Q Just on the Zika funding, there were Republicans talking about $1.1 bi=
llion last week. Would that be enough to at least combat the problem this=
 summer if that was the agreement?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, wed have to take a look at what they're pr=
oposing. And I would note that that's barely half of what we've indicated=
 is needed. So Im not going to rule it out until we've had an opportunity=
 to take a close look at it. But right now our concern isnt just focused =
on the fact that its about half of what our public health professionals s=
ay that we need to effectively fight this fight. Right now our concern is=
 that that funding is tied to a moribund appropriations process.=20



So, again, there is very little prospect for the passage of appropriation=
s bills before the fall at the earliest. The onset of Zika is going to be=
 felt several months before that. And that's why we believe Congress need=
s to find a way to act before then, as well.



 Q This is College Signing Day. Do we know yet where the First Daughter i=
s going to college?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that. But once we have an announ=
cement to make, well make sure you all are read in. All right?=20



 Thanks, everybody. Well see you tomorrow.=20

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&n=
bsp; Welcome back, Josh.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Thank yo=
u.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South K=
orea says that North Korea is on the verge of a fifth nuclear test.&nbsp; I=
 was wondering whether the U.S. can confirm that you're seeing those prepar=
ations take place, and what kind of a U.S. response there would be to such
 an action.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Josh, at=
 this point I don't have a new assessment to share in terms of potential st=
eps that North Korea could potentially take.&nbsp; Over the last several mo=
nths, we've seen them engage in a series of actions that are in
 direct contradiction to U.N. Security Council resolutions.&nbsp; We have e=
xpressed our strong concern about those provocative actions.&nbsp; We have =
marshalled the international community to respond accordingly.&nbsp; And ea=
rlier this year, there was a response from the
 United Nations that actually put in place the farthest-reaching sanctions =
against North Korea that targeted specific elements of their economy, such =
as it is, that we know are used to fund these illicit activities.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we're going to continue =
to ramp up the pressure on the North Korean regime.&nbsp; We're going to co=
ntinue to work closely with the Chinese government that has more influence =
with the North Korean government than any other country in
 the world.&nbsp; And we're going to continue to make clear that the path t=
hat North Korea must choose to rejoin the international community is one th=
at involves them committing to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and come i=
nto compliance with their international
 obligations.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wante=
d to ask you about a letter that Senators Gillibrand and Grassley sent to t=
he President asking them to -- asking the White House to investigate why Pe=
ntagon officials misled Congress about sexual assault cases.&nbsp; Essentia=
lly,
 the information that's come to light shows that the way that the Pentagon =
characterized the cases undermined efforts to try and perform that process =
-- it takes the power away from commanders. Is there any follow-up in the W=
hite House to that letter?&nbsp; Do you
 guys plan to heed the senators' call for an investigation?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have a specific response to the letter to share at this point.&nbsp; Obviou=
sly this question is the subject of some disagreement between officials at =
the Department of Defense and members of Congress.&nbsp; I know leading
 up to the production of this information there were extensive negotiations=
 between members of Congress and the Department of Defense about this data.=
&nbsp; So this dispute and the way it's being characterized differently by =
the two parties is not new.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President has made clea=
r that this is a top priority of the Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp; You've heard=
 the President speak on a number of occasions quite powerfully about the ne=
ed to eradicate sexual assault from the military.&nbsp; The President
 has talked movingly about how victims in the United States military should=
 understand that the Commander-in-Chief has their back, and the President h=
as made clear to the civilian and military leadership at the Department of =
Defense that eradicating sexual
 assault from the military is a top priority.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President had an opport=
unity to reinforce that priority at the meeting that he convened with comba=
tant commanders from around the world here at the White House earlier this =
month.&nbsp; The President convened that meeting on April 6th
 in the Cabinet Room, and this was a conversation that the President had wi=
th the Secretary of Defense that all of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the c=
ombatant commanders.&nbsp; And this continues to be a top priority.&nbsp; A=
nd the President anticipates and expects that
 the leadership will follow through on reforms and other appropriate steps =
based on the President making this a priority.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Jo=
sh, I mean, misleading members of Congress is a pretty serious charge.&nbsp=
; Does the White House have any concerns about the veracity of the informat=
ion that Pentagon officials provided in testimony to members of Congress?<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Based on=
 what I have read in the reports is that members of Congress have expressed=
 concerns about the way that the information was presented.&nbsp; At the sa=
me time, I've seen in in those reports that Department of Defense
 officials have characterized that material as accurate.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you'=
re siding with the Pentagon that -- <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; What I'm=
 observing at this point is that this information has been the subject of l=
ong-running controversy between Congress and the Department of Defense.&nbs=
p; And while this is an important issue, the difference of agreement
 about the presentation of this information is something that they're going=
 to have to resolve between Congress and the Department of Defense.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's important that this bu=
reaucratic dispute not overshadow the way that the President has made this =
a top priority when it comes to military policy.&nbsp; And the President ha=
s spoken on this publicly on a number of occasions, and even
 in his private meetings with the top leaders in the military, the Presiden=
t time and time again makes clear that the Commander-in-Chief has made this=
 a priority and expects military leadership to follow through with the nece=
ssary steps to eliminate sexual
 assault from the military.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on =
the campaign trail, Donald Trump said today that Hillary Clinton has only g=
otten to where she's gotten because she's played the woman card.&nbsp; Any =
thoughts about that statement from the White House?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Not real=
ly.&nbsp; I think Secretary Clinton and her team can certainly speak to her=
 qualifications and her credentials, and I don't need to weigh in.<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wante=
d to ask about a division between the two governments in Libya.&nbsp; Evide=
ntly, today, the government in eastern Libya shipped a cargo of crude oil, =
much to the chagrin of the government in Tripoli.&nbsp; Does the administra=
tion
 have a reaction to that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I haven'=
t seen those specific reports.&nbsp; I can tell you that the United States =
was strongly supportive of the U.N. process that led to the creation of the=
 Government of National Accord that does now reside in Tripoli.&nbsp;
 We've also been pretty candid about the significant challenges that are fa=
cing that newly created government.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libya is a unique country.&=
nbsp; It was one that was presided over by an autocratic dictator for four =
decades.&nbsp; And the Qaddafi regime succeeded in essentially eroding any =
pillar of civil society or of government inside that country.&nbsp; And
 so when he was deposed, the country was struggling and continues to strugg=
le with rebuilding those institutions that are critical to governing a larg=
e country like Libya.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And part of what the Gove=
rnment of National Accord is facing is building support among the variety o=
f groups that have sprouted up to try to fill that vacuum.&nbsp; Some of th=
em are armed groups.&nbsp; In other cases, there
 are fledgling attempts to form some substance or some entity that looks li=
ke a government.&nbsp; And the international community, including the Unite=
d States, continues to support the effort of the GNA to unify that country.=
 And that obviously is going to raise
 significant questions about security and providing security for the countr=
y.&nbsp; It also is going to raise important economic questions like how to=
 effectively manage the oil supply in Cuba -- I'm sorry -- in Libya that ob=
viously has significant consequences
 for that country's economy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So these are just some of t=
he significant challenges that are facing the government.&nbsp; And the Uni=
ted States, the United Nations, and other countries around the world are st=
rongly supportive of the GNA's efforts.&nbsp; We do not anticipate
 that they're going to succeed in unifying that country and restoring order=
 to the chaos overnight.&nbsp; But over time, and with a commitment to basi=
c principles, they will be successful.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U.S. Sp=
ecial Forces have stopped another cargo -- before coming from that governme=
nt.&nbsp; Is that an option here?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
aware of a discussion about that, but, again, I didn't have a debriefing on=
 this today because I hadn't seen the report.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning=
 to refugee issues in Kansas.&nbsp; Governor Brownback told the administrat=
ion today that Kansas will withdraw from the U.S. relocation program for re=
fugees.&nbsp; Do you have a reaction to that?&nbsp; And what would this mea=
n, practically?&nbsp;
 That no refugees would end up in Kansas?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
haven't seen his letter, so we'll have to take a look at the letter and get=
 back to you on that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And jus=
t one more on Iran.&nbsp; Heavy-water purchase last week.&nbsp; The Departm=
ent of Energy said at the time that it's not going to be -- the U.S. is not=
 going to be the customer for the heavy-water forever.&nbsp; And Tom Cotton=
, Senator
 Cotton has introduced an amendment saying no U.S. dollars would go to anot=
her purchase.&nbsp; How confident is the U.S. that another country will ste=
p up and make more of these purchases?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'=
m certainly not an expert on the global market for heavy-water.&nbsp; But I=
 can tell you that the United States, through the Department of Energy, did=
 make this properly licensed purchase of about 32 metric tons of
 heavy-water.&nbsp; There is a market for heavy-water, particularly when it=
 comes to applications related to industry and research here in the United =
States.&nbsp; And that's how that material will be used by the Department o=
f Energy -- to essentially sell it at market
 prices to entities that would use it for industrial or research purposes h=
ere in the United States.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should underscore that th=
ere this is no -- that heavy-water is not radioactive.&nbsp; It doesn't pos=
e any sort of public health concern.&nbsp; But it is valuable in terms of i=
ts use in these particular technical applications.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More generally, I can say t=
hat this is consistent with Iran fulfilling their obligations as a part of =
their Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.&nbsp; This was the international =
deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; Part
 of the prescribed steps that they had to take was to reduce their nuclear =
stockpile and that involved reducing their technological nuclear capabiliti=
es.&nbsp; So Iran did have to ship a bunch of its heavy-water out of the co=
untry, and that's what they've done and
 now they're selling off the stockpile.&nbsp; And the United States has pur=
chased some of it for resale to entities in the United States that would us=
e it for research purposes or even industrial purposes in some cases.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it relates to Senator Co=
tton's amendment, I'm not aware of what sort of impact this could potential=
ly have.&nbsp; I guess I would suggest that if he has genuine concerns abou=
t this, maybe he can just write another letter to the Supreme
 Leader and see how far that gets him.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, Jon.<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.=
&nbsp; What was the President's reaction to the brutal killing in Banglades=
h of the Foreign Service national who worked for USAID?&nbsp; Did he share =
that with you?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Jon, I c=
an tell you that this is a murder that the United States government strongl=
y condemns.&nbsp; The individual who was killed was the employee of the U.S=
. Agency for International Development in Bangladesh.&nbsp; His name
 was Xulhaz Mannan.&nbsp; Mr. Mannan served the U.S. embassy in Dhaka with =
distinction, and he worked on behalf of his fellow Bangladeshis as a voice =
for justice, equality, human rights for all, including for the local LGBT c=
ommunity.&nbsp; And while his death is obviously
 a significant tragedy, there are also reports that indicate that he was ta=
rgeted because of his advocacy for these human rights, and that makes his d=
eath even more tragic than it seems.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Mannan set an example o=
f dignity, courage, and selflessness, and his legacy will live on in the ca=
uses that he championed.&nbsp; We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr. Mann=
an's loved ones as they mourn his loss.&nbsp; And we strongly encourage
 the government of Bangladesh to ensure that the perpetrators of this sense=
less crime are brought to justice.&nbsp; I can tell you that the U.S. gover=
nment has already been in touch with the government of Bangladesh to make i=
t clear that this investigation is a
 priority.&nbsp; And we are pleased to see that, so far, the government is =
moving forward with the kind of thorough criminal investigation that we wou=
ld expect them to conduct.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does th=
e President believe that the government of Bangladesh should take a stronge=
r public stance against these high-profile crimes?&nbsp; It seems like ther=
e have been a few, not just this one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, at=
 this point, our expectation is that the government of Bangladesh should en=
gage in a serious criminal investigation to determine who is responsible an=
d to bring those individuals to justice.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve committed
 a heinous crime and they should be held accountable for it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One mor=
e question on Judge Garland.&nbsp; I believe it's been 4i days since he was=
 nominated.&nbsp; Is the pressure that the White House is putting on Republ=
icans, is it making any sort of impact on Capitol Hill?&nbsp; What do you s=
ee developing
 over the last several weeks?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think in the last week or so we have seen some signs that Republicans conti=
nue to feel pressure from the American public as they refuse to do their jo=
b.&nbsp; This is a convenient opportunity for me to say that Chief
 Judge Garland will be participating in a number of other meetings on Capit=
ol Hill over the course of this week.&nbsp; Tomorrow, Wednesday, he has mee=
tings scheduled with Senator Lankford of Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe of Oklaho=
ma, Senator Rounds of South Dakota, and
 Senator Nelson of Florida.&nbsp; And on Thursday, he'll meet with Senator =
Peters of Michigan and Senator Widen of Oregon.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he&#8217;s going to cont=
inue to have meetings with individual senators.&nbsp; This is consistent wi=
th the way the process usually works.&nbsp; And the way the process usually=
 works is that after these private meetings are completed that there&#8217;=
s
 an open hearing that is scheduled.&nbsp; And the kinds of issues that are =
discussed in private by the Chief Judge and individual members of the Senat=
e are then discussed publicly.&nbsp; And that's appropriate.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there are certainly a n=
umber of Republicans -- 11 -- who have already met with -- 11 Republican se=
nators who have already met with Chief Judge Garland and many of them have =
had nice things to say about the Judge.&nbsp; We heard Senator
 Lindsey Graham from South Carolina indicate that Chief Judge Garland&#8217=
;s reputation is &#8220;beyond reproach.&#8221;&nbsp; Senator Portman descr=
ibed Chief Judge Garland as &#8220;an impressive guy.&#8221;&nbsp; Senator =
Toomey described Chief Judge Garland as &#8220;very, very smart, very knowl=
edgeable.&#8221;&nbsp;
 And Senator Flake noted that Chief Judge Garland is &#8220;obviously a man=
 of accomplishment and keen intellect.&#8221;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the question for al=
l of these senators who have made a strong case that the American public sh=
ould have a voice in this process -- I think the question is why are they d=
enying the American public the opportunity to hear directly
 from Chief Judge Garland?&nbsp; Why wouldn't they support a hearing, parti=
cularly when they have nice things to say about him?&nbsp; I also understan=
d that Senator Toomey had some criticisms to lodge against Chief Judge Garl=
and&#8217;s record.&nbsp; I would actually make the case
 that that is all the more reason to hold a hearing.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even across party lines, I =
think most Americans subscribe to this general notion of fairness, and for =
Senator Toomey to criticize Chief Judge Garland and his record without givi=
ng Chief Judge Garland the opportunity to answer questions
 about it, that's just unfair.&nbsp; And it's even worse when you consider =
that it's Senator Toomey&#8217;s job to ensure that Chief Judge Garland has=
 an opportunity to discuss these issues in public.&nbsp; So it's not just u=
nfair, it is a classic example of Washington obstruction
 that, frankly, I think the American people are going to be pretty dissatis=
fied with.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s plenty of public polling to indicate tha=
t that's the case.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, look, the message has =
gotten through at least in the state of Florida; you have a Republican cand=
idate for the United States Senate who, I understand, just yesterday said, =
&#8221;I do think he should have a hearing and I would like
 to see a vote.&#8221;&nbsp; That's not a Democrat saying that.&nbsp; That =
is a Republican candidate for the United States Senate.&nbsp; And I think t=
hat is a pretty good piece of evidence that somebody who is obviously makin=
g a pretty direct appeal to the people of Florida that
 he should be the representative of their state and that legislative body t=
hat his view is consistent with the expectations of most of his -- most of =
the citizens in his state.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think it's notable th=
at we're not talking about a candidate for the United States Senate that's =
a Democrat.&nbsp; We're not even talking about a candidate for the United S=
tates Senate that's a Republican that's running in a blue state.&nbsp;
 We're talking about a Republican candidate that's running in the biggest s=
wing state in the country, and even he is making the case that Chief Judge =
Garland deserves a hearing and a vote.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I think that's a prett=
y good piece of evidence that Republicans continue to feel pressure from th=
e public.&nbsp; And they should.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve taken a position that'=
s stands in stark contrast to the expectations not just
 of a majority of Democrats and independents, but in plenty of polls there&=
#8217;s strong indications that the position that they&#8217;ve taken is no=
t even approved of by a majority of Republicans.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just =
one more, quick question.&nbsp; This is on a different topic.&nbsp; But Sen=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But i=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
it's material that is currently being reviewed by the Office of the Directo=
r of National Intelligence, so Director Clapper&#8217;s office is currently=
 conducting a review to determine how or whether
 this material could be released without compromising national security. &n=
bsp;Obviously it's classified right now and they are engaged in a process t=
o determine if we can declassify that information so that it could be relea=
sed.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This is consistent with t=
he process that the Director&#8217;s office undertakes whenever a piece of =
information is considered for declassification, and this is obviously somet=
hing that they&#8217;ve been working on for a long
 time.&nbsp; I think this has been going through the process for over a yea=
r now.&nbsp; And I think that's an indication of just how seriously they&#8=
217;re taking this matter.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I saw that Director Clapp=
er had an opportunity just yesterday to discuss it, and he indicated that h=
e viewed a June time frame as a realistic goal from completing the process =
of reviewing this information.&nbsp; You
 will have to check with his office to see whether or not -- what that actu=
ally means about the process, but I think it is an indication that Director=
 Clapper is approaching this with the seriousness that is required and that=
 we would all expect.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can t=
his be expedited at all because of a bill that while it doesn&#8217;t direc=
tly address that -- the Schumer-Cornyn bill -- which would essentially allo=
w the families of victims of terrorists killed on American
 soil to sue foreign governments, and Saudi Arabia has been brought up.&nbs=

ng discussion?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; What I=
 can say is this.&nbsp; For the process and for the timeline that's been es=
tablished, I'd encourage you to check with Director Clapper's office.&nbsp;=
 I can tell you the White House has not made a request
 of Director Clapper with regard to the process as a result of the legislat=
ion being filed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And las=
tly, a recent announcement -- 250 more troops to Syria to combat ISIS.&nbsp=
; The President saying to &quot;keep up the momentum.&quot;&nbsp; Is there =
a possibility for more troops to be deployed in the near future?<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Lu=
ke, the President's approach to this situation has been to direct his natio=
nal security team to consider the range of elements in our strategy.&nbsp; =
And you'll recall that it was a few months ago that the President
 initially announced that there would be this commitment of 50 Special Oper=
ators to Syria to see if we could deepen our coordination with the forces i=
n Syria that are fighting ISIL.&nbsp; And what the Department of Defense ha=
s found is that the efforts of the preliminary
 commitment of Special Operators proved to be quite useful.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And through deepened coor=
dination and better organization on the ground, we saw improved performance=
 of those forces on the battlefield.&nbsp; And we saw that the United State=
s and our coalition partners were better
 able to coordinate our efforts with them.&nbsp; And the judgment that was =
reached by the United States military is that an additional contingent of S=
pecial Operators moving into Syria would advance that coordination and that=
 cooperation even further, and that that
 would yield even more progress on the ground.&nbsp; That's why the Preside=
nt approved the request that the Department of Defense brought forward for =
that additional contingent of troops.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, to answer your questi=
on directly, I think what that means is that if this additional commitment =
of additional troops yields positive results, and the Department of Defense=
 concludes that, again, additional results
 could be generated with an additional commitment, then that's something th=
at the President would consider.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Obviously this is somethi=
ng that both the Department of Defense and the Commander-in-Chief would con=
sider quite carefully given the significant risk that these Special Operato=
rs are facing.&nbsp; They're not in a combat
 role, but they are in a role that puts them in harm's way.&nbsp; They are =
armed for combat.&nbsp; They are armed to defend themselves if necessary.&n=
bsp; But the role that they have is to offer advice and assistance to force=
s on the ground fighting ISIL in their own country.&nbsp;
 And that has proved to be a valuable tool and one that the President is se=
eking to intensify.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consi=
dering we don&#8217;t have a formal AUMF for Syria, are there any geographi=
c limitations on this time of deployment?&nbsp; Libya has ISIS factions.&nb=
sp; We see some in Africa, as well.&nbsp; Is this something that the Americ=
an
 people could expect to see in other parts of the world?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm no=
t aware of any geographic limitations that have been put in place.&nbsp; Ob=
viously, each country is different, though.&nbsp; Libya is a good example.&=
nbsp; There are military operations that the Commander-in-Chief
 has ordered against ISIL targets in Libya.&nbsp; There have been a couple =
of reports of airstrikes carried out against ISIL targets that have -- back=
 in November took off the battlefield the individual who at the time was de=
scribed as the most senior ISIL official
 in the country.&nbsp; There have been other strikes carried out against IS=
IL targets that included -- or at least one instance in which a military st=
rike was taken against an ISIL target where fighters had congregated in one=
 location.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the President has not =
hesitated to order military action in Libya, when necessary, to protect the=
 American people and to further advance our campaign to degrade and ultimat=
ely destroy ISIL.&nbsp; There are other places
 in Africa where the United States is working closely with host governments=
 to help them combat extremism within their own country.&nbsp; I think the =
most prominent example of this is a concern that we have about Boko Haram.&=
nbsp; And there are U.S. forces -- U.S. personnel
 in Nigeria that are working closely with the Nigerian government as they f=
ight those extremist elements in their own country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we've been clear about=
 what our strategy is, and that strategy is to build up the capacity of loc=
al forces in countries around the world to fight extremism.&nbsp; And there=
 are a variety of ways that we do that.&nbsp;
 In the situation in Iraq, we obviously work closely with the Iraqi central=
 government and support the efforts of Iraqi forces.&nbsp; In Syria, we obv=
iously don&#8217;t have a situation where we can coordinate with the centra=
l government in Syria.&nbsp; We certainly would
 like to see that, and that's why we believe that a political transition in=
 that country is overdue.&nbsp; But since we can't coordinate directly with=
 the central government in Syria, we're working with those forces on the gr=
ound with whom we are able to cooperate,
 and we are seeing some progress against ISIL targets in Syria.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So each of these countrie=
s has taken -- is considered individually for the appropriate strategy that=
 will protect the American people -- that is obviously the first priority -=
- to advance our campaign to degrade
 and destroy ISIL, but also to build the capacity of fighters to take the f=
ight to ISIL in their own country.&nbsp; And the reason for that is that th=
e United States cannot be a substitute for those kinds of forces.&nbsp; We =
cannot impose a military solution on ISIL
 in any country around the world.&nbsp; And, in some cases, it may require =
military involvement to build the capacity of local fighters to take the fi=
ght to ISIL, but the President has made clear that the United States milita=
ry will not be a substitute for the effectiveness
 of local fighters.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The S=

 I was wondering what your response was to that.&nbsp; Do you agree with hi=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I stro=

&nbsp; You may recall, Mike -- I think you've been covering this story clos=

 Bloomberg story out there, possibly with your byline on it, that dates bac=
k to October 21st, 2015.&nbsp; For those of you scoring along at home, that=
 is 188 days ago. &nbsp;And that story included a summarization of our legi=
slative proposal for addressing the situation
 in Puerto Rico.&nbsp; So we put forward our proposal 188 days ago.&nbsp; I=
t's a little ironic for Leader McCarthy or any other Republican to come for=
ward after 188 days and suggest that somehow the Obama administration has b=
een slow to act to address the situation in
 Puerto Rico.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Look, =
I go to great lengths to avoid putting myself in a situation of predicting =
a positive outcome from Congress, particularly because there are plenty of =
common-sense things that Congress should
 do that they don&#8217;t.&nbsp; In many cases, there are a variety of expl=
anation for that.&nbsp; Sometimes that is just run-of-the-mill congressiona=
l dysfunction.&nbsp; Sometimes it is the fact that Republicans allow ideolo=
gy and partisan politics and political considerations
 to get in front of core American priorities.&nbsp; In some cases, it's bec=
ause the issues that they're working through are really complicated and rea=
lly hard.&nbsp; As it relates to Puerto Rico, it's probably some combinatio=
n of all three of those things.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so I can tell you tha=
t at least we are encouraged by the fact that the Republican Leader of the =
House has finally acknowledged that there's something that needs to be addr=
essed here.&nbsp; For most of the last 188
 days, we haven&#8217;t seen much responsiveness from Republicans in Congre=
ss.&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t seen much of a sense of urgency about needing to=
 act on this.&nbsp; So if he feels the need to come out and criticize the O=
bama administration, even if it's false, because he's
 feeling some political pressure to act, that might be evidence of potentia=
l movement in the future.&nbsp; And we certainly would like to see it.&nbsp=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We do believe that the Pu=
erto Rican government should be given access to an orderly restructuring re=
gime.&nbsp; We believe that the Puerto Rican government should also be held=
 accountable for following through on financial
 reforms, including through an independent fiscal oversight body that would=

 providing Puerto Rico access to the earned income tax credit <a name=3D"_G=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Related=
 somewhat to Luke&#8217;s question, in the meeting with the European leader=
s on Monday, was more substantial intervention in Libya discussed?<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
don't have a whole lot more to describe about that meeting beyond what you =
saw on the readout.&nbsp; I can just tell you in general that there is conc=
ern among our European allies about the situation in Libya.&nbsp; And
 as I mentioned in response to Luke&#8217;s question, President Obama has a=
lready demonstrated a commitment and a willingness to order U.S. military a=
ction in Libya where necessary to protect the United States.&nbsp; And he c=
ontinues to recognize that that's a priority
 and he&#8217;s willing to take additional military action, if necessary, t=
o protect the United States.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a strong sense, ho=
wever, that like in Syria, a military solution cannot be imposed on Libya.&=
nbsp; And that's why you've seen the United States and our European allies =
be so strongly supportive of the Government of National Accord
 and hopeful that that fledgling government can succeed in unifying the cou=
ntry, in trying to restore some order to the chaos that they have sustained=
, try to institute some order over the security situation, some control ove=
r the security situation in Libya,
 and also begin to address the wide range of economic questions. <o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">When you have sustained t=
he kind of damage to their infrastructure -- both governmental and physical=
 -- in Libya, that's going to have some pretty significant negative consequ=
ences for the economy.&nbsp; And that's why
 there are important decisions that need to be made the GNA about restoring=
 the strength of their economy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly =
in the context of the President&#8217;s remarks on being prepared probably =
by the end of the year for an assault on Mosul, I was really struck by The =
New York Times&#8217; article yesterday on the situation in now Anbar Provi=
nce and
 in Fallujah where, as you know, your allies, the Iraqi government is layin=
g siege to Fallujah.&nbsp; And many of the civilians are not getting much f=
ood.&nbsp; In the Times&#8217; story, their reporting showed that the price=
 of a bag of flour in Baghdad at $15 would cost
 you $750 in Fallujah because of the siege.&nbsp; Is that a tactic the admi=
nistration feels comfortable with?&nbsp; And would you like to see it repli=
cated against the Sunni civilian population in Mosul?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ob=
viously, Mike, when you are encountering a situation where you have extremi=
sts that have essentially set up shop in some of the largest cities in your=
 country, that's going to have a profound and profoundly negative
 impact on the local population.&nbsp; And one of the things that President=
 Obama spent some time talking about in Saudi Arabia is the need for additi=
onal economic support to the Iraqi government for those areas that have bee=
n liberated from ISIL.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Ramadi is a good example.=
&nbsp; That's a country where -- that is a community in Iraq that is still =
trying to rebuild and recover after enduring many months of ISIL&#8217;s re=
ign of terror.&nbsp; And for the central government
 in Iraq to succeed in rebuilding and restoring those communities, they're =
going to need some economic resources.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is a good example =
of where countries in the region can step up and offer economic assistance =
to the central government in Iraq that will have a tangible, positive impac=
t on our campaign against ISIL.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But sti=
ll in Fallujah, which the government hasn&#8217;t retaken, they're essentia=
lly laying siege to the city, which starves the civilian population.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, my=
 point is that obviously the central government in Iraq is dealing with a v=
ery difficult situation, and trying to root out ISIL fighters is, of course=
, going to have a negative impact on the local population.&nbsp;
 That's the reason it is so important for the Iraqi government, once they h=
ave succeeded in driving ISIL out of these communities, to have the support=
 from other countries in the region and other countries around the world fo=
r rebuilding and restoring those
 communities that have endured such great loss.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, S=
peaker Ryan says he hasn't read the 28 pages that are currently being consi=
dered to be declassified from the 9/11 Commission, but he believes that it =
would not be detrimental for the U.S. and Saudi relationship, saying
 &quot;There's the Saudi Arabia then, and now there's the Saudi Arabia now.=
&quot;&nbsp; And he also -- he brings up the example of the Saudis cooperat=
ing in tracking financing of terrorists.&nbsp; Does the President agree wit=
h that assessment that there would not be a negative
 impact?&nbsp; And if so, is that because the role of the Saudis has change=
d, or when you take a look at those 28 pages, there really is no &#8220;the=
re&#8221; there in terms of them contributing to the 9/11 attacks?<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, le=
t me say a couple of things about this.&nbsp; The first thing that comes to=
 mind is that we have made the point that we have seen an improvement in th=
e way the Saudi government has confronted extremism both in their
 country and around the world since 9/11.&nbsp; That prior to 9/11, there w=
as a sense that the Saudi government didn't recognize the risk of extremist=
 groups operating either in Saudi Arabia or around the world, but since 9/1=
1, we have seen the Saudi government
 engage with a greater sense of purpose in efforts to counter those extremi=
st activities, and to counter the activities of extremist organizations tha=
t are trying to propagate a hateful extremist ideology.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That is part of what has =
made Saudi Arabia a valuable partner of the United States.&nbsp; We have se=
en tangible Saudi contributions to efforts that strengthen American nationa=
l security.&nbsp; And the basis of that coordination
 and cooperation is the basis of the important relationship the United Stat=
es and Saudi Arabia have today.&nbsp; It's why President Obama has traveled=
 to Saudi Arabia four times as President of the United States -- more than =
any other President in American history.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is a relationship =
that, while complicated because of the obvious differences between our two =
countries, there are areas of common ground, particularly as it relates to =
taking the steps to protect our national security.&nbsp; And
 the President has worked hard to cultivate that relationship even further.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't read the 28 pages=
, so I can't offer up my own assessment about what impact it would have on =
the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; Speaker Ryan is certainly en=
titled to his own opinion, but, as he pointed out, it's an
 opinion that he has offered up without having read the 28 pages. <o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The process that we're en=
gaged in now is a process whereby people who have read the 28 pages can con=
sider the range of ramifications of releasing that material and declassifyi=
ng it so that it can be read by the
 American public.&nbsp; And that's what they're doing.&nbsp; And that's wha=
t I think the American people would expect, which is carefully consider how=
 transparent it's possible to be without posing undue risk to our national =
security.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the other thing tha=
t's relevant is that the conclusions of the 9/11 Commission have been made =
public.&nbsp; They have been declassified.&nbsp; And you saw the -- I don't=
 know if you saw the statement from Governor Kaine and from former
 Congressman Hamilton about the work of the 9/11 Commission.&nbsp; They ind=
icated that they did read the 28 pages.&nbsp; They described those 28 pages=
 as being &quot;almost entirely raw, unvetted material that came to the FBI=
.&quot;&nbsp; And this is material that the 9/11 Commission
 did have an opportunity to vet.&nbsp; It is material they did have an oppo=
rtunity to follow up on.&nbsp; And they discussed the range of interviews t=
hat they conducted to pursue the leads that were included in that material.=
&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the conclusions of the =
9/11 Commission is something that we've talked about in here quite extensiv=
ely.&nbsp; The conclusion of the 9/11 Commission is that Saudi Arabia has l=
ong been considered the primary source of al Qaeda funding,
 but we have found no evidence that the Saudi government, as an institution=
, or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think the point is, th=
ere is an outside blue ribbon commission that was established to take a loo=
k at what contributed to the 9/11 attacks and what reforms we could put in =
place to prevent an attack like that from ever happening
 again.&nbsp; They had an opportunity to look carefully at the 28 pages.&nb=
sp; They had an opportunity to follow up carefully on the information that =
was included in the 28 pages.&nbsp; And they reached the declassified concl=
usion that they did not find evidence that the
 Saudi government as an institution, or senior Saudi officials individually=
 funded the organization.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And jus=
t coming off this trip with Saudi Arabia, does the President feel more reas=
surances that this is not going to be something that is going to impact the=
 relationship?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the best way to describe that -- well, let me say it this way.&nbsp; =
When the President had an opportunity to sit down with King Salman in Saudi=
 Arabia -- as you know, he spent about two hours talking to him
 about a range of issues that are critically important to both of our count=
ries -- and King Salman never raised this question about the 28 pages. I th=
ink in some ways that is a testament to the wide range of other important i=
ssues that the two leaders had to
 discuss.&nbsp; But I think it also is an indication that there are a range=
 of other things that are more important to the relationship between our tw=
o countries than just these 28 pages.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should =
we read into that that the President didn't bring it up, either?&nbsp; The =
28 pages?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That's c=
orrect.&nbsp; The President did not bring it up, either.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And jus=
t on another thing.&nbsp; The Senate race here in Maryland -- Van Hollen an=
d Donna Edwards.&nbsp; There are some people who are saying this is turning=
 into identity politics as opposed to based on ideology -- that the way peo=
ple
 are voting in Maryland are along racial lines.&nbsp; Does the President ha=
ve an opinion or an assessment of how that's playing out here --<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I thin=
k it's too early to draw that kind of conclusion because people are voting =
right now, even as we speak. So we can take a look at the results tomorrow =
and determine whether or not that's an appropriate
 conclusion to draw, and whether or not there's any evidence to substantiat=
e that claim.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gardiner.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another=
 question for Leader McCarthy.&nbsp; He says that Republicans still have no=
t been given all the answers to their questions on Zika.&nbsp; And so I'm j=
ust wondering, is the White House aware of any outstanding questions from C=
ongress
 on Zika funding? And if so, is there a timeline for answering them?&nbsp; =
And then just in addition to that -- I might as well just add it now -- the=
re's a complaint that you guys have not stipulated how the money needs to b=
e apportioned between a supplemental
 for Fiscal Year '16 and the regular appropriations process for Fiscal Year=
 '17.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; To the e=
xtent there is a regular appropriations process in Congress.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I m=
ean, have you guys -- do you guys have sort of&nbsp; -- how much, specifica=
lly, do you need for supplemental in '16 and how much can wait for the '17 =
approps?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, le=
t me take your question about providing information to Congress first.&nbsp=
; As I've noted previously, there have been 48 open public hearings in Cong=
ress where questions about Zika have been asked and answered by
 administration officials.&nbsp; I think that's an indication that there ha=
ve been a variety of venues where any member of Congress, Democrat or Repub=
lican, has had an opportunity to ask a senior administration official a que=
stion about Zika.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So if there are any unans=
wered questions about the strategy that the administration has put forward =
to fight Zika and to protect the American people from Zika, I think it's me=
mbers of Congress themselves who are
 responsible for not having answers to those questions because they've had =
ample opportunity to ask them.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That being said, if, after =
48 open public hearings, some Republican who hasn't shown up to the hearing=
s continues to have outstanding questions, I'm confident that we can find a=
 way to try to answer the question.&nbsp; That's the first
 thing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the second thing is=
, and I've -- <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to=
 be clear, you don't know of any outstanding questions, like some list of q=
uestions they've sent you that you guys haven't responded to?<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Not that=
 I'm aware of.&nbsp; But, look, I wouldn't put it past some Republican that=
 I've never heard of producing a detailed list of questions that they say h=
as been residing on their website for a couple of weeks.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think my point is, sen=
d the questions over; we'll take a look.&nbsp; But there's no excuse for th=
em having those unanswered questions when you consider that we've already p=
ut forward a detailed legislative proposal more than two months
 ago now.&nbsp; We've already participated in 48 hearings in which question=
s about Zika have been raised.&nbsp; There have been briefings that have be=
en convened by senior administration officials for both the House and the S=
enate to discuss this issue.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I guess what I would s=
ay for members of Congress who say that they have questions about the admin=
istration's Zika strategy, that ignorance is not an excuse.&nbsp; They've h=
ad opportunities to ask their questions.&nbsp;
 There's ample information that's been provided by the administration.&nbsp=
; And I don't think their constituents are going to find it an acceptable r=
esponse when there is a widespread media freak-out about the Zika virus tha=
t Republicans haven't acted because they
 didn't get their questions answered.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your second question was ab=
out?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplem=
ental.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Supple=
mental.&nbsp; Well, you've heard from public health professionals that they=
 don't have all the resources that they need right now to do everything tha=
t they believe they could do to protect the America
 people from the Zika virus.&nbsp; Now, part of that is because -- particul=
arly as it relates to our efforts to develop a vaccine -- the government ne=
eds to demonstrate a long-term commitment to funding these efforts.&nbsp; T=
he efforts to develop a vaccine and to manufacture
 that vaccine will include a robust role for the private sector.&nbsp; And =
the private sector will only fully engage when they see that they have a cu=
stomer that's committed to buying the product.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so that's why the del=
ay that we've seen thus far is already problematic.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s al=
so why the suggestion that Republicans are just going to tie Zika funding t=
o a totally inept budget process is also destined
 to fail.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an emergency.&nbsp;=
 Our public health professionals have said as much.&nbsp; And the American =
people are counting on the Congress to act.&nbsp; And instead, we've gotten=
 bureaucratic excuses from Congress about why they&#8217;ve done nothing.&n=
bsp;
 And right now they haven&#8217;t paid a significant price for that.&nbsp; =
But at some point, there are going to be direct, specific, serious question=
s asked to members of Congress -- particularly Republicans -- about why the=
y haven&#8217;t done anything.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m not sure
 exactly what their explanation will be.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that's also why, Gard=
iner, we don't take a lot of solace in Republican proposals to say that the=
y&#8217;ll attach an emergency appropriation to a regular appropriations bi=
ll.&nbsp; What evidence is there that regular appropriations
 bills are going to pass either house of Congress, let alone both?&nbsp; Re=
publicans in the House haven&#8217;t even passed a budget, despite the fact=
 that the deadline passed a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; And Leader McConnell=
 has indicated that it&#8217;s not clear to him when a
 budget is ever going to pass the United States Senate.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, again, it&#8217;s prett=
y simple exactly what we need here.&nbsp; There is no reason it should be b=
ogged down in partisan politics. There&#8217;s no question of ideology or p=
rinciple at stake, other than the basic public health and well-being of
 the American public.&nbsp; And right now that has fallen victim to a Repub=
lican refusal to govern.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, t=
he Democrats have suggested a supplemental that also includes funding for F=
lint water, as well as for the opioid crisis.&nbsp; Obviously, these are th=
ree crises.&nbsp; But if the Zika virus is truly -- the opioid epidemic, ob=
viously,
 has been going on for 15 years.&nbsp; If the Zika crisis is truly this sum=
mer&#8217;s public health emergency, why not just a supplemental just about=
 Zika?&nbsp; Why not tell your allies in Congress, look, this goes to the h=
ead of the line, just a clean Zika bill, we need
 it to pass right away?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I think ultimately members of Congress are going to have to decide how=
 this moves through the legislative process.&nbsp; We've talked about the u=
rgency that Congress should feel about giving our public health
 professionals the resources that they need to fight Zika.&nbsp; And we've =
even presented our own proposal for how we believe Congress should do that,=
 what those resources should look like.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, look, we've also ackno=
wledged that there is a role for Congress to play in helping Flint deal wit=
h the situation with their water supply.&nbsp; That's a pretty urgent situa=
tion, too.&nbsp; There are some other things that we can do to manage
 that situation.&nbsp; But there is a role for Congress to play here, and C=
ongress has been AWOL on this one, as well.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it relates to opioids, t=
his is a -- I guess in some ways, the way I would differentiate the opioid =
crisis from the Zika situation is that we&#8217;ve long passed the point at=
 which the opioid crisis has taken effect.&nbsp; This is a problem
 that reached crisis proportions quite a while ago.&nbsp; And I do think th=
at's why you've seen bipartisan rhetoric, at least, to making this public h=
ealth question a priority.&nbsp; The administration has put forward a very =
specific proposal for how we believe additional
 resources could be used to fight the opioid epidemic.&nbsp; And we&#8217;d=
 encourage Democrats and Republicans to work together on that, as well.&nbs=
p;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, ultimately, members of =
Congress are going to have to decide how to address these priorities.&nbsp;=
 This what governing is all about.&nbsp; And the irony of the situation tha=
t you've raised is that there is a reason that we can have legitimate
 discussions and even debates about the appropriate funding levels for the =
Department of Education.&nbsp; There are some basic questions that go to co=
re political beliefs about the proper role of government.&nbsp; That's not =
an excuse for congressional inaction, but
 it is an explanation for why you would have long-running debates about app=
ropriate levels of funding for that agency.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when it comes to giving=
 our public health professionals the resources that they need to fight Zika=
, or fighting the opioid epidemic, or even helping an American city rebuild=
 their water supply, I don't understand why that would
 get bogged down in partisanship.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no reason that should=
 come into conflict with the ideology of anybody who has got the best inter=
ests of the American people at heart.&nbsp; It shouldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; And, =
unfortunately, in the fact of a Republican Congress that time
 and time again refuses to do its job, it has.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217=
;m sorry to say that The Washington Post had a very good story today about =
this crisis and how the juggling of funds that has happened within the admi=
nistration is causing ripple effects and problems across states, across the
 country.&nbsp; Is that -- can you confirm that?&nbsp; Is that, indeed, hap=
pening -- because you have not gotten this emergency funding from Congress =
specifically from Zika, you are having to do a juggling act that is having =
ripple effects that is causing problems around
 the country? <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes.&nbs=
p; I happened to see the story, too.&nbsp; And I do think that it did chron=
icle the significant challenge that our public health professionals and tha=
t our emergency responders are facing right now.&nbsp; And they're not gett=
ing
 any help from Congress.&nbsp; In fact, Congress is making the problem wors=
e.&nbsp; Congress has put our emergency response officials in a situation o=
f choosing which oncoming potential disaster to prepare for, as opposed to =
doing the responsible thing and making sure
 that our emergency responders have all the resources that they need to pro=
tect us.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Knowing that there's -- h=
ere's the thing.&nbsp; When you're an emergency manager, you're often in a =
situation in which you are responding to a situation that nobody could have=
 ever predicted. No one can predict the exact
 path of a tornado.&nbsp; Nobody knows exactly how powerful a hurricane wil=
l strike the American coast this summer, if at all.&nbsp; Those are emergen=
cy situations that can't be predicted in advance, but yet our expectation i=
s that our emergency managers are going to
 have the necessary resources to deploy a flexible response and to keep us =
all safe.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question with Zika is, =
in some ways, not quite as complicated.&nbsp; We have known for months that=
 this was a virus that could threaten the American people, particularly as =
it relates to pregnant women.&nbsp; And we've known for months what
 kinds of steps we can take to fight it.&nbsp; There's nothing that we can =
do on this short of notice to make sure the Zika virus never enters the Uni=
ted States, but there are a whole bunch of things that we can do to blunt i=
ts impact.&nbsp; We can better fight the mosquito
 population -- that by personnel that can quickly respond in certain situat=
ions to go and kill mosquitos, that can actually have the effect of protect=
ing an entire community.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the things that our =
public health professionals have talked about is that if they detect that a=
n individual has tested positive for Zika, that essentially a strike team s=
hould go into that person's neighborhood and try to eradicate
 as many mosquitos as possible around that person's house to prevent a mosq=
uito from biting that person and spreading the disease to someone else.&nbs=
p; That's kind of a common-sense approach.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We have some strategies t=
o protect people, but they require resources.&nbsp; And that's to say nothi=
ng of the kinds of resources that could be invested in diagnostics that wou=
ld make sure that an individual like I just
 described has access to a test and can get the results of that test quickl=
y.&nbsp; In some cases, people may not be able to get tested and we won't k=
now whether or not they have the Zika virus.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As we've discussed in her=
e before, the vast majority of people who contract the Zika virus won't hav=
e any symptoms.&nbsp; But for those who do, they can get a diagnostic test =
in many situations.&nbsp; But because of constrained
 lab capacity, it could take them a couple of weeks to get the results.&nbs=
p; So, again, that couple of weeks' delay could expedite the spread of the =
disease.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, again, there are a nu=
mber of things that we know we can do to better protect the American people=
 from the Zika virus, and Congress hasn&#8217;t given us the resources to d=
o any of them.&nbsp; And to make matters worse,
 they haven&#8217;t just restrained resources when it comes to fighting Zik=
a, the government has been forced to try to look for other accounts where o=
ur fight against Zika can be enhanced.&nbsp; And that has meant that there =
are other worthy government programs that are
 critical to our homeland security that have been negatively affected.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I can't speak to conf=
irm any of the individual details in that story, but I suspect that those k=
inds of impacts aren&#8217;t just being felt in the handful of states that =
are mentioned in that story, they're having
 an impact in states all across the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last =
one on this, Josh.&nbsp; If there is a child that gets microcephaly from a =
domestically acquired infection, will that be on the Republicans' watch and=
 their responsibility?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I thin=
k what will be true is what you heard Dr. Fauci say when he stood at this p=
odium a couple of weeks ago. He said made clear that they don&#8217;t have =
-- that our public health professionals do not
 have all of the resources that they need to do everything that they can an=
d should be doing right now to prepare for Zika.&nbsp; And that's going to =
have consequences.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, as I said before, Ga=
rdiner, I don&#8217;t think there's a strategy that would prevent every inc=
ident of Zika in the United States.&nbsp; But there are surely steps that w=
e should already be taking to minimize the spread
 of the disease later this year.&nbsp; And every day that goes by, where Co=
ngress makes excuses, that's a day lost to preparing for the Zika fight.&nb=
sp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I've said this a coup=
le of times, and it's true -- there will be a day when I'm going to come ou=
t here and I'm going to do a briefing, and the headlines in the newspapers =

 the television stations are going to be worrying about the impact of the Z=

ing about all the steps that our public health professionals have taken to =
try to fight this disease.&nbsp; We're
 going to talk about all the steps that the administration has proposed, da=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I thin=

&nbsp; Obviously there were -- even in just the one bilateral meeting that =

 when we first arrived in Saudi Arabia, there were about 20 U.S. and Saudi =
officials in the same room.&nbsp; So that's a lot of different conversation=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You d=
idn&#8217;t hear it discussed?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I did =
not.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Rich.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh,=
 in regards to North Korea, when the President said to CBS that the United =
States is spending time positioning our missile defense systems, is that in=
 response to recent provocations to the last few months,
 or is that part of this broader pivot to Asia?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That's a=
 good question, Rich.&nbsp; This is actually something that our Department =
of Defense has been doing on the orders of the President for at least a cou=
ple of years now.&nbsp; There were a number of anti-ballistic missile
 capabilities that were moved to Alaska in 2014.&nbsp; We have increased th=
e deployment of naval assets in the Asia Pacific as a part of the Asia pivo=
t, but that also has enhanced our ability to counter ballistic missiles in =
that region of the world.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last several years=
, there's been equipment that's been deployed to places like Japan and Guam=
 that could be effective in protecting the United States and our allies fro=
m ballistic missiles.&nbsp; The United States is in discussions
 right now with our allies in South Korea about the potential deployment of=
 something called a THAAD battery.&nbsp; This is essentially an anti-ballis=
tic missile system that could be useful in protecting our allies in South K=
orea from a ballistic missile fired by
 the North Koreans.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is not a response t=
o recent provocations from North Korea, but rather a response to the threat=
 that has emanated from North Korea for quite some time now.&nbsp; I think =
it's an indication of the value in planning ahead and the strategic
 approach that President Obama and his national security team have taken to=
 protecting the American people in the face of the North Korean threat.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has tha=
t strategic approach changed at all since the fourth nuclear test in Januar=
y and then the submarine or the apparent submarine launch of a ballistic mi=
ssile this past weekend?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
aware of any -- let me take that back. I can think of one change.&nbsp; It =
was only in response to a more recent test from the North Koreans that the =
United States and South Korea began our dialogue about the potential
 deployment of an anti-ballistic missile battery in South Korea.&nbsp; That=
 was -- the beginning of those conversations was a response to a specific a=
nd recent event.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But other than that, I can'=
t think of any other responses that I can tell you about.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obvio=
usly, there are a number of things that our national security apparatus is =
engaged in on a daily basis to protect the American people. &nbsp;And
 when necessary, they can make changes that reflect the threat emanating fr=
om anywhere around the world, including in North Korea.&nbsp; But as it rel=
ates to things that I can talk about publicly, I don't have any other examp=
les for you other than discussions about
 the deployment of this THAAD battery to South Korea.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the =
administration confident in its ability to defend allies in the region on t=
he Korean Peninsula?&nbsp; And are sanctions working here?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Rich, I =
can tell you that the President is quite confident in the defense capabilit=
ies that we have to protect the American people and to protect our allies i=
n the Asia Pacific.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It means we need to continu=
e to monitor the threat that's emanating from North Korea.&nbsp; It means t=
hat we need to be nimble and adjust our strategy accordingly.&nbsp; But the=
re has been a significant commitment of resources and a lot of time
 spent considering how we can best arrange those resources to protect our a=
llies and protect the American people, and that work is ongoing.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it relates to the impact=
 of sanctions, we have not yet seen the desired change in behavior that is =
long overdue.&nbsp; But what we have succeeded in doing is working with the=
 international community to ramp up the pressure on the North
 Korean government even further.&nbsp; And that includes by targeting speci=
fic aspects of the North Korean economy that we know were used to fund thei=
r ballistic missile program.&nbsp; And we did succeed in working closely wi=
th the Chinese and other members of the U.N.
 Security Council to pass those sanctions and to implement them in a way th=
at maximizes the impact on the North Koreans.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the North Korean governm=
ent has been isolated for quite some time.&nbsp; That's had a terrible impa=
ct on the North Korean population, and it is solely as a result of the mana=
gement decisions that are being made by the North Korean government
 that that pressure has only tightened in recent months as a result of the =
stepped-up provocations from the North Koreans.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; The House plans to vote this week to reauthorize the D.C. Scho=
ol Choice program, something the President has opposed.&nbsp; Will he veto =
that legislation if it reaches him?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Dave, I =
know we have expressed our concerns about similar legislation in the past, =
but I haven't seen the specific proposal that has been put forward.&nbsp; I=
 know that our team has taken a look at it.&nbsp; But hopefully in the
 next couple of days we can give you a better answer in terms of our final =
position on it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On anot=
her matter, the House Armed Services chairman has floated a proposal to rei=
n in the size of the National Security Council and to possibly make the NSC=
 director subject to congressional confirmation.&nbsp; It look like it woul=
dn't
 affect your administration by the time it was enacted, but do you have tho=
ughts on it?&nbsp; Do you have a reaction to it?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, it=
 certainly makes me think that Republicans in Congress aren't too bullish a=
bout the prospects of a Republican succeeding President Obama.&nbsp; But yo=
u can ask them about that, I guess.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did see that the proposal=
 includes limiting the size of the National Security Council.&nbsp; I think=
 it warrants mentioning that under the leadership of the current National S=
ecurity Advisor, Susan Rice, the size of the National Security
 Council has actually shrunk 10 percent in just the last 18 months or so. A=
nd that's based on her own initiative to try to streamline the National Sec=
urity Council and make its actions even more efficient than it already is.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is something that w=
e're already focused on here.&nbsp; I have also seen that -- those proposal=
s suggest that the National Security Council staff should be capped at 50 p=
eople.&nbsp; I might note that the staff of the Senate Armed Services
 Committee is larger than that.&nbsp; That seems like a rather curious appo=
rtionment of resources when you consider the important work that's done at =
the National Security Council every day.&nbsp; So obviously we've got some =
concerns with their proposals.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217=
;m sure you've seen that the rationale for this proposal is to give the Con=
gress and the Pentagon more leverage in policy disputes with the White Hous=
e over military policy.&nbsp; Do you have a comment on that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, co=
nsidering that this Congress doesn't seem like they're at all prepared to p=
ass a budget for our military this year; considering that Congress has for =
the last two years refused to even consider seriously an authorization
 for the use of military force; and considering that there are a range of s=
pending reforms that the Department of Defense has repeatedly put forward o=
nly to see them be denied by Congress -- I saw a story while we were travel=
ing about continued opposition in
 Congress to considering another round of base closures.&nbsp; These are ba=
se closures that the Department of Defense assesses would have a positive i=
mpact on our national security because it would allow for the more efficien=
t deployment of military resources around
 the country.&nbsp; But Republicans, and some Democrats, probably, have voi=
ced some opposition to those reforms.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think all of that makes=
 clear that there are too many members of Congress that don't take very ser=
iously their responsibility to engage in a legitimate debate about policies=
 that are critical to our national security.&nbsp;
 That's why I&#8217;m surprised to hear that some of them are seeking more =
authority over those decisions that they have thus far refused to make.&nbs=
p;
<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JC.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How con=
cerned is Chancellor Merkel -- or did she express her concerns to the Presi=
dent while he was there that Schengen agreement regarding travel within the=
 EU, an essential part of the entire EU, that would remain in place despite
 some of the reactions had by some of the political activities that have go=
ne on in terms of -- vis-=E0-vis the refugee crisis going on right now?<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; JC, I do=
n't have more details to share.&nbsp; They're private conversations.&nbsp; =
And for her government&#8217;s view of that policy, I&#8217;d refer you to =
my German counterpart.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a nice guy.&nbsp; I got a chance to=
 see him over the weekend.&nbsp;
 (Laughter.)&nbsp; So I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d be happy to try to answer y=
our question. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think what I can tell you=
 more generally, though, is that Chancellor Merkel and the President had an=
 opportunity to consult with the leaders of the UK, France, and Italy yeste=
rday.&nbsp; And part of those discussions focused on the need
 for greater information-sharing to ensure that we're working together to c=
ombat homeland security threats to all of our nations.&nbsp; And that level=
 of information-sharing can and should improve.&nbsp; And doing so would im=
prove our national security.&nbsp; Okay?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pam, I&#8217;ll give you th=
e last one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on=
 the Zika funding, there were Republicans talking about $1.1 billion last w=
eek.&nbsp; Would that be enough to at least combat the problem this summer =
if that was the agreement?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ob=
viously, we&#8217;d have to take a look at what they're proposing.&nbsp; An=
d I would note that that's barely half of what we've indicated is needed.&n=
bsp; So I&#8217;m not going to rule it out until we've had an opportunity t=
o take
 a close look at it.&nbsp; But right now our concern isn&#8217;t just focus=
ed on the fact that it&#8217;s about half of what our public health profess=
ionals say that we need to effectively fight this fight.&nbsp; Right now ou=
r concern is that that funding is tied to a moribund appropriations
 process.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, again, there is very =
little prospect for the passage of appropriations bills before the fall at =
the earliest.&nbsp; The onset of Zika is going to be felt several months be=
fore that.&nbsp; And that's why we believe Congress
 needs to find a way to act before then, as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is=
 College Signing Day.&nbsp; Do we know yet where the First Daughter is goin=
g to college?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
know the answer to that.&nbsp; But once we have an announcement to make, we=
&#8217;ll make sure you all are read in.&nbsp; All right?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.&nbsp; We=
&#8217;ll see you tomorrow. <o:p></o:p></p>
