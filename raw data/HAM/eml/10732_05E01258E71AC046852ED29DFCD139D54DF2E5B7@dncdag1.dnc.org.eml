Plus Erik who has negotiated our debates. I believe we left that to the net=
works. If you get a little more info from him on what kind of story he's wo=
rking on we can decide if it's worth giving him any insight.

Subject: question

I have a question I am hoping someone there can help me with on background,=
 attributable to a "Democratic official" or whatever terms we negotiate.

Regarding the primary election debates, does anyone there know definitively=
 whether the presidential campaigns negotiate the share of questions they w=
ill receive (40% of the questions asked, 50%, etc.), or is that something t=
he network has license to decide? During the general election debate, I'm t=
old, an equal number of questions is a negotiated point.  But how does it w=
ork for the primary?

Thanks much for any guidance.
