THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release May 13, 2016





REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA

AND PRIME MINISTER STEFAN LFVEN OF SWEDEN

AFTER MULTILATERAL MEETING WITH NORDIC LEADERS



State Dining Room=20





12:15 P.M. EDT





 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, once again, I want to welcome our Nordic partners=
. The last time that we met together was three years ago in Sweden, and w=
e had a very productive meeting again here today.



As I said this morning, the United States is grateful for the partnership=
 that we have with all the countries represented around this table. They =
are, individually, not large countries in terms of population, but in ter=
ms of effectiveness, contributions, ideas, energy, they are enormously im=
portant players on the international stage. And the fact that our values =
and our interests align make them one of our most important partners. So =
we very much want to thank their presence.



Given the threats of terrorism, our Nordic partners are making significan=
t contributions in the fight against ISIL, including more Special Operati=
ons Forces, and aircrafts and trainers, more assistance to stabilize area=
s that have been liberated from ISIL, and more humanitarian assistance to=
 Syrians and Iraqis.=20



We discussed counterterrorism cooperation, and that includes the need to =
share more information. And I want to thank Denmark for new commitments t=
o the NATO mission in Afghanistan.



Beyond our military campaign, we agreed that we need to work together in =
support of a political settlement to end the Syrian civil war. And our co=
untries will continue to work together to counter violent extremists and =
to prevent people from being radicalized in the first place.



I want to commend the contributions that these countries have made in abs=
orbing refugees. And we had a significant discussion around the issue of =
migrants and refugees. I think it's useful for the American press to unde=
rstand that, although some of the absolute numbers that are going into th=
ese respective countries may not seem that large, when you look at it on =
a per-capita basis, they are making an enormously generous effort to help=
 people in great need. But it's important for the world to carry this bur=
den alongside them and not allow any individual country to carry those bu=
rdens alone, which is part of the reason why I'm glad we'll get strong co=
operation and participation in the summit on refugees that I intend to ho=
st in September in the margins of the U.N. General Assembly.



 With regard to European security, as we head into the NATO Summit in War=
saw, I'm pleased that Denmark and Norway will be joining the United State=
s in contributing to an enhanced allied forward presence to bolster our c=
ollective defense in Europe. And all of our nations agreed to increase co=
operation between NATO and the EU.=20



We agreed on the need to continue to support Ukraine, and maintain sancti=
ons against Russia until we can get a resolution, as was outlined in the =
Minsk agreements, and that those need to be fully implemented.



 We're united in our concern about Russia's growing aggressive military p=
resence and posture in the Baltic-Nordic region. We will be maintaining o=
ngoing dialogue and seek cooperation with Russia, but we also want to mak=
e sure that we are prepared and strong, and we want to encourage Russia t=
o keep its military activities in full compliance with international obli=
gations.=20



 As members of the EU, Denmark, Finland and Sweden are strong supporters =
of T-TIP. I reaffirmed my intention to try to get this done before the en=
d of the year. And we discussed the importance of Europe's energy securit=
y, including diversification of suppliers and sources and routes.=20



 Our six nations remain strong partners in climate change, including the =
implementation of the Paris agreement and transitioning to a low-carbon e=
conomy. And as Arctic nations, we committed to conservation and sustainab=
le development that prioritize our efforts to combat climate change. And =
we look forward to hosting the first-ever White House Arctic Science Mini=
sterial this fall to ensure that we're working together on that issue.



 And finally, all the leaders here are key partners in global development=
. The Nordic countries are some of the few countries -- and, by the way, =
the United States doesnt fall into this category of meeting the goals tha=
t had been set with respect to foreign aid and humanitarian assistance. A=
nd I'd like us to do even more. They're doing a great job. And the coordi=
nation in terms of global health security, in terms of encouraging women'=
s education and inclusion in economies, developing sustainable developmen=
t in poor countries, and eradicating extreme poverty, as was outlined in =
the 2030 agenda -- all these countries have been outstanding leaders in t=
his process. And one of the things we discussed is how we can coordinate =
better so that we get more effect from the common contributions that we'r=
e making in that regard.



 So I thought this was a very useful and important conversation -- althou=
gh there was probably too much agreement -- (laughter) -- to make for as =
exciting a multilateral meeting as I sometimes participate in.=20



 With that, what I'd like to do is to turn it over to Prime Minister Lfve=
n, who is going to be sharing, I think, for the group their perspective o=
n how the meeting went.=20



 Stefan.



 PRIME MINISTER LFVEN: Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you once again=
 for inviting us Nordic leaders to this summit. We appreciate it very muc=
h.



 We know that the United States and the Nordic countries, we share a grea=
t history. More than 11 million Americans have Scandinavian heritage. So =
we share that, but we also share many values. And that was clear today. L=
et me just give two examples.



 First, we agree on the need of global response to common challenges. And=
 the transatlantic link is more important than ever. It is actually key t=
o preserving European and global security. And in times when basic rules =
and norms of international standards are contested, we stand side by side=
 to defend them.=20



We will not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea, or accept Russian=
 aggression in Ukraine.=20



 We are convinced that a negotiated two-state solution is urgently needed=
 for peace and security for both Israel and Palestine, and will require a=
ctions and responsibility.



 We welcome the military progress made by the coalition against Daesh, wh=
ile seeking to complement these efforts with strong political and civilia=
n support. We also agreed to work together to tackle the root causes of f=
orced migration. I believe that we need a globally shared responsibility =
in handling the flows of migration, and we welcome the U.S.-led leaders s=
ummit on refugees in September, to which Sweden will seek to actively con=
tribute. And I will personally attend that summit. I think its very, very=
 important to have a global perspective on the migration issue.



 The same goes for climate change. And I applaud President Obamas instrum=
ental role in pushing for the climate agenda and a clean energy revolutio=
n in U.S. and globally. And our Nordic countries will gladly both coopera=
te and compete in the race to reduce emission. And I can also say that Sw=
eden aims to be the first fossil-free welfare nation in the world.



 Secondly, the U.S. and the Nordic countries share the belief that the be=
st foundation for individual freedom are jobs, growth, and social investm=
ents. To create jobs, we need free trade, sustainable investment that emb=
races innovation and new technology. That is why Im a staunch supporter o=
f bringing the U.S. and EU closer together through a strong Transatlantic=
 Trade and Investment Partnership.=20



 But with freedom comes also responsibility. We strive for trade that is =
both free and fair, enables social development, creates better working co=
nditions, and protects our environment. We share the belief that womens e=
mpowerment and participation in the workforce are necessary to achieve re=
al, sustainable development. Gender equality is both financially smart an=
d a fundamental matter of human rights.=20



 Our five countries have developed what has been known as the Nordic welf=
are model to enable more people to work, to increase gender equality, and=
 to create socially inclusive societies. And we are proud to see that tho=
se ideas are also discussed and developed here in the United States, with=
 President Obamas strong efforts for affordable health care, social safet=
y nets, and higher education system for all.=20



 I believe that seeing U.S. advance on these issues will create new rippl=
es of hope for all of us who believe in social justice and individual fre=
edom. And as we have read in The Atlantic, President Obama likes to say, =
if only everyone could be like the Scandinavians, this would all be easy.=
 (Laughter.) We don't know about that. But let me just add that we Scandi=
navians truly enjoy cooperation with the United States to make life not o=
nly easier, but better and freer for all.=20



 Thank you very much.



 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you very much, everybody.=20

.&nbsp; The last time that we met together was three years ago in Sweden, a=
nd we had a very productive meeting again here today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As I said this morning, t=
he United States is grateful for the partnership that we have with all the =
countries represented around this table.&nbsp; They are, individually, not =
large countries in terms of population, but
 in terms of effectiveness, contributions, ideas, energy, they are enormous=
ly important players on the international stage.&nbsp; And the fact that ou=
r values and our interests align make them one of our most important partne=
rs.&nbsp; So we very much want to thank their
 presence.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Given the threats of terr=
orism, our Nordic partners are making significant contributions in the figh=
t against ISIL, including more Special Operations Forces, and aircrafts and=
 trainers, more assistance to stabilize
 areas that have been liberated from ISIL, and more humanitarian assistance=
 to Syrians and Iraqis.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We discussed counterterro=
rism cooperation, and that includes the need to share more information.&nbs=
p; And I want to thank Denmark for new commitments to the NATO mission in A=
fghanistan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Beyond our military campa=
ign, we agreed that we need to work together in support of a political sett=
lement to end the Syrian civil war.&nbsp; And our countries will continue t=
o work together to counter violent extremists
 and to prevent people from being radicalized in the first place.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I want to commend the con=
tributions that these countries have made in absorbing refugees.&nbsp; And =
we had a significant discussion around the issue of migrants and refugees.&=
nbsp; I think it's useful for the American press
 to understand that, although some of the absolute numbers that are going i=
nto these respective countries may not seem that large, when you look at it=
 on a per-capita basis, they are making an enormously generous effort to he=
lp people in great need.&nbsp; But it's
 important for the world to carry this burden alongside them and not allow =
any individual country to carry those burdens alone, which is part of the r=
eason why I'm glad we'll get strong cooperation and participation in the su=
mmit on refugees that I intend to
 host in September in the margins of the U.N. General Assembly.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to European sec=
urity, as we head into the NATO Summit in Warsaw, I'm pleased that Denmark =
and Norway will be joining the United States in contributing to an enhanced=
 allied forward presence to bolster our collective defense
 in Europe.&nbsp; And all of our nations agreed to increase cooperation bet=
ween NATO and the EU.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We agreed on the need to =
continue to support Ukraine, and maintain sanctions against Russia until we=
 can get a resolution, as was outlined in the Minsk agreements, and that th=
ose need to be fully implemented.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're united in our concern=
 about Russia's growing aggressive military presence and posture in the Bal=
tic-Nordic region.&nbsp; We will be maintaining ongoing dialogue and seek c=
ooperation with Russia, but we also want to make sure that
 we are prepared and strong, and we want to encourage Russia to keep its mi=
litary activities in full compliance with international obligations.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As members of the EU, Denma=
rk, Finland and Sweden are strong supporters of T-TIP.&nbsp; I reaffirmed m=
y intention to try to get this done before the end of the year.&nbsp; And w=
e discussed the importance of Europe's energy security, including
 diversification of suppliers and sources and routes.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our six nations remain stro=
ng partners in climate change, including the implementation of the Paris ag=
reement and transitioning to a low-carbon economy.&nbsp; And as Arctic nati=
ons, we committed to conservation and sustainable development
 that prioritize our efforts to combat climate change.&nbsp; And we look fo=
rward to hosting the first-ever White House Arctic Science Ministerial this=
 fall to ensure that we're working together on that issue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally, all the leader=
s here are key partners in global development.&nbsp; The Nordic countries a=
re some of the few countries -- and, by the way, the United States doesn&#8=
217;t fall into this category of meeting the goals that had been
 set with respect to foreign aid and humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; And I'd=
 like us to do even more.&nbsp; They're doing a great job.&nbsp; And the co=
ordination in terms of global health security, in terms of encouraging wome=
n's education and inclusion in economies, developing
 sustainable development in poor countries, and eradicating extreme poverty=
, as was outlined in the 2030 agenda -- all these countries have been outst=
anding leaders in this process.&nbsp; And one of the things we discussed is=
 how we can coordinate better so that
 we get more effect from the common contributions that we're making in that=
 regard.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I thought this was a ver=
y useful and important conversation -- although there was probably too much=
 agreement -- (laughter) -- to make for as exciting a multilateral meeting =
as I sometimes participate in.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, what I'd like to=
 do is to turn it over to Prime Minister L=F6fven, who is going to be shari=
ng, I think, for the group their perspective on how the meeting went.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stefan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRIME MINISTER L=D6FVEN:&nb=
sp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; And thank you once again for inviting u=
s Nordic leaders to this summit.&nbsp; We appreciate it very much.<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that the United Sta=
tes and the Nordic countries, we share a great history.&nbsp; More than 11 =
million Americans have Scandinavian heritage.&nbsp; So we share that, but w=
e also share many values.&nbsp; And that was clear today.&nbsp; Let me just
 give two examples.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we agree on the need=
 of global response to common challenges.&nbsp; And the transatlantic link =
is more important than ever.&nbsp; It is actually key to preserving Europea=
n and global security.&nbsp; And in times when basic rules and norms
 of international standards are contested, we stand side by side to defend =
them.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We will not recognize the=
 illegal annexation of Crimea, or accept Russian aggression in Ukraine.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are convinced that a neg=
otiated two-state solution is urgently needed for peace and security for bo=
th Israel and Palestine, and will require actions and responsibility.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We welcome the military pro=
gress made by the coalition against Daesh, while seeking to complement thes=
e efforts with strong political and civilian support.&nbsp; We also agreed =
to work together to tackle the root causes of forced migration.&nbsp;
 I believe that we need a globally shared responsibility in handling the fl=
ows of migration, and we welcome the U.S.-led leaders&#8217; summit on refu=
gees in September, to which Sweden will seek to actively contribute.&nbsp; =
And I will personally attend that summit.&nbsp;
 I think it&#8217;s very, very important to have a global perspective on th=
e migration issue.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same goes for climate c=
hange.&nbsp; And I applaud President Obama&#8217;s instrumental role in pus=
hing for the climate agenda and a clean energy revolution in U.S. and globa=
lly.&nbsp; And our Nordic countries will gladly both cooperate and compete
 in the race to reduce emission.&nbsp; And I can also say that Sweden aims =
to be the first fossil-free welfare nation in the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the U.S. and the =
Nordic countries share the belief that the best foundation for individual f=
reedom are jobs, growth, and social investments.&nbsp; To create jobs, we n=
eed free trade, sustainable investment that embraces innovation
 and new technology.&nbsp; That is why I&#8217;m a staunch supporter of bri=
nging the U.S. and EU closer together through a strong Transatlantic Trade =
and Investment Partnership.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But with freedom comes also=
 responsibility.&nbsp; We strive for trade that is both free and fair, enab=
les social development, creates better working conditions, and protects our=
 environment. We share the belief that women&#8217;s empowerment
 and participation in the workforce are necessary to achieve real, sustaina=
ble development.&nbsp; Gender equality is both financially smart and a fund=
amental matter of human rights.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our five countries have dev=
eloped what has been known as the Nordic welfare model to enable more peopl=
e to work, to increase gender equality, and to create socially inclusive so=
cieties.&nbsp; And we are proud to see that those ideas are
 also discussed and developed here in the United States, with President Oba=
ma&#8217;s strong efforts for affordable health care, social safety nets, a=
nd higher education system for all.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that seeing U.S. =
advance on these issues will create new ripples of hope for all of us who b=
elieve in social justice and individual freedom.&nbsp; And as we have read =
in The Atlantic, President Obama likes to say, if only everyone
 could be like the Scandinavians, this would all be easy.&nbsp; (Laughter.)=
&nbsp; We don't know about that.&nbsp; But let me just add that we Scandina=
vians truly enjoy cooperation with the United States to make life not only =
easier, but better and freer for all.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Than=
k you very much, everybody.&nbsp; <o:p>
