Not necessarily. If Mika just doesn't like her, I'm not sure it's worth eit=
her of their time. I've lowered her expectations, but don't know. If you th=
ink Mika is set in stone I'm happy to kill it.

Hey Chuck, per our conversation earlier today, I=92d appreciate it if you p=
assed along the following to the Morning Joe team. I understand Joe and Mik=
a will say whatever they=92re going to say in terms of opinion, but at a mi=
nimum they should consider the facts on some of the key allegations they=92=
re making.

The DNC Chair has repeatedly said on the air and otherwise that it=92s not =
her job to tell either candidate to get out and has never called for anyone=
 to get out of the race. She has talked in very positive terms<https://www.=
democrats.org/Post/dnc-chair-statement-on-april-26-primary-results> about b=
oth of our candidates<https://www.democrats.org/Post/dnc-chair-statement-on=
-south-carolina-primary-results-feb-27> and the substantive campaigns they=
=92ve run<https://www.democrats.org/Post/dnc-chair-statement-on-new-hampshi=
re-primary-results>. As for the stuff that Joe and Mika tried to rehash thi=
s morning about debates, the fact is our debates earned far better ratings<=
https://medium.com/@MiraLuisDC/democratic-debate-ratings-rank-far-ahead-of-=
most-primary-debates-889d8ab42ca#.qepssg11f> overall this year than they di=
d in past cycles. And as NBC knows all too well, when we were able to get b=
oth campaigns to agree, we added four.


The rules in place for this election have been pretty much the same for sev=
eral cycles. In fact, the major change from 2008 =96 when Obama beat Clinto=
n --- is that there are actually LESS unpledged =93super=94 delegates, now =
down to 15% from 20% prior to the change. No one wrote or rewrote any rules=
 to help or hurt any specific candidate, these are the Party rules.



The single biggest factor determining the nominee (85%) is the participatio=
n of voters in primaries and caucuses. You can see a post we did here that =
lays out the facts on Super Delegates<https://medium.com/@patricetaylor/her=
e-are-the-actual-facts-about-super-delegates-7660c5c7dd1#.288n079v7>. It al=
so debunks the false myths about Iowa.



The DNC=92s delegate selection rules for this primary were set before any o=
f these candidates declared, and are consistent with the rules in place for=
 several cycles =96 including 2008 when Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clint=
on.



There=92s just no evidence that the process has been rigged. It certainly w=
asn=92t rigged in Nevada this weekend, which was not a DNC event but a stat=
e party one. But don=92t take it from us, here=92s what Jon Ralston wrote:
