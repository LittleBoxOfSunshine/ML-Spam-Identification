Subject: President Obama in Seattle on June 24



Hello Tom,


I wanted you to be the first to know this exciting news - on Friday, June 2=
4th, President Barack Obama will be coming to Seattle for a dinner to suppo=
rt my campaign!  You have been a wonderful supporter and I am hopeful that =
you will continue that support by serving as a Table Captain at this histor=
ic event.

To serve as a table captain you would sell ten seats for this exciting dinn=
er on June 24th at the Washington State Convention Center.  You can either =
recruit your friends and colleagues to purchase tickets individually or pur=
chase the table yourself.  All table captains will have their names placed =
in a lottery to be one of the lucky individuals to have their photo taken w=
ith President Obama.

You can sign up to be a table captain here: www.jayinslee.com/tablecaptain<=
http://jayinslee.com/tablecaptain>



The President's help comes at a pivotal time for my reelection.  I hope you=
 will join Trudi and me as we welcome President Obama back to Seattle for w=
hat is likely to be his last trip as President.  We look forward to having =
you join us to hear from the President as he continues to fight for economi=
c justice and our shared progressive values.

Friday, June 24, 2016 - Time: dinner

800 Convention Place | Seattle

24@jayinslee.com> if you would like to host a table, or if you have any que=

d to sharing this experience with you.
