Hi all =97 Below are three emails we=92re planning to send from Hillary Cli=
nton on Monday. HFA and she have already signed off on these, but let me kn=
ow if you have any flags.

--v1--
Sender: Hillary Clinton
Subject:

Friend--

What was once unimaginable is now all but certain. Donald Trump will be the=
 Republican nominee for president.

This isn't hyperbole: our country -- and the whole world -- is counting on =
us to win this election.

No matter who you're supporting in our Democratic primary, I know this team=
 will step up and do all we can to keep Trump out of the White House.

Please give what you can today, and let's start defeating Donald Trump righ=
t away:

Thank you,

Hillary



--v2--
Sender: Hillary Clinton
Subject:

Friend --

The Republican Party has a new leader: Donald Trump. I can=92t think of a t=
ime in my life when I=92ve been prouder to be a Democrat -- or more committ=
ed to building a strong party.

Consider Trump=92s stated goals for his first 100 days in office: He plans =
to undo some of President Obama=92s most important accomplishments, like th=
e Affordable Care Act and executive orders on immigration, and he promises =
to appoint a =93Scalia-like=94 justice to the Supreme Court to rip away our=
 dearest progress, like marriage equality and a woman=92s right to choose.

NAME, we absolutely cannot let those things happen. We need to protect and =
build on President Obama=92s legacy, for our shared values, and for the fut=
ure of the country we love. [link] Your $ASK contribution to the Democratic=
 National Committee today will do just that -- can you help? [/link]

As Democrats, we have a very different vision for our country, from protect=
ing LGBT people and public education at the state level to raising the mini=
mum wage and confronting climate change as a nation. We know that there are=
 no magic solutions -- we get things done by rolling up our sleeves and put=
ting in hard work.

That starts with working to elect Democrats all across this country, to pro=
tect President Obama=92s legacy, and to make sure Donald Trump never, ever =
becomes president.

We can=92t win this fight without you, NAME. Chip in now -- the world is co=
unting on us:

URL

With deep thanks,

Hillary

--v3--
Sender: Hillary Clinton
Subject:

Friend =97

As Democrats, we believe that no one who works hard every day should have t=
o live in poverty because they=92re paid a minimum wage that=92s too low. W=
e know that climate change is a challenge we must confront. We believe no y=
oung person should have to spend so much on a college education that they e=
nd up shackled by years of debt.

And we know that we can never, never allow Donald Trump to become President=
 of the United States.

[link]Will you donate $ASK today to help keep that from happening?[/link]

Any Republican president would put President Obama=92s progress on economic=
 security in danger, make moves to repeal health care reform that millions =
of Americans are now relying on, and try to move backwards on the steps we=
=92ve taken these past seven years to make our country more equal and more =
fair.

But it=92s clear that Trump -- with his repugnant attitude toward women, im=
migrants, Muslim-Americans, and pretty much anyone he comes across -- is th=
e worst of the bunch.

We=92re going to be going up against him this fall. So right now, I=92m ask=
ing you to pitch in $10 or whatever you can so that Democrats can stop Dona=
ld Trump:
