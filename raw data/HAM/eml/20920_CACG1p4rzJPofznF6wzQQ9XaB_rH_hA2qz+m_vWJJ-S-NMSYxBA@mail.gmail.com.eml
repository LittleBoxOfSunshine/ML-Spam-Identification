Ken -

Unfortunately due to WH protocol, because they don't have a passport or US
Green card, they won't be able to attend the evening and will need to be
refunded in order to ensure compliance of FEC campaign finance regulations.

Would you like us to be the bearer of bad news or would you prefer to reach
out? We're happy to take your lead.

Thanks, and 2 more spots are now opened up for what (little) that's worth.

Best,
Zach
