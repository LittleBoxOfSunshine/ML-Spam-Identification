Today in the fight for a full, nine seat Supreme Court: Iowans fly to DC an=
d join Sen. Reid to tell Sen. Grassley to do his job, new polling shows vot=
ers in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida want their Senators to move forward o=
n Chief Judge Garland's nomination, and a new memo by People for the Americ=
an Way and the Center for American Progress details Sen. Grassley's pattern=
 of inaction and obstruction on judicial nominations during his time as Sen=
ate Judiciary Chairman.

Former Grassley supporters fly to DC and join Sen. Reid to tell Sen. Grassl=
ey: Do Your Job.
Sen. Harry Reid held a press conference with former Sen. Grassley supporter=
s who flew in from Iowa to tell Sen. Grassley to do his job and give Suprem=
e Court nominee Merrick Garland a fair hearing and a vote. Watch a video of=
 the press conference HERE<https://www.facebook.com/weneednine/videos/17823=
01601991364/> and Sen. Reid's follow up remarks HERE<https://www.facebook.c=
om/weneednine/videos/1782338175321040/>.

Swing-state voters overwhelmingly support immediate Senate action on Chief =
Judge Garland's nomination.
According to a new Quinnipiac University Poll<https://www.qu.edu/images/pol=
ling/ps/ps05112016_S28whtr.pdf>, a majority of voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio=
 and Florida-all states with contested Senate races -want Senate Republican=
s to hold a hearing and an up-or-down vote on Chief Judge Garland's nominat=
ion this year. Results include:


*         58% of Pennsylvania voters want the Senate to consider Chief Judg=
e Garland's nomination this year, including 57% of independent voters.

*         56% of Ohio voters want the Senate to consider Chief Judge Garlan=
d's nomination this year.

*         54% of Florida voters want the Senate to consider Chief Judge Gar=
land's nomination this year, including 58% of independent voters.

Sen. Toomey's Supreme Court obstruction creates an "intensity of feeling fa=
vor[ing] Democrats."
The Philadelphia Inquirer<http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/capitolinq/Q-P=
oll-Toomey-McGinty-in-dead-heat.html> reports:

"Two weeks after the Democratic primary, the Quinnipiac University survey f=
ound 45 percent of Pennsylvania voters backing Toomey against 44 percent fo=
r Democrat Katie McGinty in one of the most closely-watched races in the co=
untry...Democrats have been hammering Toomey over his opposition to Garland=
, staging protests and running television ads painting him as an obstructio=
nist. Republicans have argued that few voters will make electoral decisions=
 based on the issue, and that it's equally important to conservatives that =
Toomey help stop a nominee who would change the balance of the Supreme Cour=
t....But this poll says the intensity of feeling favors Democrats."

Sen. Grassley' legacy: the do-nothing chairman
Today, People for the American Way and the Center for American Progress rel=
eased a memo<http://www.pfaw.org/press-releases/2016/05/chuck-grassley-do-n=
othing-chairman> detailing how Senator Grassley's refusal to hold a hearing=
 on President Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Co=
urt highlights a pattern of inaction apparent throughout his leadership of =
the Senate Judiciary Committee.

"Grassley's refusal to do his job goes well beyond his partisan blockade of=
 a qualified nominee to our nation's highest court... By the end of April 2=
008, [Sen. Patrick Leahy] had worked to confirm 45 judges with only 32 nomi=
nations remaining before the Senate... During the comparable time period be=
tween January 2015 and April of this year, Grassley has only managed to con=
firm 17 nominees, barely a third the number of Patrick Leahy under George W=
. Bush."

Sen. Grassley's reelection hopes are increasingly in jeopardy as he leads S=
enate GOP's Supreme Court obstruction.
A memo by the DSCC<http://www.dscc.org/press-release/memo-senator-chuck-gra=
ssley-increasingly-vulnerable-leads-supreme-court-obstruction/> outlines ho=
w Sen. Grassley's leadership in blocking Chief Judge Garland's nomination h=
urts his standing with his constituents.

"After Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February, Senator Grassley chose t=
o help lead Republicans' unprecedented obstruction of the Supreme Court, an=
d he's become increasingly vulnerable in these subsequent weeks. A majority=
 of Iowans want the Senate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy this year, and=
 that's hurt Grassley's standing with Iowa voters who wonder what happened =
to the Grassley they once knew. And now with Donald Trump leading the top o=
f the GOP ticket, Chuck Grassley's reelection is anything but certain."

FACT CHECK: Sen. Grassley previously said it is the Senate's responsibility=
 to review presidential judicial appointments
The DPCC used Sen. Grassley's own past statements on the Supreme Court vaca=
ncy to fact-check a recent blog post in which the Senator perpetuates Repub=
lican-created myths about the Supreme Court nomination process. Read the me=
mo HERE<http://www.dpcc.senate.gov/?p=3Dissue&id=3D561>.

Qualifications seem to be irrelevant to Senate Republicans.
While Senate Republicans are getting behind Donald Trump-a man who has neve=
r before held elected office - they are rejecting a Supreme Court nominee w=
ith more judicial experience than any other in recent memory. Christian Far=
ias of the Huffington Post<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/merrick-garl=
and-never-overruled_us_5731f86ee4b096e9f092a569> reports on Garland's quest=
ionnaire:

"There was also this nugget from when he was in private practice:  While I =
was at Arnold & Porter in the 1980s, a young man who worked as a photocopie=
r operator at the firm asked me to help him with his writing. I worked with=
 and mentored him over many years, both while I was in private practice and=
 in the government, from the time we met through his successful graduation =
from law school and entry into the legal profession. Will any of this matte=
r? Probably not, as qualifications seem to be irrelevant to Senate Republic=
ans who appear increasingly persuaded that a businessman with zero governme=
nt experience and troubling constitutional views would somehow uphold their=
 vision of a principled conservative for the Supreme Court."

A look ahead at upcoming Senate courtesy meetings with Chief Judge Merrick =
Garland:

THURSDAY 05/12/16


*         Senator Jon Tester (D-MT)
