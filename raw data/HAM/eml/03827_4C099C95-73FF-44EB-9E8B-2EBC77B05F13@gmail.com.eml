Garret has already spoken with Shana before we even got off the plane. We w=
ill call The Assemblywoman when we get to the hotel. Ethan Berkowitz is the=
 new Mayor of Anchorage. I know him. He was an R2B candidate in '06 when I =
co-chaired it. He's also Jewish.=20

chorage and that her understanding is the the Senator has assigned someone =
from his team- Shana Thoma to you for the day.   Assemblywoman Gray-Jackson=
 is originally from Jersey. She is going to events during the day, but not =
the dinner. She said she's from Newark and she won't be bullied and she did=
n't want to have to curse anybody out. But, after talking to Chaka, she was=
 at an event with the Mayor and told him about you coming, etc and he said =
that it was all worked out. So Garret, here are two numbers for you:
