ve access to treatment and support recovery.



Prescription drug abuse and heroin use have taken a heartbreaking toll on=
 too many Americans and their families, while straining resources of law =
enforcement and treatment programs. More Americans now die every year fro=
m drug overdoses than they do in motor vehicle crashes. The President has=
 made clear that addressing the opioid overdose epidemic is a priority fo=
r his Administration and has highlighted tools that are effective in redu=
cing drug use and overdose, like evidence-based prevention programs, pres=
cription drug monitoring, prescription drug take-back events, medication-=
assisted treatment and the overdose reversal drug naloxone.



The event will feature remarks by White House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarr=
ett, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, and Director of National Drug Control =
Policy Michael Botticelli. The event will also feature members of the cas=
t and production team of the Warner Bros. Television-produced CBS comedy =
series Mom&lrm;.



The Champions of Change program was created as an opportunity for the Whi=
te House to feature individuals doing extraordinary things to empower and=
 inspire members of their communities. The event will be open press and s=
treamed live on www.whitehouse.gov/live [ http://www.whitehouse.gov/live =
].To learn more about the White House Champions of Change program, visit =
www.whitehouse.gov/champions [ http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions ]. Fol=
low the conversation at #WHchamps.



*WHEN*: Friday, April 29, 2016 at 1:00 PM ET



*WHERE: *Eisenhower Executive Office Building, South Court Auditorium



*MEDIA REGISTRATION: **This event will be open press, but space is limite=
d.Members of the media who wish to cover this event must RSVP via the fol=
lowing link by **12:00PM ET, Thursday, April 28**: *https://www.whitehous=
e.gov/webform/media-rsvp-champions-change-advancing-prevention-treatment-=

ng form by the deadline for access to the White House complex:** *https:/=
