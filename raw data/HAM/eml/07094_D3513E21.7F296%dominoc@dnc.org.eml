TITLE: Democrats are ready for the general elections, thanks in part to joi=
nt victory funds
BYLINE: Brad Marshall


When I started working at the Democratic National Committee, the office was=
 smaller, the computers were bigger, and if I wanted to talk through campai=
gn finance, it meant blocking off a couple hours and going out for coffee.

Since then, there have been a whole lot of changes. But one thing that stay=
ed pretty constant? We are still using joint victory funds to make sure tha=
t every Democrat has the resources they need to succeed in November.

This year, we have established joint victory funds with both the Clinton an=
d the Sanders campaigns, which is exactly what we did with the Obama campai=
gn in 2012, with both the Obama and Clinton campaigns in 2008, with the Ker=
ry campaign in 2004, and you get the picture. Under these agreements, our c=
andidates can fundraise simultaneously for their campaigns, for the DNC, an=
d for the state parties that do so much work to support down-ballot Democra=
ts. And yes, these funds are absolutely allowed by the Federal Elections Co=
mmission.

There has been a lot of confusion and misinformation about the joint victor=
y funds, so I want to correct a few points.


1. Joint Victory Funds are building our general election nest egg
Millions of dollars that we have earmarked for the general election are sit=
ting in the bank, ready to be distributed to state parties (and, for what i=
t=92s worth, to the DNC) once the general election is officially underway. =
You may have heard that state parties are only keeping 1% of the money bein=
g raised by Joint Victory Funds, but that=92s misleading. It ignores the mo=
ney that is being kept safe for general election needs. As more coordinated=
 campaign offices - home bases for Democrats working and volunteering for p=
residential, statewide, and local candidates - are established, that money =
will pay for staff and office space.

2. Joint Victory Funds pay for resources the state parties need
You probably know that the DNC manages a massive amount of voter data that =
everyone from our presidential campaigns down to candidates running for loc=
al office can leverage in their races. But that costs a lot of money, and t=
he staff and vendors who manage that data are paid by the DNC. The DNC is a=
lso building the tools and staff to manage complex rapid response, communic=
ations, and digital organizing needs - again, we pay for it, and give the t=
ools and resources to down-ballot Dems.

3. Joint Victory Funds are legal
It might sound strange coming from the guy who manages the Democratic Party=
=92s money, but I believe that putting commonsense limits on the amount of =
money any one person can give to a candidate or political party is good for=
 our democracy. And that=92s also one of the good things about joint victor=
y funds =97 they have a lot of legal limitations in place that help to keep=
 the amount of money we raise under control and ensure that every dollar ge=
ts reported.

But you don=92t have to trust me: Dr. Rick Hasen is an expert in campaign f=
inance and election law and a professor at  University of California, Irvin=
e School of Law, and he has responded to criticism of the DNC=92s use of jo=
int victory funds by saying, in short, =93legally, this seems weak.=94

The general election will be here before we know it, and I=92m resting easi=
er knowing that we have built the tools and saved the money we need to come=
 out of the gate as strong as possible. If you care about electing Democrat=
s, you should feel that way, too.
