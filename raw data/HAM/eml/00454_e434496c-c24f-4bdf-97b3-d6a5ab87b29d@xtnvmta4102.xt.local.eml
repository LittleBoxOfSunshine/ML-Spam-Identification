By Natasha Korecki (nkorecki@politico.com; @natashakorecki) with Manuela Tobias (mtobias@politico.com; @manuelatobiasm)  

Good Thursday morning, Illinois. Gov. Bruce Rauner's polling numbers are edging dangerously close to Mayor Rahm Emanuel territory. A new survey out today by Morning Consult shows Rauner's approval dipped 8 percentage points to 34 percent since it conducted a similar survey last year. 

The percentage of people who said they disapproved of the way that Rauner is doing his job went up by 9 points, giving him a disapproval rating of 54 percent. According to the Morning Consult rankings, Rauner is the sixth most unpopular governor in America. His numbers dropped during a period that saw an unprecedented Illinois' budget stalemate persist, leaving social services in a lurch and a very public crisis in higher education that was only recently, partially resolved. 

From Morning Consult: Most Unpopular U.S. Governors: 

1. Sam Brownback (R-Kansas) 

2. Dan Malloy (D-Conn.) 

3. Rick Snyder (R-Mich.) 

4. Chris Christie (R-N.J.) 

5. Paul LePage (R-Maine) 

6. Bruce Rauner (R-Ill.) 

7. Gina Raimondo (D-R.I.) 

8. Scott Walker (R-Wis.) 

9. Matt Bevin (R-Ky.) 

10. Mary Fallin (R-Okla.) 

The full report goes live this morning here: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f496405965c2259f4fc3e5d741c6909fe326c70d2156a365e4eadefe9 

IN LEADERSHIP'S HANDS -- A group of lawmakers from both parties and both legislative chambers who had been meeting as part of the so-called Budgeteer Group in Springfield is forwarding a budget package to leadership, Illinois Playbook has learned. As part of the package: proposed cuts and proposed tax increases. There are no items from Rauner's turnaround agenda included in it. 

"This is a really simple budget issue. Just pluses and minuses. That was the agreement from all the leaders," said a legislative source who is part of the negotiations. "This is a package that somehow on paper is balanced. This is forwarded to the leaders and the governor and we'll see how they react ... Keep in mind, that at the end of the day, no matter what we put together, this particular group cannot get to 60 votes in the House and 30 votes in the Senate. That's up to leaders and to the governor's office." 

MONEY FOR SCHOOLS -- What's not included in the package? Funding for K-12 education. Education leaders in the House are discussing a new "hybrid" plan that would take portions of a Senate-backed funding formula overhaul and partner it with a so-called evidence-based plan backed by school superintendents. Sources tell Playbook that Manar's proposal will have a tough time passing as is, with opposition coming from lawmakers whose school districts lose out under the Bunker Hill Democrat's funding proposal change. The hybrid approach would mean no schools would lose money but Manar's machinations would go into effect based on district need to boost those with the least funding, while keeping
 others at the same levels.

SCHOOL SUPTS WORRY -- "Moline superintendent among those warning of possible layoffs and closures," by The Associated Press' Shellie Nelson: "Illinois superintendents warned of school closures and staff layoffs as they implored state lawmakers to pass a budget to give them certainty for the fall. Education funding is the only portion of the budget for the current year that Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner signed. But superintendents from districts including Kankakee, Moline, and Streator expressed worry that there's no agreement for next year yet. They say they'll have to deplete their reserves to open this fall and that some might not make it all year."

DEATH THREAT TO GOVERNOR -- "Elgin Man Accused of Threatening Gov. Bruce Rauner," by Patch.com's Amie Schaenzer: "Bail has been set at $50,000 for an Elgin man accused of leaving a voicemail death threat for Gov. Bruce Rauner, the Elgin Courier-News reports. Jesse M. Kuzma, 31, of the 1100 block of West Highland Avenue, is charged with a felony count of threatening a public official. Kane County Assistant State's Attorney Scott Schwertley told the Daily Herald Kuzma left a message with Rauner's office at 11 p.m. on Friday. In the voicemail he stated, 'If I ever see you, consider this your death threat.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f49640596ce6ba091cd14428f2f26c010e20ffc573aaac2bcb6debf5c 
 
EXELON WANTS 'STATE ASSISTANCE' -- "Officials will plead Exelon nuke case with Rauner," by The News-Gazette's Tom Kacich: "Central Illinois legislators, labor union officials and representatives of taxing districts will meet with Gov. Bruce Rauner Thursday to underscore the importance of the Clinton nuclear power plant to the region's economy. Exelon Corp., which owns the Clinton plant, said last week that it would have to close the plant next year without help from the state. Another Exelon-owned nuclear facility at Cordova, near the Quad Cities, would have to close a year later without assistance, the company said. The 29-year-old Clinton plant operates efficiently, but has lost $453
 million over the last six years, primarily because its costs are greater than other power plants in the Midcontinent Independent System Operators region, which includes a lot of low-cost wind, coal-fired and natural-gas plants, company spokesman Brett Nauman said." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f4964059653df32c493f29aa3ecf1f1aa1d05079e24c4ba7617c34294 

AS A SIDE NOTE -- EXELON reported $34.5 billion in revenue in 2015. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f496405964072bf13fa5be80672ff9e4dbd616e04a81fad04aee32672  
 
WAS NOTHING PERSONAL, DOROTHY -- "Effort to appoint court clerk ditched amid racial accusations," by Chicago Tribune's Hal Dardick: "An effort to make the elected post now held by embattled Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown an appointed office was abandoned Wednesday amid an outcry from a bevy of African-American groups that alleged racial motives were behind the initiative. In a County Board room packed with black protesters, including members of Black Lives Matter Chicago and members of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH, Commissioner Peter Silvestri, R-Elmwood Park, withdrew his proposal ... 'I am very concerned about the divisive nature of this resolution, especially
 taken out of context as it has in so many different ways in the last couple of days,' Silvestri added. 'This had nothing ever to do with the Circuit Court clerk. I consider her a friend.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f4964059653a4b94fdb3ecdaba67ea4aadedcad7dd21dcdf4694748f9 

HUMAN SERVICES HELP -- "Measure to provide $700M for human services advances in House," by State Journal-Register's Doug Finke: "A House committee has given preliminary approval to legislation to spend $700 million to help out financially strapped human services in the state. The House Human Services Appropriations Committee approved the measure on a unanimous vote Wednesday ... about $700 million is being directed to a variety of human services programs that aren't covered by consent decrees or court orders that have kept much of state spending going out the door even without a state budget." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f4964059662671c4e0b8e7fbc2837389cbb24fb6e8c2801b7eaf3ea3f 

STUDENTS OF COLOR HIT HARDEST IN SCHOOL BUDGET STALEMATE -- "Illinois fiscal crisis threatens progress in college-going for students of color," by Catalyst Chicago's Melissa Sanchez: "The recent higher education bill that sent $600 million in stopgap funding to public colleges and universities will keep them afloat for the next few months. But with long-term state funding still held hostage by the ongoing budget crisis, deeper problems with college access and affordability remain unsolved for low-income and first-generation students of color, who depend most heavily on state aid and publicly funded universities. These cuts threaten the progress that Chicago and Illinois have made in getting
 more of these students into college and earning degrees." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f49640596e0b342eb3f061051d9268e281c3e999485eec5830e73915a 

CONTROVERSIAL RULING -- "Judge refuses to reinstate $3.5 million jury verdict in fatal police shooting," by Chicago Tribune's Jason Meisner: "A Cook County judge ruled Tuesday her controversial decision to negate a $3.5 million jury verdict in a wrongful death lawsuit over a fatal Chicago police shooting should stand. Associate Judge Elizabeth Budzinski threw out the jury's award of damages in November. The jury had found Officer Marco Proano had used unjustified force in killing 19-year-old Niko Husband in 2011. But in answering 'yes' to a written question as part of their decision, jurors contradicted the verdict by indicating Proano had a reasonable belief that his life was in danger
 when he opened fire. In asking Budzinski to reinstate the $3.5 million award, lawyers for Husband's mother, Priscilla Price, had argued the wording of the question was confusing." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f49640596886f6cfc7ea2b83764f2725b25f75766aba148fe91252e0c 

KEEPING HIS FOOT ON THE PLATE -- "Tunney stands his ground against Cubs' patio license squeeze play," by Chicago Sun-Times' Fran Spielman: "Like a catcher blocking home plate before the rules were changed, Ald. Tom Tunney (44th) on Tuesday stood his ground against the Cubs' request for a patio permit to sell liquor at an open-air plaza adjacent to a renovated Wrigley Field. 'Remember they wanted to close Clark and Addison? This is another way of trying to close Clark and Addison. If you look at the rules for the patio license they requested, they could stay open from 11 a.m. to midnight and allow people to drink all day and all night during the game and after the game. That's a public
 safety issue,' Tunney said." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f496405960b11c0ea7d3d98184e138a2024585ce75ffaa416e572735f 

RENTAL REALITY -- "Airbnb moved in, and there went my neighborhood," by Samuel A. Lichtenfeld for Crain's: "'Nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.' You've heard the common refrain. But if Mayor Rahm Emanuel and some aldermen get their way, you may hear the same thing about your neighborhood. They call Chicago a city of neighborhoods. Yet the Great American City is being invaded by the vacation rental industry, led by Airbnb. The City Council is considering an ordinance that would regulate Airbnb rentals here. You may live near such a rental. Chances are good you do not know the owner. Chances are good the city does not either." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f49640596c8609fbcf4868647a936c508fa68293eb2a9c7a1227cf721
 

IT'S A DIGNITY DEBATE -- "Transgender rights fight is about dignity, not privacy," by Chicago Tribune's Eric Zorn: "Come on, it's not really about bathrooms at all, is it? Much of the current debate over the rights of transgender people centers on which multiple-occupancy public restrooms and changing rooms trans people should be allowed to use. North Carolina officials and the U.S Justice Department recently filed dueling lawsuits over that state's new law mandating that people use bathrooms corresponding to the gender on their birth certificate in government facilities. And the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois announced Tuesday it will intervene in opposition to a lawsuit filed
 last week that seeks to ban Palatine-based Township High School District 211 from allowing a transgender girl access to the girls' locker room." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f496405961c063e8a2eab6d12a7f6e879f3885c4d038d343fc56689cc 

SPEAKING UP FOR FIRST TIME -- "CPS principal, mayoral critic to tell of CPS charges he faces," by Chicago Sun-Times' Lauren FitzPatrick: "Principal Troy LaRaviere, who's been ousted from a Lake View elementary school, plans to finally discuss the charges Chicago Public Schools has filed against him at a news conference Thursday morning. LaRaviere, one of Mayor Rahm Emanuel's loudest critics who actively campaigned against him, says he will speak to the charges he faces for the first time since being forced out of top-rated Blaine Elementary School. He had a formal hearing on Wednesday before a hired independent hearing officer at Chicago Public Schools to determine the future of his job." 
http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f4964059649f0973017cc8cde4320054d782934099a0b220d798f5f88 

NO SECOND CHANCE -- "Chance The Rapper, Whose Dad Works For Rahm, Says Chicago 'Needs A New Mayor,'" Chicagoist's Mae Rice: "'We need a new mayor, for sure,' Chance the Rapper says of Chicago in a new Complex profile, responding to a suggestion from the writer that President Barack Obama could run for mayor here after his presidential term is up ... However, that particular stands out because Chance's father works for Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the guy Chance was implicitly criticizing. Ken Bennett, Chance's dad (Chance was born Chancelor Bennett) works as Rahm's Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of Public Engagement. He was appointed to both posts in 2014, according to the Tribune."

-- "Emanuel blames 40 years of financial neglect for bad poll results," Chicago Sun-Times' Fran Spielman: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f4964059693c72871e5ac5f3448a34a775f2f790da56c0b38e2a2a5c0 

-- "Emanuel names Zopp deputy mayor, announces CTA South Side service expansion," - Chicago Tribune's Bill Ruthhart: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f4964059681c82d4366238958514a5898c5f988a425dd24cfa67d4c12 

SCHOOL MONEY OPTIONS -- "Slowik: No need for Southlanders to lose sleep over state school funding reform," by Chicago Tribune's Ted Slowik: "This week's action on state funding for schools reflects good news and bad news for Southland residents. The state Senate on Tuesday approved a funding reform proposal by Andy Manar, D-Bunker Hill, that would gradually increase state funding for poor districts and decrease it for wealthy ones. The measure now goes to the House. Manar's plan would help places like Hazel Crest, Country Club Hills, Chicago Heights and Harvey; and hurt places like Tinley Park, Orland Park, Mokena and Frankfort." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f49640596173e3264f01845d9e893953c2c7e0c4d5405c6106717062b 

TICK TOCK -- "Emanuel keeps Wall Street waiting on pension overhaul," by Chicago Tribune's Hal Dardick: "When the Illinois Supreme Court decisively rejected Mayor Rahm Emanuel's plan to keep two city worker pension systems from going broke, City Hall told nervous credit-rating agencies it would have an alternate fix within weeks. Nearly seven weeks later, Emanuel's top aides have yet to propose any new ideas, much less file the state legislation that would be needed to make it reality. Playing the waiting game are Wall Street analysts. Their pronouncements on Chicago's creditworthiness determine how much it costs the city to borrow money, and they've already warned that further downgrades
 could be coming if there is no solution for the pension funds covering municipal workers and laborers." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f4964059686782b0a4b9c5c604f6216c884e44b0768c5eab0c5a72970 

PUTTING KIDS IN JOBS THIS SUMMER -- "Emanuel's Summer Jobs Program to Create 25,000 Jobs for Chicago Youth," by NBC Chicago's Tom Schuba: "Mayor Rahm Emanuel touted a jobs program Wednesday that will reportedly create 25,000 summer jobs for young Chicagoans this year. The mayor visited Children's Home and Aid in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood to discuss the One Summer Chicago program which focuses on creating job and internship program for Chicagoans aged 14 to 24. 'Summer is just around the corner, and with more than 25,000 job opportunities, we are helping our youth earn a paycheck and realize their full potential,' Emanuel said. 'Chicago continues to step up for our children and create
 more of these critical opportunities each year, even as the state has stepped back.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f49640596704377b0006af578f77fc8d9dd4f418a60036ed075068905 

COST OVERRUNS -- "Navy Pier Transformation Hits Some Snags," WBEZ 91.5: "Summer is fast approaching, but the new-and-improved Navy Pier is not quite as ready as it was supposed to be by this time. Crain's Chicago Business reporter Danny Ecker gives us an update on the cost overruns, new features and construction timetable going forward as Navy Pier undergoes its transformation to celebrate its centennial." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f4964059676d49fbbdde78397c5e7f054941dc108a3f00fda27e05b61 

BATTLING A WAR HERO -- "Sen. Mark Kirk targets 'war hero' Rep. Tammy Duckworth's record on veterans," by Associated Press's Sara Burnett: "Rep. Tammy Duckworth lost both legs when her helicopter was shot down in Iraq, then went on to hold leadership roles in the Illinois and U.S. Veterans Affairs departments. Yet, the Democratic Senate hopeful now finds her record on helping military veterans under attack by her opponent, Republican Sen. Mark Kirk, as he tries to hold on to a seat Democrats believe is key to their efforts to regain the Senate majority. Kirk, one of the GOP's most endangered incumbents, has accused Duckworth of failing to protect veterans in her care and putting her
 political ambitions ahead of her duties. He's also touted the more than two decades he served in the Navy Reserve and his own high-profile efforts to highlight problems at the VA." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f49640596947e0af2b26b260c5a41ea41866fae611a19b43162a303e2 

RACE-BASED DISCRIMINATION ALLEGED -- "Class-action lawsuit filed against Alexander County Housing Authority, past directors," by The Southern's Molly Parker: "A class-action lawsuit was filed in federal court Tuesday on behalf of current and former Alexander County Housing Authority residents to remedy allegations of 'rampant' discrimination based on race and family status and rent overcharges. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, in East St. Louis. The lawsuit names as defendants the ACHA and four past executive directors: James Wilson, Martha Franklin, Tom Upchurch and Joann Pink." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f49640596df2b5867ac727fa86221ba9667d23acf80480cdd690aaab5 

CEOs DON'T LIKE ILLINOIS -- "CEOs say Illinois is bottom-5 worst state for business," by Chicago Business Journal's Evan Hoopfer: "Illinois was ranked 48th, among the worst states in the country, for businesses by Chief Executive magazine. Only New York and California placed behind it. Chief Executive surveyed 513 CEOs across the nation on what states have the most business-friendly tax and regulatory regimes, quality of workforce and quality of living environment. The magazine has conducted the survey for 12 years. Illinois ranked 46th for taxation and regulation, 44th for workforce quality and placed 45th for living environment. Last year, it also placed 48th overall."

'HOLY COW DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM' -- "Comey increasingly worried about murder spike in cities," by POLITICO's Josh Gerstein: "FBI Director James Comey is again sounding the alarm about a surge in murders in several American cities and is publicly complaining that the problem isn't getting much national media attention because the victims are minorities who live in particular neighborhoods. 'I was very worried about it last fall and I am in many ways more worried,' Comey told reporters during a question-and-answer session at FBI headquarters Wednesday. 'The numbers are not only going up, they're continuing to go up faster than they were going up last year. And I worry very much it's a problem
 that most of America can drive around....I don't know what the answer is, but, holy cow, do we have a problem.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f49640596b63e7cead5d94fcb5f02c0b3f46ebdf2fb8f602c800f6ffa 

FUN UP AHEAD -- "LondonHouse Hotel And Its Killer Rooftop Bar To Open Next Month," by DNAinfo's David Matthews: "Chicagoans will soon be able to drink atop one of Michigan Avenue's most historic buildings. The LondonHouse hotel and what's being billed as the city's first three-level rooftop bar will open June 1 in the vintage tower at 360 N. Michigan Ave., according to a hotel spokeswoman. Guests will be able to drink and dine on the top floor, its roof, and eventually have private events in the distinctive cupola crowning the landmarked Beaux Arts tower at Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive. LondonHouse takes its name from the first owner of the 1923 tower: the London Guaranty & Accident
 Co., an insurance company, as well as the London House jazz club that once occupied the building's ground floor." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f4964059641097ae6a8cfe1f2551cfcdf734a6440c9057f666b8e56f2

<p>&quot;This is a really simple budget issue. Just pluses and minuses. That was the agreement from all the leaders,&quot; said a legislative source who is part of the negotiations. &quot;This is a package that somehow on paper is balanced. This is forwarded to the leaders and the governor and we'll see how they react ... Keep in mind, that at the end of the day, no matter what we put together, this particular group cannot get to 60 votes in the House and 30 votes in the Senate. That's up to leaders and to the governor's office.&quot; </p><p><b>MONEY FOR SCHOOLS -- 
</b>What's not included in the package? Funding for K-12 education. Education leaders in the House are discussing a new &quot;hybrid&quot; plan that would take portions of a Senate-backed funding formula overhaul and partner it with a so-called evidence-based plan backed by school superintendents. Sources tell Playbook that Manar's proposal will have a tough time passing as is, with opposition coming from lawmakers whose school districts lose out under the Bunker Hill Democrat's funding proposal change. The hybrid approach would mean no schools would lose money but Manar's machinations would go into effect based on district need to boost those with the least funding, while keeping others at the same
 levels. </p><p><b>Welcome to the POLITICO Illinois Playbook. Have a tip, event, announcement, endorsement?

Education funding is the only portion of the budget for the current year that Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner signed.

Bruce Rauner, the Elgin Courier-News reports. Jesse M. Kuzma, 31, of the 1100 block of West Highland Avenue, is charged with a felony count of threatening a public official. Kane County Assistant State's Attorney Scott Schwertley told the Daily Herald Kuzma left a message with Rauner's office at 11 p.m. on Friday. In the voicemail he stated, 'If I ever see you, consider this your death threat.'&quot;

</b>&quot;Central Illinois legislators, labor union officials and representatives of taxing districts will meet with Gov. Bruce Rauner Thursday to underscore the importance of the Clinton nuclear power plant to the region's economy. Exelon Corp., which owns the Clinton plant, said last week that it would have to close the plant next year without help from the state. Another Exelon-owned nuclear facility at Cordova, near the Quad Cities, would have to close a year later without assistance, the company said. The 29-year-old Clinton plant operates efficiently, but has lost $453 million over the last six years, primarily because its costs are greater than other power plants in the Midcontinent
 Independent System Operators region, which includes a lot of low-cost wind, coal-fired and natural-gas plants, company spokesman Brett Nauman said.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f4964059653df32c493f29aa3ecf1f1aa1d05079e24c4ba7617c34294" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1seKSS9 </a></p><p><b>AS A SIDE NOTE -- EXELON reported $34.5 billion in revenue in 2015. <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f496405964072bf13fa5be80672ff9e4dbd616e04a81fad04aee32672" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1TR9gSu</a> </b> </p>  <p><b>WAS NOTHING PERSONAL, DOROTHY -- &quot;Effort to appoint court clerk ditched amid racial accusations,&quot; by Chicago Tribune's Hal Dardick:

In a County Board room packed with black protesters, including members of Black Lives Matter Chicago and members of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH, Commissioner Peter Silvestri, R-Elmwood Park, withdrew his proposal ...

<b>STUDENTS OF COLOR HIT HARDEST IN SCHOOL BUDGET STALEMATE -- &quot;Illinois fiscal crisis threatens progress in college-going for students of color,&quot; by Catalyst Chicago's Melissa Sanchez:
</b> &quot;The recent higher education bill that sent $600 million in stopgap funding to public colleges and universities will keep them afloat for the next few months. But with long-term state funding still held hostage by the ongoing budget crisis, deeper problems with college access and affordability remain unsolved for low-income and first-generation students of color, who depend most heavily on state aid and publicly funded universities. These cuts threaten the progress that Chicago and Illinois have made in getting more of these students into college and earning degrees.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f49640596e0b342eb3f061051d9268e281c3e999485eec5830e73915a" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1seLO9a</a> </p><p>
<b>CONTROVERSIAL RULING -- &quot;Judge refuses to reinstate $3.5 million jury verdict in fatal police shooting,&quot; by Chicago Tribune's Jason Meisner:
</b> &quot;A Cook County judge ruled Tuesday her controversial decision to negate a $3.5 million jury verdict in a wrongful death lawsuit over a fatal Chicago police shooting should stand. Associate Judge Elizabeth Budzinski threw out the jury's award of damages in November. The jury had found Officer Marco Proano had used unjustified force in killing 19-year-old Niko Husband in 2011. But in answering 'yes' to a written question as part of their decision, jurors contradicted the verdict by indicating Proano had a reasonable belief that his life was in danger when he opened fire. In asking Budzinski to reinstate the $3.5 million award, lawyers for Husband's mother, Priscilla Price, had
 argued the wording of the question was confusing.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f49640596886f6cfc7ea2b83764f2725b25f75766aba148fe91252e0c" target="_blank">http://trib.in/1seLJ5m</a> </p><p><b>KEEPING HIS FOOT ON THE PLATE -- &quot;Tunney stands his ground against Cubs' patio license squeeze play,&quot; by Chicago Sun-Times' Fran Spielman: 
</b>&quot;Like a catcher blocking home plate before the rules were changed, Ald. Tom Tunney (44th) on Tuesday stood his ground against the Cubs' request for a patio permit to sell liquor at an open-air plaza adjacent to a renovated Wrigley Field. 'Remember they wanted to close Clark and Addison? This is another way of trying to close Clark and Addison. If you look at the rules for the patio license they requested, they could stay open from 11 a.m. to midnight and allow people to drink all day and all night during the game and after the game. That's a public safety issue,' Tunney said.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f496405960b11c0ea7d3d98184e138a2024585ce75ffaa416e572735f" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1seM6ga</a>

You've heard the common refrain. But if Mayor Rahm Emanuel and some aldermen get their way, you may hear the same thing about your neighborhood. They call Chicago a city of neighborhoods. Yet the Great American City is being invaded by the vacation rental industry, led by Airbnb. The City Council is considering an ordinance that would regulate Airbnb rentals here. You may live near such a rental. Chances are good you do not know the owner. Chances are good the city does not either.&quot;

</b>&quot;Come on, it's not really about bathrooms at all, is it? Much of the current debate over the rights of transgender people centers on which multiple-occupancy public restrooms and changing rooms trans people should be allowed to use. North Carolina officials and the U.S Justice Department recently filed dueling lawsuits over that state's new law mandating that people use bathrooms corresponding to the gender on their birth certificate in government facilities. And the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois announced Tuesday it will intervene in opposition to a lawsuit filed last week that seeks to ban Palatine-based Township High School District 211 from allowing a transgender
 girl access to the girls' locker room.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f496405961c063e8a2eab6d12a7f6e879f3885c4d038d343fc56689cc" target="_blank">http://trib.in/1seMHOQ</a> </p><p><b>SPEAKING UP FOR FIRST TIME -- &quot;CPS principal, mayoral critic to tell of CPS charges he faces,&quot; by Chicago Sun-Times' Lauren FitzPatrick:

<b>'HOLY COW DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM' -- &quot;Comey increasingly worried about murder spike in cities,&quot; by POLITICO's Josh Gerstein: 
</b>&quot;FBI Director James Comey is again sounding the alarm about a surge in murders in several American cities and is publicly complaining that the problem isn't getting much national media attention because the victims are minorities who live in particular neighborhoods. 'I was very worried about it last fall and I am in many ways more worried,' Comey told reporters during a question-and-answer session at FBI headquarters Wednesday. 'The numbers are not only going up, they're continuing to go up faster than they were going up last year. And I worry very much it's a problem that most of America can drive around....I don't know what the answer is, but, holy cow, do we have a
 problem.'&quot;  <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f49640596b63e7cead5d94fcb5f02c0b3f46ebdf2fb8f602c800f6ffa" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1seOR0W</a> </p><p><b>FUN UP AHEAD -- &quot;LondonHouse Hotel And Its Killer Rooftop Bar To Open Next Month,&quot; by DNAinfo's David Matthews: 
</b>&quot;Chicagoans will soon be able to drink atop one of Michigan Avenue's most historic buildings. The LondonHouse hotel and what's being billed as the city's first three-level rooftop bar will open June 1 in the vintage tower at 360 N. Michigan Ave., according to a hotel spokeswoman. Guests will be able to drink and dine on the top floor, its roof, and eventually have private events in the distinctive cupola crowning the landmarked Beaux Arts tower at Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive. LondonHouse takes its name from the first owner of the 1923 tower: the London Guaranty &amp; Accident Co., an insurance company, as well as the London House jazz club that once occupied the building's ground
 floor.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7eb7c28f4964059641097ae6a8cfe1f2551cfcdf734a6440c9057f666b8e56f2" target="_blank">http://dnain.fo/1seOYtC</a> </p><p><b>EVENTS</b> </p><p><b>TODAY: </b>U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker delivers and take part in a conversation with Irene S.
