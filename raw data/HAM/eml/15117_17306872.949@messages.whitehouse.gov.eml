*WEEKLY ADDRESS: Expanding Overtime Pay*



WASHINGTON, DC  In this week's address, President Obama discussed one of =
the single most important steps to help grow middle-class wages  expandin=
g the number of workers who are eligible for the overtime that they have =
earned. Every week, millions of Americans work more than 40 hours but do =
not receive the overtime pay they deserve. This week, the Department of L=
abor finalized a rule to extend overtime protections to 4.2 million more =
Americans, which will boost wages for working Americans by $12 billion ov=
er the next 10 years. This action will not only mean a better life for mo=
re American families, but will also strengthen our economy across the boa=
rd. The President emphasized the he will continue to build an economy whe=
re everyone gets a fair shot to get ahead.=20



The audio of the address and video of the address will be available onlin=
e at www.whitehouse.gov [ http://www.whitehouse.gov ] at 6:00AM ET, May 2=
1, 2016.=20

Hi everybody. Last summer, I got a letter from a woman named Elizabeth Pa=
redes from Tucson, Arizona. Elizabeth is the mom of a 3-year-old boy, and=
 an assistant manager at a sandwich shop. She earns about $2,000 a month,=
 and she routinely works some 50 hours a week, sometimes even more. But b=
ecause of outdated overtime regulations, she doesnt have to be paid a dim=
e of overtime.=20



She wrote: Its not easy work and requires a lot of time away from my son =
at times I find [it's] not worth it.=20



Things like the 40-hour workweek and overtime are two of the most basic p=
illars of a middle class life. But for all the changes weve seenin our ec=
onomy, our overtime rules have only been updated once since the 1970s. Ju=
st once. In fact, forty years ago, more than 60 percent of workers were e=
ligible for overtime based on their salaries. But today, that number is d=
own to seven percent. Only seven percent of full-time salaried workers ar=
e eligible for overtime based on their income.



Thats why this week, my Administration took a step to help more workers g=
et the overtime pay theyve earned. The Department of Labor finalized a ru=
le to extend overtime protections to 4.2 million more Americans. Its a mo=
ve that will boost wages for working Americans by $12 billion over the ne=
xt 10 years. Were more than doubling the overtime salary threshold. And w=
hat that means is, most salaried workers who earn less than about $47,500=
 a yearwill qualify for overtime. Or, their employers can choose to give =
them a raise so that they earn more than $47,500. Or, if employers dont w=
ant to raise wages, they can let them go home after 40 hours and see thei=
r families or train for new jobs. Any way you slice it, its a win for wor=
king families. And were making sure that every three years, there will be=
 an automatic update to this threshold  so that working families wont fal=
l through the cracks for decades at a time ever again.



This is the single biggest step I can take through executive action to ra=
ise wages for the American people. It means that millions of hardworking =
Americans like Elizabeth will either get paid for working more than 40 ho=
urs, or theyll get more time with their families. Either way, they win. T=
he middle class wins. And America wins.



We still have more work to do to make sure this economy works for everybo=
dy, not just those at the top. Thats why Ill never stop fighting for as l=
ong as I hold this office  to restore the sense that in America, hard wor=
k should be rewarded with the chance to get ahead.=20



Thanks everybody. Have a great weekend.=20

 Any way you slice it, it&#8217;s a win for working families.&nbsp; And we&=
#8217;re making sure that every three years, there will be an automatic upd=
ate to this threshold &#8211; so that working families won&#8217;t fall thr=
ough the cracks for decades at a time ever again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"wordsection1"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quo=

on to raise wages for the American people.&nbsp; It means that millions of =
hardworking Americans like Elizabeth will either get
 paid for working more than 40 hours, or they&#8217;ll get more time with t=
heir families.&nbsp; Either way, they win.&nbsp; The middle class wins.&nbs=
p; And America wins.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 everybody, not just those at the top.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ll ne=

 the sense that in America, hard work should be rewarded with the chance to=
 get ahead.
