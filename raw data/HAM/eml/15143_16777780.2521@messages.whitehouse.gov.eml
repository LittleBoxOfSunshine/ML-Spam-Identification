For Immediate Release   April 30, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

AT WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER



Capital Hilton

Washington, D.C.



10:05 P.M. EDT





 (Entrance music: "When I'm Gone" by Anna Kendrick.)





 THE PRESIDENT: You can't say it, but you know it's true. (Laughter.)=20



Good evening, everybody. It is an honor to be here at my last -- and perh=
aps the last -- White House Correspondents' Dinner. (Laughter and applaus=
e.)



You all look great. The end of the Republic has never looked better. (Lau=
ghter and applause.)



I do apologize -- I know I was a little late tonight. I was running on C.=
P.T. -- (laughter) -- which stands for "jokes that white people should no=
t make." (Laughter and applause.) It's a tip for you, Jeff. (Laughter.)



Anyway, here we are. My eighth and final appearance at this unique event.=
 (Laughter.) And I am excited. If this material works well, I'm going to =
use it at Goldman Sachs next year. (Laughter and applause.) Earn me some =
serious Tubmans. That's right. (Laughter and applause.)



My brilliant and beautiful wife, Michelle, is here tonight. (Applause.) S=
he looks so happy to be here. (Laughter.) That's called practice -- it's =
like learning to do three-minute planks. (Laughter.) She makes it look ea=
sy now. (Laughter.)



Next year at this time, someone else will be standing here in this very s=
pot, and it's anyone's guess who she will be. (Laughter and applause.) Bu=
t standing here, I can't help but be reflective, a little sentimental. Ei=
ght years ago, I said it was time to change the tone of our politics. In =
hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific. (Laughter.)



Eight years ago, I was a young man, full of idealism and vigor, and look =
at me now. (Laughter.) I am gray and grizzled, just counting down the day=
s 'til my death panel. (Laughter and applause.) Hillary once questioned w=
hether I'd be ready for a 3 a.m. phone call -- now I'm awake anyway becau=
se I've got to go to the bathroom. (Laughter and applause.) I'm up.=20



In fact, somebody recently said to me, Mr. President, you are so yesterda=
y; Justin Trudeau has completely replaced you -- he's so handsome, he's s=
o charming, he's the future. And I said, Justin, just give it a rest. (La=
ughter and applause.) I resented that. (Laughter.)



Meanwhile, Michelle has not aged a day. (Applause.) The only way you can =
date her in photos is by looking at me. (Laughter.) Take a look.=20



Here we are in 2008. (Slide is shown.)



Here we are a few years later. (Slide is shown.)=20



And this one is from two weeks ago. (Slide is shown.) (Laughter and appla=
use.)



So time passes. (Laughter.) In just six short months, I will be officiall=
y a lame duck, which means Congress now will flat-out reject my authority=
. (Laughter.) And Republican leaders won't take my phone calls. And this =
is going to take some getting used to, it's really going to -- it's a cur=
ve ball. I don't know what to do with it. (Laughter.)



Of course, in fact, for months now congressional Republicans have been sa=
ying there are things I cannot do in my final year. Unfortunately, this d=
inner was not one of them. (Laughter.) But on everything else, it's anoth=
er story. And you know who you are, Republicans. In fact, I think we've g=
ot Republican Senators Tim Scott and Cory Gardner, they're in the house, =
which reminds me, security, bar the doors! (Laughter.) Judge Merrick Garl=
and, come on out, we're going to do this right here, right now. (Applause=
.) It's like "The Red Wedding." (Laughter.)



But it's not just Congress. Even some foreign leaders, they've been looki=
ng ahead, anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up t=
o our meeting in his bathrobe. (Laughter and applause.) That was a slap i=
n the face. (Laughter.) A clear breach in protocol. (Laughter.) Although =
while in England I did have lunch with Her Majesty, the Queen, took in a =
performance of Shakespeare, hit the links with David Cameron -- just in c=
ase anybody is still debating whether I'm black enough, I think that sett=
les the debate. (Laughter and applause.)=20



I won't lie -- look, this is a tough transition. It's hard. Key staff are=
 now starting to leave the White House. Even reporters have left me. Sava=
nnah Guthrie, she's left the White House Press Corps to host the Today sh=
ow. Norah O'Donnell left the briefing room to host CBS This Morning. Jake=
 Tapper left journalism to join CNN. (Laughter and applause.)



But the prospect of leaving the White House is a mixed bag. You might hav=
e heard that someone jumped the White House fence last week, but I have t=
o give Secret Service credit -- they found Michelle, brought her back, sh=
e's safe back at home now. (Laughter and applause.) It's only nine more m=
onths, baby. Settle down. (Laughter.)



And yet, somehow, despite all this, despite the churn, in my final year, =
my approval ratings keep going up. (Laughter.) The last time I was this h=
igh, I was trying to decide on my major. (Laughter and applause.)



And here's the thing: I haven't really done anything differently. So it's=
 odd. Even my aides can't explain the rising poll numbers -- what has cha=
nged, nobody can figure it out. (Slide is shown.) (Laughter and applause.=
) Puzzling.



Anyway, in this last year I do have more appreciation for those who have =
been with me on this amazing ride, like one of our finest public servants=
, Joe Biden. God bless him. Love that guy. (Applause.) I love Joe Biden, =
I really do. And I want to thank him for his friendship, for his counsel,=
 for always giving it to me straight, for not shooting anybody in the fac=
e. (Laughter.) Thank you, Joe. (Laughter.)



Also, I would be remiss -- let's give it up for our host, Larry Wilmore. =
(Applause.) Also known as one of the two black guys who is not Jon Stewar=
t. (Laughter.) You're the South African guy, right? (Laughter.) I love La=
rry. And his parents are here, who are from Evanston, which is a great to=
wn. (Applause.)



I also would like to acknowledge some of the award-winning reporters that=
 we have with us here tonight. Rachel McAdams. Mark Ruffalo. Liev Schreib=
er. (Laughter.) Thank you all for everything that you've done. (Laughter.=
) Im just joking. As you know, "Spotlight" is a film, a movie about inves=
tigative journalists with the resources and the autonomy to chase down th=
e truth and hold the powerful accountable. Best fantasy film since Star W=
ars. (Laughter.) Look -- that was maybe a cheap shot. (laughter.)



I understand the news business is tough these days, it keeps changing all=
 the time. Every year at this dinner, somebody makes a joke about BuzzFee=
d, for example, changing the media landscape. And every year, the Washing=
ton Post laughs a little bit less hard. (Laughter.) Kind of a silence the=
re. (Laughter.) Especially at the Washington Post table. (Laughter.)



GOP Chairman Reince Priebus is here as well. (Applause.) Glad to see you =
that you feel that youve earned a night off. (Laughter.) Congratulations =
on all your success. The Republican Party, the nomination process - its a=
ll going great. Keep it up. (Laughter and applause.)=20



Kendall Jenner is also here. And we had a chance to meet her backstage --=
 she seems like a very nice young woman. Im not exactly sure what she doe=
s, but I am told that my Twitter mentions are about to go through the roo=
f. (Laughter.)



Helen Mirren is here tonight. (Applause.) I dont even have a joke here. I=
 just think Helen Mirren is awesome. (Laughter and applause.) She's aweso=
me. (Laughter.)



Sitting at the same table, I see Mike Bloomberg. (Applause.) Mike, a comb=
ative, controversial New York billionaire is leading the GOP primary and =
it is not you. (Laughter.) Thats has to sting a little bit. (Laughter.) A=
lthough its not an entirely fair comparison between you and the Donald. A=
fter all, Mike was a big-city mayor. He knows policy in depth. And hes ac=
tually worth the amount of money that he says he is. (Laughter and applau=
se.)



What an election season. For example, weve got the bright new face of the=
 Democratic Party here tonight - Mr. Bernie Sanders! (Applause.) There he=
 is -- Bernie! (Applause.) Bernie, you look like a million bucks. (Laught=
er.) Or to put it in terms youll understand, you look like 37,000 donatio=
ns of 27 dollars each. (Laughter and applause.)



A lot of folks have been surprised by the Bernie phenomenon, especially h=
is appeal to young people. But not me, I get it. Just recently, a young p=
erson came up to me and said she was sick of politicians standing in the =
way of her dreams. As if we were actually going to let Malia go to Burnin=
g Man this year. (Laughter.) That was not going to happen. (Laughter.) Be=
rnie might have let her go. (Laughter.) Not us. (Laughter.)



I am hurt, though, Bernie, that you've distancing yourself a little from =
me. (Laughter.) I mean, that's just not something that you do to your com=
rade. (Laughter and applause.) =20



Bernies slogan has helped his campaign catch fire among young people. Fee=
l the Bern. (Laughter.) Feel the Bern -- it's a good slogan. Hillarys slo=
gan has not had the same effect. Let's see this. (Slide is shown.) (Laugh=
ter.)



Look, Ive said how much I admire Hillarys toughness, her smarts, her poli=
cy chops, her experience. Youve got to admit it, though, Hillary trying t=
o appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative just signed u=
p for Facebook. (Laughter.) Dear America, did you get my poke?" (Laughter=
.) "Is it appearing on your wall?" (Laughter.) "I'm not sure I am using t=
his right. Love, Aunt Hillary. (Laughter and applause.) It's not entirely=
 persuasive.



Meanwhile, on the Republican side, things are a little more -- how should=
 we say this -- a little "more loose." Just look at the confusion over th=
e invitations to tonights dinner. Guests were asked to check whether they=
 wanted steak or fish, but instead, a whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ry=
an. (Laughter.) That's not an option, people. Steak or fish. (Laughter.) =
You may not like steak or fish -- (laughter) -- but that's your choice. (=
Laughter.)



Meanwhile, some candidates arent polling high enough to qualify for their=
 own joke tonight. (Slide is shown.) (Laughter.) The rules were well-esta=
blished ahead of time. (Laughter.)



And then there's Ted Cruz. Ted had a tough week. He went to Indiana - Hoo=
sier country - stood on a basketball court, and called the hoop a basketb=
all ring. (Laughter and applause.) What else is in his lexicon? Baseball =
sticks? Football hats? (Laughter.) But sure, Im the foreign one. (Laughte=
r and applause.)



Well, let me conclude tonight on a more serious note. I want to thank the=
 Washington press corps, I want to thank Carol for all that you do. The f=
ree press is central to our democracy, and -- nah, Im just kidding! You k=
now Ive got to talk about Trump! Come on! (Laughter and applause.) We wer=
en't just going to stop there. Come on. (Laughter and applause.)=20



Although I am a little hurt that hes not here tonight. We had so much fun=
 the last time. (Laughter.) And it is surprising. You've got a room full =
of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he says no? (Laughter.) Is this d=
inner too tacky for The Donald? (Laughter.) What could he possibly be doi=
ng instead? Is he at home, eating a Trump Steak -- (laughter) -- tweeting=
 out insults to Angela Merkel? (Laughter.) What's he doing? (Laughter.)



The Republican establishment is incredulous that he is their most likely =
nominee -- incredulous, shocking. They say Donald lacks the foreign polic=
y experience to be President. But, in fairness, he has spent years meetin=
g with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss A=
zerbaijan. (Laughter and applause.)=20



And there's one area where Donalds experience could be invaluable - and t=
hats closing Guantanamo. Because Trump knows a thing or two about running=
 waterfront properties into the ground. (Laughter and applause.)



All right, thats probably enough. I mean, I've got more material -- (appl=
ause) -- no, no, I dont want to spend too much time on The Donald. Follow=
ing your lead, I want to show some restraint. (Laughter.) Because I think=
 we can all agree that from the start, hes gotten the appropriate amount =
of coverage, befitting the seriousness of his candidacy. (Laughter and ap=
plause.)



I hope you all are proud of yourselves. (Laughter.) The guy wanted to giv=
e his hotel business a boost, and now were praying that Cleveland makes i=
t through July. (Laughter.)



Mm-mm-mm. (Laughter and applause.) Hmm. (Laughter.)=20



As for me and Michelle, weve decided to stay in D.C. for a couple more ye=
ars. (Applause.) Thank you. This way, our youngest daughter can finish up=
 high school, Michelle can stay closer to her plot of carrots. (Laughter.=
) Shes already making plans to see them every day. Take a look. (Slide is=
 shown.) (Laughter.)



But our decision has actually presented a bit of a dilemma because, tradi=
tionally, Presidents dont stick around after they're done. And it's somet=
hing that I've been brooding about a little bit. Take a look.



(Video is shown.)



(Applause.)



I am still waiting for all of you to respond to my invitation to connect =
on LinkedIn. (Laughter.) But I know you have jobs to do, which is what re=
ally brings us here tonight.=20



I know that there are times that we've had differences, and that's inhere=
nt in our institutional roles -- it's true of every President and his pre=
ss corps. But we've always shared the same goal - to root our public disc=
ourse in the truth; to open the doors of this democracy; to do whatever w=
e can to make our country and our world more free and more just. And I've=
 always appreciated the role that you have all played as equal partners i=
n reaching these goals.=20



And our free press is why we once again recognize the real journalists wh=
o uncovered a horrifying scandal and brought about some measure of justic=
e for thousands of victims throughout the world. They are here with us to=
night - Sacha Pfeiffer, Mike Rezendes, Walter Robinson, Matt Carroll, and=
 Ben Bradlee, Jr. Please give them a big round of applause. (Applause.)=20=




Our free press is why, once again, we honor Jason Rezaian. (Applause.) As=
 Carol noted, last time this year, we spoke of Jasons courage as he endur=
ed the isolation of an Iranian prison. This year, we see that courage in =
the flesh and it's a living testament to the very idea of a free press, a=
nd a reminder of the rising level of danger, and political intimidation, =
and physical threats faced by reporters overseas. And I can make this com=
mitment that as long as I hold this office, my administration will contin=
ue to fight for the release of American journalists held against their wi=
ll -- and we will not stop until they see the same freedom as Jason had. =
(Applause.)



At home and abroad, journalists like all of you engage in the dogged purs=
uit of informing citizens, and holding leaders accountable, and making ou=
r government of the people possible. And it's an enormous responsibility.=
 And I realize its an enormous challenge at a time when the economics of =
the business sometimes incentivize speed over depth; and when controversy=
 and conflict are what most immediately attract readers and viewers.=20



The good news is there are so many of you that are pushing against those =
trends. And as a citizen of this great democracy, I am grateful for that.=
 For this is also a time around the world when some of the fundamental id=
eals of liberal democracies are under attack, and when notions of objecti=
vity, and of a free press, and of facts, and of evidence are trying to be=
 undermined. Or, in some cases, ignored entirely.=20



And in such a climate, its not enough just to give people a megaphone. An=
d thats why your power and your responsibility to dig and to question and=
 to counter distortions and untruths is more important than ever. Taking =
a stand on behalf of what is true does not require you shedding your obje=
ctivity. In fact, it is the essence of good journalism. It affirms the id=
ea that the only way we can build consensus, the only way that we can mov=
e forward as a country, the only way we can help the world mend itself is=
 by agreeing on a baseline of facts when it comes to the challenges that =
confront us all.=20



So this night is a testament to all of you who have devoted your lives to=
 that idea, who push to shine a light on the truth every single day. So I=
 want to close my final White House Correspondents' Dinner by just saying=
 thank you. (Applause.) I'm very proud of what you've done. It has been a=
n honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our d=
emocracy. (Applause.)



And with that, I just have two more words to say - Obama out. (Drops micr=
ophone.) (Laughter and applause.) Thank you. (Applause.)

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Good evening, everybody.&=
nbsp; It is an honor to be here at my last -- and perhaps the last -- White=
 House Correspondents' Dinner.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">You all look great.&nbsp;=
 The end of the Republic has never looked better.&nbsp; (Laughter and appla=
use.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I do apologize -- I know =
I was a little late tonight.&nbsp; I was running on C.P.T. -- (laughter) --=
 which stands for &quot;jokes that white people should not make.&quot;&nbsp=
; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; It's a tip for you, Jeff.&nbsp; (Laughter.=
)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Anyway, here we are.&nbsp=
; My eighth and final appearance at this unique event.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nb=
sp; And I am excited.&nbsp; If this material works well, I'm going to use i=
t at Goldman Sachs next year.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp;
 Earn me some serious Tubmans.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; (Laughter and appl=
ause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">My brilliant and beautifu=
l wife, Michelle, is here tonight.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; She looks so hap=
py to be here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; That's called practice -- it's like =
learning to do three-minute planks.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; She makes
 it look easy now.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Next year at this time, s=
omeone else will be standing here in this very spot, and it's anyone's gues=
s who she will be.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; But standing here, =
I can't help but be reflective, a little sentimental.&nbsp;
 Eight years ago, I said it was time to change the tone of our politics.&nb=
sp; In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific.&nbsp; (Laughter=
.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Eight years ago, I was a =
young man, full of idealism and vigor, and look at me now.&nbsp; (Laughter.=
)&nbsp; I am gray and grizzled, just counting down the days 'til my death p=
anel.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; Hillary once
 questioned whether I'd be ready for a 3 a.m. phone call -- now I'm awake a=
nyway because I've got to go to the bathroom.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.=
)&nbsp; I'm up.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In fact, somebody recentl=
y said to me, Mr. President, you are so yesterday; Justin Trudeau has compl=
etely replaced you -- he's so handsome, he's so charming, he's the future.&=
nbsp; And I said, Justin, just give it a
 rest.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; I resented that.&nbsp; (Laughte=
r.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Meanwhile, Michelle has n=
ot aged a day.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; The only way you can date her in pho=
tos is by looking at me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Take a look.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Here we are in 2008.&nbsp=
; (Slide is shown.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Here we are a few years l=
ater.&nbsp; (Slide is shown.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And this one is from two =
weeks ago.&nbsp; (Slide is shown.)&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So time passes.&nbsp; (La=
ughter.)&nbsp; In just six short months, I will be officially a lame duck, =
which means Congress now will flat-out reject my authority.&nbsp; (Laughter=
.)&nbsp; And Republican leaders won't take my phone calls.&nbsp;
 And this is going to take some getting used to, it's really going to -- it=
's a curve ball.&nbsp; I don't know what to do with it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Of course, in fact, for m=
onths now congressional Republicans have been saying there are things I can=
not do in my final year.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this dinner was not one of th=
em.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But on everything else,
 it's another story.&nbsp; And you know who you are, Republicans.&nbsp; In =
fact, I think we've got Republican Senators Tim Scott and Cory Gardner, the=
y're in the house, which reminds me, security, bar the doors!&nbsp; (Laught=
er.)&nbsp; Judge Merrick Garland, come on out, we're
 going to do this right here, right now.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It's like =
&quot;The Red Wedding.&quot;&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But it's not just Congres=
s.&nbsp; Even some foreign leaders, they've been looking ahead, anticipatin=
g my departure.&nbsp; Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in =
his bathrobe.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; That
 was a slap in the face.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; A clear breach in protocol=
.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Although while in England I did have lunch with H=
er Majesty, the Queen, took in a performance of Shakespeare, hit the links =
with David Cameron -- just in case anybody is still
 debating whether I'm black enough, I think that settles the debate.&nbsp; =
(Laughter and applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I won't lie -- look, this=
 is a tough transition.&nbsp; It's hard.&nbsp; Key staff are now starting t=
o leave the White House.&nbsp; Even reporters have left me.&nbsp; Savannah =
Guthrie, she's left the White House Press Corps to host
 the Today show.&nbsp; Norah O'Donnell left the briefing room to host CBS T=
his Morning.&nbsp; Jake Tapper left journalism to join CNN.&nbsp; (Laughter=
 and applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But the prospect of leavi=
ng the White House is a mixed bag.&nbsp; You might have heard that someone =
jumped the White House fence last week, but I have to give Secret Service c=
redit -- they found Michelle, brought her
 back, she's safe back at home now.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; It=
's only nine more months, baby.&nbsp; Settle down.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And yet, somehow, despite=
 all this, despite the churn, in my final year, my approval ratings keep go=
ing up.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; The last time I was this high, I was trying=
 to decide on my major.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And here's the thing:&nbs=
p; I haven't really done anything differently.&nbsp; So it's odd.&nbsp; Eve=
n my aides can't explain the rising poll numbers -- what has changed, nobod=
y can figure it out.&nbsp; (Slide is shown.)&nbsp; (Laughter
 and applause.)&nbsp; Puzzling.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Anyway, in this last year=
 I do have more appreciation for those who have been with me on this amazin=
g ride, like one of our finest public servants, Joe Biden.&nbsp; God bless =
him.&nbsp; Love that guy.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I love
 Joe Biden, I really do.&nbsp; And I want to thank him for his friendship, =
for his counsel, for always giving it to me straight, for not shooting anyb=
ody in the face.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Thank you, Joe.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Also, I would be remiss -=
- let's give it up for our host, Larry Wilmore.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Als=
o known as one of the two black guys who is not Jon Stewart.&nbsp; (Laughte=
r.)&nbsp; You're the South African guy, right?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
 I love Larry.&nbsp; And his parents are here, who are from Evanston, which=
 is a great town.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoListParagraph" style=3D"margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in"><s=

owledge some of the award-winning reporters that we have with us here tonig=

 (Laughter.)&nbsp; Thank you all for everything that you've done.&nbsp; (La=
ughter.)&nbsp; I&#8217;m just joking.&nbsp; As you know, &quot;Spotlight&qu=
ot; is a film, a movie about investigative journalists with the resources a=
nd the autonomy to chase down the truth and hold the powerful accountable.&=
nbsp;
 Best fantasy film since Star Wars.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Look -- that wa=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I understand the news bus=
iness is tough these days, it keeps changing all the time.&nbsp; Every year=
 at this dinner, somebody makes a joke about BuzzFeed, for example, changin=
g the media landscape.&nbsp; And every year, the
 Washington Post laughs a little bit less hard.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Kin=
d of a silence there.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Especially at the Washington =
Post table.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>

 This year, we see that courage in the flesh and it's a living testament to=
 the very idea of a free press, and a reminder of the rising level of dange=

 why your power and your responsibility to dig and to question and to count=

 Taking a stand on behalf of what is true does not require you shedding you=
