HAPPY Friday. Sunday is Mother's Day.

PLAYBOOK BREAKFAST: Please join us at 8 a.m. on livestream or C-SPAN 2 for blockbuster Playbook Breakfast with RNC Chair Reince Priebus. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=363e8426b6bbe791cb32bbf9c07d01391af12d5125b382313f63cca027f6bcd4

TICK TOCK -- "How Ryan decided to ditch Trump" in interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on "The Lead" -- Jake Sherman: "On Wednesday morning, not even 24 hours after Donald Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination, Paul Ryan convened his top advisers for a call. With Congress out of session, Ryan was bouncing between multiple states, raising the piles of money needed to keep House Republicans in the majority. But Donald Trump was on his mind. The speaker could not - at least at this point - support him. And he wanted to talk through how to proceed.

"Ryan never expected Trump to lock up the nomination so quickly. He didn't think Texas Sen. Ted Cruz would drop out of the race in May. In fact, Ryan's orbit was preparing for a contested convention in Cleveland, where he is slated to serve as chairman, effectively the emcee of the Trump coronation." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=363e8426b6bbe7916d6dbe6e6ca323f9e35dc9ec999197819df4afc3cb049c9a

--TRUMP's statement fires back: "I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda. Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people. They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first!"

DONALD IN D.C. -- "Trump plans Capitol Hill visit," by Jake Sherman and Seung Min Kim: "Trump might be coming to Capitol Hill as soon as next week to begin wooing Republican members of Congress. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions' operation is trying to broker meetings between Trump and Republican factions according to multiple sources familiar with the plans. Trump may even meet with members of Republican leadership ... The outreach is ... a sign that Trump knows he has work to do in Washington now that he is the presumptive nominee." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=363e8426b6bbe791000402958445fc9e2d47f60855d5bdfbe95fc96c222f4f75 

MARY MATALIN leaves the GOP and switches parties to register as a libertarian, telling Bloomberg's "With All Due Respect": "I'm a never Hillary and I'm a provisional Trump because I like his attitude, I like his strategic chutzpah. I like that he had the gall to put macro messaging over micro targeting and I like what I know of his economic policy but I just don't know enough.'" 3-min. video http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=363e8426b6bbe791af8b7c123a8d6cbfb4a4f1b23fbd953f243c349306eaad03

--"Sheldon Adelson Says He Will Support Donald Trump," by NYT's Thomas Kaplan and Maggie Haberman: "'Yes, I'm a Republican, he's a Republican ... He's our nominee.

He won fair and square.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=363e8426b6bbe791b0a40421aa071e019f41108ba9adb67c7e02a80658efc825

The group also plans to spend about $19.5 million in the traditional presidential bellwether state of Ohio." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=363e8426b6bbe791e5c86ce9be397774d21ef6cd4fdd61765f8cfc7f0f9dcbf1

<b>TICK TOCK -- &quot;How Ryan decided to ditch Trump&quot; in interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on &quot;The Lead&quot; -- Jake Sherman:</b> &quot;On Wednesday morning, not even 24 hours after Donald Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination, Paul Ryan convened his top advisers for a call. With Congress out of session, Ryan was bouncing between multiple states, raising the piles of money needed to keep House Republicans in the majority. But Donald Trump was on his mind. The speaker could not - at least at this point - support him. And he wanted to talk through how to proceed.</p><p><b>&quot;Ryan never expected Trump 
</b>to lock up the nomination so quickly. He didn't think Texas Sen. Ted Cruz would drop out of the race in May. In fact, Ryan's orbit was preparing for a contested convention in Cleveland, where he is slated to serve as chairman, effectively the emcee of the Trump coronation.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=363e8426b6bbe7916d6dbe6e6ca323f9e35dc9ec999197819df4afc3cb049c9a" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1TvqphK</a></p><p><b>--TRUMP's statement fires back</b>: &quot;I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda.
