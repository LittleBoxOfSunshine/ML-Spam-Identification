REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA

IN ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE

**

Hannove Messe Fairgrounds

Hannover, Germany







11:22 A.M. CEST



PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you so much. (Applause.) Thank you. Guten tag! It =
is wonderful to see all of you, and I want to begin by thanking Chancello=
r Merkel for being here. (Applause.) On behalf of the American people, I =
want to thank Angela for being a champion of our alliance. And on behalf =
of all of us, I want to thank you for your commitment to freedom, and equ=
ality, and human rights, which is a reflection of your inspiring life. I =
truly believe youve shown us the leadership of steady hands -- how do you=
 call it? The Merkel-Raute. (Laughter.) And over the last seven years, I =
have relied on your friendship and counsel, and your firm moral compass. =
So we very much appreciate your Chancellor, Angela Merkel.



To the members of the Bundestag, Prime Minister Weil, Mayor Schostock, di=
stinguished guests, people of Germany. And Im especially pleased to see t=
he young people here -- from Germany and across Europe. We also have some=
 proud Americans here. (Laughter and applause.)=20



I have to admit that I have developed a special place in my heart for the=
 German people. Back when I was a candidate for this office, you welcomed=
 me with a small rally in Berlin, where I spoke of the change thats possi=
ble when the world stands as one. As President, you've treated me and Mic=
helle and our daughters to wonderful hospitality. You've offered me excel=
lent beer -- (laughter) -- and weisswurst in Krun. You've now hosted our =
delegation here in Hannover.=20



My only regret is that I have never been to Germany for Oktoberfest. (Lau=
ghter.) So I will have to come back. And I suspect it's more fun when you=
're not President. (Laughter and applause.) So my timing will be good. (A=
pplause.)=20



And as always, I bring the friendship of the American people. We consider=
 the German people, and all of our European allies, to be among our close=
st friends in the world -- because we share so much experience and so man=
y of the same values. We believe that nations and peoples should live in =
security and peace. We believe in creating opportunity that lifts up not =
just the few but the many. And Im proud to be the first American Presiden=
t to come to Europe and be able to say that, in the United States, health=
 care is not a privilege, it is now a right for all. We share that as wel=
l. (Applause.)



Perhaps most importantly, we believe in the equality and inherent dignity=
 of every human being. Today in America, people have the freedom to marry=
 the person that they love. We believe in justice, that no child in the w=
orld should ever die from a mosquito bite; that no one should suffer from=
 the ache of an empty stomach; that, together, we can save our planet and=
 the worlds most vulnerable people from the worst effects of climate chan=
ge. These are things that we share. It's borne of common experience.



And this is what I want to talk to you about today -- the future that we =
are building together -- not separately, but together. And that starts ri=
ght here in Europe.=20



And I want to begin with an observation that, given the challenges that w=
e face in the world and the headlines we see every day, may seem improbab=
le, but its true. We are fortunate to be living in the most peaceful, mos=
t prosperous, most progressive era in human history. That may surprise yo=
ung people who are watching TV or looking at your phones and it seems lik=
e only bad news comes through every day. But consider that its been decad=
es since the last war between major powers. More people live in democraci=
es. Were wealthier and healthier and better educated, with a global econo=
my that has lifted up more than a billion people from extreme poverty, an=
d created new middle classes from the Americas to Africa to Asia. Think a=
bout the health of the average person in the world -- tens of millions of=
 lives that we now save from disease and infant mortality, and people now=
 living longer lives.=20



Around the world, were more tolerant -- with more opportunity for women, =
and gays and lesbians, as we push back on bigotry and prejudice. And arou=
nd the world, theres a new generation of young people -- like you -- that=
 are connected by technology, and driven by your idealism and your imagin=
ation, and you're working together to start new ventures, and to hold gov=
ernments more accountable, and advance human dignity.=20



If you had to choose a moment in time to be born, any time in human histo=
ry, and you didn't know ahead of time what nationality you were or what g=
ender or what your economic status might be, you'd choose today -- which =
isn't to say that there is not still enormous suffering and enormous trag=
edy and so much work for us to do. It is to remember that the trajectory =
of our history over the last 50, 100 years has been remarkable. And we ca=
n't take that for granted, and we should take confidence in our ability t=
o be able to shape our own destiny.=20



Now, that doesn't mean that we can be complacent because today dangerous =
forces do threaten to pull the world backward, and our progress is not in=
evitable. These challenges threaten Europe and they threaten our transatl=
antic community. We're not immune from the forces of change around the wo=
rld. As they have elsewhere, barbaric terrorists have slaughtered innocen=
t people in Paris and Brussels, and Istanbul and San Bernardino, Californ=
ia. And we see these tragedies in places central to our daily lives -- an=
 airport or caf, a workplace or a theater -- and it unsettles us. It make=
s us unsure in our day-to-day lives -- fearful not just for ourselves but=
 those that we love. Conflicts from South Sudan to Syria to Afghanistan h=
ave sent millions fleeing, seeking the relative safety of Europes shores,=
 but that puts new strains on countries and local communities, and threat=
ens to distort our politics.



Russian aggression has flagrantly violated the sovereignty and territory =
of an independent European nation, Ukraine, and that unnerves our allies =
in Eastern Europe, threatening our vision of a Europe that is whole, free=
 and at peace. And it seems to threaten the progress that's been made sin=
ce the end of the Cold War.=20



Slow economic growth in Europe, especially in the south, has left million=
s unemployed, including a generation of young people without jobs and who=
 may look to the future with diminishing hopes. And all these persistent =
challenges have led some to question whether European integration can lon=
g endure; whether you might be better off separating off, redrawing some =
of the barriers and the laws between nations that existed in the 20th cen=
tury.



Across our countries, including in the United States, a lot of workers an=
d families are still struggling to recover from the worst economic crisis=
 in generations. And that trauma of millions who lost their jobs and thei=
r homes and their savings is still felt. And meanwhile, there are profoun=
d trends underway that have been going on for decades -- globalization, a=
utomation that -- in some cases, of depressed wages, and made workers in =
a weaker position to bargain for better working conditions. Wages have st=
agnated in many advanced countries while other costs have gone up. Inequa=
lity has increased. And for many people, its harder than ever just to hol=
d on.=20



This is happening in Europe; we see some of these trends in the United St=
ates and across the advanced economies. And these concerns and anxieties =
are real. They are legitimate. They cannot be ignored, and they deserve s=
olutions from those in power.=20



Unfortunately, in the vacuum, if we do not solve these problems, you star=
t seeing those who would try to exploit these fears and frustrations and =
channel them in a destructive way. A creeping emergence of the kind of po=
litics that the European project was founded to reject -- an us versus th=
em mentality that tries to blame our problems on the other, somebody who =
doesnt look like us or doesnt pray like us -- whether its immigrants, or =
Muslims, or somebody who is deemed different than us.



And you see increasing intolerance in our politics. And loud voices get t=
he most attention. This reminds me of the poem by the great Irish poet W.=
B. Yeats, where the best lack all conviction, and the worst are full of p=
assionate intensity.=20



So this is a defining moment. And what happens on this continent has cons=
equences for people around the globe. If a unified, peaceful, liberal, pl=
uralistic, free-market Europe begins to doubt itself, begins to question =
the progress thats been made over the last several decades, then we cant =
expect the progress that is just now taking hold in many places around th=
e world will continue. Instead, we will be empowering those who argue tha=
t democracy cant work, that intolerance and tribalism and organizing ours=
elves along ethnic lines, and authoritarianism and restrictions on the pr=
ess -- that those are the things that the challenges of today demand.



So Ive come here today, to the heart of Europe, to say that the United St=
ates, and the entire world, needs a strong and prosperous and democratic =
and united Europe. (Applause.)=20



Perhaps you need an outsider, somebody who is not European, to remind you=
 of the magnitude of what you have achieved. The progress that I describe=
d was made possible in large measure by ideals that originated on this co=
ntinent in a great Enlightenment and the founding of new republics. Of co=
urse, that progress didnt travel a straight line. In the last century -- =
twice in just 30 years -- the forces of empire and intolerance and extrem=
e nationalism consumed this continent. And cities like this one were larg=
ely reduced to rubble. Tens of millions of men and women and children wer=
e killed.=20



But from the ruins of the Second World War, our nations set out to remake=
 the world -- to build a new international order and the institutions to =
uphold it. A United Nations to prevent another world war and advance a mo=
re just and lasting peace. International financial institutions like the =
World Bank and International Monetary Fund to promote prosperity for all =
peoples. A Universal Declaration of Human Rights to advance the inalienab=
le rights of all members of the human family. And here in Europe, giants =
like Chancellor Adenauer set out to bind old adversaries through commerce=
 and through trade. As Adenauer said in those early days, European unity =
was a dream of a few. It became a hope for [the] many. Today it is a nece=
ssity for all of us. (Applause.)=20



And it wasnt easy. Old animosities had to be overcome. National pride had=
 to be joined with a commitment to a common good. Complex questions of so=
vereignty and burden-sharing had to be answered. Ant at every step, the i=
mpulse to pull back -- for each country to go its own way -- had to be re=
sisted. More than once, skeptics predicted the demise of this great proje=
ct.



But the vision of European unity soldiered on -- and having defended Euro=
pes freedom in war, America stood with you every step of this journey. A =
Marshall Plan to rebuild; an airlift to save Berlin; a NATO alliance to d=
efend our way of life. Americas commitment to Europe was captured by a yo=
ung American President, John F. Kennedy, when he stood in a free West Ber=
lin and declared that freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslave=
d, all are not free.

=20

With strength and resolve and the power of our ideals, and a belief in a =
unified Europe, we didnt simply end the Cold War -- freedom won. Germany =
was reunited. You welcomed new democracies into an even ever closer union=
. You may argue over whose football clubs are better, vote for different =
singers on Eurovision. (Laughter.) But your accomplishment -- more than 5=
00 million people speaking 24 languages in 28 countries, 19 with a common=
 currency, in one European Union -- remains one of the greatest political=
 and economic achievements of modern times. (Applause.)=20



Yes, European unity can require frustrating compromise. It adds layers of=
 government that can slow decision-making. I understand. I've been in mee=
tings with the European Commission. And, as an American, we're famously d=
isdainful of government. We understand how easy it must be to vent at Bru=
ssels and complain. But remember that every member of your union is a dem=
ocracy. That's not an accident. Remember that no EU country has raised ar=
ms against another. That's not an accident. Remember that NATO is as stro=
ng as its ever been.=20



Remember that our market economies -- as Angela and I saw this morning --=
 are the greatest generators of innovation and wealth and opportunity in =
history. Our freedom, our quality of life remains the envy of the world, =
so much so that parents are willing to walk across deserts, and cross the=
 seas on makeshift rafts, and risk everything in the hope of giving their=
 children the blessings that we -- that you -- enjoy -- blessings that yo=
u cannot take for granted.=20



This continent, in the 20th century, was at constant war. People starved =
on this continent. Families were separated on this continent. And now peo=
ple desperately want to come here precisely because of what you've create=
d. You can't take that for granted.



And today, more than ever, a strong, united Europe remains, as Adenauer s=
aid, a necessity for all of us. Its a necessity for the United States, be=
cause Europes security and prosperity is inherently indivisible from our =
own. We cant cut ourselves off from you. Our economies are integrated. Ou=
r cultures are integrated. Our peoples are integrated. You saw the respon=
se of the American people to Paris and Brussels -- its because, in our im=
aginations, this is our cities.

=20

A strong, united Europe is a necessity for the world because an integrate=
d Europe remains vital to our international order. Europe helps to uphold=
 the norms and rules that can maintain peace and promote prosperity aroun=
d the world.=20



Consider what weve done in recent years: Pulling the global economy back =
from the brink of depression and putting the world on the path of recover=
y. A comprehensive deal that's cut off every single one of Irans paths to=
 a nuclear bomb -- part of our shared vision of a world without nuclear w=
eapons. In Paris, the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climat=
e change. (Applause.) Stopping Ebola in West Africa and saving countless =
lives. Rallying the world around new sustainable development, including o=
ur goal to end extreme poverty. None of those things could have happened =
if I -- if the United States did not have a partnership with a strong and=
 united Europe. (Applause.) It wouldnt have happened.=20



Thats whats possible when Europe and America and the world stand as one. =
And thats precisely what we're going to need to face down the very real d=
angers that we face today. So let me just lay out the kind of cooperation=
 that we're going to need. We need a strong Europe to bear its share of t=
he burden, working with us on behalf of our collective security. The Unit=
ed States has an extraordinary military, the best the world has ever know=
n, but the nature of todays threats means we cant deal with these challen=
ges by ourselves.



Right now, the most urgent threat to our nations is ISIL, and thats why w=
ere united in our determination to destroy it. And all 28 NATO allies are=
 contributing to our coalition -- whether its striking ISIL targets in Sy=
ria and Iraq, or supporting the air campaign, or training local forces in=
 Iraq, or providing critical humanitarian aid. And we continue to make pr=
ogress, pushing ISIL back from territory that it controlled.=20



And just as Ive approved additional support for Iraqi forces against ISIL=
, Ive decided to increase U.S. support for local forces fighting ISIL in =
Syria. A small number of American Special Operations Forces are already o=
n the ground in Syria and their expertise has been critical as local forc=
es have driven ISIL out of key areas. So given the success, Ive approved =
the deployment of up 250 additional U.S. personnel in Syria, including Sp=
ecial Forces, to keep up this momentum. Theyre not going to be leading th=
e fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the traini=
ng and assisting local forces that continue to drive ISIL back.=20



So, make no mistake. These terrorists will learn the same lesson as other=
s before them have, which is, your hatred is no match for our nations uni=
ted in the defense of our way of life. And just as we remain relentless o=
n the military front, were not going to give up on diplomacy to end the c=
ivil war in Syria, because the suffering of the Syrian people has to end,=
 and that requires an effective political transition. (Applause.)=20



But this remains a difficult fight, and none of us can solve this problem=
 by ourselves. Even as European countries make important contributions ag=
ainst ISIL, Europe, including NATO, can still do more. So Ive spoken to C=
hancellor Merkel and Ill be meeting later with the Presidents of France a=
nd the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and of Italy. In Syria and Iraq, =
we need more nations contributing to the air campaign. We need more natio=
ns contributing trainers to help build up local forces in Iraq. We need m=
ore nations to contribute economic assistance to Iraq so it can stabilize=
 liberated areas and break the cycle of violent extremism so that ISIL ca=
nnot come back.=20



These terrorists are doing everything in their power to strike our cities=
 and kill our citizens, so we need to do everything in our power to stop =
them. And that includes closing gaps so terrorists cant pull off attacks =
like those in Paris and Brussels.



Which brings me to one other point. Europeans, like Americans, cherish yo=
ur privacy. And many are skeptical about governments collecting and shari=
ng information, for good reason. That skepticism is healthy. Germans reme=
mber their history of government surveillance -- so do Americans, by the =
way, particularly those who were fighting on behalf of civil rights.

So its part of our democracies to want to make sure our governments are a=
ccountable.=20



But I want to say this to young people who value their privacy and spend =
a lot of time on their phones: The threat of terrorism is real. In the Un=
ited States, Ive worked to reform our surveillance programs to ensure tha=
t theyre consistent with the rule of law and upholding our values, like p=
rivacy -- and, by the way, we include the privacy of people outside of th=
e United States. We care about Europeans privacy, not just Americans priv=
acy.



But I also, in working on these issues, have come to recognize security a=
nd privacy dont have to be a contradiction. We can protect both. And we h=
ave to. If we truly value our liberty, then we have to take the steps tha=
t are necessary to share information and intelligence within Europe, as w=
ell as between the United States and Europe, to stop terrorists from trav=
eling and crossing borders and killing innocent people.=20



And as todays diffuse threats evolve, our alliance has to evolve. So were=
 going to have a NATO summit this summer in Warsaw, and I will insist tha=
t all of us need to meet our responsibilities, united, together. That mea=
ns standing with the people of Afghanistan as they build their security f=
orces and push back against violent extremism. It means more ships in the=
 Aegean to shut down criminal networks who are profiting by smuggling des=
perate families and children.=20



And that said, NATOs central mission is, and always will be, our solemn d=
uty -- our Article 5 commitment to our common defense. Thats why well con=
tinue to bolster the defense of our frontline allies in Poland and Romani=
a and the Baltic states.=20



So we have to both make sure that NATO carries out its traditional missio=
n, but also to meet the threats of NATOs southern flank. Thats why we nee=
d to stay nimble, and make sure our forces are interoperable, and invest =
in new capabilities like cyber defense and missile defense. And thats why=
 every NATO member should be contributing its full share -- 2 percent of =
GDP -- towards our common security, something that doesnt always happen. =
And Ill be honest, sometimes Europe has been complacent about its own def=
ense.=20

=20

Just as we stand firm in our own defense, we have to uphold our most basi=
c principles of our international order, and thats a principle that natio=
ns like Ukraine have the right to choose their own destiny. Remember that=
 it was Ukrainians on the Maidan, many of them your age, reaching out for=
 a future with Europe that prompted Russia to send in its military. After=
 all that Europe endured in the 20th century, we must not allow borders t=
o be redrawn by brute force in the 21st century. So we should keep helpin=
g Ukraine with its reforms to improve its economy and consolidate its dem=
ocracy and modernize its forces to protect its independence.



And I want good relations with Russia, and have invested a lot in good re=
lations with Russia. But we need to keep sanctions on Russia in place unt=
il Russia fully implements the Minsk agreements that Chancellor Merkel an=
d President Hollande and others have worked so hard to maintain, and prov=
ide a path for a political resolution of this issue. And ultimately, it i=
s my fervent hope that Russia recognizes that true greatness comes not fr=
om bullying neighbors, but by working with the world, which is the only w=
ay to deliver lasting economic growth and progress to the Russian people.=
=20



Now, our collective security rests on a foundation of prosperity, so that=
 brings me to my second point. The world needs a prosperous and growing E=
urope -- not just a strong Europe, but a prosperous and growing Europe th=
at generates good jobs and wages for its people.=20



As I mentioned before, the economic anxieties many feel today on both sid=
es of the Atlantic are real. The disruptive changes brought about by the =
global economy, unfortunately, sometimes are hitting certain groups, espe=
cially working-class communities, more heavily. And if neither the burden=
s, nor the benefits of our global economy are being fairy distributed, it=
s no wonder that people rise up and reject globalization. If there are to=
o few winners and too many losers as the global economy integrates, peopl=
e are going to push back.



So all of us in positions of power have a responsibility as leaders of go=
vernment and business and civil society to help people realize the promis=
e of economic and security in this integrated economy. And the good news =
is, we know how to do it. Sometimes we just lack the political will to do=
 it.=20



In the United States, our economy is growing again, but the United States=
 cant be the sole engine of global growth. And countries should not have =
to choose between responding to crises and investing in their people. So =
we need to pursue reforms to position us for long-term prosperity, and su=
pport demand and invest in the future. All of our countries, for example,=
 could be investing more in infrastructure. All of our countries need to =
invest in science and research and development that sparks new innovation=
 and new industries. All of our countries have to invest in our young peo=
ple, and make sure that they have the skills and the training and the edu=
cation they need to adapt to this rapidly changing world. All of our coun=
tries need to worry about inequality, and make sure that workers are gett=
ing a fair share of the incredible productivity that technology and globa=
l supply chains are producing.=20



But if youre really concerned about inequality, if youre really concerned=
 about the plight of workers, if youre a progressive, its my firm belief =
that you cant turn inward. Thats not the right answer. We have to keep in=
creasing the trade and investment that supports jobs, as were working to =
do between the United States and the EU. We need to keep implementing ref=
orms to our banking and financial systems so that the excesses and abuses=
 that triggered the financial crisis never happen again.=20



But we cant do that individually, nation by nation, because finance now i=
s transnational. It moves around too fast. If were not coordinating betwe=
en Europe and the United States and Asia, then it wont work.=20



As the world has been reminded in recent weeks, we need to close loophole=
s that allow corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid paying their f=
air share of taxes through tax havens and tax avoidance, trillions of dol=
lars that could be going towards pressing needs like education and health=
 care and infrastructure. But to do that, we have to work together.



Here in Europe, as you work to strengthen your union -- including through=
 labor and banking reforms, and by ensuring growth across the Eurozone --=
 you will have the staunch support of the United States. But youre going =
to have to do it together, because your economies are too integrated to t=
ry to solve these problems on your own. And I want to repeat: We have to =
confront the injustice of widening economic inequality. But that is going=
 to require collective work, because capital is mobile, and if only a few=
 countries are worrying about it, then a lot of businesses will head towa=
rd places that dont care about it quite as much.



For a lot of years, it was thought that countries had to choose between e=
conomic growth and economic inclusion. Now we know the truth -- when weal=
th is increasingly concentrated among the few at the top, its not only a =
moral challenge to us but it actually drags down a countrys growth potent=
ial. We need growth that is broad and lifts everybody up. We need tax pol=
icies that do right by working families.=20



And those like me who support European unity and free trade also have a p=
rofound responsibility to champion strong protections for workers -- a li=
ving wage and the right to organize, and a strong safety net, and a commi=
tment to protect consumers and the environment upon which we all depend. =
If we really want to reduce inequality, we've got to make sure everyone w=
ho works hard gets a fair shot -- and that's especially true for young pe=
ople like you -- with education, and job training, and quality health car=
e and good wages. And that includes, by the way, making sure that there's=
 equal pay for equal work for women. (Applause.)



The point is, we have to reform many of our economies. But the answer to =
reform is not to start cutting ourselves off from each other. Rather, it'=
s to work together. And this brings me back to where I began. The world d=
epends upon a democratic Europe that upholds the principles of pluralism =
and diversity and freedom that are our common creed. As free peoples, we =
cannot allow the forces that Ive described -- fears about security or eco=
nomic anxieties -- to undermine our commitment to the universal values th=
at are the source of our strength.=20



Democracy, I understand, can be messy. It can be slow. It can be frustrat=
ing. I know that. I have to deal with a Congress. (Laughter.) We have to =
constantly work to make sure government is not a collection of distant, d=
etached institutions, but is connected and responsive to the everyday con=
cerns of our people. There's no doubt that how a united Europe works toge=
ther can be improved. But look around the world -- at authoritarian gover=
nments and theocracies that rule by fear and oppression -- there is no do=
ubt that democracy is still the most just and effective form of governmen=
t ever created. (Applause.)=20



And when I talk about democracy, I don't just mean elections, because the=
re are a number of countries where people get 70, 80 percent of the vote,=
 but they control all the media and the judiciary. And civil society orga=
nizations and NGOs can't organize, and have to be registered, and are int=
imidated. I mean real democracy, the sort that we see here in Europe and =
in the United States. So we have to be vigilant in defense of these pilla=
rs of democracy -- not just elections, but rule of law, as well as fair e=
lections, a free press, vibrant civil societies where citizens can work f=
or change.



And we should be suspicious of those who claim to have the interests of E=
urope at heart and yet don't practice the very values that are essential =
to Europe, that have made freedom in Europe so real.



So, yes, these are unsettling times. And when the future is uncertain, th=
ere seems to be an instinct in our human nature to withdraw to the percei=
ved comfort and security of our own tribe, our own sect, our own national=
ity, people who look like us, sound like us. But in today's world, more t=
han any time in human history, that is a false comfort. It pits people ag=
ainst one another because of what they look or how they pray or who they =
love. And yet, we know where that kind of twisted thinking can lead. It c=
an lead to oppression. It can lead to segregation and internment camps. A=
nd to the Shoah and Srebrenica.



In the United States, weve long wrestled with questions of race and integ=
ration, and we do to this day. And we still have a lot of work to do. But=
 our progress allows somebody like me to now stand here as President of t=
he United States. That's because we committed ourselves to a larger ideal=
, one based on a creed -- not a race, not a nationality -- a set of princ=
iples; truths that we held to be self-evident that all men were created e=
qual. And now, as Europe confronts questions of immigration and religion =
and assimilation, I want you to remember that our countries are stronger,=
 they are more secure and more successful when we welcome and integrate p=
eople of all backgrounds and faith, and make them feel as one. And that i=
ncludes our fellow citizens who are Muslim. (Applause.)=20



Look, the sudden arrival of so many people from beyond our borders, espec=
ially when their cultures are very different, that can be daunting. We ha=
ve immigration issues in the United States as well, along our southern bo=
rder of the United States and from people arriving from all around the wo=
rld who get a visa and decide they want to stay. And I know the politics =
of immigration and refugees is hard. It's hard everywhere, in every count=
ry. And just as a handful of neighborhoods shouldn't bear all the burden =
of refugee resettlement, neither should any one nation. All of us have to=
 step up, all of us have to share this responsibility. That includes the =
United States.=20



But even as we take steps that are required to ensure our security; even =
as we help Turkey and Greece cope with this influx in a way that is safe =
and humane; even as Chancellor Merkel and other European leaders work for=
 an orderly immigration and resettlement process, rather than a disorderl=
y one; even as we all need to collectively do more to invest in the susta=
inable development and governance in those nations from which people are =
fleeing so that they can succeed and prosper in their own countries, and =
so that we can reduce the conflicts that cause so much of the refugee cri=
sis around the world -- Chancellor Merkel and others have eloquently remi=
nded us that we cannot turn our backs on our fellow human beings who are =
here now, and need our help now. (Applause.) We have to uphold our values=
, not just when its easy, but when its hard.



In Germany, more than anywhere else, we learned that what the world needs=
 is not more walls. We can't define ourselves by the barriers we build to=
 keep people out or to keep people in. At every crossroads in our history=
, we've moved forward when we acted on those timeless ideals that tells u=
s to be open to one another, and to respect the dignity of every human be=
ing.=20



And I think of so many Germans and people across Europe who have welcomed=
 migrants into their homes, because, as one woman in Berlin said, we need=
ed to do something. Just that human impulse to help. And I think of the r=
efugee who said, I want to teach my kids the value of working. That human=
 impulse to see the next generation have hope. All of us can be guided by=
 the empathy and compassion of His Holiness, Pope Francis, who said refug=
ees are not numbers, they are people who have faces, names, stories, and =
[they] need to be treated as such.=20



And I know it may seem easy for me to say all this, living on the other s=
ide of the ocean. And I know that some will call it blind hope when I say=
 that I am confident that the forces that bind Europe together are ultima=
tely much stronger than those trying to pull you apart. But hope is not b=
lind when it is rooted in the memory of all that you've already overcome =
-- your parents, your grandparents.=20



So I say to you, the people of Europe, don't forget who you are. You are =
the heirs to a struggle for freedom. You're the Germans, the French, the =
Dutch, the Belgians, the Luxembourgers, the Italians -- and yes, the Brit=
ish -- (applause) -- who rose above old divisions and put Europe on the p=
ath to union. (Applause.)=20



Youre the Poles of Solidarity and the Czechs and Slovaks who waged a Velv=
et Revolution. Youre the Latvians, and Lithuanians and Estonians who link=
ed hands in a great human chain of freedom. Youre the Hungarians and Aust=
rians who cut through borders of barbed wire. And youre the Berliners who=
, on that November night, finally tore down that wall. Youre the people o=
f Madrid and London who faced down bombings and refused to give in to fea=
r.=20



And you are the Parisians who, later this year, plan to reopen the Batacl=
an. Youre the people of Brussels, in a square of flowers and flags, inclu=
ding one Belgian who offered a message -- we need more. More understandin=
g. More dialogue. More humanity.=20



That's who you are. United, together. You are Europe -- United in diversi=
ty. Guided by the ideals that have lit the world, and stronger when you s=
tand as one. (Applause.)=20



As you go forward, you can be confident that your greatest ally and frien=
d, the United States of America, stands with you, shoulder-to-shoulder, n=
ow and forever. Because a united Europe -- once the dream of a few -- rem=
ains the hope of the many and a necessity for us all.=20



Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)

 fortunate to be living in the most peaceful, most prosperous, most progres=

ching TV or looking at your phones and it seems like only bad news comes th=
rough every day.&nbsp; But consider that it&#8217;s
 been decades since the last war between major powers.&nbsp; More people li=
ve in democracies.&nbsp; We&#8217;re wealthier and healthier and better edu=
cated, with a global economy that has lifted up more than a billion people =
from extreme poverty, and created new middle classes
 from the Americas to Africa to Asia.&nbsp; Think about the health of the a=

If a unified, peaceful, liberal, pluralistic, free-market
 Europe begins to doubt itself, begins to question the progress that&#8217;=

rogress that is just now taking hold in many places around the world will c=

 who argue that democracy can&#8217;t work, that intolerance and tribalism =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

 The progress that I described was made possible in large
 measure by ideals that originated on this continent in a great Enlightenme=

8217;t travel a straight line.&nbsp; In the last century -- twice in just 3=

 &#8220;inalienable rights of all members of the human family.&#8221;&nbsp;=
 And here in Europe, giants like Chancellor Adenauer set out to bind old ad=

 It became a hope for [the] many.&nbsp; Today it is a necessity for all of =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

 of American Special Operations Forces are already on the ground in Syria a=

 of up 250 additional U.S. personnel in Syria,
 including Special Forces, to keep up this momentum.&nbsp; They&#8217;re no=

us can solve this problem by ourselves.&nbsp; Even as European countries ma=

 NATO, can still do more.&nbsp; So I&#8217;ve spoken to Chancellor Merkel a=
nd I&#8217;ll be meeting later with the Presidents of France and the Prime =
Ministers of Great Britain and of Italy.&nbsp; In Syria and Iraq, we need m=
ore nations contributing to the air campaign.&nbsp; We need
 more nations contributing trainers to help build up local forces in Iraq.&=

can stabilize liberated areas and break the cycle of violent extremism so t=

 closing gaps so terrorists can&#8217;t pull off attacks like those in Pari=

ans, like Americans, cherish your privacy.&nbsp; And many are skeptical abo=
ut governments collecting and sharing information, for good
 reason. That skepticism is healthy.&nbsp; Germans remember their history o=
f government surveillance -- so do Americans, by the way, particularly thos=
e who were fighting on behalf of civil rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">=
So it&#8217;s part of our democracies to want to make sure our governments =
are accountable.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">=
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=
y:&quot;Courier New&quot;">But I want to say this to young people who value=
 their privacy and spend a lot of time on their phones:&nbsp; The threat of=
 terrorism is real.&nbsp; In the United States, I&#8217;ve worked
 to reform our surveillance programs to ensure that they&#8217;re consisten=
t with the rule of law and upholding our values, like privacy -- and, by th=
e way, we include the privacy of people outside of the United States.&nbsp;=
 We care about Europeans&#8217; privacy, not just
 Americans&#8217; privacy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=
y:&quot;Courier New&quot;">But I also, in working on these issues, have com=
e to recognize security and privacy don&#8217;t have to be a contradiction.=
&nbsp; We can protect both.&nbsp; And we have to.&nbsp; If we truly value
 our liberty, then we have to take the steps that are necessary to share in=
formation and intelligence within Europe, as well as between the United Sta=
tes and Europe, to stop terrorists from traveling and crossing borders and =
killing innocent people.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=
y:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And as today&#8217;s diffuse threats evolve, our=
 alliance has to evolve.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re going to have a NATO summit t=
his summer in Warsaw, and I will insist that all of us need to meet
 our responsibilities, united, together.&nbsp; That means standing with the=
 people of Afghanistan as they build their security forces and push back ag=
ainst violent extremism.&nbsp; It means more ships in the Aegean to shut do=
wn criminal networks who are profiting by
 smuggling desperate families and children. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

and always will be, our solemn duty -- our Article 5 commitment to our comm=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

uthern flank.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we need to stay nimble, and
 make sure our forces are interoperable, and invest in new capabilities lik=
e cyber defense and missile defense.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why every NATO =
member should be contributing its full share -- 2 percent of GDP -- towards=
 our common security, something that doesn&#8217;t
 always happen.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll be honest, sometimes Europe has been c=

that prompted Russia to send in its military.&nbsp; After all that Europe e=
ndured in the 20th century, we must not allow
 borders to be redrawn by brute force in the 21st century.&nbsp; So we shou=

changes brought about by the global economy, unfortunately,
 sometimes are hitting certain groups, especially working-class communities=

 rise up and reject globalization.&nbsp; If there
 are too few winners and too many losers as the global economy integrates, =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

in, but the United States can&#8217;t be the sole engine of global growth.&=

 to crises and investing in their people.&nbsp; So we need to pursue reform=

 the future.&nbsp; All of our countries, for example, could be investing mo=

 need to invest in science and research and development that sparks new inn=
ovation and new industries.&nbsp; All of our countries have to invest in ou=
r young people, and make sure that they have the skills and the training an=
d the education they need to adapt to
 this rapidly changing world.&nbsp; All of our countries need to worry abou=

credible productivity that technology and global supply chains are producin=

 That&#8217;s not the right answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to keep increasing =
the trade and investment that supports jobs, as we&#8217;re working to do b=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

we need to close loopholes that allow corporations and wealthy individuals =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=
y:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Here in Europe, as you work to strengthen your u=
nion -- including through labor and banking reforms, and by ensuring growth=
 across the Eurozone -- you will have the staunch
 support of the United States.&nbsp; But you&#8217;re going to have to do i=
t together, because your economies are too integrated to try to solve these=
 problems on your own.&nbsp; And I want to repeat:&nbsp; We have to confron=
t the injustice of widening economic inequality. But
 that is going to require collective work, because capital is mobile, and i=

 head toward places that don&#8217;t care about it quite as much.<o:p></o:p=

e know the truth -- when wealth is increasingly concentrated
 among the few at the top, it&#8217;s not only a moral challenge to us but =
it actually drags down a country&#8217;s growth potential.&nbsp; We need gr=

 free trade also have a profound responsibility to champion strong protecti=
ons for workers -- a living wage and the right to
 organize, and a strong safety net, and a commitment to protect consumers a=
nd the environment upon which we all depend.&nbsp; If we really want to red=
uce inequality, we've got to make sure everyone who works hard gets a fair =
shot -- and that's especially true for
 young people like you -- with education, and job training, and quality hea=

 this brings me back to where I began.&nbsp; The world depends upon a democ=
ratic Europe that upholds the principles of pluralism and diversity and fre=
edom that are our common creed.&nbsp; As free peoples, we cannot allow the =
forces that I&#8217;ve described -- fears about
 security or economic anxieties -- to undermine our commitment to the unive=

can be slow.&nbsp; It can be frustrating.&nbsp; I know that.&nbsp; I have t=

to
 make sure government is not a collection of distant, detached institutions=
, but is connected and responsive to the everyday concerns of our people.&n=
bsp; There's no doubt that how a united Europe works together can be improv=
ed.&nbsp; But look around the world -- at
 authoritarian governments and theocracies that rule by fear and oppression=
 -- there is no doubt that democracy is still the most just and effective f=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-famil=

an elections, because there are a number of countries where people get 70, =
80 percent of the vote, but they control all the
 media and the judiciary.&nbsp; And civil society organizations and NGOs ca=
n't organize, and have to be registered, and are intimidated.&nbsp; I mean =
real democracy, the sort that we see here in Europe and in the United State=
s.&nbsp; So we have to be vigilant in defense of
 these pillars of democracy -- not just elections, but rule of law, as well=
 as fair elections, a free press, vibrant civil societies where citizens ca=

 of our own tribe, our own sect, our own nationality, people who look like =
us, sound like us.&nbsp; But in today's world, more than any time in human =

 like me to now stand here as President of the United States.&nbsp; That's =
because we committed ourselves to a larger ideal, one based on a creed -- n=
ot a race, not a nationality -- a set of principles; truths that we held to=
 be self-evident that all men were created
 equal.&nbsp; And now, as Europe confronts questions of immigration and rel=
igion and assimilation, I want you to remember that our countries are stron=

and from people arriving from all around the world who get a visa and decid=

 those nations from which people
 are fleeing so that they can succeed and prosper in their own countries, a=
