20Week%20in%20Washington%27>
Remember Wisconsin? That state's primary on April 5 was the beginning of th=
e end for Donald Trump, insisted the " Never Trump" movement within the GOP=
. The gig was up! Voters were on to him! He was imploding!

Fourteen days later, Trump took more than 60 percent of the vote and all bu=
t a handful of the available 95 delegates in New York's primary. Trump's ac=
ross-the-board win zeroed out Ted Cruz's mathematical chances of getting to=
 the 1,237 delegate threshold before the July national party convention. Me=
aning that Trump is now the only one of the three Republican candidates sti=
ll in the race who can secure a majority of the delegates on the first ball=
ot.

The calendar will only get better for Trump. He could well sweep all five s=
tates -- Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island -- =
that vote on Tuesday, further adding to his momentum. And anew poll release=
d Friday<http://washingtonpost.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3Dc5adbd47=
83d227c40313eb002&id=3D3b683892f4&e=3D848198a255> showed Trump leading Cruz=
 in Indiana's May 3 primary, a state where the "Never Trump" forces have al=
ready dedicated lots of time and money<http://washingtonpost.us2.list-manag=

255> and the winner can take most or all of the state's crucial 57 delegate=
s.

Amid this series of wins, Trump has also taken genuine strides to improving=
 his campaign staff -- and his new hires have, in turn, begun much-needed o=
utreach efforts to GOP delegates and establishment types to assure them tha=
t Trump doesn't present nearly the risk as the party's nominee as some have=
 suggested<http://washingtonpost.us2.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=3Dc5adb=
d4783d227c40313eb002&id=3D34344e5e0f&e=3D848198a255>. The new team also app=
ears to have Trump's ear, as the GOP front-runner delivered a much more mea=
sured victory speech than usual<http://washingtonpost.us2.list-manage1.com/=
track/click?u=3Dc5adbd4783d227c40313eb002&id=3D44d1850afd&e=3D848198a255> f=
ollowing his New York win.

What's an organization driven by the sole purpose of keeping Trump from the=
 nomination to do? Struggle, that's what.

A movement like "Never Trump" is entirely dependent on momentum and the mon=
ey that goes along with it. Allowing Trump to roll through April almost unc=
ontested -- no part of the "Never Trump" group spent any money on TV in New=
 York -- looks like a major strategic mistake in retrospect.

John Weaver, chief strategist for John Kasich's presidential campaign,bashe=
d the "Never Trump" movement<http://washingtonpost.us2.list-manage1.com/tra=
ck/click?u=3Dc5adbd4783d227c40313eb002&id=3D7402324908&e=3D848198a255> for =
its absence from the playing field in two major states.

Trump may not ultimately get to 1,237 delegates. And he may well never end =
up as the Republican presidential nominee. But, he had a VERY good week. An=
d, that means those trying to keep him from the nomination had a bad week. =
In fact, the Worst Week in Washington.
