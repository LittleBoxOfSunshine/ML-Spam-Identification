REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA

AND CHANCELLOR MERKEL OF GERMANY

AT HANNOVER MESSE TRADE FAIR=20



Hannover Messe Fairgrounds

Hannover, Germany=20





9:00 A.M. CEST





 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Guten morgen! Once again, I want to thank Chancellor Me=
rkel and everyone here at Hannover Messe for welcoming us. Angela and I a=
lready spoke last night. Im giving a speech later this morning. So Im goi=
ng to be very brief.=20



As I said last night, so much of our global economy and the growth that c=
reates jobs is driven by the spirit of innovation --discovery, invention =
-- and then turning those ideas into new products, companies, new industr=
ies, new services that create good jobs. So here at the U.S. Pavilion, we=
 are proud to showcase Americas commitment to innovation. Youll see pione=
ering companies that are changing the way that we live, the way that we w=
ork, the way that we learn. So this is another chance for me to tell ever=
yone to come here and buy Made in America. (Applause.)=20



Last night, I also talked about why companies around the world that are l=
ooking for where to set up shop should select America. And here at the pa=
vilion, youll find states, cities and communities from across the United =
States who are ready to welcome you with open arms.=20



Of course, Angela may have different ideas when we go to the German pavil=
ion. (Laughter.) But this friendly competition is healthy. It is what has=
 made our two countries some of the most competitive in the world, our wo=
rkers the best in the world, our products the best in the world.=20



So, again, I want to thank Angela and everyone at Hannover Messe. I expec=
t that as a result of this great event, well see more partnerships, more =
trade, and more good jobs for our people on both sides of the Atlantic. A=
ngela and I are going to go check out some exhibits, but first I know tha=
t she wants to say a few words as well. (Applause.)=20



CHANCELLOR MERKEL: (As interpreted.) Mr. President, dear Barack, I am del=
ighted that we are able to welcome so many guests from the United States =
here today. You have more than 400 exhibiters, more than 400 companies th=
at are presenting their goods, that are presenting their products here th=
is year as guest country, as partner country of the Hannover Fair. And I'=
m very much looking forward that later on we're going to take a tour and =
we're going to be presented very tangible examples of what companies prod=
uce here and what the companies themselves are doing.



Well, I think I can safely speak on behalf of the German business communi=
ty as well when I welcome you most cordially -- you, the representatives =
of your companies here -- as friends. We know you are our friends, you ar=
e partners. But you're also very strong companies, and we know that you w=
ant to present your product here. You want to be strong. But our companie=
s, too, want to present their products, want to be strong, they want to l=
earn from you. We want to learn from each other. We want to get closer to=
 each other, because we both want to shape innovation. We want to be forw=
ard-looking in this world of tomorrow.=20



And I think that all of us are very interested in bringing our products t=
o bear in this world that is so interesting -- to present our products he=
re at the Hannover Fair. And I hope and trust that this Hannover Fair, ag=
ain, will be a highlight of the best of production and of trade. And it i=
s a top of the world event as regards industrial trade fairs, and we trus=
t that it's going to be the same this year again.



But I think we should not forget that the companies are presenting themse=
lves here during this industrial trade fair, but behind companies are alw=
ays and invariably the members of the workforce. Workers, ordinary Americ=
ans want to secure their jobs -- and ordinary Germans, for that matter --=
 who want safe jobs, who want to secure their jobs, and who want to work =
for their prospects. And so that's never an abstract concept. But it's al=
so so that such an industrial fair also is about people, about people on =
both sides of the Atlantic. So what we have here today is also a piece of=
 America that we see and that we meet.=20



And again, a very warm welcome to all of you. (Applause.)=20



(Speaks in English.) And now I learn the proof of the pudding is the eati=
ng. Lets try it. (Laughter and applause.)



 END 9:09 A.M. CEST

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">CHANCELLOR MERKEL:&nbsp; =
(As interpreted.)&nbsp; Mr. President, dear Barack, I am delighted that we =
are able to welcome so many guests from the United States here today.&nbsp;=
 You have more than 400 exhibiters, more than 400 companies
 that are presenting their goods, that are presenting their products here t=
his year as guest country, as partner country of the Hannover Fair.&nbsp; A=
nd I'm very much looking forward that later on we're going to take a tour a=
nd we're going to be presented very tangible
 examples of what companies produce here and what the companies themselves =
are doing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Well, I think I can safel=
y speak on behalf of the German business community as well when I welcome y=
ou most cordially -- you, the representatives of your companies here -- as =
friends.&nbsp; We know you are our friends,
 you are partners.&nbsp; But you're also very strong companies, and we know=
 that you want to present your product here.&nbsp; You want to be strong.&n=
bsp; But our companies, too, want to present their products, want to be str=
ong, they want to learn from you.&nbsp; We want to learn
 from each other.&nbsp; We want to get closer to each other, because we bot=
h want to shape innovation.&nbsp; We want to be forward-looking in this wor=
ld of tomorrow.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I think that all of u=
s are very interested in bringing our products to bear in this world that i=
s so interesting -- to present our products here at the Hannover Fair.&nbsp=
; And I hope and trust that this Hannover
 Fair, again, will be a highlight of the best of production and of trade.&n=
bsp; And it is a top of the world event as regards industrial trade fairs, =
and we trust that it's going to be the same this year again.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But I think we should not=
 forget that the companies are presenting themselves here during this indus=
trial trade fair, but behind companies are always and invariably the member=
s of the workforce.&nbsp; Workers, ordinary
 Americans want to secure their jobs -- and ordinary Germans, for that matt=
er -- who want safe jobs, who want to secure their jobs, and who want to wo=
rk for their prospects.&nbsp; And so that's never an abstract concept.&nbsp=
; But it's also so that such an industrial
 fair also is about people, about people on both sides of the Atlantic.&nbs=
p; So what we have here today is also a piece of America that we see and th=
at we meet.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And again, a very warm we=
lcome to all of you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">(Speaks in English.)&nbsp=
; And now I learn the proof of the pudding is the eating.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s=
 try it.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
