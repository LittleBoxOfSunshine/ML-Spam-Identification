Hey Sri,

=20

After deliberating with our hosts, we think it best to push back to June.  =
We do not want to infringe on Tina (or Neera's) holiday weekend, so would l=
ike to look at dates in June, if that works for Tina.

=20

In an effort to align both Neera and Tina's schedules, we requested Neera's=
 June availability, which is below:

=20

Monday, June 6

Tuesday, June 7

Monday, June 27

Tuesday, June 28

Wednesday, June 29

=20

Please let us know if any of the above are options and we can move this for=
ward.  Thanks again for your assistance on all of this.  We know it has bee=
n a fete trying to get this scheduled!

Hey Sri, in an effort to be considerate of Neera Tanden's time, we are hopi=

Please let us know as soon as possible if Tina is available to fly in the m=

d we would pair her with another surrogate (i.e. Neera Tanden, Congresswoma=
n Bonnie Watson Coleman, et al) in other cities, pending your approval of t=
he pairing of course.  We have already made contact with Neera's office and=
 the Congresswoman Coleman's staff; both have agreed to participate.

	   If you wouldn't mind letting us know dates in May and June that work we=
ll for Tina, we can coordinate with our respective hosts and other surrogat=
es to make sure everyone is in sync.  We can also get you the other surroga=
tes availability if that's helpful.  My contact info is below if it's easie=
r to talk through everything.  Thanks for all your help!

	   Hi Sri,
	  =20
	   Jordan Vaughn here from the DNC.  Reaching out as I know Tina has spoke=
n with both Michele Taylor and Jordan Kaplan about potentially doing female=
 empowerment roundtables (1-pager attached) for us.
	  =20
	   Wanted to follow up with you to see if Tina has any open dates in May o=
r June that would work for her to act as a surrogate at one of these roundt=
ables.  The locations we are currently hoping to get her to are New York Ci=
ty and Raleigh-Durham.

	   Please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have additional questions; m=
y contact is below.  I look forward to hearing from you.
