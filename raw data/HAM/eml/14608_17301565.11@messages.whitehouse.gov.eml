THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the First Lady

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 5, 2016



"The following op-ed by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden appe=
ared in The Wall Street Journal [ http://www.wsj.com/articles/veterans-wi=
th-job-skills-america-needs-1462400324 ]. "

**

*_First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden: Veterans With Job Skills =
America Needs_*



When Americas leading companies look to hire top technology talent, their=
 search often follows a well-worn path: Recruiters fan out to world-renow=
ned institutions like MIT, Caltech and Stanford, or they solicit applicat=
ions from community colleges and other universities with the leading IT a=
nd engineering programs. For too long, though, another source of talent h=
as been largely overlooked, despite producing many of Americas most talen=
ted technology professionals.=20



Were talking about the U.S. military.=20



On land and in the air, under the sea and out in space, America has the m=
ost technologically advanced armed forces in history.=20



Military researchers and inventors have pioneered technological innovatio=
ns, including the Internet and GPS, that have transformed modern life. To=
day, more than 150,000 men and women in the U.S. military are working in =
tech jobslike the developers who create the software for fighter jets and=
 the network engineers who protect our country from cyberattacks.=20



And whether they were establishing wireless networks in Baghdad, repairin=
g communications equipment in the mountains of Afghanistan, or maintainin=
g data-storage units on 100,000-ton aircraft carriers in the South China =
Sea, these military personnel have often done their jobs in conditions th=
at most people cant even begin to imagine.



Given this experience, chances are that these men and women can handle wh=
atever comes their way in an office building in Silicon Valley. And when =
they decide to hang up that uniform and make the transition to civilian l=
ife, any company that decides to hire or train them will surely benefit f=
rom what they have to offer.



Former Air Force cyber analyst Donny Greene is a perfect example. Last ye=
ar, after more than two decades in the military, Donny took a job at a co=
mpany called RBR-Technologies. Since then, he has already completed numer=
ous certifications, represented the company at multiple conferences and w=
orked tirelessly to develop junior analysts. Today, RBR tells us, custome=
rs frequently request Donny by name to support their cyber exercises and =
operations.=20



Many military spouses, who serve and sacrifice right alongside Americas m=
en and women in uniform, have similar skills and experience. Sandy Browns=
 husband is an Army colonel. And even while their family frequently moved=
 from base to base across the country, Sandy continued to excel in her ow=
n career. After starting as a software engineer at Raytheon 16 years ago,=
 she is now an area director responsible for $350 million of their busine=
ss and more than 2,500 employees.



In addition to their hard skills, veterans and military spouses like Donn=
y and Sandy also bring plenty of hard-won life skills: an exacting sense =
of discipline; a commitment to executing missions perfectly every time; t=
he ability to juggle competing priorities; experience managing diverse te=
ams in high-pressure situations.



It is therefore not surprising that companies across America have realize=
d that hiring veterans and military spouses isnt just the patriotic thing=
 to do: Its the smart thing to do for their bottom lines.



That is why, on Thursday, more than 50 American companies and organizatio=
nsfrom small startups to multinational corporations like Amazon, J.P. Mor=
gan Chase, and AT&Tare pledging to hire more than 110,000 veterans and mi=
litary spouses and to train more than 60,000 of them.



These companies wont be hiring just for tech jobs, but also for the count=
less other roles that tech firms need to fill, from logistics and adminis=
tration to human resources and project management. No matter what job a c=
ompany has open, chances are that Americas men and women in uniform have =
been doing that job already in the military and will show up ready to suc=
ceed on day one.=20



The companies making these commitments arent alone. Since we launched our=
 Joining Forces initiative in 2011 and started asking Americans to honor =
and support service members, veterans and their families, leaders in many=
 industriesfrom private equity and construction to transportation and ene=
rgyhave answered the call. All told, over the past five years the unemplo=
yment rate for veterans has been cut in half, and through Joining Forces =
companies have hired or trained more than 1.2 million veterans and milita=
ry spouses.=20



Despite that remarkable achievement, there is plenty left to be done: 200=
,000 service members are returning to civilian life every year, and as fa=
r as were concerned, one unemployed veteran is one too many.



That is why, no matter who takes our husbands places next year, we urge t=
hem to continue making veteran and military-spouse employment a national =
priority with leadership from the White House. Giving these men and women=
 an opportunity to find their next mission here at home isnt just good fo=
r American businesses, it is one important way that we as a nation can fu=
lfill our obligation to serve them as well as they have served this count=
ry.



"Mrs. Obama is the first lady of the United States. Dr. Biden is the seco=
nd lady of the United States."

 husband is an Army colonel. And even while their family frequently moved f=

that tech firms need to fill, from logistics and administration

 and support service members, veterans and their families, leaders in many =
industries&#8212;from private equity and construction to transportation and=
 energy&#8212;have answered the call. All told, over the past five years th=

 in half, and through Joining Forces companies have hired or trained more t=
