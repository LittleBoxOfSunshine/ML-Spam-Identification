The rush is pretty verbatim on the tax returns piece.

>> He spent a fraction of what the other folks spent in the primary process and they lost. So you can kind of extrapolate what he needed for that and probably come up with a up in number as you did for what he would probably need given how big a name he is, which you of course recognize. So let me ask you about the tax return issue. He has said that he will not release his tax returns, at least not before the general election. The billionaire businessman saying that there is nothing to learn from those returns. But do you think he should release them for the sake of transparency? Because every candidate has done that since 1976. So why not?

SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I think it is an unusual circumstance where you got a billionaire running for the presidency. This would be the first entrepreneur to enter directly into the White House. Remember, this is the first person, except for Dwight Eisenhower -- so we're going back 50, 60 years -- that would enter the presidency without any political resume. I think what candidate trump is saying is that the tax returns are super complicated. So he wants to break precedent with that 40-year status and I think he's built up a pretty good case for that and good evidence for the American people.

>> But Anthony, what's the case -- I'm sorry to jump in on you, but I guess what is the case? I personally don't think that he necessarily should have to. And it is an optional issue. However, there is going to be a lot of pressure on him and people are going to say, we've heard Donald Trump talk a lot about the fact that he pushes the limits, that he doesn't want to pay any more taxes than he absolutely has to. He's been somewhat creative, in a way. So what would be in there that he wouldn't want people to see?

SCARAMUCCI: Well, I think it has to do with three things. The complication of the return, the fact that he's under an audit, he feels that he doesn't want to give out that information to the general public and have a whole nightmare situation with opposition research trying to pick holes through the return. I think the more meaningful thing is he's trying to get the American public to focus on the policies that could heal the economy and create the middle class jobs, Martha, that, frankly, my mom and dad experienced when I was growing up. So we've hollowed out the middle of the United States. The economic pain that's out there is being felt not only by the Donald Trump supporters, but also the Bernie Sanders supporters on the other side of the aisle. And so his attitude is why focus on this? It is non-material issue to my campaign. If it were something illegal, the Department of Justice or IRS would bring something against him. It is clearly not an illegal thing. His attitude is, what you just said -- it is optional. Let's make it optional.

>> All right.

SCARAMUCCI:  You have the option not to do it.

Scaramucci on Fox News

Says Trump will need less money than traditional candidates

First entrepreneur to go straight into White House

Tax Returns?

-          Too complicated

-          Doesn't want to open them up to opposition research poking holes

-          Wants to focus instead on creating middle-class jobs

-          Non-material issue to the campaign

-          Optional. Clearly not a legal issue, because IRS would do something
