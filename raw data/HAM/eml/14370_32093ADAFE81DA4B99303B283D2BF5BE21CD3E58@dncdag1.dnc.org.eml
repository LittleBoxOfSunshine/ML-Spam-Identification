t-conservative-economics>
THE WEEK // PAUL WALDMAN

Rand Paul debuted his flat tax plan Thursday in a Wall Street Journal op-ed=
, and we shouldn't mince words: This plan is utterly bonkers. But it may ye=
t have an impact on the presidential race, not because anything like it wil=
l ever be enacted, but because it's so radical that the other candidates wi=
ll have to confront it. They might decide that it makes their own plans see=
m reasonable and practical by comparison. Or they might feel pressure to ma=
ke their own ideas more sweeping to try to keep up. Either way, Paul's plan=
 is vivid proof of the magical thinking that grips Republicans on the subje=
ct of taxes.

When you get to this line early in Paul's op-ed, you know you've entered an=
 economic Bizarro World, where the most fantastical claims are sure to foll=
ow: "In consultation with some of the top tax experts in the country, inclu=
ding the Heritage Foundation's Stephen Moore, former presidential candidate=
 Steve Forbes, and Reagan economist Arthur Laffer, I devised a 21st-century=
 tax code..." Those three are "some of the top tax experts in the country" =
in the same sense that Jenny McCarthy, Guy Fieri, and that lady down the st=
reet who ate her baby's placenta are "some of the top medical experts in th=
e country." So what did Paul and his kitchen cabinet of cranks come up with=
?

First, he'd tax all individuals and businesses at 14.5 percent, regardless =
of the type of income. In there is the sole good idea Paul has - there's no=
 logical reason why wage income should be taxed at a higher rate than incom=
e from investments - but that represents a gigantic tax cut for those with =
high incomes. He'd completely eliminate inheritance taxes, which is good ne=
ws for future Paris Hiltons. He'd also eliminate payroll taxes, "which are =
seized by the IRS from a worker's paychecks before a family ever sees the m=
oney." Paul doesn't mention the fact that payroll taxes fund the Social Sec=
urity and Medicare systems, of which Americans are rather fond. Is he going=
 to just shut them down? Who knows.

Speaking of things Americans are fond of, Paul shows the limits of his cour=
age by noting that while he'd eliminate most tax deductions, he'd keep the =
deduction for charitable contributions and the hallowed mortgage interest d=
eduction. If you own a home, you love the mortgage interest deduction - who=
 wouldn't want the government to pay part of their mortgage? But it costs a=
round $70 billion a year, and three-quarters of the benefits go to those ea=
rning over $100,000. In other words, the mortgage interest deduction is a m=
iddle- and upper-class entitlement program, a gigantic big-government givea=
way of the type a quasi-libertarian like Rand Paul ought to despise. But do=
n't worry - he'll let you keep it.

And what about the economic benefits of Paul's plan? I'll let him explain:

Because the Fair and Flat Tax rewards work, saving, investment, and small b=
usiness creation, the Tax Foundation estimates that in 10 years it will inc=
rease gross domestic product by about 10 percent, and create at least 1.4 m=
illion new jobs.

So he's claiming that his plan will increase GDP by 1 percent a year, which=
 is substantial, but for some reason it produces a whopping 140,000 jobs pe=
r year, or 11,667 jobs per month. Last month the U.S. economy added 280,000=
 new jobs, so it's a little hard to see that 11,667 as the "economic steroi=
d injection" Paul says it would be.

The plan would deprive the federal government of huge amounts of tax revenu=
e, meaning either an enormous deficit or truly spectacular spending cuts. H=
ow does Paul handle this? Get ready for the pixie dust:

And because the best way to balance the budget and pay down government debt=
 is to put Americans back to work, my plan would actually reduce the nation=
al debt by trillions of dollars over time when combined with my package of =
spending cuts.

Unless Paul's "package of spending cuts" includes shutting down the Departm=
ent of Defense, eliminating Medicaid, and no longer doing a whole lot of ot=
her things the federal government currently does, there's just no way this =
is possible. And while it's true that the best way to balance the budget is=
 with strong economic growth that brings in more tax revenue, Paul's plan r=
ests on a theory that has been tested again and again, and has failed again=
 and again.

Republicans are still gripped by a religious belief that tax rates are the =
primary determinant of whether the economy is good or bad at a particular m=
oment, which leads to two inevitable corollaries: If you cut taxes, the eco=
nomy will explode with a glitter bomb of prosperity for all, and if you rai=
se taxes, the economy will descend into a pit of misery and despair. But we=
 know that's false. The actual truth is that changing tax rates can have an=
 impact on economic growth, all other things being equal, but that impact i=
s quite small.

You don't have to be an economic historian to know that the predictions Rep=
ublicans have made based on their economic theory have proven wrong again a=
nd again. When Bill Clinton raised taxes in 1993, they said the result woul=
d be a "job-killing recession." Over the course of Clinton's administration=
, the American economy created 22 million new jobs. When George W. Bush cut=
 taxes, they said it would supercharge the economy. What followed was seven=
 years of anemic job creation culminating in the worst economic crisis sinc=
e the Great Depression. They said Barack Obama's policies, including some t=
ax increases, would destroy any hope of job creation. But the economy has a=
dded 12 million jobs since the beginning of 2010, and 2014 was the best yea=
r for job growth since 1999.

That's not to mention the fact that some of the strongest growth in both th=
e overall economy and in incomes in American history happened during the 19=
50s and 1960s, when the top income tax rate was as high as 91 percent (and =
labor unions were at their strongest, by they way). The point is that while=
 cutting taxes can, in the right circumstances, provide a boost to the econ=
omy by giving people some more money to spend, it isn't anything like the p=
anacea Republicans believe it to be. And tax cuts don't ever pay for themse=
lves by creating so much growth, as Republicans always hope.

Yet that remains the foundation of every Republican candidate's tax plan: A=
ll we need to do is cut taxes, particularly for the wealthy, and we'll all =
sashay into economic nirvana. Rand Paul's may be the most extreme in the bu=
nch (so far anyway), but you can bet the other candidates are going to look=
 at the marker he has laid down and fall all over themselves to assure prim=
ary voters that they too believe that tax cuts have magical powers.
