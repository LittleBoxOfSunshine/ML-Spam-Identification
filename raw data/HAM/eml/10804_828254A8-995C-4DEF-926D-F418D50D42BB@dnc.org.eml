Spoke with the Assemblywoman Gray-Jackson. She will be happy to meet you this evening or first thing in the morning. She definitely wants to meet and talk with you, but she told me that she just spoke with the Mayor of Anchorage and that her understanding is the the Senator has assigned someone from his team- Shana Thoma to you for the day.   Assemblywoman Gray-Jackson is originally from Jersey. She is going to events during the day, but not the dinner. She said she's from Newark and she won't be bullied and she didn't want to have to curse anybody out. But, after talking to Chaka, she was at an event with the Mayor and told him about you coming, etc and he said that it was all worked out. So Garret, here are two numbers for you:

Assemblywoman Elvi Gray-Jackson 907- 230-0320. Asked that you please call her once DWS lands and gets situated. She would love to speak to her candidly about the events she attended today and provide some background. 

shana Thoma- this is the person from the Senator's team that has been assigned to staff DWS. Her cell is 907-229-9594. 

I am calling Shana now, reviewing the speech and going to sleep. I spoke with the Mayor's Chief of Staff and I feel a lot better about things.
