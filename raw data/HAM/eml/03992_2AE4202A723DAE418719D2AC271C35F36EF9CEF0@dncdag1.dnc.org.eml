Donald Trump=92s rivals Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina have hammered the frontr=
unner this week for touting the endorsement of former heavyweight-boxing ch=
ampion Mike Tyson in Indiana =97 a state where Tyson was convicted in 1992 =
of raping a beauty pageant contestant Desiree Washington.



Trump controversially suggested<http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/12=
/when-donald-trump-tried-get-mike-tyson-out-of-prison-time-of-rape> in 1992=
 Tyson could pay the victim with money from a fight to avoid serving a jail=
 sentence and as reported earlier this week by BuzzFeed News<https://www.bu=
zzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-blamed-the-victim-in-mike-tysons-ra=
pe-case?utm_term=3D.cjNME519v#.muYeLB4gq> said in the early =9290s that Tys=
on was =93railroaded=94 in his case, and that the victim had willingly ente=
red Tyson=92s room.



In another instance in late 1992, Trump discussed the case at length in an =
interview with Charlie Rose. The topic centered around a New York magazine =
profile in which Trump said his mother was angry at him for defending Tyson=
. In the piece, Trump said Tyson told him the victim =93wanted it real bad.=
=94



Wrote New York magazine<https://books.google.com/books?id=3DBeUCAAAAMBAJ&pg=
=3DPA43&dq=3Ddonald+trump+mother+tyson&hl=3Den&sa=3DX&ved=3D0ahUKEwjK8Ym_4L=
bMAhVSET4KHa5SBNwQ6AEIPDAI#v=3Donepage&q=3Dtyson&f=3Dfalse> in their cover =
profile of Trump:



Donald is discussing his buddy Mike Tyson. Tyson told Trump the woman who p=
ut him in jail =93wanted it real bad.=94 Trump feels Tyson is doing time on=
 a bad rap: =93She knocked on his door at 1 a.m. and was up and dancing at =
eight the next morning.=94 This speech is another of the set pieces he is s=
o fond of delivering. When he defended Tyson and suggested a payoff and com=
munity service for the champ, his mother got so angry she raised her voice =
to him for the first time in his 46 years.

Trump said his mother was not amused with his defense of Tyson.



=93I think that=92s probably the first time that my mother absolutely got a=
ngry at me,=94 Trump told Rose. =93I really mean that. My mother was so cra=
zy when I came out in defense of Mike Tyson.=94



Again remarking that his mother was livid at him, Trump added that he had p=
roblems with how Tyson=92s defense was handled.



=93She didn=92t exactly like the fact that I was defending Iron Mike, but I=
 watched what happened to Mike Tyson,=94 said Trump. =93I watched how badly=
 he was represented by an attorney in Washington that was charging him $3, =
$4, or $5 million against a local attorney, the best within 100 miles, that=
 the state hired who just ate the other man=92s lunch. I watched the way he=
 did it.=94



Trump then questioned if the rape even had occurred, suggesting the victim =
made it up.



=93I heard about a girl that late in the evening knocked on his door, was t=
aken in, was raped perhaps, perhaps not,=94 said Trump. =93I don=92t know. =
Again, I think he was badly represented, but I did see that number one, she=
 knocks late in the night. Number two, she=92s dancing in a beauty contest =
at 8 a.m. I saw the tapes. I see the big smile on her face. She=92s dancing=
 happily at 8 a.m. Then Mike Tyson=92s in jail for four, five, or six years=
. I had a real problem with that case. I had a real problem with Mike Tyson=
=92s lawyers. I had a real problem with Don King. I just think that he was =
really fed out to the wolves.=94



Trump noted Tyson still denied the charges and said he believed if Tyson ha=
dn=92t testified would have been found not guilty.



=93He to this day denies it,=94 said Trump, when asked by Rose if Tyson sho=
uld have gone to jail if found guilty. =93I don=92t know that it happened. =
I think that as they said if he didn=92t testify, he would have been exoner=
ated totally. The jury said that. Mike was arrogant. He was a horrible witn=
ess from what I understand. I=92m not surprised. I would say that generally=
 speaking, you don=92t put Mike on as a witness but he was a horrible witne=
ss. To get four, five, or six years, I think that there was just too many c=
ircumstances. Again, she was in a beauty contest. She was dancing with a bi=
g smile on her face at 8:00 a.m.=94



Trump said Tyson was thrown in jail before being found guilty and deserved =
another chance.



=93I watched Mike,=94 he staid. =93I=92ve been with Mike. I=92ve seen him. =
People really take advantage of this man. I want to tell you something. I t=
hink this is one of those examples. Now, I know we have a system of juries.=
 We have a system where if you=92re found guilty, you=92re guilty, but some=
body like me and maybe who has a little bit more independent streak can say=
, =91Hey, Mike Tyson in my opinion should really be given another break.=92=
 They put him in jail before he was even guilty as far as I was concerned.=
=94
