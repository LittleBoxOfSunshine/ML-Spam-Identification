The Democratic Party

Getting the word out about how bad Republicans would be for=20
America is the most important part of our work. Become a Factivist=20

http://my.democrats.org/Become-a-Factivist

Hey there, Luis --

Remember that classic '80s movie where high school kids from all=20
different walks of life come together over weekend detention and=20
realize they're not so different after all? Well, Speaker Paul Ryan=20
and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for president,=20
Donald Trump, spent some time together on Thursday morning and=20
realized there is plenty they have in common.

In fact, they issued a statement (just like The Breakfast Club's=20
assignment!) saying how crucial it was that "Republicans unite around=20
our shared principles, advance a conservative agenda, and do all we=20
can to win this fall," and "while we recognize our few differences, we=20
recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground"=20
and ultimately "remain confident there's a great opportunity to unify =
our=20
party and win this fall."=20

Yes, the Republican Party is unifying around a candidate who has stoked=20
hatred and intolerance so much, some of his biggest fans are white=20
nationalists:

Real-life headline: "Trump Selects a White Nationalist Leader as a=20
Delegate in California"

http://my.democrats.org/Retweet-This-Today

Whose approval rating among women is historically low -- with good reason:

Remember that time Donald Trump said there should be "some form of=20
punishment" for women who have abortions?

http://my.democrats.org/Retweet-This-Today2

And who is at odds with our most fundamental American values:

http://my.democrats.org/Retweet-This-Today3

But really, it shouldn't surprise Speaker Ryan -- or anyone else, for =
that=20
matter -- that he should be able to find common ground with Donald=20
Trump. After all, Trump's candidacy has given the Republican Party=20
what they've been asking for after years of sowing seeds of fear, =
hatred,=20
greed, and intolerance:=20

http://my.democrats.org/Retweet-This-Today4

The stakes have never been higher for electing Democrats this=20
November, Luis. Especially when the Republican nominee is as=20
resistant to facts and fact-checking as Trump is, your job is more=20
important than ever to get the word out to your family, friends, and=20
neighbors on what a disaster Trump -- and the rest of his Republican=20
Party -- would be for our country. So tweet, share, and forward this=20
email to everyone you can.=20
