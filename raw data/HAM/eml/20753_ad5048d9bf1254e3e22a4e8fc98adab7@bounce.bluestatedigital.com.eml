This summer, OFA organizers around the country are looking
ahead to this movement's future. This is a crucial time to
prepare for the fights to come, but also a time to take
stock of all we've accomplished together.

As part of that reflection, we're giving one lucky supporter
the opportunity to talk to the Organizer-in-Chief himself
about how far we've come. OFA is launching a new contest
giving you the chance to tell President Obama which of this
movement's accomplishments mean the most to you.

Enter now for your chance to meet the President this summer
at OFA's event in Washington, D.C.:

https://my.barackobama.com/Tell-Him-Yourself

In his recent commencement speech at Howard University,
President Obama talked about the importance of organizing,
about how change requires more than anger at the status quo
-- it requires a program, and it requires people willing to
put in the hard work of making incremental progress.

OFA supporters talk a lot about being proud to be organizers
with the patience and commitment to create lasting progress.
As a movement, we've continued to prove wrong those who say
we can't make change -- and along the way have remained
hopeful in the face of so much cynicism.

That dedication has accomplished a lot over the past few
years, like 90 percent of Americans with health coverage, 74
straight months of private-sector job growth, and marriage
equality for all. We should be proud of what we've achieved
together -- and be thankful that we have a leader like
President Obama who has stood side-by-side with organizers
the whole way.

If you want the chance to tell President Obama why you're
thankful for this movement and all we have built together,
enter OFA's new contest today:

https://my.barackobama.com/Tell-Him-Yourself

Thanks -- and good luck,
