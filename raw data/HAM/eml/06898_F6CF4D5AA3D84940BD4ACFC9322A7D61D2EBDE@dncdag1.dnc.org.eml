ROUNDUP

UPDATE

DONALD TRUMP ROUNDUP

TRUMP USED PSEUDONYMS "JOHN MILLER" AND "JOHN BARRON" TO BRAG ABOUT HIMSELF TO PRESS: "A recording obtained by The Washington Post captures what New York reporters and editors who covered Trump's early career experienced in the 1970s, '80s and '90s: calls from Trump's Manhattan office that resulted in conversations with 'John Miller' or 'John Barron' - public-relations men who sound precisely like Trump himself - who indeed are Trump, masquerading as an unusually helpful and boastful advocate for himself, according to the journalists and several of Trump's top aides." [Washington Post, 5/13/16<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-alter-ego-barron/2016/05/12/02ac99ec-16fe-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html>]

NO, TRUMP HAS NOT SOFTENED ON HIS MUSLIM BAN: "'Glad he's walking it back,' Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) tweeted on Thursday. Except that Trump has not actually walked anything back. The presumptive Republican nominee still wants to ban nearly all members of the world's fastest-growing religion from entering the United States in an effort to prevent terrorist attacks. As Trump first said in December, such a ban would be temporary and last only until U.S. authorities 'find out what's going on.' He also said then that the ban will not apply to U.S. citizens, and that there would be exceptions for world leaders, athletes and others." [Washington Post, 5/13/16<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/no-donald-trump-has-not-softened-his-stance-on-banning-muslims/2016/05/12/6ec8d514-185c-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html>]

JAMIE BAKER SPURNS TRUMP'S BRAND OF FOREIGN POLICY: "'We've got a lot of problems today, but you'd have a hell of a lot more if that were the case,' Baker, who was secretary of state in President George H.W. Bush's administration, said without mentioning Trump by name. 'NATO has been the foundation of peace and stability in Europe. The more countries that obtain nuclear weapons the more instability there will be in the world.'"

SAM CLOVIS IMPLIES SWEEPING CHANGES TO THE VA VIA "SOME FORM OF PRIVATIZATION": "While short on details, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee would likely push VA health care toward privatization and might move for it to become more of an insurance provider like Medicare rather than an integrated hospital system, said Sam Clovis, Mr. Trump's chief policy adviser, in an interview. 'We want quality care top to bottom,' Mr. Clovis said in an interview. 'If that means we have some form of privatization or some form of Medicare, we don't see anything wrong with that.'"

ENDORSEMENT TRACKER - SHELDON ADELSON: "I am endorsing Trump's bid for president and strongly encourage my fellow Republicans - especially our Republican elected officials, party loyalists and operatives, and those who provide important financial backing - to do the same. The alternative to Trump being sworn in as the nation's 45th president is frightening."

TRUMP DAILY UPDATE

Eric Trump: "I Have More Hispanics Come Up To Me Telling Me, 'Listen, I Can't Wait For Your Father To Be President. He's Going To Bring Jobs Back To The United States. He's Going To End The Nonsense." "Eric Trump says Hispanics approach him on the trail to express their desire for his father to be president. Donald Trump, according to the latest Gallup poll, is viewed unfavorably by 77% of Hispanics in the United States. 'People often talk about Hispanics,' Eric Trump said Monday on Irish radio's RTE Radio1's Drivetime. 'You know, I have more Hispanics come up to me telling me, 'listen, I can't wait for your father to be president. He's gonna bring jobs back to the United States. He's gonna end the nonsense. He's gonna create good trade deals. He's gonna create better education. He's gonna create a better family structure. '' 'I see so little of the divisiveness, which is interesting. You watch it on TV, but you see so little of it out in the field.'"

At The Prompting Of The Anti-Defamation League, Trump Denounced David Duke's Anti-Semitic Remarks: "Antisemitism Has No Place Our Society, Which Needs To Be United, Not Divided." "Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement that 'David Duke's latest remarks - smearing Jews and Jewish Republicans specifically - are as unsurprising as they are hateful.' 'The onus is now on Donald Trump to make unequivocally clear he rejects those sentiments and that there is no room for Duke and anti-Semitism in his campaign and in society,' he said. 'Mr. Trump can and should speak up now. If not, his silence will speak volumes.' Later Thursday, Mr. Trump said in a statement that he 'totally disavows' Mr. Duke's remarks. 'Antisemitism has no place our society, which needs to be united, not divided,' said Mr. Trump, who has been accused of using overtly racial appeals to motivate his largely white, working-class political base. The Anti-Defamation League has criticized Mr. Trump before, and has redirected his previous donations to the group because of his remarks about Muslims and others. Mr. Trump has often cited his ties to the Jewish community, noting, for instance, that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is an Orthodox Jew, and that his daughter, Ivanka, converted to Judaism."

The Zionist Organization Of America Praised Trump For His Support For Continued Construction Of Israeli Settlements In The West Bank. "Donald Trump on Thursday earned high praise from the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), a group that hosted Ted Cruz and Michelle Bachmann at its annual dinner, for expressing support for continued construction in Israeli settlements in the West Bank. In an interview with DailyMail.com on Monday, Trump was asked whether he would call on Israel to halt new construction in the settlements in order to bring the Palestinians to the negotiating table. 'No, I don't think there should be a pause,' Trump said. 'I think Israel really have to keep going. They have to keep moving forward.'"

Trump Said He Was Putting Together A Commission Headed By Rudy Giuliani To Study Muslim Immigration And Immigration Generally. QUESTION: "You said we'll stop Muslim immigration until we find out what the hell is going on, you said. And then you said -- you walked back the other day and said, listen, that was a suggestion. But you're going to put together a commission headed by Rudy Giuliani. Would you like to expand on that?" TRUMP: "Yeah. It was a suggestion. Look, anything I say right now, I'm not the president. Everything is a suggestion, no matter what you say it's a suggestion. I feel strongly we have to do something about when you look at radical Islamic terrorism, we have a president that as you folks know very well, we have a president that won't use the term for the world trade center he won't use the term. And we have to do something. You're not going to do something about it until you know what the problem is. I have spoken to Rudy Giuliani. We're going to put together a group. We're going to look at the problem. We're going to study the problem. It's a temporary ban. I feel very strongly that we have to find out what the problem is. When you look at San Bernardino, when you look at Paris, when you look at all of these horrible, horrible acts of hatred, this is pure hatred. We have to find out and get to the bottom of the problem before we can solve it." QUESTION: "So Donald Trump who's on this panel? How big is it? What is the task exactly? To look at Muslim immigration, Muslim Americans?' TRUMP: "To look at Muslim immigration and also immigration generally." [Fox & Friends, Fox News, 5/13/16]

Tax Returns

Trump Said Voters Did Not Have The Right To See His Tax Returns Before Deciding To Vote For Him. STEPHANOPOULOS: "I just have a bottom line question for you. Yes or no, do you believe voters have a right to see your tax returns before they make a final decision?" TRUMP: "I don't think they do. But I do say this, I will really gladly give them -- not going to learn anything but it's under routine audit. When the audit ends I'll present them. That should be before the election. I hope it's before the election. But when the audit ends I've had even journalists say that." [Good Morning America, ABC, 5/13/16]

Trump: "There Have Been Many Presidents That Have Not Shown Their Tax Returns... Before 1976 Most People Didn't Do. It Used To Be A Secret Thing." TRUMP: "Well, because at the time it didn't make any difference to me. Now it does. If you take a look at the picture that we sent you with a tax returns probably ten feet high when you stack them on top and lengthy and complex and built a massive business and want to make sure that everything is perfect. It's a routine audit and get through it first and that's what I'll do. There have been many presidents that have not shown their tax returns." STEPHANOPOULOS: "Every single nominee before 1976--" TRUMP:  "Before 1976 most people didn't do. It used to be a secret thing. I don't want it secret, but I do want it finished." [Good Morning America, ABC, 5/13/16]

Trump: "I Do Not Have Swiss Bank Accounts. I Don't Have Offshore -- I Really Have A Very, Very Clean Company." STEPHANOPOULOS:  "Before that Richard Nixon released his returns but to get to your point on the one hand you show that tack and on the other hand you say people can't learn anything. They can learn a lot. They can learn your sources of income. They can learn whether you have any foreign sources of income or any Swiss bank accounts or other offshore accounts. Do you?" TRUMP: "I tell you, I do not. I do not have Swiss bank accounts. I don't have offshore -- I really have a very, very clean company and believe me, if I didn't, it would have been reported by 200 groups because there's nobody that has more reporting or more scrutiny than I have. I have given my financials, they're extraordinary. And we would have read if they weren't. Believe me when I release my financial, George and sent them down to federal elections, there was a feeding frenzy by the media and they reported, wow, that is a great company and I have built a great, great company and by the way, when you look at numbers, when you look at incomes, when you look at all of the things or most of the things you talked about that's reported on the financials."

STEPHANOPOULOS: "It's not reported on the financials. What they don't know also is your tax rate. They don't show whether you paid a low--" TRUMP:  "I try to pay as little tax as possible and have said that for the last two years, I fight very hard because this country wastes our money. They take our tax money and throw it down the drain. They spend $4 trillion in the Middle East and we can't fix a road or a bridge and I fight very hard. I consider it an expense because, frankly, our country doesn't know what they're doing with our money or tax money and that's part of the problem so I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible." STEPHANOPOULOS: "What is your tax rate? " TRUMP: "It's none of your business. You'll see it when I release but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible."

STEPHANOPOULOS: "What is your tax rate? " TRUMP: "It's none of your business. You'll see it when I release but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible." STEPHANOPOULOS: "You know, we've talked about this several times over the last several years. I first asked about it in 2011. You said you would release your tax returns then thinking of running for president when president Obama releases his birth certificate. He did. Then you said when Secretary Clinton released her e-mails. She turned over all mails in her--" TRUMP: "There's plenty of missing. I read yesterday that there were plenty missing. I know you're a good friends of hers. She did not turn over her e-mails. There are a lot of e-mails missing." [Good Morning America, ABC, 5/13/16]


LGBT

Trump Said He Did Not Yet Have An Opinion On Whether Transgender Individuals Should Be Forced To Use The Bathroom Of The Gender On Their Birth Certificate. QUESTION: "I wanted to ask you this, the Obama administration is allowing the transgender students to choose their bathrooms and if the schools are not on board they could face federal funding and face lawsuits." TRUMP: "It's become a huge story and everybody has to be protected. If it's one person, but it's a tiny, tiny portion of the population. And it's become a massive story. I think there should be a state's issue and as many other things should be by the way. And the state should decide." QUESTION: "Do you think boys the way their gender-- they should use the bathroom of the gender they were born with?" TRUMP: "Right now, it's a new issue. Right now I don't have an opinion. But what I would like to do is I would like to see the states make that decision." [Fox & Friends, Fox News, 5/13/16]

Tax Policy

HEADLINE: "Donald Trump Won't Alter Tax Plan, Spokeswoman Says As Confusion Reigns." [New York Times, 5/12/16<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/us/politics/donald-trump-wont-alter-tax-plan-spokeswoman-says-as-confusion-reigns.html?ref=politics&_r=1>]

Despite Disparities Between Trump's Published Tax Plan And His Rhetoric, His Spokeswoman Said He Had No Plans To Change It. "After days of confusion over Donald J. Trump's hints that he would change his tax plan to reduce its budget-busting cost and make it less generous to the rich, his spokeswoman on Thursday sought to clear things up: He plans no changes, Hope Hicks said, and advisers who say otherwise do not speak for him. One of those advisers, Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation, had his own response: 'I'm a little bummed out if his spokeswoman says they're not going to make any changes to the plan.' Mr. Trump set off the speculation a week ago, shortly after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president, when he told the business cable network CNBC that his months-old tax plan was just a starting point for a final deal. As for his plan's tilt toward the rich and corporations, Mr. Trump said, 'I am not necessarily a huge fan of that,' adding, 'I am so much more into the middle class, who have just been absolutely forgotten in our country.' Since then, he has vacillated on his intentions - repeatedly saying wealthy individuals and businesses would pay more taxes if he were president, and then clarifying that he means the richest taxpayers would pay more than under his original tax-cuts plan, but less than under current law." [New York Times, 5/12/16<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/us/politics/donald-trump-wont-alter-tax-plan-spokeswoman-says-as-confusion-reigns.html?ref=politics&_r=1>]

April 2016: Kudlow And Moore Met With Trump To Propose Changes To His Tax Plan. "Compounding the confusion, Politico reported on Wednesday that two informal advisers - Larry Kudlow, a CNBC host, and Mr. Moore, an economic commentator - said they were helping Mr. Trump at his request and had proposed changes to slash the plan's cost from $10 trillion in its first decade to $3.8 trillion. They attributed the estimate to the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation... As for Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Moore, Ms. Hicks wrote, 'They do not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign.' In an interview, Mr. Moore said he and Mr. Kudlow met with Mr. Trump a few weeks ago at his Trump Tower office to talk about Mr. Trump's tax plan, which he had outlined last winter. 'We just were asked to look at the plan and to try to make a few revisions to it so that it would be a little less costly,' Mr. Moore said. At Mr. Trump's direction, he said, he and Mr. Kudlow later passed along their proposed tweaks to Sam Clovis, the campaign policy director, who 'said he likes a lot of the ideas.'"

The conversation, which lasted about 15 minutes according to the statement, 'centered on the national security threats facing the United States.'

Trump Said The Big Issue Discussed In His Meetings With Paul Ryan And Congressional Republicans Was Supreme Court Justices. HANNITY: "Maybe it's me and maybe I'm a little cynical here. What does he want to know, that -- why is this so hard for him to say, yes, I agree with him on all of those issues right there, and Hillary Clinton is on the other side? I don't understand why that's so hard." TRUMP: "Well, I think a big thing today was the judges, you know, the justices, the Supreme Court. And I think that they felt very good about it. I had this idea a couple of months ago because I was getting a little bit of pushback from some great people and some great friends of mine that are in Congress, and they were telling me that, you know, How can we feel a little bit better? And I came up with this idea that I would come up with a list of really, really terrific acceptable judges, conservative, and I'll put that list forward, and that'll be a list from which I'll choose or at least a list -- at a minimum, a list from which I'll sort of use as a guide. And I'll tell you, that went a long way. People really liked that idea a lot." [Hannity, Fox News, 5/12/16]

Trump Accused Jeff Bezos Of Using The Washington Post "As A Tool Of Political Power" Against Him And Other Politicians To Maintain Amazons Tax And Business Advantages: "He's Using The Washington Post For Power So That The Politicians In Washington Don't Tax Amazon Like They Should Be Taxed."  TRUMP: "Yes. It's interesting that you say that because every hour, we're getting calls from reporters from The Washington Post asking ridiculous questions. And I will tell you, this is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos, who controls Amazon. Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He's using The Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed. He's getting absolutely away. He's worried about me and he -- I think he said to somebody. It was in some article, where he thinks I would go after him for anti-trust because he's got a huge anti-trust problem because he's controlling so much. Amazon is controlling so much of what they're doing. And what they've done is he bought this paper for practically nothing, and he's using that as a tool of political power against me and against other people. And I'll tell you what. We can't let him get away with it. So he's got about 20, 25. I just heard they're taking these really bad stories. I mean, they're, you know, wrong. I don't even say bad. They're wrong. And in many cases, they have no proper information. And they're putting them together. They're slopping them together and they're going to do a book. And the book is going to be all false stuff because the stories are so wrong. And the reporters, I mean, one after another -- so what they're doing is he's using that as a political instrument to try and stop anti- trust, which he thinks I believe he's anti-trust, in other words, what he's got is a monopoly.

In The 1970s To 1990s, Trump Masqueraded As "John Miller" Or "John Barron" Pretending To Be Trump's Spokesman. "A recording obtained by The Washington Post captures what New York reporters and editors who covered Trump's early career experienced in the 1970s, '80s and '90s: calls from Trump's Manhattan office that resulted in conversations with 'John Miller' or 'John Barron' - public-relations men who sound precisely like Trump himself - who indeed are Trump, masquerading as an unusually helpful and boastful advocate for himself, according to the journalists and several of Trump's top aides. In 1991, Sue Carswell, a reporter at People magazine, called Trump's office seeking an interview with the developer. She had just been assigned to cover the soap opera surrounding the end of Trump's 12-year marriage to Ivana, his budding relationship with the model Marla Maples and his rumored affairs with any number of celebrities who regularly appeared on the gossip pages of the New York newspapers. Within five minutes, Carswell got a return call from Trump's publicist, a man named John Miller, who immediately jumped into a startlingly frank and detailed explanation of why Trump dumped Maples for the Italian model Carla Bruni.

Hillary Clinton

Trump Said Hillary Clinton Was "Not A Closer" Because She Had Not Secured The Democratic Nomination: "She's Not A Closer Here. She Wasn't A Closer Last Time. She's Not A Closer With The Chinese For Trade Deals. She's Not Going To Be A Closer With ISIS." HANNITY: "Nearly half of Bernie Sanders West Virginia voters say they will vote for you instead of Hillary. Hillary has warned her donors -- literally, they sent out an e-mail the other night saying even if Bernie runs the table on the remaining states, the corrupt system of superdelegates gives it to Hillary. So she's doing very, very poorly here. I'll give you an example. Back in 2008, when she ran in West Virginia, she had 240,000 votes. She got less than 85,000. What do you make of how she can't close out this nomination on her side?" TRUMP: "She's not a closer here. She wasn't a closer last time. She's not a closer with the Chinese for trade deals. She's not going to be a closer with ISIS. She destroyed -- she really hurt us with Libya. That's Benghazi. Not only that, ISIS has the oil. Now. They've gone and taken the oil. Libya was her baby, and that was a disaster. I mean, what she's done has been a disaster. She's not a closer. You know, the bottom line, whether it's the election or whether it's the election against Obama, you know, in terms of the primaries, she's just not a closer. This is not a woman that would be -- that should be president. We have so much work to do. I don't think she has the energy to be president. I don't think she can do it."

Minimum Wage

Trump Said He Would Give The Determination On The Minimum Wage To The States, And Make States Compete Against Each Other. HANNITY: "Let's talk -- some issues came up this week about -- in the last week-and-a-half, some ambiguity on issues of minimum wage, raising taxes, whether or not you were softening your stance about bringing refugees into the country. So let's clarify. Minimum wage." TRUMP: "OK, let me just tell you, the only thing I am talking about a little bit is I want -- I like the idea of the states looking at minimum wage because if they don't -- you know, New York is totally different than if you go to Alabama or Arkansas, so many places that I love. They voted for me. I love them all. And -- but you're talking about a whole different, you know, cost of living. So what's good for New York is not necessarily good for someplace else. New York is very expensive to live in, and I could see having more in New York and less in other places. And yet your standard of living might be better in Alabama or, as I said, Arkansas and other places than it would be in New York, even though New York would have a higher minimum wage. So I really like giving it to states to determine. Plus, they have to compete with each other among, you know, other things, but they have to compete with each other. So I like the concept of giving it to states. And in some states, where it's more expensive, maybe they do have to lift the minimum wage, and in others, they don't have to do it. And those people live very well. So that's the way it is. Now, they also have to compete with each other in business. So I really like the idea because it's so different -- you know, it's a big country -- it's so different and the cost of living is so different, I like letting the states set the minimum wage."

Supreme Court

I had this idea a couple of months ago because I was getting a little bit of pushback from some great people and some great friends of mine that are in Congress, and they were telling me that, you know, How can we feel a little bit better? And I came up with this idea that I would come up with a list of really, really terrific acceptable judges, conservative, and I'll put that list forward, and that'll be a list from which I'll choose or at least a list -- at a minimum, a list from which I'll sort of use as a guide.

This character who I refer to as zero (0) should have been taken out by our military and shot as an enemy agent in his first term !!!!!" Senecal said in one post on Wednesday, which was visible only to his Facebook friends but was published by Mother Jones. 'Instead he still remains in office doing every thing he can to gut the America we all know and love !!!!!' In other posts, Senecal called for a 'second American revolution,' reflected Trump's birther arguments in 2011 and referred to Obama a 'Kenyan fraud.'"

Trump Touted The Grand Hyatt As Evidence Of Self-Made Success Even Though The Deal Was Only Done With The Help Of His Father.  "The point of Trump's speech at the Republican gala was not to tout the present state of the Grand Hyatt, which he no longer owns, but to buff the legend he peddles of himself as an underdog success story-as a self-made tycoon who disproved the haters and remade the Manhattan skyline in his image. 'When I did the building, everybody said, 'Don't do it, it can't be done, never gonna happen,''  Trump said. 'My father, who was in Brooklyn and Queens ... was so against me coming into Manhattan. And then this became so successful, and he said, 'Wow.' 'Of course, in New York, real estate is politics. And few real estate deals in New York history were as laden with back-room negotiations as the one that permitted the renovation of a hulking commuter hotel into a luxe four-star affair. Wedged between the Beaux Arts Grand Central Terminal and the art deco Chrysler Building, the Grand Hyatt stands as a curious and very Trumpian amalgam: a turn-of-the-century brick building blanketed by sheets of mirrored, '80s-era glass. It could have been airlifted from Dallas. 'When he wanted to glaze the building, I put up a big battle-I was more interested in preserving the building,' the project's architect, Ralph Steinglass, told me recently. 'Trump sold [Hyatt] on the fact that he would be able to refashion the building, really recreate it into a bright, shiny object.' In truth, Fred C. Trump wasn't an obstacle to the deal. He was the main reason the deal got done at all." [Politico Magazine, 5/12/16<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888?o=0>]

Donald Trump Never Would Have Gotten His Career Off The Ground Without The Cash And Connections Of His Father, Fred C. Trump. "In truth, Fred C. Trump wasn't an obstacle to the deal. He was the main reason the deal got done at all. Fred Trump has surfaced periodically as a point of political contention. Donald's erstwhile Republican opponents accused him of inheriting upward of $200 million. This overinflated figure is about as misleading as Trump's claim that all he ever received from dad was a 'small' million-dollar loan. In determining Fred Trump's influence on his son's success, though, the exact numerical figure is at best a distraction. The Grand Hyatt represented Donald's entry into Manhattan, and to pull it off, Donald relied not only on his father's cash, but his connections-and this is not a Trumpian exaggeration-to some of the most powerful politicians, lawyers and bankers in New York. A decade later, when Donald's boardwalk empire in Atlantic City was underwater and the Grand Hyatt was looking un-Grand, Donald again needed Fred's resources to bail him out. The inside story of the Grand Hyatt doesn't showcase the vaunted business sense Trump credits with leading him to the threshold of the GOP presidential nomination. Rather, it reveals the crucial role Fred Trump played in getting his son's career off the ground, and keeping it airborne. Without Fred's help, there would be no Hyatt. And without the Hyatt, there would be no Trump Tower, no casinos, no golf courses, no career." [Politico Magazine, 5/12/16<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888?o=0>]

Fred C. Trump's Real Estate Career Was Entirely Contingent On Government Subsidies From The Federal Housing Authority. "Fred Trump was a builder of middle-class, outer-borough homes, and nearly every major project he developed-from single-family houses in East Flatbush to Trump Village in Coney Island-was subsidized by tax dollars. Without the Federal Housing Authority, Trump family biographer Gwenda Blair wrote, 'Fred Trump would have been running a supermarket.' Fred Trump's biggest contracts came from the federal government, but his political clout was more pronounced at home. He lunched with a downtown Brooklyn power-crowd known as the 'Knights of the Round Table' and was a VIP at the Madison Democratic Club, the nerve-center of Brooklyn politics. Early on, he became close with legendary real estate lawyer and political fixer Bunny Lindenbaum, along with Lindenbaum's best friend, a machine pol named Abe Beame, who in 1974 would become mayor of New York. Both would prove instrumental in his son's early career." [Politico Magazine, 5/12/16<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888?o=0>]

Donald Trump's Early Real Estate Deals Were Made Possible By Tax Abatements, Secured With The Help Of His Father Fred. "In late 1973, needing the city's assistance with another property, Trump scheduled a meeting at City Hall that included his father and Beame. A few minutes into the meeting, according to Blair's biography, Beame put his arms around the Trumps and said, 'Whatever my friends Fred and Donald want in this town, they get.' A similar dynamic was at work several months later, when Donald began agitating for the Commodore property. Inspired in part by Donald's ambitions, Beame and Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut-another old friend of Fred Trump's-pushed a bill in Albany that, conveniently, would have created 20-year tax abatements for commercial properties like the one Trump was trying to develop. When that bill stalled and ultimately died upstate, Donald Trump worked with a well-connected City Hall bureaucrat named Mike Bailkin to create an even more favorable deal for himself. Bailkin's ingenious idea was for the state-run Urban Development Corporation (UDC)-created in the 1960s by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to develop racially integrated housing by fiat-to buy the place from Trump for a nominal fee of a dollar, then lease it back to him tax-free for 40 years, saving him hundreds of millions of dollars." [Politico Magazine, 5/12/16<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888?o=0>]

Donald Trump Was Only Able To Make The Hyatt Deal After His Father Promised To "Provide Financial Credibility."  "Trump, by inheriting several of his father's best people-longtime New York publicist Howard Rubenstein; Brooklyn lawyer Lindenbaum and his son Sandy, Lindenbaum's equal as a real estate savant-inherited his father's credibility. And Donald certainly cultivated a handful of key contacts himself-most notably Roy Cohn, the political fixer and notorious legal hit man for red-baiting Senator Joe McCarthy. Cohn represented the Trump Organization in a massive federal housing discrimination case, before helping broker the Hyatt deal with Beame, with whom he was also friendly. But nothing could match the persuasive power of Fred in the flesh. In 1975, after talks about the tax deal started to get serious, another meeting was called at which both Mayor Beame and Fred Trump would personally appear. According to Wayne Barrett's exhaustive book Trump: The Deals and the Downfall, Fred promised the group he would keep watch over the construction. More significantly, he pledged to 'provide financial credibility.'" [Politico Magazine, 5/12/16<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888?o=0>]

Donald Trump's 1976 Construction Loan For The Grand Hyatt Was Guaranteed By His Father Fred, And Fred Trump Later Convinced His Friends At Chase Bank To Give Donald Additional Financing To Cover Cost Overruns. "By 1976, the $4-million-a-year abatement (it would grow progressively more valuable) was his. But even once he got the tax break, Trump still needed actual money to buy and renovate the thing. His financial broker went hunting for lenders on Wall Street and had come up empty. Fred Trump, once again, wound up doing the heavy lifting. There was of course the famous million-dollar loan. But there was also Fred's decades-old contact at Equitable Life Insurance, whose support Barrett reports was key to the firm's decision to help finance the project. And it was Fred Trump and Hyatt chief Jay Pritzker, not Donald, who guaranteed the project's $70 million construction loan. (Donald and the Pritzkers would co-own the hotel.) When the project ran over budget in the run-up to its 1980 opening, according to Gwenda Blair's biography, it was Fred who persuaded his pals at Chase Bank to give Donald a $35 million line of credit and a second mortgage worth $30 million. 'When it counted, which was when they went for the financing,' says Palmieri, 'his father turned up to be on the loans, which was really the vital part of the whole deal.' Donald may have conceived of the deal, but when it came to closing it, Ralph Steinglass told me, Donald 'had very little to do with pulling it off.'"

Trump Was Unable To Afford Necessary Maintenance On The Grand Hyatt In The Wake Of His 1991 Bankruptcy And Financial Missteps In The Construction Of The Trump Taj Majal. "At the heart of the problem was Trump's cratering casino empire. After a series of financial missteps connected to the bloated $1 billion, junk-bond-funded construction of the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump's third and largest Atlantic City property, Trump declared bankruptcy in 1991 on several casinos and the Plaza Hotel in New York, which he also then owned. His net worth plunged into the red. In 1993, in the midst of their ongoing dispute over Trump's unpaid share of the growing maintenance bill for the Grand Hyatt, Donald sued the Pritzkers, alleging financial mismanagement. A year later, the Pritzkers sued back for $100 million. In their complaint, they alleged that Trump agreed in the late 1980s that repairs were necessary, before deciding they weren't because he was 'not in a financial position' to afford them. They were suing him for being broke, and, what's more, for purposely refusing to spiff up the hotel in order to extract financial concessions from them. Trump, for his part, found the whole ordeal unjust.

Donald Trump Avoided Total Financial Collapse When His Father Bailed Out His Casino With An Illegal $3.5 Million Loan, Allowing Trump To Eventually Settle His Lawsuit With The Pritzkers Over His Neglected Maintenance Of The Grand Hyatt. "His net worth plunged into the red. In 1993, in the midst of their ongoing dispute over Trump's unpaid share of the growing maintenance bill for the Grand Hyatt, Donald sued the Pritzkers, alleging financial mismanagement. A year later, the Pritzkers sued back for $100 million. In their complaint, they alleged that Trump agreed in the late 1980s that repairs were necessary, before deciding they weren't because he was 'not in a financial position' to afford them. They were suing him for being broke, and, what's more, for purposely refusing to spiff up the hotel in order to extract financial concessions from them. Trump, for his part, found the whole ordeal unjust.

Committee For American Sovereignty Expected To Raise Over $100 Million In Support Of Trump's Presidential Bid. "As presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump shifts his campaign to the general election, at least one super PAC is getting on board too. A brand new pro-Trump super PAC launched today, touting its ability to take on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton through a major donor operation focused on funding voter registration programs, get-out-the-vote operations, and television and online media ad buys. Representatives for the group, called the Committee for American Sovereignty, say they expect to raise $20 million between now and the GOP convention in July and upwards of $100 million throughout the course of the campaign. Doug Watts, national executive director and spokesman for the group, who also served as a former adviser to Ben Carson, told ABC News that the group's mission is to combat the 'Clinton machine.' 'With the recent announcement that a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC has already booked over $90 million in ad time in just seven states in June, it is clear we need to ramp up major donor fundraising efforts, unify Republicans, and take on the Clinton machine. We have already begun to raise significant funds in California and from supporters across the country,' Watts said."

Pro-Trump Super PAC, Committee For American Sovereignty, Was Supported By Former CA State Senator Tony Strickland, Venture Capitalist Ken Abramowitz, Investor Nick Loeb,  California Businessman Tim Yale, California GOP Chairman Shawn Steel, Eagle Forum Founder Phyllis Schlafly And Retired Navy Admiral James A. Lyons, Jr. "A group of veteran Republican party leaders and wealthy allies of Donald Trump are launching a new super PAC to bolster his efforts to win the White House, aiming to raise $20 million before the national convention in July. The new group, called the Committee for American Sovereignty, was started by a group of Trump supporters in California, including former state senator Tony Strickland, who will serve as the super PAC's chairman. GOP strategist Doug Watts, who most recently worked for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson's presidential bid, has signed on to be the national executive director. Already, the organization has attracted a list of major donors and party fundraisers including venture capitalist Ken Abramowitz, investor Nick Loeb and California businessman Tim Yale.

The Involvement Of Former Trump Hotel, Casino And Resorts Chairman, Nicholas Ribis Sr., In Committee For American Sovereignty, Was A Sign Of The Super PAC's Blessing By Trump's Inner Circle. "Perhaps most significant is the participation of Nicholas Ribis Sr., the former chairman of Trump Hotel, Casino and Resorts, which will likely be read as a sign that Trump's circle has blessed the undertaking. The roll-out of the group shows that Trump's new rhetoric about super PACs has been interpreted as a change in his posture toward such group. Throughout the primaries, he bashed his rivals for relying on super PACs for support."

HEADLINE: "Donald Trump's Money Man Schmoozes With Billionaire Donors." [Yahoo News, 5/12/16<http://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-guy-is-the-new-royalty-among-hedge-fund-honchos-162444227.html?soc_src=mail&soc_trk=ma>]

Trump Finance Chairman, Steve Mnuchin, Met With Potential Financial Industry Donors At The SALT Conference In Las Vegas. "Steve Mnuchin sat quietly at the end of a long table, in a dark suit with no tie, chatting quietly with a parade of financiers who stopped by. Mnuchin wasn't on the speaking agenda at SALT, but he suddenly had a more important gig - finance chairman for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign. That new role may explain why Mnuchin was at SALT in the first place. Trump has mostly self-funded his campaign so far, with individual donors contributing about one-fourth of the $48 million Trump has spent. And Trump has had no super PAC able to raise unlimited funds from wealthy donors to spend on his behalf, or on negative advertising aimed at an opponent. But Trump will need way more money to run a competitive campaign in the general election - possibly $500 million to $1 billion. That's why Trump has said he'll accept outside financing - and appointed Mnuchin to oversee that. 'He's a very accomplished guy,' says Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge Capital, which organizes the SALT conference every year. 'He's an entrepreneur, built a fund, he was a partner at a big investment bank. This is the kind of guy you can recruit into a Trump administration.' Mnuchin is a former partner at Goldman Sachs (GS) who has run his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management, since 2004. His father, Robert Mnuchin, was head of stock trading at Goldman, and is now a well-regarded art dealer. So the younger Mnuchin, while not as well-known as financial titans like Jamie Dimon or Bill Ackman or Ken Griffin, clearly knows his way around Wall Street." [Yahoo News, 5/12/16<http://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-guy-is-the-new-royalty-among-hedge-fund-honchos-162444227.html?soc_src=mail&soc_trk=ma>]

Trump Finance Team Member, Anthony Scaramucci: "You've got to get enough money to get the opportunity to win."  "Many in the finance industry are still puzzling over Trump, who has criticized hedge-fund managers for 'getting away with murder' on account of low tax rates, and proposed free-trade restrictions that could severely hurt the bottom line of many big companies. But there's no other candidate for big donors to give to, other than Hillary Clinton. And so far, big donors have given $400 million to Republican candidates who flamed out. There's more where that came from, and Trump will likely grab some Wall Street money - especially since he's now setting up his own super PAC. Scaramucci says he'll work with Mnuchin to set up the nationwide fundraising effort Trump will need to take on the Democratic nominee, most likely Clinton, state-by-state. 'You've got to get enough money to get the opportunity to win,' Scaramucci says. 'You need the money to power that up.' Scaramucci backed Scott Walker and Jeb Bush earlier in the campaign, but says Trump is his guy now. A bunch of his hedge-fun pals may be making the same transition."

 hints that he would change his tax plan to reduce its budget-busting cost and make it less generous to the rich, his spokeswoman on Thursday sought to clear things up: He plans no changes, Hope Hicks said, and advisers who say otherwise do not speak for him.
 One of those advisers, Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation, had his own response: &#8216;I&#8217;m a little bummed out if his spokeswoman says they&#8217;re not going to make any changes to the plan.&#8217; Mr. Trump set off the speculation a week ago, shortly after becoming
 the presumptive Republican nominee for president, when he told the business cable network CNBC that his months-old tax plan was just a starting point for a final deal. As for his plan&#8217;s tilt toward the rich and corporations, Mr. Trump said, &#8216;I am not necessarily
 a huge fan of that,&#8217; adding, &#8216;I am so much more into the middle class, who have just been absolutely forgotten in our country.&#8217; Since then, he has vacillated on his intentions &#8212; repeatedly saying wealthy individuals and businesses would pay more taxes if he
 were president, and then clarifying that he means the richest taxpayers would pay more than under his original tax-cuts plan, but less than under current law.&#8221; [New York Times,

 week about -- in the last week-and-a-half, some ambiguity on issues of minimum wage, raising taxes, whether or not you were softening your stance about bringing refugees into the country. So let's clarify. Minimum wage.&#8221; TRUMP: &#8220;OK, let me just tell you, the
 only thing I am talking about a little bit is I want -- I like the idea of the states looking at minimum wage because if they don't -- you know, New York is totally different than if you go to Alabama or Arkansas, so many places that I love. They voted for
 me. I love them all. And -- but you're talking about a whole different, you know, cost of living. So what's good for New York is not necessarily good for someplace else. New York is very expensive to live in, and I could see having more in New York and less
 in other places. And yet your standard of living might be better in Alabama or, as I said, Arkansas and other places than it would be in New York, even though New York would have a higher minimum wage. So I really like giving it to states to determine. Plus,
 they have to compete with each other among, you know, other things, but they have to compete with each other. So I like the concept of giving it to states. And in some states, where it's more expensive, maybe they do have to lift the minimum wage, and in others,
 they don't have to do it. And those people live very well. So that's the way it is. Now, they also have to compete with each other in business. So I really like the idea because it's so different -- you know, it's a big country -- it's so different and the
 cost of living is so different, I like letting the states set the minimum wage.&#8221; [Hannity, Fox News, 5/12/16]

 gala was not to tout the present state of the Grand Hyatt, which he no longer owns, but to buff the legend he peddles of himself as an underdog success story&#8212;as a self-made tycoon who disproved the haters and remade the Manhattan skyline in his image. &#8216;When
 I did the building, everybody said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t do it, it can&#8217;t be done, never gonna happen,'&#8217;&nbsp; Trump said. &#8216;My father, who was in Brooklyn and Queens &#8230; was so against me coming into Manhattan. And then this became so successful, and he said, &#8216;Wow.&#8217; &#8216;Of course,
 in New York, real estate is politics. And few real estate deals in New York history were as laden with back-room negotiations as the one that permitted the renovation of a hulking commuter hotel into a luxe four-star affair. Wedged between the Beaux Arts Grand
 Central Terminal and the art deco Chrysler Building, the Grand Hyatt stands as a curious and very Trumpian amalgam: a turn-of-the-century brick building blanketed by sheets of mirrored, &#8216;80s-era glass. It could have been airlifted from Dallas. &#8216;When he wanted
 to glaze the building, I put up a big battle&#8212;I was more interested in preserving the building,&#8217; the project&#8217;s architect, Ralph Steinglass, told me recently. &#8216;Trump sold [Hyatt] on the fact that he would be able to refashion the building, really recreate it
 into a bright, shiny object.&#8217; In truth, Fred C. Trump wasn&#8217;t an obstacle to the deal. He was the main reason the deal got done at all.&#8221; [Politico Magazine,

</span></b><span style="color:black">&#8220;In truth, Fred C. Trump wasn&#8217;t an obstacle to the deal. He was the main reason the deal got done at all. Fred Trump has surfaced periodically as a point of political contention. Donald&#8217;s erstwhile Republican opponents accused
 him of inheriting upward of $200 million. This overinflated figure is about as misleading as Trump&#8217;s claim that all he ever received from dad was a &#8216;small&#8217; million-dollar loan. In determining Fred Trump&#8217;s influence on his son&#8217;s success, though, the exact numerical
 figure is at best a distraction. The Grand Hyatt represented Donald&#8217;s entry into Manhattan, and to pull it off, Donald relied not only on his father&#8217;s cash, but his connections&#8212;and this is not a Trumpian exaggeration&#8212;to some of the most powerful politicians,
 lawyers and bankers in New York. A decade later, when Donald&#8217;s boardwalk empire in Atlantic City was underwater and the Grand Hyatt was looking un-Grand, Donald again needed Fred&#8217;s resources to bail him out. The inside story of the Grand Hyatt doesn&#8217;t showcase
 the vaunted business sense Trump credits with leading him to the threshold of the GOP presidential nomination. Rather, it reveals the crucial role Fred Trump played in getting his son&#8217;s career off the ground, and keeping it airborne. Without Fred&#8217;s help, there
 would be no Hyatt. And without the Hyatt, there would be no Trump Tower, no casinos, no golf courses, no career.&#8221; [Politico Magazine,

 homes, and nearly every major project he developed&#8212;from single-family houses in East Flatbush to Trump Village in Coney Island&#8212;was subsidized by tax dollars. Without the Federal Housing Authority, Trump family biographer Gwenda Blair wrote, &#8216;Fred Trump would
 have been running a supermarket.&#8217; Fred Trump&#8217;s biggest contracts came from the federal government, but his political clout was more pronounced at home. He lunched with a downtown Brooklyn power-crowd known as the &#8216;Knights of the Round Table&#8217; and was a VIP
 at the Madison Democratic Club, the nerve-center of Brooklyn politics. Early on, he became close with legendary real estate lawyer and political fixer Bunny Lindenbaum, along with Lindenbaum&#8217;s best friend, a machine pol named Abe Beame, who in 1974 would become
 mayor of New York. Both would prove instrumental in his son&#8217;s early career.&#8221; [Politico Magazine,

 property, Trump scheduled a meeting at City Hall that included his father and Beame. A few minutes into the meeting, according to Blair&#8217;s biography, Beame put his arms around the Trumps and said, &#8216;Whatever my friends Fred and Donald want in this town, they
 get.&#8217; A similar dynamic was at work several months later, when Donald began agitating for the Commodore property. Inspired in part by Donald&#8217;s ambitions, Beame and Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut&#8212;another old friend of Fred Trump&#8217;s&#8212;pushed a bill in Albany
 that, conveniently, would have created 20-year tax abatements for commercial properties like the one Trump was trying to develop. When that bill stalled and ultimately died upstate, Donald Trump worked with a well-connected City Hall bureaucrat named Mike
 Bailkin to create an even more favorable deal for himself. Bailkin&#8217;s ingenious idea was for the state-run Urban Development Corporation (UDC)&#8212;created in the 1960s by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to develop racially integrated housing by fiat&#8212;to buy the place
 from Trump for a nominal fee of a dollar, then lease it back to him tax-free for 40 years, saving him hundreds of millions of dollars.&#8221; [Politico Magazine,

 And Donald certainly cultivated a handful of key contacts himself&#8212;most notably Roy Cohn, the political fixer and notorious legal hit man for red-baiting Senator Joe McCarthy. Cohn represented the Trump Organization in a massive federal housing discrimination
 case, before helping broker the Hyatt deal with Beame, with whom he was also friendly. But nothing could match the persuasive power of Fred in the flesh. In 1975, after talks about the tax deal started to get serious, another meeting was called at which both
 Mayor Beame and Fred Trump would personally appear. According to Wayne Barrett&#8217;s exhaustive book Trump: The Deals and the Downfall, Fred promised the group he would keep watch over the construction. More significantly, he pledged to &#8216;provide financial credibility.&#8217;&#8221;

 Barrett reports was key to the firm&#8217;s decision to help finance the project. And it was Fred Trump and Hyatt chief Jay Pritzker, not Donald, who guaranteed the project&#8217;s $70 million construction loan. (Donald and the Pritzkers would co-own the hotel.) When
 the project ran over budget in the run-up to its 1980 opening, according to Gwenda Blair&#8217;s biography, it was Fred who persuaded his pals at Chase Bank to give Donald a $35 million line of credit and a second mortgage worth $30 million. &#8216;When it counted, which
 was when they went for the financing,&#8217; says Palmieri, &#8216;his father turned up to be on the loans, which was really the vital part of the whole deal.&#8217; Donald may have conceived of the deal, but when it came to closing it, Ralph Steinglass told me, Donald &#8216;had

 in a dark suit with no tie, chatting quietly with a parade of financiers who stopped by. Mnuchin wasn&#8217;t on the speaking agenda at SALT, but he suddenly had a more important gig &#8211; finance chairman for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign.
 That new role may explain why Mnuchin was at SALT in the first place. Trump has mostly self-funded his campaign so far, with individual donors contributing about one-fourth of the $48 million Trump has spent. And Trump has had no super PAC able to raise unlimited
 funds from wealthy donors to spend on his behalf, or on negative advertising aimed at an opponent. But Trump will need way more money to run a competitive campaign in the general election &#8211; possibly $500 million to $1 billion. That&#8217;s why Trump has said he&#8217;ll
 accept outside financing &#8211; and appointed Mnuchin to oversee that. &#8216;He's a very accomplished guy,&#8217; says Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge Capital, which organizes the SALT conference every year. &#8216;He's an entrepreneur, built a fund, he was a partner at
 a big investment bank. This is the kind of guy you can recruit into a Trump administration.&#8217; Mnuchin is a former partner at Goldman Sachs (GS) who has run his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management, since 2004. His father, Robert Mnuchin, was head of stock
 trading at Goldman, and is now a well-regarded art dealer. So the younger Mnuchin, while not as well-known as financial titans like Jamie Dimon or Bill Ackman or Ken Griffin, clearly knows his way around Wall Street.&#8221; [Yahoo News,

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="color:black">Trump Finance Team Member, Anthony Scaramucci: &#8220;You've got to get enough money to get the opportunity to win.&#8221;&nbsp;
</span></b><span style="color:black">&#8220;Many in the finance industry are still puzzling over Trump, who has criticized hedge-fund managers for &#8216;getting away with murder&#8217; on account of low tax rates, and proposed free-trade restrictions that could severely hurt
 the bottom line of many big companies. But there&#8217;s no other candidate for big donors to give to, other than Hillary Clinton. And so far, big donors have given $400 million to Republican candidates who flamed out. There&#8217;s more where that came from, and Trump
 will likely grab some Wall Street money &#8211; especially since he's now setting up his own super PAC. Scaramucci says he'll work with Mnuchin to set up the nationwide fundraising effort Trump will need to take on the Democratic nominee, most likely Clinton, state-by-state.
 &#8216;You've got to get enough money to get the opportunity to win,&#8217; Scaramucci says. &#8216;You need the money to power that up.&#8217; Scaramucci backed Scott Walker and Jeb Bush earlier in the campaign, but says Trump is his guy now. A bunch of his hedge-fun pals may be
 making the same transition.&#8221; [Yahoo News, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-guy-is-the-new-royalty-among-hedge-fund-honchos-162444227.html?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma">
