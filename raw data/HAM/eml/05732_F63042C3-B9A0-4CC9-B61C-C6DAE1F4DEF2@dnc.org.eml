I like it.

I'd do less of our own analysis at the bottom and let POTUS' words stand mo=

Subject: Obama comments on Muslim fearmongering during OBL raid

SL: WATCH: President Obama Delivers Rebuke of Anti-Muslim Fearmongering whi=
le Commemorating Raid that Killed Osama Bin Laden

Body: Last night, while commemorating the 5th anniversary of the raid that =
killed Osama Bin Laden, President Obama delivered a rebuke of the dangerous=
 anti-Muslim fearmongering that has defined the GOP presidential race.

VIDEO

=93I do think it is important for us to understand the nature of the threat=
; what works and what doesn=92t. Painting the Muslim community with a broad=
 brush does not work. They are the greatest allies in fighting against the =
organizations=85Most importantly, we have to stay true to our values during=
 the process. We have to make sure that we are not engaging in the kind of =
the knee-jerk anti-Muslim sentiment that we have heard from some politician=
s. We have to make sure that the legal structures around our intelligence g=
athering and our use of predators are subject to oversight. It is not alway=
s going to be easy. It is not always going to be perfectly smooth. There ar=
e going to be times where as president you make a decision knowing that the=
re are going to be critics, and knowing that there's some gray areas, and a=
mbiguities that you have to deal with given the realities of the situation,=
 but overall, I think that we can draw a lesson from the Bin Laden raid tha=
t we have got really effective people and a government that knows how to do=
 this. As long as we operate from the position of confidence and strength a=
nd are true to who we are, groups like this or the individuals like this ca=
nnot defeat us.=94

President Obama is correct. Success in combating terror requires strong rel=
ationships with our Muslim allies in the Middle East and Muslims in the Uni=
ted States who are often the first line of defense against terror attacks. =
In fact, taking out Osama Bin Laden depended on those relationships with Mu=
slims in Afghanistan and Pakistan who provided intelligence to U.S. officia=
ls.

Trump=92s absurd proposal to ban Muslims from the United States, along with=
 his other dangerous, half-baked proposals and foreign policy cluelessness,=
 has alarmed our allies throughout the world =96 including leaders in the M=
iddle East who are our partners in fighting terror.

Not to be outdone, Ted Cruz has called for =93carpet bombing=94 the Middle =
East with no regard to civilian lives, and would authorize law enforcement =
to =93patrol and secure=94 neighborhoods where Muslim-Americans live, a dan=
gerous and discriminatory policy that resembles the political witch hunts o=
f the McCarthy era.

Being true to our values is not only the right thing to do, it keeps Americ=
ans safer. Period.
