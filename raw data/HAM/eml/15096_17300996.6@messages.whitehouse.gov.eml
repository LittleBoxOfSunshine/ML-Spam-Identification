Subject: In town pool report #3

At 4:20pm in the East Room, teachers began walking onto a stage, saying t=
he state they were from to loud whoops from the crowd. All 50 states, DC,=
 and the territories were represented standing on risers.

The crowd included educators from around the country, as well as US Senat=
or Chris Murphy (who is from Connecticut, the same state as the national =
teacher of the year)

Before the event, the crowd was twice told,
"As a reminder, keep cell phones and cameras down." They laughed. And whe=
n the event started, no one, it seems, kept their cell phones down.

The ceremony began with the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, Jahana Hay=
es of Connecticut, urging the room to do better for kids and to hire more=
 minority educators before emotionally introducing POTUS.

"There are few events that make me prouder," he said at the start.  "It's=
 a good day, with all of you here in Washington, to say thank you."

"It's also," he cracked, "a pretty good day for substitute teachers!"

He spoke for 20 minutes, giving a warm tribute to Hayes, and all teachers=
 (check with transcript).

"This is a profession where you will have more influence than any other,"=
 POTUS said.

"Say it again!" a man yelled. POTUS did.

He closed by mentioning a teacher from central Virginia who wrote him a l=
etter saying no one in his classroom wanted to be a teacher.

"This is the gods honest truth," POTUS said, channeling VPOTUS. If his da=
ughters told him they wanted to become a teacher, he would be proud and s=
upportive.

He then presented Hayes with a crystal apple.

POTUS took a group photo, exchanged a few "I love you-I love you back"s w=
ith the teachers, and then shook hands.

Shortly after 5pm, he was gone.
