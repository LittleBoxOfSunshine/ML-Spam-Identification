Donna,

Even though your Tigers have owned my Gators over the past few years, I'm a
long-time admirer of yours. Luis and Tracie, thank you for setting this up.

Taylor Wofford is a reporter with Newsweek. He is working on a piece about
Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz. He has been asking questions prompted by
many of the "off-the-record" critics of the Congresswoman. He says he's
looking to get a sense of who she is by speaking with people who know her
best. He has spoken to ex-staffers but he's looking for someone who DWS
turns to for advice. Someone who's opinion she trusts.

In speaking with the Congresswoman, she praised you and said she values
your opinion.

We would like to help this reporter get as many positive comments on the
record about the Congresswoman as possible to counter any negatives being
drummed up by her opponents and critics. Are you available to speak with
him? If so, would you like to phone him or would you like me to have him
phone you?

Thanks for all your help,

Ryan
