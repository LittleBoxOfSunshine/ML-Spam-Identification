I have something the 7th I could bail on, but would rather not.  June 9 I
may have to be in DC.  This is getting difficult!

Maybe we should have the first one at my apartment -- combining host and
pitchman makes it a little easier to get their two schedules to mesh. <grin>
If I can get a date from David Hyde Pierce tonight, I'll let you know.

I'm in SF the week after Memorial Day.
How about June 7 or 9 at our apt? Maybe, to Andy's point, we could hold a
second event that week. We could focus on women and engageing them.
We'd need a third event in NYC.
I'll send David Von Storch an email about hosting an event in DC.

Good morning guys:

I'm sorry I wasn't able to join you last week for the latest call.

June 1st is workable, but as its only two weeks from today, I'll encourage
that we consider dates starting on the 8th, with a commitment from staff
that an invite is ready for approval on 5/17 (tomorrow).

Also, do we know of staff have a vetted invitation list (email addresses)
ready to us for distribution of invites?

Best,
Rod
