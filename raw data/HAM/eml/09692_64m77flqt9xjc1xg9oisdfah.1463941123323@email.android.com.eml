Statement by Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Senator Sanders endorsement of her primary campaign opponent

"I am so proud to serve the people of Florida's 23rd district and I am confident that they know that I am an effective fighter and advocate on their behalf in Congress.  Even though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent I remain, as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the Presidential Democratic primary. I look forward to working together with him for Democratic victories in the fall."

Luis,
I'm a reporter at the Wall Street Journal. Sorry to bother you on Sunday, but we're doing a story on the Democratic race today that will mention Bernie Sanders' statement that he'd remove Debbie Wasserman Schultz as DNC chair if he becomes president. I just wanted to check if you guys had a comment.
Thank you,
Naftali Bendavid
