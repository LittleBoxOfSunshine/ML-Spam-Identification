Great, thanks! I'll process their WAVES.=20

Feel free to loop me with the best PoC for the group so I can put them in c=
ontact with Kyle to coordinate on Friday. Or, just let them know to meet Ky=
le no later than 7:45pm on Friday at the corner of 17th Street and State Pl=
ace, and to bring valid government-issued IDs for everyone. If you don't wa=
nt to loop me, just let me know an email/cell to pass on to Kyle in case he=
 can't find them.

Thanks, Max. I saw that there are 8 people listed on the ARPS form you sent=
 over -- unfortunately we can only accommodate 6 people max for WW tours. A=
nd we need WAVES (not ARPS) for all 6 -- spreadsheet attached.

Thanks,
Angelica
