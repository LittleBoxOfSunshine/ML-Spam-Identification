RUBIO IS A CHAMPION OF THE WEALTHY, NOT THE MIDDLE CLASS



Rubio opposes policies that make college more affordable, opposes raising t=
he minimum wage, opposes ensuring paid family leave and much more - all whi=
le pushing for extreme tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Under Rubio's=
 plan, Mitt Romney would pay nothing in taxes. Rubio is offering more of th=
e same tired and failed policies.





REPUBLICANS AND TAX EXPERTS AGREE: RUBIO'S TAX PLAN WOULD RAISE RATES ON TH=
E MIDDLE CLASS AND HURTS WORKING FAMILIES



Republicans Argued That Rubio's Tax Plan Could Expose Many Middle-Income Ea=
rners To A Significant Tax Hike. "But not all Republicans are embracing the=
 plan. Some argue that it leaves the top rate far too close to the current =
highest bracket of 39.6 percent. And they note that it would apply the 35 p=
ercent rate to individual incomes as low as $75,000, possibly exposing many=
 middle-income earners to a significant tax hike." [Politico, 4/9/15<http:/=
/www.politico.com/story/2015/04/marco-rubio-tax-plan-challenges-gop-orthodo=
xy-116831.html?hp=3Dt4_r>]



Vox: The Rubio Tax Plan "Amounts To A Tax Increase For Certain Income Segme=
nts" Including Low-Income Individuals And Families. "The current tax code h=
as seven income tax rates for individuals, ranging from 10 percent to 39.6 =
percent. Rubio and Lee reduce that to just two: 15 percent for income below=
 $75,000 (or $150,000 for couples), and 35 percent for all income above tha=
t. That amounts to a tax increase for certain income segments and a cut for=
 others. Roughly speaking, low-income and rich but not super-rich individua=
ls and families lose out while slightly less rich and even richer ones gain=
." [Vox, 3/17/15<http://www.vox.com/2015/3/17/8226915/rubio-lee-tax-plan>]



RUBIO BLOCKED BILLS THAT WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS TO REFINANCE THEIR STUDENT LO=
ANS



6/11/14: Rubio Voted Against Cloture On A Bill That Would Allow Students To=
 Refinance Their Federal Student Loans. "A bill to amend the Higher Educati=
on Act of 1965 to provide for the refinancing of certain Federal student lo=
ans, and for other purposes." [S.2432, Vote 185, 113th Congress, 6/11/14<ht=

*         Rubio Said Senator Warren's Student Loan Bill "Does Nothing To Ad=
dress The Growing Costs Of Higher Education And Puts Taxpayers On The Hook =
For Billions Of Dollars Of Existing Loan Debt." Rubio: "The President is al=
so calling for the Senate to pass Senator Elizabeth Warren's student loan l=
egislation, which does nothing to address the growing costs of higher educa=
tion and puts taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars of existing loa=
n debt. During this week's Senate debate, l look forward to offering altern=
ative higher education reform ideas that will make higher education more af=
fordable and accessible for young Americans." [Press Release, Office of Sen=

RUBIO OPPOSES ENSURING PAID LEAVE FOR FAMILIES



Marco Rubio Voted Against An Amendment To "Establish A Deficit-Neutral Rese=

tablish a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation to allow Americans t=

*         Rubio On Whether Companies Should Provide Paid Leave For Mothers =
Of Newborns: "I Do Not Believe It Should Be Federally Mandated."  MR. SORKI=
N: "Hey, Senator, we've got to go, but real quick, the president earlier th=
is week -- you talk about families -- he proposed that we -- he said we sho=
uld join the rest of the industrialized nations and offer paid leave for mo=
thers of newborns. I want you to wade into the debate." SEN. RUBIO: "Well, =
many countries -- I'm sorry -- many companies already provide that. And if =
a company decides to do that as part of their benefit package" MR. SORKIN: =
"Do you think it should be legislated?" SEN. RUBIO: "I do not believe it sh=
ould be federally mandated." MR. SORKIN: "Do you think it should be state-m=
andated?" SEN. RUBIO: "I think states can decide to do that, because states=
 have to compete with each other for business. But I don't believe there sh=
ould be a federal mandate to that effect." [Squawk Box, CNBC, 6/25/14]



RUBIO: THE IDEA THAT MINIMUM WAGE CREATES UPWARD MOBILITY IS "FRANKLY, QUIT=
E SILLY"



Rubio On The Minimum Wage Creating Upward Mobility: "To Argue That Raising =
The Minimum Wage Is Going To Create Upward Mobility Is, Quite Frankly, Sill=
y."   GWEN IFILL: "Last week on the NewsHour, George Miller, liberal congre=
ssman from California, said that the secret to this, or at least the founda=
tion, is raising the minimum wage. And the president today is signing his e=
xecutive order, which would at least raise the minimum wage to $10.10 for f=
ederal contractors. Is that the foundation of..." RUBIO: "That's certainly =
not the foundation of it. So, I understand they may support that policy ini=
tiative. But to argue that raising the minimum wage is going to create upwa=
rd mobility is, quite frankly, silly. I mean, $10.10 is not the American dr=
eam. The way you're - the best way to look at it is to think about a person=

RUBIO CALLED MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE "A WASTE OF TIME"



Rubio Called The Pursuit Of A Minimum Wage Increase A "Waste Of Time."  SEN=
ATOR MARCO RUBIO: "I just wanted to-- as a practical matter I'm not calling=
 to repeal the minimum wage. I'm not saying to get rid of it as a practical=
 matter. I think it is what it is and we don't-- that's a disruption that w=
e don't need with all so many other disruptions happening. But I will say t=
his, I think that all this focus that the president has on the minimum wage=
 is a cure-all for the, you know, the problems being faced by working Ameri=
cans is not only a waste of time, I think it shows how unserious he really =
is about dealing with the challenges of our time." [Freedom Partners Forum,=

RUBIO'S TAX PLAN IS NOTHING NEW AND A RETURN TO BUSH ECONOMICS AND WOULD HE=
LP THE WEALTHY



Rubio's Tax Plan Was More Lucrative For Wealthy Individuals Who Don't Work,=
 Like The Romneys, Who Would Pay Nothing In Taxes Under His Plan. "But Rubi=
o's plan is actually most lucrative for those who don't have to work for a =
living: those who can get by on so-called 'unearned income'-quarterly stock=
 dividends and capital gains made from selling assets at a profit. Former G=
OP nominee Mitt Romney's 2011 tax return, for example, showed that he and h=
is wife reported a total of $13.7 million in income-none of it coming from =
wages-on which he paid $1.9 million in taxes because of the lower rate on u=
nearned income and their sizable charitable contributions. Had the Rubio pl=
an been law, the Romneys would have owed nothing in taxes." [National Journ=

evenue By $1.7 Trillion - Which Would "Largely Favor The Top 1 Percent Of A=

 the competition with his plan to boost economic growth by slashing taxes o=
