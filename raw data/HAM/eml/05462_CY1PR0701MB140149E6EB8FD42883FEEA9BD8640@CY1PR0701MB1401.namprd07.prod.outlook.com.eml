Today in the fight for a full and functioning Supreme Court: Senate leaders=
hip reaches milestone of obstruction in nomination process, former Oklahoma=
 Senator Tom Coburn says that Garland deserves a vote out of committee, whi=
le Senate Republicans continue to extend their judicial obstructionism to i=
nclude lower court nominees.

Senator Grassley Reaches Milestone in Supreme Court Obstructionism
According to a release by Americans United for Change, today marks the 42nd=
 day Judge Merrick Garland was nominated by the President to replace Justic=
e Scalia. On average<https://public.tableau.com/shared/6JZTHNXKS?:display_c=
ount=3Dno&:showVizHome=3Dno>, U.S. Supreme Court nominees are called before=
 the Senate Judiciary Committee for a hearing inside of 42 days.

Brad Woodhouse, President, Americans United for Change: "Never before has t=
he Senate shut down the entire nomination process around a Supreme Court va=
cancy because it was an election year. Grassley would have us believe that =
Presidents aren't elected for four year terms, but three years and a couple=
 months.  While Senator Grassley clumsily defends his position that the las=
t election didn't matter, the fact is<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/m=
onkey-cage/wp/2016/02/29/one-third-of-all-u-s-presidents-appointed-a-suprem=
e-court-justice-in-an-election-year/> a third of all U.S. presidents appoin=
ted a Supreme Court justice during an election year. The longer there is a =
vacancy in the Supreme Court under Republican intransigence, the more dysfu=
nction and uncertainty it invites for businesses and citizens alike."

Former GOP Senator: Senate Judiciary Committee should do its job and vote o=
n Chief Judge Merrick Garland.
Today, former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn said the Senate Judiciary Committ=
ee should meet with Chief Judge Garland and vote on whether to send his nom=
ination to the full Senate. The New York Times<http://www.nytimes.com/polit=
ics/first-draft/2016/04/27/tom-coburn-ex-senator-says-merrick-garland-shoul=
d-get-a-vote/?_r=3D0> reports:

"Despite once being among the most conservative members of the Senate, Mr. =
Coburn took pride in his ability to work with Democrats. He made it clear W=
ednesday that he believed Republicans were motivated by politics in refusin=
g to consider Mr. Obama's pick to replace the conservative-leaning Justice =
Antonin Scalia, who died in February."

Sen. Coburn (R-OK): ""If I was running things, I'd have had a vote and vote=
 him down...The presidents have a right to have their nominees considered. =
And if it had been a Republican president, I'm sure they'd have been consid=
ering him."

Senate Republican leadership continues to block votes on judicial nominatio=
ns - despite support from fellow Republicans
The Knoxville News Sentinel<http://www.knoxnews.com/news/politics/senate-de=
mocrats-tried-unsuccessfully-to-force-confirmation-vote-for-federal-judicia=
l-nominees-31655-377146621.html> reports:

"U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other Senate Democrats called for a v=
ote on 11 noncontroversial nominees, including some who have been waiting f=
or more than a year. Schumer charged the GOP has unnecessarily delayed the =
votes and has brought the judicial confirmation process to a standstill. Tw=
enty nominees, including [Edward] Stanton, already have won the approval of=
 the Senate Judiciary Committee and are awaiting a final vote on the Senate=
 floor. 'We are urging our colleagues to do their jobs,' Schumer said from =
the Senate floor. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Se=
n. John Cornyn, R-Texas, objected to giving the nominees a vote, thwarting =
the Democrats' efforts."

President Ronald Reagan understood the importance of a full and functioning=
 Supreme Court.
In a letter to the editor in the Abilene Reporter-News<http://www.reportern=
ews.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/john-compere-letter-appoint-new-justi=
ce-now-316566e4-23b1-62f5-e053-0100007f911f-377179641.html>:

John Compere, Baird, Texas: "Republican President Ronald Reagan nominated S=
upreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and a Democratic majority Senate confi=
rmed him during the 1988 presidential election year. Reagan told the Americ=
an people filling the vacancy expeditiously was important because we must "=
 ... fulfill our constitutional obligation of restoring the United States S=
upreme Court to full strength." This is an inconvenient historical truth fo=
r Republicans."

University of Chicago law student reflects on President Obama's visit
After President Obama visited the University of Chicago Law School to speak=
 about the Supreme Court vacancy, first-year law student Luke Sperduto penn=
ed a post on Medium<https://medium.com/@WhiteHouse/when-professor-obama-spo=
ke-to-our-law-school-d245a1117495#.5njoryku2>:

Luke Sperduto: "Obama the Professor acknowledged that while politics has al=
ways played a role in judicial decision-making, the judiciary has now falle=
n victim to broader trends towards partisan gridlock...Asked about the visi=
on that guides his judicial nominations, the President praised judges who f=
ollow the law even when they disagree with it. ... Democracy can be frustra=
ting, the President acknowledged, and our actions will always have conseque=
nces beyond our control."
