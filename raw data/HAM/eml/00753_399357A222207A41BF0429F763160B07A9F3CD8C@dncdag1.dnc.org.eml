Hi Angelica - 

Thanks for the heads up, I think the younger kids will not be joining in the tour, just waiting for confirmation of which two will not be attending!

Thanks, Max. I saw that there are 8 people listed on the ARPS form you sent over -- unfortunately we can only accommodate 6 people max for WW tours. And we need WAVES (not ARPS) for all 6 -- spreadsheet attached.

Thanks,
Angelica

	Jordan, feel free to send the group's WAVES over to me and I'll get them set up for the 20th at 7:45pm. Also happy to loop Kyle on an email with the group so they can coordinate arrival, etc.
