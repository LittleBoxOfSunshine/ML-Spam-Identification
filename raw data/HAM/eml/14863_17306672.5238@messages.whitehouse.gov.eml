White House In-town Pool Report #1, 5/20/16  POTUS pleads for Congress to=
 fund Zika response



Oval Office



Pool entered the Oval Office at 12:02 p.m. at the end of President Obamas=
 Zika briefing with senior White House and public health officials. Obama=
 spoke for about 10 minutes, giving an update on the spread of the virus =
and then making a plea to members of the public to tell their members of =
Congress to support the $1.9 billion in funding the administration has re=
quested.



Key quotes, please check against the transcript:



This is something that is solvable. It is not something that we have to p=
anic about, but it is something that we need to take seriously.  Weve got=
 to get moving  The bottom line is, Congress needs to get me a bill. It n=
eeds to get me a bill that has sufficient funds to do the job. They shoul=
d not be going off on recess before this is done.  To the extent that wer=
e not handling this thing on the front end, were going to have bigger pro=
blems on the back end.



To the public: Tell your members of Congress to get on the job on this.



More highlights:



What we do know is if you contract Zika, even if you dont appear to have =
significant symptoms, it is possible for Zika to cause significant birth =
defects, including microcephaly.  We dont know all of the potential effec=
ts. We do know theyre serious.



He outlined all the steps the administration is taking to combat the spre=
ad of the virus and develop a vaccine and diagnostic tests, then said, Al=
l of this work costs money. The $1.9 billion figure was not from the top =
of our heads, this was based on public health assessments of all the work=
 that needs to be done, he said. The Senate has provided about half, he s=
aid, and the House only a third that must be offset, he said, so, effecti=
vely theres no new money there. All that the House has said is, You can r=
ob Peter to pay Paul.=20

Color in the room.



POTUS sat in a chair with his back to the fireplace and Vice President Bi=
den in a chair to his right. On the couch to his right: OMB Director Shau=
n Donovan and Amy Pope, deputy homeland security advisor. On couch to his=
 left: Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell; Cente=
rs for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden; and Tony Fauc=
i, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases =
at the National Institute of Health.



Pool was led out at 12:13.



A note on further presidential movements today: As the pool assembled in =
the Rose Garden for this spray, we saw several black vans and other motor=
cade vehicles gathering on the South Lawn driveway, and we have just been=
 asked to gather at 12:40 for an as-yet-undisclosed movement that does no=
t appear on the public schedule. Stay tuned to see what Friday afternoon =
has in store for President Obama.
