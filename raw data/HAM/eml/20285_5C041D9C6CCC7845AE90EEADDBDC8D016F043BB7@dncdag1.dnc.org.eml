Hi Mike,

Thanks so much for your kind words! Julia moved to New Jersey a few weeks ago, so she's no longer the LGBT Finance Director. If you need anything, I'm your man.

As for the LGBT Gala, my hunch is that it will take place closer to September, similar to what we did last year. I'll let you know once we have a firm date for that. Right now we're building a couple different events across the country; I've attached those invites for your reference. The first is a roundtable in D.C. with President Obama, and the second is a dinner in New York with President Obama. If you  or anyone you know might be interested in contributing to events and securing spots, just let me know and I'll get it taken care of.

I look forward to working with you, and thanks again for checking in!

Best,

Hi Scott,

Congratulations on your new role!  Alex just told me.  Is Julia no longer the LGBT contact?

Since the early bird gets the worm and I don't want to miss any deadlines (Henry always said to just let him know what events I wanted to attend and he'd look after us), as a DNC LGBT NLC Co-Chair level contributor, may I please get on the list for my partner and I to receive invites to the WH LGBT Reception this summer (if there is one again -- last year this somehow fell through after I was told about the event) and the WH and VP holiday receptions?  And, of course, anything else you think might be worthwhile, particularly for LGBT issues/clutches/meetings.

Thank you so much!

Once I relocate from Chicago to NYC, too, I'd love to talk about my continuing contribution plans, roles I might be able to help for the DNC and the like.

Take care and I hope all is well!
