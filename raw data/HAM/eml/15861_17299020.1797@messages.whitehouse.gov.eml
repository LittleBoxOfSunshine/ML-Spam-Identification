THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release April 27, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20





1:08 P.M. EDT

 Q You didnt wait and finish watching Trump --

MR. EARNEST: No. I didnt start, either. (Laughter.) I'll catch the highli=
ghts later on tonight.

Q He said "Tan-zania."

MR. EARNEST: Yeah, apparently the phonetics are not included on the telep=
rompter. (Laughter.)=20

All right, on to more serious topics. Kevin, do you want to start?

Q Sure. Josh, can you talk a bit about the President's trip to Flint, Mic=
higan? Why now? What does he hope to accomplish? And is it designed to pu=
t more pressure on Congress to do more to help that area?

MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, you saw that the President had written a letter=
 in response to a young girl in Flint who had asked the President to spen=
d some time meeting with the residents of Flint to show and remind them t=
hat the American people continue to keep that community in mind as they d=
eal with some pretty significant challenges.

The President is prepared to travel there next month -- next week, and de=
monstrate that while the public discussion of this situation doesnt retai=
n the same spot in the limelight, the administration is committed to foll=
owing through on helping that community recover.

Now, we certainly would welcome a greater commitment -- or, frankly, any =
commitment -- from Republicans in Congress to responding to this situatio=
n. The administration has marshalled significant resources to help that c=
ommunity respond. There was the urgent provision of bottled water and fil=
ters by FEMA in the immediate aftermath of the situation. But over the lo=
nger term, there's been a commitment by the administration to expanding M=
edicaid to ensure that more citizens across Flint can get access to neede=
d health care. There have been grants provided to local health care provi=
ders to expand their capacity to provide immediate needed health care. Th=
e EPA has ramped up their monitoring of the water supply, and this expand=
ed testing can verify that the appropriate steps are being taken to resto=
re safe drinking water to Flint.=20

So there are a number of things that the administration has done, but the=
re are significant underlying problems that can only be addressed through=
 congressional action. And I also think that the President will note that=
 the administration is committed to responding to the situation both to h=
elp the people of Flint recover but also to make sure that a similar situ=
ation is not being experienced in communities all across the country.=20

And you've seen the EPA, months ago -- or at least more than a month ago =
-- write a letter to governors across the country, outlining exactly how =
the lead and copper rule will be enforced to ensure that a situation like=
 this isnt repeated. And that certainly stands in stark contrast to some =
Republicans in Congress who advocate for the eliminating of the EPA. How =
exactly is that going to improve the situation? This is the agency that i=
s principally responsible for protecting our clean air and clean water.=20=


So as you can tell from my answer to your question, there's a lot to talk=
 about in Flint, and the President is looking forward to taking advantage=
 of this opportunity to ensure that the people of Flint understand that w=
e're going to follow through on our response and to make sure they unders=
tand that the American people havent forgotten.

Q Is the administration confident that EPA leaders have been held fully a=
ccountable for what occurred there?

MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, there's more than one ongoing investigation. An=
d so when it comes to accountability, I've refrained from weighing in in =
a lot of detail because I dont want to be perceived as even attempting to=
 influence those ongoing investigations in one form or another. So we'll =
let those move forward. But the President certainly believes in accountab=
ility. And as the President of the United States, the President takes res=
ponsibility for a lot of things.

Q And now that we have a clearer picture of this year's presidential race=
, does President Obama consider Hillary Clinton to be the presumptive nom=
inee? Does he have any near-term plans for rallying Democrats around her =
candidacy?

MR. EARNEST: Well, the Democratic voters will determine who the Democrati=
c nominee is going to be, and Republican voters will determine who the Re=
publican nominee is going to be. And that's the way that our process was =
structured, and the President participated in that process by casting a v=
ote of his own in the Illinois primary.=20

But, ultimately, the voters will decide and the candidates will make thei=
r own individual decisions about how long to pursue the nomination. And t=
hat's a perfectly appropriate decision for them to make on their own. I d=
ont have any details to announce at this point about when the President w=
ill be engaged in this debate, but he most assuredly will once the genera=
l election has begun.

Q Josh, just one final one. How serious is the threat of the legislation =
from Senator Cotton to prevent the U.S. from purchasing heavy-water from =
Iran? Is the White House prepared to veto that legislation?

MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I learned shortly before coming out here that t=
his legislation did not succeed in getting the sufficient number of votes=
 in the Senate to end debate. So that is an indication that there is not =
likely to be the necessary support in the United States Senate to add tha=
t amendment to this broader appropriations bill.

But we've made clear our commitment to a principle that ideologically mot=
ivated policy riders are not appropriate for appropriations bills. And th=
at is the -- you all have written extensively about Senator Cotton's repe=
ated commitment to undermining the successful implementation of the inter=
national agreement among Iran and some of our closest allies to prevent t=
hem from obtaining a nuclear weapon. So it is clear what the intent of hi=
s amendment is. Senator Cotton is certainly no expert when it comes to he=
avy-water. I'm confident that he couldnt differentiate heavy-water from s=
parkling water. His focus is on undermining the effective implementation =
of this agreement that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.=20

So we'll have to see if -- but right now, I guess I'd say that we're grat=
ified that this has not advanced in the Senate.

Tim.

Q Hi. Back to Flint. Given that the federal EPA -- there were problems th=
ere, there were failures there -- and you mentioned some of the FEMA mone=
y, but Congress is not being able to get money through. So can we expect =
some other way to get federal money to the people in Flint?

MR. EARNEST: Well, I didnt hear the entirety of the first part of your qu=
estion. What did you say about the EPA?

Q Just the failures there, that the EPA was at fault for not telling -- t=
here was a scientist there who knew about the poisoning, but within the E=
PA the message didnt get out and was delayed there.

MR. EARNEST: Well, there continues to be an investigation into the EPA's =
response to the situation. So, again, I'm going to reserve judgment on th=
at.

 But there have been some conclusions that have been reached about the co=
nduct at the state agency that was responsible for protecting the water s=
upply in Flint. And there are at least three individuals who have been in=
dicted for their conduct by the Michigan Attorney General. And I'd also p=
oint out that it was the independent commission that was established by G=
overnor Snyder who pointed out that "the Michigan Department of Environme=
ntal Quality failed in its fundamental responsibility to effectively enfo=
rce drinking water regulations." So, again, I think when it comes to acco=
untability, the agencies that have looked at this thus far and reported s=
ome results have raised significant concerns about what was happening at =
the state level.=20



 There continues to be an investigation of the entire response and the po=
tential role of the federal regulators. And, again, I'm certainly not goi=
ng to say anything that's going to try to -- that could be perceived as i=
nfluencing the outcome of those investigations. But the investigations th=
at have been completed thus far have focused most of their attention, if =
not all, on the conduct of state officials.



 More generally, the reason that Congress has not acted on funding for Fl=
int is because Republicans say they oppose it. So it's not just congressi=
onal dysfunction that has prevented the appropriation of this money, but =
rather because Republicans oppose providing it. And that's despite the co=
nscientious work of people like Senator Stabenow and Senator Peters, in p=
articular, but other Democrats who have said that Congress has a role and=
 a responsibility for making sure that the state of Michigan and the city=
 of Flint has available resources.=20



 When it comes to the administration, our options are a little bit more l=
imited. But you saw that earlier this year the administration expedited s=
ome grant funding that was relevant to water infrastructure projects to t=
ry to provide additional resources to the state of Michigan that could be=
 used in Flint to address this situation. We'll continue to look for othe=
r ways that we can offer up assistance, both as it relates to infrastruct=
ure but also as it relates to health care and other emergency funding. Bu=
t there's a role for Congress to play, and right now it's Republicans who=
 are preventing those necessary steps from occurring.



 Q And when can we expect the EPA to change the lead and copper rule?



 MR. EARNEST: You'd have to talk to them about whether or not that's some=
thing they're considering. The concern that has been expressed is that th=
ere was a little bit of ambiguity about the most effective way to enforce=
 that rule, and that's precisely why you saw the administrator of the EPA=
 write a letter to governors all across the country making clear exactly =
how the EPA was prepared to enforce that rule. And she did that because s=
he's focused on making sure that what happened in Flint doesn't crop up i=
n a whole bunch of communities across the country. And I think this is pr=
udent and effective leadership of learning from shortcomings, and making =
sure they aren't replicated in other situations. That's responsible leade=
rship and it's certainly something that the EPA Administrator, Gina McCar=
thy, takes quite seriously.



 Q And on Puerto Rico, there's a payment due on Sunday and then one in Ju=
ly. But it looks like the bill -- rescue package -- whatever you want to =
call it -- is being delayed. Is there anything the White House can do to =
speed that along?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, I'm not sure what it would be. We rolled out a p=
roposal 188 or 189 days ago, and we haven't seen much activity from the R=
epublicans who are in charge of the House of Representatives. We did see =
a commitment from the Republican leadership in the House to move on a leg=
islative package for Puerto Rico in the first quarter of this year, and w=
e haven't seen nearly as much movement as we would like.



 I think among some Republican leaders there has been a genuine effort th=
at's been made, but among many other Republicans there has just been a re=
fusal to embrace their responsibility to govern. I think you can detect w=
hat I expect will be a bit of an emerging pattern over the course of this=
 briefing that we're going to spend a lot of time talking about how Repub=
licans in Congress aren't doing their job, and that when it comes to core=
 priorities, you've got an administration that is putting forward ideas, =
that is offering up specific proposals, making specific recommendations, =
and doing everything within our power to try to address problems.=20



 But you have a Republican majority in both the House and the Senate that=
 seems much more committed to playing political games and engaging in pol=
itical obstruction than actually using the majority that they fought so h=
ard to win to strengthen the country. And that's unfortunate.



 Q How concerned is the White House that, even if Republicans come to a d=
eal, that there's going to be items attached, like the minimum wage, that=
 the Democrats have --=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, that certainly would be consistent with what I just s=
aid. Attempting to add completely unrelated ideological riders to a piece=
 of legislation that would give the government of Puerto Rico the restruc=
turing authority that they need to try to prevent an economic and humanit=
arian disaster on an island that's inhabited by 3 million Americans is a =
failure of leadership on the part of Republicans. And I don't know exactl=
y what they're going to do, but what I do know is that the longer that we=
 go with Republicans blocking responsible legislation that is not a bailo=
ut, but does give the Puerto Rican government the opportunity to restruct=
ure their debts in a way that would allow them to implement some economic=
 and fiscal reforms, means that we're only getting closer to a bailout ac=
tually being required.



 So that's why we continue to make a strong case that Republican obstruct=
ion of this critical legislation only makes a bailout more likely. But ho=
pefully thats something that we can avoid.



 Mark.



 Q Josh, is the little girl from Flint who wrote the President coming to =
the White House this week?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that. I don't believe that she i=
s.



 Q She asked if she could come by.



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, and I believe in the President's response he noted tha=
t he was looking forward to traveling to Flint and having an opportunity =
to meet with her there.



 Q How does a letter like that get in front of the President?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, as you know, Mark, there's a process where the White =
House Correspondence Office will consider the thousands of pieces of corr=
espondence that's received by the White House, either through the postal =
service or via e-mail, and they process that material and they choose abo=
ut 10 letters each day that are a representative sample of the letters th=
at have been received by the White House that day, and they put them in f=
ront of the President.



 Q So that was one of the 10-a-day?



 MR. EARNEST: That's often how this process works. Occasionally, if the P=
resident shows interest in a particular area, they may seek out additiona=
l pieces of correspondence that they can show the President. I do not kno=
w whether this young lady's letter was one of the 10, but I do know that =
the President has reviewed several pieces of correspondence that are dire=
ctly related to the situation in Flint. And I just don't know whether or =
not her letter was included in the Flint-related correspondence that was =
presented to the President, or if her letter was part of the 10 letters a=
 day that the President reviews on a variety of topics.



 Q On politics, Donald Trump said again today that he believes President =
Obama was snubbed because President Castro was not at the airport to gree=
t him when he arrived in Havana. Did the White House see that as a snub o=
r arriving anywhere and the head of state is not there to greet the Presi=
dent?



 MR. EARNEST: No. And, Mark, as you know, it is not at all uncommon for t=
he President to have formal meetings with heads of state when he travels =
not to participate in ceremonial arrival ceremonies with heads of state w=
hen he arrives at the airport. And so those of you who traveled with the =
President to Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Germany may have observ=
ed that neither the leader of Saudi Arabia, nor the United Kingdom, nor G=
ermany met the President at the airport. So it rather is -- so it is most=
 common for the President to be received by a lower level official at the=
 airport so that the senior level official, the head of the government or=
 the head of -- the most senior official in the country can meet with the=
 President more formally.



 Q And lastly, is President Obama planning on addressing the Democratic C=
onvention in July?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't believe that's something that we've announced at th=
is point.



 Q That's why I'm asking. (Laughter.)



 MR. EARNEST: I certainly would expect that the President would do so. I =
do not know at this point whether or not a date has been selected. Presum=
ably, that's something that we would coordinate with the Democratic nomin=
ee, once one has been chosen. So we'll keep you posted on that, though.



 Mary.



 Q On the ongoing fight over Zika funding, Republicans continue to insist=
 that there's enough remaining money in the pipeline to address this. And=
 the Speaker actually went a step further by saying -- or rather accusing=
 the administration of having, as he put it, a bit of a track record of o=
ver-requesting what is needed. Just wonder if you're confident that the a=
mount that's being requested will be --



 MR. EARNEST: That's interesting. The Republican Congress certainly has a=
 well-established track record of under-performing in response to those r=
equests. This is the latest example of that.



 Sometimes that can be attributed to just a difference of opinion about w=
hats needed. That's not a plausible explanation in this case. You have th=
e Director of the National Institute of Health and a high-ranking officia=
l from the Centers for Disease Control standing at this podium about thre=
e weeks ago and say they did not have the resources that they needed that=
 should be used to fully prepare for the onset of the Zika virus. So thes=
e are experts. These are not political appointees of the President of the=
 United States. These are legitimate scientific experts who are responsib=
le for protecting the health and safety of the American people. And they =
said that Congress had not provided them with all of the resources that t=
hey believe are necessary to do everything possible to prepare the countr=
y for the Zika virus.



 This is notable primarily because when we initially put forward our requ=
est, Speaker Ryan indicated that there is plenty of money in the pipeline=
 right now that can go to Zika. Then just a couple of weeks ago, he said =
that funding for Zika should go through the normal process. Presumably, h=
e said that before the process completely broke down in the House of Repr=
esentatives that he leads.=20



And now hes saying that somehow they don't have enough information to eva=
luate our request. He says that despite the fact that discussions of the =
Zika virus have emerged in 48 different congressional hearings. There was=
 a briefing that was offered to every member of Congress in both the Hous=
e and the Senate so that they could hear directly from our nations top sc=
ientists, so they could understand exactly what the threat is.=20



There have been ample opportunities for members of Congress who have ques=
tions to ask them. There have been a variety of answers that have been gi=
ven. The administration put forward a specific proposal, dated February 2=
2nd, with lots of details about what exactly these resources would do to =
make the country safer and to allow us to prepare for the Zika virus.



Whats interesting about this situation is, as I mentioned yesterday, we o=
ften can't predict exactly where a flood is going to hit; we don't know t=
he exact path of a tornado. These are emergencies that we cannot specific=
ally prepare for; we can in general. We know which regions of the country=
 are more likely to be flooded or more likely to be hit by a tornado. In =
this situation, we do have an opportunity. We have months that could have=
 been used to prepare for the onset of this virus. And yet, that time has=
 been frittered away by Republicans who have refused to do what is necess=
ary to protect the country from a genuine public health emergency.=20



Q Beyond the $600,000 million in remaining Ebola funding that's already b=
een allocated, it seems theres several hundreds of millions left, still r=
emaining in Ebola funding. As the stalemate continues, is that an area wh=
ere you may be looking to free up some remaining funding, or not?



MR. EARNEST: Well, that certainly would not be our preference. Look, when=
 we were in the midst of what was then described by many people publicly =
as an Ebola crisis, there were legitimate questions asked by all of you i=
n this room of me while I was standing here why we hadnt done more to pre=
pare for the situation. And we eventually were able to secure necessary r=
esources from Congress to begin to take the appropriate steps to ensure t=
hat our public health system and, frankly, the public health system in ot=
her countries where the Ebola virus is most likely to emerge, were orient=
ed to try to protect us from the Ebola virus.



Why we would now go and undermine those investments and dedicate them to =
something else only because Congress wouldn't act is not a wise decision.=
 The wise decision is to take the investments that we've already made in =
protecting the country from Ebola, making sure they continue to be effect=
ively spent, and also using the resources of this country to protect the =
American people from the Zika virus.=20



This is not that complicated. This should be a pretty straightforward pol=
icy decision. But unfortunately, as I've mentioned, Republicans, who spen=
t years in the minority throwing sand in the gears of government, have ke=
pt throwing the sand in the gears, despite the fact they are now in charg=
e of the government when it comes to the House of Representatives and the=
 United States Senate. That raises questions, frankly, why they chose to =
run in the first place.



Q And one question on the campaign. It was around this time in 2008 when =
Senator Feinstein brokered a meeting between then Senator Obama and Hilla=
ry Clinton to try and bring the two together and unite the party. Does th=
e President at all feel obligated to try and foster a similar meeting bet=
ween Senators Clinton and Sanders, and does he think that such a meeting =
would benefit the candidates and the party at this point?



MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any discussions about a brokered meeting, a=
t least, that involve the White House. Look, as youve heard me say on man=
y occasions, there were predictions in 2008 that the longer than expected=
 Democratic primary was going to have a negative impact on the eventual n=
ominee. That didnt prove to be true. In some states that had not recently=
 been the host of a competitive primary, it gave Democrats in those state=
s the opportunity to build an infrastructure. And it certainly created op=
portunities for Democrats in 2008 to win in states that Democrats hadnt w=
on in a while. Indiana is a good example of that.=20



So that's why I think youll find a lot of people, at least in this admini=
stration, who still have vivid memories of the 2008 race, that we underst=
and that these kinds of contests can sometimes go on longer than expected=
, but that's not automatically a bad thing -- particularly when the debat=
e is focused on substantive issues that are worthy of a significant publi=
c debate. And there certainly is no shortage of those.



Julie.



Q Thanks, Josh. One thing that the Republicans on the Hill seem to repeat=
edly ask for with regard to the Zika funding is a rundown of what exactly=
 is needed for this year versus next year. And that's not an answer that =
they've gotten either from the White House or, they say, anywhere else in=
 the administration. Is that a number that's noble? Is there a reason tha=
t you havent provided that to them? Because they seem to be pointing to t=
hat as the reason that they can't go forward on figuring out what they mi=
ght be able to free up for this year.



MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think you get differing explanations dependin=
g on who you ask. Obviously there appears to be, based on public reports,=
 an effort to put specific numbers on paper on the Senate side. So certai=
nly members of the Senate -- Democrats and Republicans -- feel like they =
have necessary information to start working on a bill. We havent had the =
top to take a close look at it, so it's unclear at this point whether or =
not that's something that we would believe is sufficient for the task. So=
 it's a little hard to take seriously criticism from Republicans in the H=
ouse that they dont have enough information to write the bill when there =
are Republicans in the Senate who are working with Democrats who are writ=
ing a bill.



I think, separately, what we've also gone to great lengths to try to expl=
ain is that while we are concerned about ensuring that we have sufficient=
 resources over the course of this summer and fall to fight Zika, we need=
 to make sure we're laying the groundwork for an effective long-term resp=
onse. For example, despite the remarkable scientific capacity of the Unit=
ed States and the United States government, our experts do not anticipate=
 that we will have an effective vaccine against Zika available this summe=
r. But if we want to have one available by next summer or the summer afte=
r that, we need to start doing research now, and we need to start doing c=
linical trials now. And we need to demonstrate a commitment from the fede=
ral government to be a customer for those vaccines so that private sector=
 entities that have a capacity to manufacture that vaccine will pursue it=
.



So the point is, we are going to need resources and a commitment of resou=
rces over the long term. And this is something that we have discussed in =
both private and in public with members of the House and the Senate. So i=
t's just a little hard to take very seriously these complaints when there=
's ample information that's been provided. There are a wide range of disc=
ussions that have occurred. And those discussions have actually resulted =
in members of the Senate working in bipartisan fashion to draft legislati=
on. I dont understand why they can't do that in the House.

Q But when you talk about long term, I mean, these are emergency funds th=
at are being requested in a supplemental. So you can understand why there=
 might be some opposition on the Hill to providing funding that you're ta=
lking about for a long-term response in an emergency fashion. I'm just wo=
ndering if you can distinguish between one and the other, if that's possi=
ble.

MR. EARNEST: Right. It's an emergency because we need to start working on=
 that vaccine right now. If we dont start working now on that vaccine -- =
well, let me say it this way. The most effective way to protect the count=
ry from the Zika virus is to develop a vaccine. And we know that developi=
ng a vaccine takes time. It also requires a long-term commitment of resou=
rces both to conduct clinical trials, but also to manufacture a large qua=
ntity of the vaccine so that we can protect a large number of Americans. =
And every day that goes by now, where we havent made a long-term commitme=
nt to that vaccine, is a day lost to the eventual implementation of that =
vaccine.=20

So we need a commitment now. And we dont just need a commitment now for t=
wo or three months; we need a commitment for a couple of years, so that p=
rivate sector pharmaceutical companies will know that there will be a cus=
tomer for their vaccine if they implement the resources now to developing=
 it. And that's why it's urgent. It's urgent because we need to get start=
ed now. But it's not just going to apply to this fiscal year because it's=
 going to take more than a year to develop tests and manufacture a vaccin=
e.

Q Just one more on a separate issue. Eighty-one senators wrote to the Pre=
sident earlier this week, asking for what they called a substantially enh=
anced new long-term agreement with Israel with regard to U.S. military ai=
d. Could you give us an update on where the talks stand with regard to so=
rt of closing that 10-year deal? You've been negotiating now since Decemb=
er. We've heard you say repeatedly that the U.S. is willing to increase t=
he level of aid, but it's not clear what the hang-up would be between now=
 and December being able to close the deal on it since Israel and the U.S=
. both seem to be willing to make an agreement. What's holding it up?

MR. EARNEST: Well, Julie, I think I want to start by just pointing out th=
at the idea for extending this agreement between the United States and Is=
rael originated with President Obama back in 2013. So it's the President =
who, for I believe three years now, has been advocating for the extension=
 of this agreement. And the idea was that this agreement that I believe e=
xtends to -- the agreement that's currently in place I believe extends to=
 2018. And the thought was that by beginning negotiations early, the Unit=
ed States can provide some significant assurance to the nation of Israel =
that our commitment to their security is enduring. But over those three y=
ears, a lot has happened that has had an impact on the effective coordina=
tion related to those negotiations.=20

And the talks continue. And what the United States has committed to do is=
 to ramp up the assistance that we provide to Israel in a way that would =
allow Israel to be the recipient of more national security aid than any o=
ther country has ever received from the United States. That is an indicat=
ion of the depth of this country and this administration's commitment to =
Israel's security. Working out the details, though, is complicated. And t=
here are a number of technical details that have to be worked through. Th=
ere are also questions related to reaching an assessment of the threat th=
at Israel faces, and making sure that the assistance that is provided is =
most effectively oriented to counter that threat.

So these are issues that take some time to work through, but there is a s=
trong commitment on the part of this administration and on the part of th=
is country to providing resources to the nation of Israel so that they ca=
n defend themselves.

Q But youre making it sound like the President and this administration is=
 committed to it, and leaving open the question of whether Israel is real=
ly willing to come to the table at this point. Have they refused these of=
fers, these repeated offers of the most unprecedented military aid that a=
ny nation has ever received from the United States?

MR. EARNEST: Well, I think we have acknowledged previously that there was=
 a period prior to last December where there was at least some reticence =
on the part of the Israelis to engage in these conversations. But those t=
alks were restarted back in December. And since then, there have been act=
ive discussions between national security officials in both countries abo=
ut reaching this agreement.=20

And I dont have an updated timeframe for you in terms of when we expect a=
n agreement to be completed, but the work to try to reach that agreement =
remains ongoing.

Suzanne.

Q Josh, you said earlier you werent listening to Donald Trump's foreign p=
olicy speech. And a lot of people, however, really are paying attention t=
o it as he gets closer to the responsibility nomination, including people=
 who are concerned around the world. I'm not asking to dispute point by p=
oint what he said, because there was a lot of criticism in saying --

MR. EARNEST: We might be here a while. (Laughter.)=20

Q -- that the U.S. treated Iran with tender love and care; that the U.S. =
is not a friend to Israel; that rivals no longer respect us, et cetera --=
 concluding that the foreign policy is reckless, rudderless, and aimless.=
 Just in general terms, can you tell us what is the President's thinking =
about what he has hoped to accomplish over the last two terms and his imp=
act around the world. And also, how does the White House prepare for some=
thing like this when you have Trump coming out, dissecting this with this=
 kind of criticism? Does the President anticipate world leaders, ambassad=
ors, people starting to make phone calls of concern about what he is sayi=
ng in light of the fact that he is so close to becoming the nominee?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think you've heard the President already speak at s=
ome length about the concerns that he has heard from other world leaders =
about the tone and tenor of the presidential debate in the United States.=
 The President has already spoken to that. I think when it comes to this =
President's foreign policy, there is no denying that the United States is=
 safer and stronger than we were when President Obama took office back in=
 January of 2009.



 And there are a variety of ways to measure it. You can certainly careful=
ly consider the economic situation of the United States. That certainly h=
as an impact on the influence that we wield around the world. Right now, =
the U.S. economy, because of the longest streak of private sector job gro=
wth in American history that we've enjoyed over the last 73 or so months =
resulting in more than 14 million private-sector jobs created, the United=
 States continues to be the envy of the world when it comes to having suc=
h a durable economy.



 As it relates to protecting the United States from very specific threats=
, when President Obama took office, there was a genuine concern about the=
 likelihood that Iran would develop a nuclear weapon. And at the time, th=
e international community was fractured in terms of considering how, exac=
tly, to respond to the situation. But because of President Obama's leader=
ship, we united the world in imposing stringent sanctions on the Iranian =
government and on the Iranian economy that compelled them to come to the =
table, and compelled them to agree to a diplomatic agreement that prevent=
s them from obtaining a nuclear weapon and establishes a verification reg=
ime, inspections, that allow us to verify that Iran has not developed a n=
uclear weapon and that they are actually abiding by the terms of the deal=
.



 What we've also seen is a strengthening of our alliances around the worl=
d. We've seen an effective renewed focus on the Asia Pacific region that =
has both positive economic and strategic benefits for the United States.=20=




So the President has got a strong record to run on, to say nothing of the=
 advances that we've made in improving our relationship with countries th=
roughout the Western Hemisphere, in part because of the President's histo=
ric agreement or policy change to begin normalizing relations with Cuba. =
This has revolutionized the kinds of relationships that the United States=
 has with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. In fact, a country=
 like Argentina that had long elected leaders that were deeply skeptical =
of the United States has now elected a leader that President Obama met wi=
th just last month who ran on a platform of warmer relations with the Uni=
ted States. It didn't happen by accident. That happened because of a rene=
wed commitment to engagement by this administration in the hemisphere, an=
d a commitment to moving past the kinds of obstacles that have stood in t=
he way of those warmer relations for decades.



 So historians will have ample opportunity to consider this President's p=
olicies, and I wouldn't be surprised if they're the subject of extensive =
debate over the next several months and through the fall. In fact, we'd w=
elcome that opportunity to have that debate.



 Q How much of the President's time is really devoted to reassuring allie=
s and others that there's not going to be a dramatic change in foreign po=
licy? Because obviously there are many world leaders and people in the di=
plomatic community who are very, very concerned about what they hear from=
 Trump.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, the President has been clear that this is some=
thing that comes up frequently in his conversations, and the President's =
response has been to reassure them that the President retains significant=
 confidence in the wisdom of the American people to continue to pursue po=
licies that are in the best interest of the United States and are focused=
 on strengthening our alliances around the world, and ensuring the safety=
 and security of the American people.



 Q On another matter, does the administration have any reaction to former=
 Speaker Denny Hastert, sentenced today by a judge to 15 months imprisonm=
ent? The judge calling him a serial child molester, and Hastert apologizi=
ng for what he calls "mistreating boys" when he was a wrestling coach.



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific response to that. Obviously, this i=
s part of our criminal justice system carrying out its mandate. And I don=
't have a specific response to it.



 April.



 Q Josh, I want to ask you a couple things on two different subjects. One=
, on the issue of Donald Trump, he brought up this issue of foreign polic=
y today. And I want to ask you some things about ISIS. He said once he be=
comes President, he would eliminate ISIS. In your conversations with worl=
d leaders, national security, intelligence officials, as well as generals=
 on the ground, has there ever been any concrete, one-stop-shop, we can e=
liminate ISIS in your conversations over ISIS?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has been clear about what his s=
trategy is for degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. And this is a st=
rategy that requires intensive cooperation with countries, partners, and =
allies around the world. And the President devoted a significant portion =
of his just-completed foreign trip to discussing how to intensify that co=
ordination.



 The progress that we've made on the ground against ISIL in both Iraq and=
 in Syria has been noteworthy. In Iraq, the calculations are that we have=
 driven ISIL out of about 40 percent of the territory on the ground that =
they previously controlled. In Syria, the number is somewhat smaller, but=
 it's about 16 percent, which represents important progress. And this isn=
't just large swaths of unpopulated desert land; these are populated area=
s that have been retaken from ISIL.



 The other thing that has attracted a lot of attention in recent days is =
our ongoing efforts to shut down ISIL's financing. The United States has =
worked effectively with countries around the world, including countries i=
n the region, to counter ISIL's ability to finance their reign of terror.=
 And we have worked closely with the Emirates, for example, to limit the =
ability of ISIL to access international financial networks. But we've als=
o been able to coordinate among intelligence officials, finance officials=
, and military officials to actually carry out military strikes against s=
ome of ISIL's cash stockpiles. And there is extensive reporting to indica=
te that ISIL is now having trouble paying its fighters on time. In some c=
ases, there is even evidence that ISIL has slashed payments to their figh=
ters, and this has had a very negative impact on morale.=20



 Let me just give you one more example. The President has been focused, d=
ating back to the fall of 2014, on shutting down the flow of foreign figh=
ters to Iraq and in Syria. One of the concerns that the international com=
munity originally had was that ISIL was able to rather easily replenish i=
ts ranks and that even as Iraqi security forces or coalition airstrikes w=
ere able to take ISIL fighters off the battlefield, there were so many IS=
IL fighters from around the world that were being recruited that they cou=
ld easily replace those fighters who had been killed. There was even more=
 concern about some of those fighters using their passports to return hom=
e and carry out attacks in their home countries.



 Because of the coordinated diplomacy of the United States and many of ou=
r partners, we have drastically reduced the flow of foreign fighters to I=
raq and in Syria. This began with the President chairing a United Nations=
 Security Council meeting to discuss this issue. It was enhanced by the e=
fforts of our allies in Turkey taking important steps to better secure th=
eir border with Syria, but we know that the flow of foreign fighters has =
not been entirely shut off, but it is significantly lower than it was bef=
ore.=20



 So this is all an indication that we have made progress, important progr=
ess in the fight against ISIL, progress that has made the American people=
 safer -- progress that has yielded a degradation of ISIL forces. But the=
re's a lot more work to be done. I think the critical part of this is the=
 President is committed to making sure the United States is not doing thi=
s alone. This is not a burden that we're going to carry on our own. We're=
 not going to be the world's policeman. We're not going to impose a milit=
ary solution on this situation. We're going to work carefully with the in=
ternational community that also has an important stake in this to continu=
e this fight and to continue to make progress in degrading and destroying=
 this terrorist organization.



 Q You said something critical -- we're not going to impose a military so=
lution. Donald Trump is -- I don't know, didn't get through the weeds wit=
h what he was saying --=20



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, you're probably not the only one.



 Q I'm not saying that to be smart, though. I'm not saying that to be sma=
rt. But he said that he could eliminate ISIS. So could a military solutio=
n eliminate ISIS?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I would encourage you to check with his advisors to g=
et them to explain to you what it means to eliminate ISIS. Or at least wh=
at he means when he says that.



 Q Before the end of the year, around December or so, President Obama fro=
m the Oval Office addressed the nation, and around that time, national se=
curity folks were saying that ISIS had been degraded about 25 percent. Ar=
e we still around that number, or is it higher or lower, even as theyre s=
till carrying out acts of violence and terrorism?



 MR. EARNEST: The latest statistics that we've seen is that we've retaken=
 about 40 percent of the territory in Iraq that ISIL previously held, and=
 about 16 percent of the territory in Syria -- populated territory in Syr=
ia that ISIL previously held.



 Q All right. And then on Flint, Michigan, will the President be making a=
ny news when he travels there, particularly as it's still an ongoing situ=
ation? There have been charges. People are still pointing figures and the=
re are still long-term effects to include the lost generation of kids and=
 some people who were physically harmed by drinking this water.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I'll just point out that there have already been some=
 serious steps taken by the administration to try to confront some of the=
 potential long-term consequences of the soiled Flint water supply. I can=
 give you a couple of examples.



 Theres been a significant expansion of Medicaid coverage so that more in=
dividuals can get access to treatment that would address any problems tha=
t they have sustained as a result of increased levels of lead in the wate=
r supply. There has been a widespread increase in testing to evaluate the=
 impact on children in Flint as a result of the contaminated water supply=
.



 Q What are you finding in that so far?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I'd refer you to HHS and they can give you some more =
details on exactly what those studies and what those tests have found.=20=




 There also has been work to provide additional assistance -- economic as=
sistance to Flint. The contamination of the water supply has a ripple eff=
ect across the economy. You can understand that you're not likely to go a=
nd establish a new business in a community that doesnt have access to cle=
an water. So theres a variety of economic assistance that's been provided=
 to the local government and to members of the community as they go throu=
gh this difficult situation.



 So we've been mindful of the longer-term challenges that Flint is facing=
, and we're going to continue to follow through with those commitments.



 As it relates to the Presidents trip, I don't have any remarks to previe=
w at this point. I suspect that the fact of the Presidents trip is news i=
n and of itself. And he certainly is looking forward to the opportunity t=
hat he'll have to meet with local officials, to meet with people in the c=
ommunity who have been affected, and both reassure them that the Obama ad=
ministration is committed to following through on the commitments that we=
 have made, but also making a broader argument to the country about why i=
nvestments in our infrastructure are so critically important.



 So we'll have more to say about that next week.



 Q One last question. Now there are charges, what is up -- can you say wh=
at this administration feels is at the root of this problem? Hillary Clin=
ton already said what she felt. What does this President and this adminis=
tration feel is the root cause of this crisis?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, youll get an opportunity to hear directly from the Pr=
esident on that next week.



 Q So will he kind of reflect, mirror some of what Hillary Clinton said? =
Because hes been very vocal when it comes to issues of inequality, the le=
sser served, and race. Will he mirror her?



 MR. EARNEST: Stay tuned. I'll let you draw that conclusion for yourself.=




 Ron.



 Q On the Trump speech, you didnt see it, right?



 MR. EARNEST: I did not.=20



 Q Werent you curious? Didnt you want to? (Laughter.)=20

 MR. EARNEST: Not really. (Laughter.)=20



 Q Why not?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't know. I guess I have plenty more important things t=
o be focused on, to prepare for your serious questions, beyond what any i=
ndividual presidential candidate might have to say.



 Q The President was -- one thing about the speech was it was done very d=
ifferently, apparently. A lot of commentators I think would agree. Even a=
 teleprompter appeared to be used. It was scripted. The setting was much =
more structured. What do you think of Mr. Trumps effort to do a foreign p=
olicy speech in that manner?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I've given up trying to divine the intentions of him =
or any other presidential candidate. Obviously hes got plenty of people o=
n his staff who can describe what theyre focused on doing there. But I wo=
uldn't begin to describe what they had in mind.



 Q You don't think you're being too dismissive of him?



 MR. EARNEST: No. I guess it's an ironic answer. I didnt view it that way=
. (Laughter.) But, no, I don't think so. Look, our process is structured =
so that individual voters all across the country can take stock of the ca=
ndidates, and given the length of this campaign, theyve had ample opportu=
nity to take stock of the candidates on both sides. And as the President,=
 himself, said, hes got a lot of confidence in the American people to mak=
e the right decision. And he certainly intends to spend some time advocat=
ing, making his preferences known. But the time for that will be during t=
he general election.=20



 Q On the Flint situation, the timing. These letters were exchanged some =
time ago, or received some time ago, correct?



 MR. EARNEST: I think the President got the letter from this little girl =
in Flint last month.=20



 Q So why now? Did he just receive it? Or is there something about the si=
tuation there that he sees that changed his mind about going? Because for=
 so long he said he would not go.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think that -- I don't think the President said that=
 he would not go. In terms of --



 Q But he said he wouldn't go --



 MR. EARNEST: He hadnt scheduled one. And, look, I think the Presidents g=
oal here is to go to the community of Flint and say in person to the peop=
le of Flint what he conveyed in the letter to this little girl, which is,=
 we've not forgotten you. In fact, we're committed to making sure that th=
is community has the support that they need to recover.=20



 Whats happened there is terrible. The President, himself, described what=
 he thought it must be like for a parent to look at the news and see that=
 their child has been drinking poisoned water for months, if not years. I=
 think many parents in Flint, like the President imagined, are beside the=
mselves -- they still are. And the President feels it's important to go a=
nd signal his continued support for that community even though it's not a=
n everyday headline like it used to be.



 And I don't mean that as some sort of criticism of the media, just a pra=
ctical observation that if you live in the city of Flint, there were sate=
llite trucks and news photographers all over the streets. And understanda=
bly, attention has moved on to other things. And the President feels it's=
 important to go back to them and make it clear that while the intention =
of other people has shifted onto other things, he continues to be focused=
 on making sure that we do right by the people of Flint.



Q Just to clarify, there was a federal state of emergency declared, corre=
ct? That's still in effect?

MR. EARNEST: So there was an initial declaration. The President issued an=
 emergency declaration for the state of Michigan that allowed some resour=
ces to be provided. There was a broader declaration that was denied simpl=
y because of the way the law is written for those broader declarations. T=
hose broader declarations are only allowed to be used in the event of a n=
atural disaster, and this disaster is obviously a man-made one.

Q So there will be a federal disaster -- declaring it a federal disaster =
area, essentially.

MR. EARNEST: Exactly.

Q We've had more calls and discussions with residents out there, and the =
feeling is -- and as we've talked about before -- there's a huge trust de=
ficit now --

MR. EARNEST: Sure.

Q -- that may not be reparable given what's happened for some certainly. =
Is there some contemplation by the administration of trying to find some =
other way to broaden the federal role there going forward? If, in fact, y=
ou're saying a disaster area can't be declared between it's a man-made ci=
rcumstance, does the President feel there is some need for something furt=
her -- some reassurance, some declaration, something -- that structures i=
n federal oversight to make sure this problem gets solved?

MR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I dont think that there is anything that the fede=
ral government could do in one day that is going to repair the trust that=
 has been broken. I would acknowledge that that's the case.=20

I think the way that you rebuild trust in a situation like this is demons=
trating a sustained commitment to following through on what you say you'r=
e going to do. And what the federal government has said that they were go=
ing to do is mobilize resources to help people have access to clean water=
 while the situation with the water supply is being fixed. So that's why =
you saw FEMA move in. They've now passed out 7.3 million liters of water =
that has been provided by FEMA to people in Flint; 55,000 water filters a=
nd 243,000 replacement filter cartridges.=20

So just meeting the urgent emergency needs of people is certainly an appr=
opriate role for the federal government. You also saw the federal governm=
ent step in and expand Medicaid coverage so that more individuals up to t=
he age of 21 could get access to reliable health care. You saw grants fro=
m the Department of Health and Human Services to local health care offici=
als to make sure they could handle the capacity -- I'm sorry, to expand t=
heir capacity so that they could handle the increase in the number of pat=
ients that they were going to see on a regular basis. These are just some=
 of the examples of the assistance that's been provided by the federal go=
vernment.=20

So there certainly is an important role for the federal government to pla=
y in responding to a situation like this. What's also true is there's a r=
ole for Congress to play. There are additional resources that could be us=
ed to make some changes to their aging water infrastructure and to provid=
e additional assistance to help the city of Flint recover and rebuild. Un=
fortunately, we've seen Republicans refuse to embrace that responsibility=
, and that's unfortunate. But the President is certainly committed to thi=
s. And it is fair to say that the President is interested in any new idea=
s that are developed about additional assistance that can be provided wit=
hin the authority of the executive branch. But there certainly is importa=
nt assistance that could be provided by Congress; we just need to see Rep=
ublicans stop blocking it.=20

Andrew.

Q The President travels to Vietnam soon. I was wondering if you could giv=
e us the White House position on the lifting of the arms embargo against =
that country. And if you do support them, what would you like to see the =
Vietnamese do in return for that being lifted?

MR. EARNEST: At this point, Andrew, I'm not aware of a change in our posi=
tion. Obviously we'll keep you posted if something like that is being con=
templated in advance of the trip. I anticipate that the President, when h=
e travels to Vietnam, will actually spend most of his time talking about =
the increased focus of the United States on the Asia Pacific region. Viet=
nam has a dynamic economy and they have a rapidly growing middle class. A=
nd it's a country that is trying to decide exactly how it's going to orie=
nt its economy in the decades ahead. And there's an opportunity for the U=
nited States, through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, to which Vietnam is =
a party, to raise labor and environmental standards in a way that creates=
 more of a level playing field for American businesses.=20

That means that Vietnamese businesses that are interested in doing busine=
ss in the United States need to change the way that they operate on a reg=
ular basis. What it also means is it means that U.S. businesses will have=
 more access to that growing middle class in Vietnam. It's a win-win for =
the U.S. economy. And the President will certainly highlight that win-win=
 when he travels to Vietnam. He'll also illustrate the risk that is posed=
 by rejecting this agreement.=20

What we know is that China would love to strengthen and deepen their econ=
omic ties with Vietnam. They recognize the same economic opportunities in=
 Vietnam that we do. But if China is able to establish a foothold in Viet=
nam, China will surely say, well, we dont really care anything about your=
 labor standards, we dont care anything about your environmental standard=
s, we certainly dont care anything about the human rights standards in yo=
ur country -- we just want to look for ways to do more business. There wi=
ll be a race to the bottom, and that will only put American businesses at=
 a greater disadvantage in trying to expand opportunities in one of the f=
astest-growing economies in the world.

 So it's a pretty simple strategic calculation. It's just one that we're =
going to continue to explain, and there's no better way to do that than h=
aving the President travel to that country directly.

 Q And on a separate issue, one thing you may have agreed with Trump on t=
oday was his suggestion that U.S. allies are not pulling their weight whe=
n it comes to the security program. Is the President considering deployin=
g naval and reconnaissance assets to the central Mediterranean, or is tha=
t a job for the Europeans?

 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President in his discussions with our European al=
lies in Europe over the weekend and earlier this week did talk about the =
significant national security of the situation that exists in the central=
 Mediterranean. The flow of migrants across the Mediterranean Sea into so=
uthern Europe represents a significant challenge for our European allies.=
 It has significant consequences for their national security. And the Pre=
sident pointed out it wasnt just their national security that was at risk=
, but the U.S. national security is affected as well. So we certainly hav=
e a stake in their ability to resolve that situation.=20

I dont have anything to announce, and the President certainly didnt have =
anything to announce in the aftermath of those meetings, but I think that=
 should be a pretty clear indication to you that the United States is pre=
pared to offer our support as they work to find an appropriate solution.=20=


What's also true is the President did take advantage of the opportunity w=
ith some of strongest our allies in the world sitting around the same tab=
le to make clear that we all need to follow through on commitments that w=
e've made as it relates to funding our defense capacities. There was a co=
mmitment that was made by our NATO allies a couple of years ago at the NA=
TO meeting in the U.K., I believe, where each of the countries of NATO co=
mmitted to dedicating 2 percent of their GDP to defense spending. The Uni=
ted States far exceeds that goal. Our allies in the U.K. have met that go=
al, but too many others havent. And the President reminded all of them of=
 the importance of meeting that goal, particularly in the face of threats=
 from ISIL, a migration flow in southern Europe that is potentially desta=
bilizing, and a steady increase in provocations from the Russians.=20

This is exactly the wrong time for our closest allies in the world to be =
insufficiently funding their defense capabilities. It's only by working t=
ogether -- that's the essence of an alliance -- working together and adeq=
uately funding our capacity to work together is the way for us to provide=
 for our mutual defense. And the President certainly did make that case t=
o his partners and our allies in the context of that meeting and other me=
etings that he's convened with them in recent months and years.



 Q Is it fair to say that the President might be reluctant to deploy U.S.=
 assets, should he see that Europeans are not willing to put their own as=
sets on the line as well?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the point of setting this two percent goal is=
 ensuring that when a situation does arise that requires a commitment of =
resources, that our partners have the capacity to follow through on those=
 commitments.=20



 Q Sorry, I was specifically talking about the central Mediterranean.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Oh, okay. I mean, as it relates to that specific situation,=
 we're obviously going to work closely with our European allies as they c=
onsider an appropriate response. But the President I think was pretty blu=
nt in saying that the potential impact of the situation there doesn't jus=
t have an impact on national security in Europe, it has an impact on the =
national security of the United States. And I think that would signal to =
you that the United States is prepared to actively support our European a=
llies as they confront this challenge.



 Kevin.



 Q Thanks, Josh. I want to extend the conversation about the NSC that you=
 had, in particular acknowledging that National Security Advisor Rice has=
, in fact, trimmed her staff. Tell me about Mac Thornberry's suggestion t=
hat the NSC could be cut significantly more than that -- is he off-base? =
And if so, how?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I think even just the conversation in the brie=
fing today is a useful illustration of the wide range of threats and chal=
lenges that is being confronted by our national security professionals ev=
ery day. And ensuring that the Commander-in-Chief has access to the infor=
mation and judgment of his advisors not just here in the White House but =
across a variety of national security agencies is critically important.



 There are a number of diplomatic and -- well, let me say it this way: On=
e way to ensure effective decision-making is to effectively coordinate th=
e actions of all of the different agencies that are involved in protectin=
g the country. And that is essentially the core function of the National =
Security Council -- to make sure that all of these agencies who have sign=
ificant responsibilities related to national security are effectively coo=
rdinated so that they can provide effective advice and information to the=
 President of the United States, but also so that decisions that are made=
 by the President of the United States are effectively implemented by tha=
t wide array of agencies.



 So given the risks that we are -- the wide range of risks that this coun=
try is confronting right now, it shouldn't be surprising to anybody that =
there is a robust structure in place, here at the White House, to make su=
re that these decisions are made and implemented effectively.



 Q And yet there has been criticism by some former Defense Secretaries th=
at the West Wing is effectively trying to override, for lack of a more de=
scriptive word, the intentions of the Pentagon, for example. In fact, one=
 said, all too often they were subject to second-guessing, even to direct=
 conversations of commanders on the ground, coming from the NSC. Is that =
the proper role?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I think that it's probably true over the cours=
e of our nation's history that every Secretary of Defense has expressed s=
ome frustration about working with the White House. That is a built-in pa=
rt of being part of the government. That's also part of being part of the=
 chain of command. And I think the President is proud -- I can tell you c=
onfidently that the President is proud of the performance of the Secretar=
ies of Defense that have served under him. He certainly is proud of the p=
erformance of Secretary Carter. It doesn't mean that he's taken their adv=
ice every time. He hasn't. He's the President of the United States. They'=
re the Secretary of Defense. It's their responsibility to offer up their =
advice.



 He surely has taken their advice more often than not, and I think a lot =
of our frustration actually stems from Congress refusing to take the advi=
ce of our Secretaries of Defense over the years. And whether that is fail=
ing to pass an authorization to use military force, something that our Se=
cretaries of Defense have strongly advocated, our Secretaries of Defense =
-- I think all of them -- have actually time and again gone to Congress a=
nd asked for spending reforms that would save taxpayers money and make ou=
r national defense stronger. But yet, those reforms have not been impleme=
nted.



 So there is a strong record of this White House working effectively with=
 leaders of the military, civilian and military, at the Department of Def=
ense to implement policies that have made the country safer. And the Pres=
ident is certainly proud of the service of his Secretaries of Defense, an=
d he's certainly proud of the way those decisions and the implementation =
of those policies has made our country safer.



 Q Just to put a finer point on it, some of the suggestion was that the N=
SC is meddling -- sort of they've got his ear ahead of his direct Cabinet=
 Secretaries.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I just disagree. I think the President carefully cons=
idered the advice that he received from each of his Secretaries of Defens=
e. He valued that advice, and it played an important role as he made crit=
ically important policy decisions throughout this presidency.



 Q Last one. The President has done well in communicating with young vote=
rs. There is a sense in 2016, a greater sense of disenfranchisement -- th=
at the process is rigged. You've heard that both on the Republican and on=
 the Democratic side, and in particular some young voters feel like the f=
ix is in. What would the President say to young voters, in particular as =
we get closer to the conventions, about the process that they're seeing h=
ere in 2016?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President's message to young voters is th=
e message that he has for all Americans, which is simply that casting a v=
ote is the most effective and powerful way to have your voice heard. The =
President has talked about this most frequently I think in the context of=
 the debate about gun safety. The President has been greatly frustrated, =
profoundly frustrated at repeated congressional inaction and obstruction =
when it comes to common-sense gun-safety bills. And the President I think=
 has been pretty blunt about the fact that he doesn't expect that environ=
ment in Congress to change until voters make their voices heard and until=
 voters make clear that this is something that is a priority to them.



 So the President wasn't signaling that this environment would change if =
some billionaire started a super PAC. It's possible that could be the cas=
e, but there have already been super PACs created by billionaires that ha=
ve tried to make this change that haven't succeeded, at least as much as =
we would like them to. The way that this will get fixed, the way that we'=
ll see common-sense legislation passed that doesn't undermine the constit=
utional rights of law-abiding Americans is when voters across the country=
 make clear that this is a priority to them. And they can do that in only=
 one way, and that's by casting their votes accordingly. And I think that=
's a powerful message about the responsibility that citizens in every par=
ty of every age all across the country has to contribute to our democracy=
 and to make our country great.



 Q Let me ask one on Chief Judge Garland. Any new activities coming down =
on him?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, he is doing a handful of meetings today. He is meetin=
g with Senator Rounds of South Dakota and Senator Nelson of Florida. Hes =
also doing a meeting with Senators Lankford and Inhofe of Oklahoma.=20



 I point this out because we also saw some interesting comments for forme=
r Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn yesterday -- maybe it was earlier today tha=
t he made these comments. He was often referred to as the conscience of t=
he Senate, and he made clear, in his typical avuncular style, that the Se=
nate should do its job, and that theres no excuse for Republicans refusin=
g to consider voting on the nomination of Chief Judge Garland.=20



 I don't think that he was vowing to vote for Chief Judge Garland if he w=
ere still in the Senate, but he was saying he would at least do his job. =
He would meet with the Chief Judge, and he would stand up before the Amer=
ican people and cast a vote. Obviously we would make a strong case to him=
 that Chief Judge Garland is deserving of his support, but there is no de=
nying, theres no argument, even among people who disagree with the admini=
stration, about the wisdom of appointing Chief Judge Garland to the Supre=
me Court -- that at the very least, the Presidents nominee deserves a hea=
ring and a vote.=20



 And hopefully that counsel from the former Republican senator of Oklahom=
a will have an influence over the current Republican senators from Oklaho=
ma.=20



 Toluse.



 Q Thanks, Josh. When the President was in London, he said that, on Syria=
, that wed looked at all the options and none of them are great. I'm wond=
ering if the President has asked his Defense Department for any options t=
hat would make it more difficult for the Assad regime to kill as many civ=
ilians as it has, something short of a full occupation, but something tha=
t would make it more difficult for the Assad regime that seems to have pr=
etty much carte blanche to kill civilians. Has the President asked for an=
y options that would specifically deal with that without going as far as =
a full no-fly zone or a full occupation in Syria?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, I guess I would just tell you that you should=
 take the President at his word that he has directed his team to consider=
 all options about the best way for the United States to degrade and ulti=
mately destroy ISIL and to do it in a way that is consistent with our nat=
ional security interests and our objectives.



 Conducting another ground invasion of another Middle Eastern country is =
not in our interest. We've learned the lessons of the previous war in Ira=
q. We know that we've got the best military in the world -- primarily bec=
ause the United States has the best sailors and soldiers and Marines and =
airmen in the world. But risking their lives to go occupy another country=
, put them in harms way, and to spend billions of dollars -- hundreds of =
billions of dollars to risk their lives, thinking that we can impose a mi=
litary solution on another country is foolish.=20



 That's not a criticism of our military. It's a criticism of policymakers=
 who have failed to understand the consequences of making a decision like=
 that.=20



 So the President and the national security advisors and policymakers on =
his team are aware of those consequences and they have considered all of =
those consequences as theyve looked for the best way for us to degrade an=
d ultimately destroy ISIL and bring about the kind of political transitio=
n inside of Syria that is long overdue. And we're going to continue to pr=
ess the Russians to use the influence that they have with the Assad regim=
e to bring an end to the violence and engage in talks about a political t=
ransition. We're going to continue to marshal the other influential count=
ries in the region to encourage the opposition to engage constructively i=
n those negotiations.



 Ultimately, it's a political solution that's required. President Assads =
failed political leadership is the root cause of all of these problems, a=
nd the only way we're going to solve them is to allow for a political tra=
nsition to a new leader that reflects the will and ambition of the Syrian=
 people, that has the capacity to unite that country to counter the extre=
mist threat that has encroached on their territory.=20



 And I wouldnt make the case to you that that's a simple solution. It cer=
tainly is not a solution that we're likely to see be imposed overnight. B=
ut it is the only solution that will achieve the objectives that the Pres=
ident has outlined.



 Q The President also said that we're going to play this option out if th=
e cessation falls apart, the U.S. going to try to put it together, and I =
think that stands in a bit of a contrast to folks who were talking about =
a plan B earlier on in this process. And I'm wondering if there still is =
a plan B. Is that something that the President and his advisors are still=
 looking at in terms of what to do if the cessation falls apart?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, I think this is exactly what the President wa=
s answering when he said he and his advisors have looked at all of the op=
tions and that none of them are good, and the United States is committed =
to supporting the international process to bring about a political transi=
tion inside of Syria.



 Look, even the Russians have indicated that they believe a political tra=
nsition is whats required. So it's just going to require the internationa=
l community continuing to chip away at this problem and try to bring all =
the parties to the table and jumpstart this process. But theres no denyin=
g how difficult that is or how long it's likely to take.



 Q A few more on Mr. Trump. You say you have better things to do than to =
watch or listen to the speech. Is that indicative of the point of view of=
 the White House generally? In other words, how seriously does this White=
 House take the foreign policy or the lack thereof of Mr. Trump?



 MR. EARNEST: I think it's indicative of the substantive questions I expe=
cted to receive in the context of this briefing, so I certainly take seri=
ously my responsibility to try to prepare for it.=20



Look, I think what I said is true, is that the American people will caref=
ully consider the presentations of candidates in both parties and theyll =
be watching closely, particularly when making a decision as important as =
who should be the Commander-in-Chief.=20



So in some ways, it doesnt really matter whether or not, in my context as=
 a White House spokesperson, I spend a lot of time watching the speeches =
delivered by other candidates. I suppose that it does matter in the conte=
xt of me as a voter. But in this case, the American people will have an o=
pportunity to decide.



Q -- the President himself -- Mr. Trump, after all, is the man who calls =
himself the presumptive Republican nominee. How seriously does the Presid=
ent take this speech? I don't think he had time to watch it because of a =
lunch with the Vice President, but how will he be informed of it, and how=
 interested is he in what was actually said?



MR. EARNEST: Well, the one candidate that you named has certainly not str=
uggled to get attention from all of you. And the President, as somebody w=
ho is an avid consumer of the media -- as youve heard me observe on a num=
ber of occasions -- so he certainly is aware of the debate that's going o=
n in the presidential race on both sides. And you won't have any -- again=
, given the amount of attention that's been lavished on a couple of these=
 candidates, the President doesnt have any trouble keeping up to speed on=
 what theyre saying.



Q One more, and I'll try and make it substantive. When Donald Trump says =
he wants to bring peace to the world, what do you make of that?

MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is true is that President Obama, over the=
 course of his presidency, has worked to unite the international communit=
y to confront a wide range of threats. And that is everything from unitin=
g the international community, to completing an agreement to fight climat=
e change. That is making the American people safer. And that is evidence =
of the United States using our influence to work with China and other cou=
ntries with large economies to make an agreement like this possible.=20

This is also true when it comes to Iran and their nuclear program. As I m=
entioned, when President Obama took office, the international community w=
as fractured in terms of considering how exactly to confront Iran in thei=
r nuclear ambitions. But President Obama demonstrated the leadership that=
 was required to unite the international community behind a strategy that=
 would impose sanctions on Iran until they came to the table and committe=
d in a verifiable fashion to not pursuing a nuclear weapon. That's exactl=
y what we've done. That has also made the world safer.

At the same time, the President has not hesitated to order military actio=
n where necessary to protect the American people. President Obama after a=
ll -- we're coming up on the fifth anniversary of President Obama decidin=
g to order our military to go after Osama bin Laden. And because of the b=
ravery and courage and dedication of our national security professionals,=
 including our men and women in uniform, that operation was successful. A=
nd that certainly has enhanced our national security and made the America=
n people safer. That's just one example of countless military operations =
that President Obama as a Commander-in-Chief has ordered to take terroris=
ts off the battlefield.=20

And again, it's a testament to the bravery, courage and professionalism a=
nd skill of our men and women in uniform that those operations have taken=
 a large number of terrorists off the battlefield. That has made the Amer=
ican people safer. That's made the world a safer place. But there continu=
e to be threats. And the President's success in strengthening our allianc=
es and strengthening our partnerships around the world, building a coalit=
ion of 65 nations to counter ISIL, including a number of Muslim-majority =
nations in the Middle East, have all been advances that have enhanced our=
 standing in the world and enhanced our national security. And so the Pre=
sident's record on those issues is quite strong, and to the extent that a=
nybody wants to have a debate about that, the President will not shy away=
 from it.

Dave.

Q Has the White House been in touch with former Senator Coburn about the =
nomination?

MR. EARNEST: I dont know of any -- I certainly dont know of any president=
ial-level conversations with former Senator Coburn about Chief Judge Garl=
and's nomination.=20

Q Any sub-presidential talks?

MR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?

Q Do you know of any sub-presidential-level talks?

MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any off the top of my head, but I wouldnt r=
ule them out either.

Q One other thing. There's a House subcommittee tomorrow that's holding a=
 hearing on the President's plan to transfer Gitmo detainees to the U.S. =
There's going to be some local officials from South Carolina -- Governor =
Haley and some people from Kansas testifying in opposition to the plan, c=
alling it dangerous. At this point, do you see any encouraging signs that=
 Congress will take up your plan and move forward on it this year? Or it =
is a dead-end?

MR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's unclear. There's no evidence I can point =
to. I think I would just point out that there are national security profe=
ssionals on both sides who think that it's dangerous to keep the prison a=
t Guantanamo Bay open and that the proposal that the President has put fo=
rward is actually that makes us safer.=20

Just to go back to your previous question, even though I dont know of any=
 conversations between White House or administration officials and former=
 Senator Coburn, obviously Senator Coburn was a pretty conservative Repub=
lican, and his personal affection for President Obama is well-known and c=
ertainly transcends their partisan differences, but I dont have any reaso=
n to believe that he was communicating anything other than his own person=
al view with his own personal conviction about how important it is for th=
e Senate to vote on Chief Judge Garland's nomination because it's their c=
onstitutional responsibility to do so.

John, I'll give you the last one.

Q Thank you, Josh. When the President met with Chancellor Merkel, did the=
y have any discussions -- as we were previously led to expect -- about th=
e continuing and rising economic crisis in Greece, as well as the refugee=
 crisis?

MR. EARNEST: I dont have any more details to share in terms of their priv=
ate conversation. But I think I can just say as a general matter that the=
re are a range of issues that were discussed that have a direct impact on=
 the unity of the EU. And obviously questions about the economy and the f=
inancial health of the European Union is something that was discussed, bu=
t I dont know in how much detail they discussed the situation in Greece.

Q And is there any concern within the White House about what appears to b=
e an obvious deadlock between the creditors over the Greek debt situation=
 and the International Monetary Fund?

MR. EARNEST: I dont have any detailed knowledge of those ongoing discussi=
ons. Obviously we're very supportive of the efforts that members of the E=
U have made to deal with the financial challenges posed by Greece's finan=
ces. Part of that agreement included Greece following through on a number=
 of structural reforms, and we certainly believe that Greece has a respon=
sibility to do that. But we've been clear all along that effective coordi=
nation among Greece and the other EU was going to be critical to resolvin=
g that situation in a way that didnt undermine the fundamentals of the Eu=
ropean economy.

Thanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">1:08 P.M. EDT<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You did=
n&#8217;t wait and finish watching Trump --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nb=
sp; I didn&#8217;t start, either.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I'll catch the hi=
ghlights later on tonight.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sa=
id &quot;Tan-zania.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yeah, =
apparently the phonetics are not included on the teleprompter.&nbsp; (Laugh=
ter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All right, on to more ser=
ious topics.&nbsp; Kevin, do you want to start?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.=
&nbsp; Josh, can you talk a bit about the President's trip to Flint, Michig=
an?&nbsp; Why now?&nbsp; What does he hope to accomplish?&nbsp; And is it d=
esigned to put more pressure on Congress to do more to help that area?<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Kevin, you saw that the President had written a letter in response to a you=
ng girl in Flint who had asked the President to spend some time meeting wit=
h the residents of Flint to show and remind
 them that the American people continue to keep that community in mind as t=
hey deal with some pretty significant challenges.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The President is prepared=
 to travel there next month -- next week, and demonstrate that while the pu=
blic discussion of this situation doesn&#8217;t retain the same spot in the=
 limelight, the administration is committed
 to following through on helping that community recover.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, we certainly would w=
elcome a greater commitment -- or, frankly, any commitment -- from Republic=
ans in Congress to responding to this situation.&nbsp; The administration h=
as marshalled significant resources to help
 that community respond.&nbsp; There was the urgent provision of bottled wa=
ter and filters by FEMA in the immediate aftermath of the situation.&nbsp; =
But over the longer term, there's been a commitment by the administration t=
o expanding Medicaid to ensure that more citizens
 across Flint can get access to needed health care.&nbsp; There have been g=
rants provided to local health care providers to expand their capacity to p=
rovide immediate needed health care.&nbsp; The EPA has ramped up their moni=
toring of the water supply, and this expanded
 testing can verify that the appropriate steps are being taken to restore s=
afe drinking water to Flint.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So there are a number of =
things that the administration has done, but there are significant underlyi=
ng problems that can only be addressed through congressional action.&nbsp; =
And I also think that the President will
 note that the administration is committed to responding to the situation b=
oth to help the people of Flint recover but also to make sure that a simila=
r situation is not being experienced in communities all across the country.=
&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And you've seen the EPA, =
months ago -- or at least more than a month ago -- write a letter to govern=
ors across the country, outlining exactly how the lead and copper rule will=
 be enforced to ensure that a situation
 like this isn&#8217;t repeated.&nbsp; And that certainly stands in stark c=
ontrast to some Republicans in Congress who advocate for the eliminating of=
 the EPA.&nbsp; How exactly is that going to improve the situation?&nbsp; T=
his is the agency that is principally responsible for
 protecting our clean air and clean water.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So as you can tell from m=
y answer to your question, there's a lot to talk about in Flint, and the Pr=
esident is looking forward to taking advantage of this opportunity to ensur=
e that the people of Flint understand
 that we're going to follow through on our response and to make sure they u=
nderstand that the American people haven&#8217;t forgotten.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is th=
e administration confident that EPA leaders have been held fully accountabl=
e for what occurred there?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Kevin, there's more than one ongoing investigation.&nbsp; And so when it co=
mes to accountability, I've refrained from weighing in in a lot of detail b=
ecause I don&#8217;t want to be perceived as even attempting
 to influence those ongoing investigations in one form or another.&nbsp; So=
 we'll let those move forward.&nbsp; But the President certainly believes i=
n accountability.&nbsp; And as the President of the United States, the Pres=
ident takes responsibility for a lot of things.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And n=
ow that we have a clearer picture of this year's presidential race, does Pr=
esident Obama consider Hillary Clinton to be the presumptive nominee?&nbsp;=
 Does he have any near-term plans for rallying Democrats
 around her candidacy?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
the Democratic voters will determine who the Democratic nominee is going to=
 be, and Republican voters will determine who the Republican nominee is goi=
ng to be.&nbsp; And that's the way that our process
 was structured, and the President participated in that process by casting =
a vote of his own in the Illinois primary.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But, ultimately, the vote=
rs will decide and the candidates will make their own individual decisions =
about how long to pursue the nomination.&nbsp; And that's a perfectly appro=
priate decision for them to make on their
 own.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any details to announce at this point about =
when the President will be engaged in this debate, but he most assuredly wi=
ll once the general election has begun.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh,=
 just one final one.&nbsp; How serious is the threat of the legislation fro=
m Senator Cotton to prevent the U.S. from purchasing heavy-water from Iran?=
&nbsp; Is the White House prepared to veto that legislation?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Kevin, I learned shortly before coming out here that this legislation did n=
ot succeed in getting the sufficient number of votes in the Senate to end d=
ebate.&nbsp; So that is an indication that there
 is not likely to be the necessary support in the United States Senate to a=
dd that amendment to this broader appropriations bill.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But we've made clear our =
commitment to a principle that ideologically motivated policy riders are no=
t appropriate for appropriations bills.&nbsp; And that is the -- you all ha=
ve written extensively about Senator Cotton's
 repeated commitment to undermining the successful implementation of the in=
ternational agreement among Iran and some of our closest allies to prevent =
them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; So it is clear what the intent =
of his amendment is.&nbsp; Senator Cotton
 is certainly no expert when it comes to heavy-water.&nbsp; I'm confident t=
hat he couldn&#8217;t differentiate heavy-water from sparkling water.&nbsp;=
 His focus is on undermining the effective implementation of this agreement=
 that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we'll have to see if -=
- but right now, I guess I'd say that we're gratified that this has not adv=
anced in the Senate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Tim.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&n=
bsp; Back to Flint.&nbsp; Given that the federal EPA -- there were problems=
 there, there were failures there -- and you mentioned some of the FEMA mon=
ey, but Congress is not being able to get money through.&nbsp; So
 can we expect some other way to get federal money to the people in Flint?<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I didn&#8217;t hear the entirety of the first part of your question.&nbsp; =
What did you say about the EPA?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just =
the failures there, that the EPA was at fault for not telling -- there was =
a scientist there who knew about the poisoning, but within the EPA the mess=
age didn&#8217;t get out and was delayed there.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
there continues to be an investigation into the EPA's response to the situa=
tion.&nbsp; So, again, I'm going to reserve judgment on that.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there have been some co=
nclusions that have been reached about the conduct at the state agency that=
 was responsible for protecting the water supply in Flint.&nbsp; And there =
are at least three individuals who have been indicted for their
 conduct by the Michigan Attorney General.&nbsp; And I'd also point out tha=
t it was the independent commission that was established by Governor Snyder=
 who pointed out that &quot;the Michigan Department of Environmental Qualit=
y failed in its fundamental responsibility
 to effectively enforce drinking water regulations.&quot;&nbsp; So, again, =
I think when it comes to accountability, the agencies that have looked at t=
his thus far and reported some results have raised significant concerns abo=
ut what was happening at the state level.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There continues to be an in=
vestigation of the entire response and the potential role of the federal re=
gulators.&nbsp; And, again, I'm certainly not going to say anything that's =
going to try to -- that could be perceived as influencing the
 outcome of those investigations.&nbsp; But the investigations that have be=
en completed thus far have focused most of their attention, if not all, on =
the conduct of state officials.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More generally, the reason =
that Congress has not acted on funding for Flint is because Republicans say=
 they oppose it.&nbsp; So it's not just congressional dysfunction that has =
prevented the appropriation of this money, but rather because
 Republicans oppose providing it.&nbsp; And that's despite the conscientiou=
s work of people like Senator Stabenow and Senator Peters, in particular, b=
ut other Democrats who have said that Congress has a role and a responsibil=
ity for making sure that the state of
 Michigan and the city of Flint has available resources.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to the admini=
stration, our options are a little bit more limited.&nbsp; But you saw that=
 earlier this year the administration expedited some grant funding that was=
 relevant to water infrastructure projects to try to provide
 additional resources to the state of Michigan that could be used in Flint =
to address this situation.&nbsp; We'll continue to look for other ways that=
 we can offer up assistance, both as it relates to infrastructure but also =
as it relates to health care and other
 emergency funding.&nbsp; But there's a role for Congress to play, and righ=
t now it's Republicans who are preventing those necessary steps from occurr=
ing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whe=
n can we expect the EPA to change the lead and copper rule?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; You'd ha=
ve to talk to them about whether or not that's something they're considerin=
g.&nbsp; The concern that has been expressed is that there was a little bit=
 of ambiguity about the most effective way to enforce that rule,
 and that's precisely why you saw the administrator of the EPA write a lett=
er to governors all across the country making clear exactly how the EPA was=
 prepared to enforce that rule.&nbsp; And she did that because she's focuse=
d on making sure that what happened in
 Flint doesn't crop up in a whole bunch of communities across the country.&=
nbsp; And I think this is prudent and effective leadership of learning from=
 shortcomings, and making sure they aren't replicated in other situations.&=
nbsp; That's responsible leadership and it's
 certainly something that the EPA Administrator, Gina McCarthy, takes quite=
 seriously.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on =
Puerto Rico, there's a payment due on Sunday and then one in July.&nbsp; Bu=
t it looks like the bill -- rescue package -- whatever you want to call it =
-- is being delayed.&nbsp; Is there anything the White House can do to spee=
d that
 along?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST: &nbsp;Well, Ti=
m, I'm not sure what it would be.&nbsp; We rolled out a proposal 188 or 189=
 days ago, and we haven't seen much activity from the Republicans who are i=
n charge of the House of Representatives.&nbsp; We did see a commitment
 from the Republican leadership in the House to move on a legislative packa=
ge for Puerto Rico in the first quarter of this year, and we haven't seen n=
early as much movement as we would like.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think among some Republic=
an leaders there has been a genuine effort that's been made, but among many=
 other Republicans there has just been a refusal to embrace their responsib=
ility to govern.&nbsp; I think you can detect what I expect
 will be a bit of an emerging pattern over the course of this briefing that=
 we're going to spend a lot of time talking about how Republicans in Congre=
ss aren't doing their job, and that when it comes to core priorities, you'v=
e got an administration that is
 putting forward ideas, that is offering up specific proposals, making spec=
ific recommendations, and doing everything within our power to try to addre=
ss problems.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you have a Republican m=
ajority in both the House and the Senate that seems much more committed to =
playing political games and engaging in political obstruction than actually=
 using the majority that they fought so hard to win to
 strengthen the country.&nbsp; And that's unfortunate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How con=
cerned is the White House that, even if Republicans come to a deal, that th=
ere's going to be items attached, like the minimum wage, that the Democrats=
 have --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
at certainly would be consistent with what I just said.&nbsp; Attempting to=
 add completely unrelated ideological riders to a piece of legislation that=
 would give the government of Puerto Rico the restructuring authority
 that they need to try to prevent an economic and humanitarian disaster on =
an island that's inhabited by 3 million Americans is a failure of leadershi=
p on the part of Republicans.&nbsp; And I don't know exactly what they're g=
oing to do, but what I do know is that
 the longer that we go with Republicans blocking responsible legislation th=
at is not a bailout, but does give the Puerto Rican government the opportun=
ity to restructure their debts in a way that would allow them to implement =
some economic and fiscal reforms,
 means that we're only getting closer to a bailout actually being required.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's why we continue t=
o make a strong case that Republican obstruction of this critical legislati=
on only makes a bailout more likely.&nbsp; But hopefully that&#8217;s somet=
hing that we can avoid.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, i=
s the little girl from Flint who wrote the President coming to the White Ho=
use this week?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
know the answer to that.&nbsp; I don't believe that she is.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ask=
ed if she could come by.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, and=
 I believe in the President's response he noted that he was looking forward=
 to traveling to Flint and having an opportunity to meet with her there.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How doe=
s a letter like that get in front of the President?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, as=
 you know, Mark, there's a process where the White House Correspondence Off=
ice will consider the thousands of pieces of correspondence that's received=
 by the White House, either through the postal service or via
 e-mail, and they process that material and they choose about 10 letters ea=
ch day that are a representative sample of the letters that have been recei=
ved by the White House that day, and they put them in front of the Presiden=
t.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that=
 was one of the 10-a-day?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That's o=
ften how this process works.&nbsp; Occasionally, if the President shows int=
erest in a particular area, they may seek out additional pieces of correspo=
ndence that they can show the President.&nbsp; I do not know whether
 this young lady's letter was one of the 10, but I do know that the Preside=
nt has reviewed several pieces of correspondence that are directly related =
to the situation in Flint.&nbsp; And I just don't know whether or not her l=
etter was included in the Flint-related
 correspondence that was presented to the President, or if her letter was p=
art of the 10 letters a day that the President reviews on a variety of topi=
cs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On poli=
tics, Donald Trump said again today that he believes President Obama was sn=
ubbed because President Castro was not at the airport to greet him when he =
arrived in Havana.&nbsp; Did the White House see that as a snub or arriving
 anywhere and the head of state is not there to greet the President?<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nbsp=
; And, Mark, as you know, it is not at all uncommon for the President to ha=
ve formal meetings with heads of state when he travels not to participate i=
n ceremonial arrival ceremonies with heads of state when he arrives
 at the airport.&nbsp; And so those of you who traveled with the President =
to Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Germany may have observed that neit=
her the leader of Saudi Arabia, nor the United Kingdom, nor Germany met the=
 President at the airport.&nbsp; So it rather
 is -- so it is most common for the President to be received by a lower lev=
el official at the airport so that the senior level official, the head of t=
he government or the head of -- the most senior official in the country can=
 meet with the President more formally.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And las=
tly, is President Obama planning on addressing the Democratic Convention in=
 July?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
believe that's something that we've announced at this point.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's =
why I'm asking.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I certai=
nly would expect that the President would do so.&nbsp; I do not know at thi=
s point whether or not a date has been selected.&nbsp; Presumably, that's s=
omething that we would coordinate with the Democratic nominee, once one
 has been chosen.&nbsp; So we'll keep you posted on that, though.<o:p></o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the =
ongoing fight over Zika funding, Republicans continue to insist that there'=
s enough remaining money in the pipeline to address this.&nbsp; And the Spe=
aker actually went a step further by saying -- or rather accusing the admin=
istration
 of having, as he put it, a bit of a track record of over-requesting what i=
s needed.&nbsp; Just wonder if you're confident that the amount that's bein=
g requested will be --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That's i=
nteresting.&nbsp; The Republican Congress certainly has a well-established =
track record of under-performing in response to those requests.&nbsp; This =
is the latest example of that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes that can be attri=
buted to just a difference of opinion about what&#8217;s needed.&nbsp; That=
's not a plausible explanation in this case.&nbsp; You have the Director of=
 the National Institute of Health and a high-ranking official from the
 Centers for Disease Control standing at this podium about three weeks ago =
and say they did not have the resources that they needed that should be use=
d to fully prepare for the onset of the Zika virus.&nbsp; So these are expe=
rts.&nbsp; These are not political appointees
 of the President of the United States.&nbsp; These are legitimate scientif=
ic experts who are responsible for protecting the health and safety of the =
American people.&nbsp; And they said that Congress had not provided them wi=
th all of the resources that they believe
 are necessary to do everything possible to prepare the country for the Zik=
a virus.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is notable primarily b=
ecause when we initially put forward our request, Speaker Ryan indicated th=
at there is &#8220;plenty of money in the pipeline right now that can go to=
 Zika.&#8221;&nbsp; Then just a couple of weeks ago, he said that funding
 for Zika should go through the normal process.&nbsp; Presumably, he said t=
hat before the process completely broke down in the House of Representative=
s that he leads.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And now he&#8217;s saying=
 that somehow they don't have enough information to evaluate our request.&n=
bsp; He says that despite the fact that discussions of the Zika virus have =
emerged in 48 different congressional hearings.&nbsp;
 There was a briefing that was offered to every member of Congress in both =
the House and the Senate so that they could hear directly from our nation&#=
8217;s top scientists, so they could understand exactly what the threat is.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">There have been ample opp=
ortunities for members of Congress who have questions to ask them.&nbsp; Th=
ere have been a variety of answers that have been given.&nbsp; The administ=
ration put forward a specific proposal, dated
 February 22nd, with lots of details about what exactly these resources wou=
ld do to make the country safer and to allow us to prepare for the Zika vir=
us.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What&#8217;s interesting =
about this situation is, as I mentioned yesterday, we often can't predict e=
xactly where a flood is going to hit; we don't know the exact path of a tor=
nado.&nbsp; These are emergencies that we cannot
 specifically prepare for; we can in general.&nbsp; We know which regions o=
f the country are more likely to be flooded or more likely to be hit by a t=
ornado.&nbsp; In this situation, we do have an opportunity.&nbsp; We have m=
onths that could have been used to prepare for
 the onset of this virus.&nbsp; And yet, that time has been frittered away =
by Republicans who have refused to do what is necessary to protect the coun=
try from a genuine public health emergency.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyon=
d the $600,000 million in remaining Ebola funding that's already been alloc=
ated, it seems there&#8217;s several hundreds of millions left, still remai=
ning in Ebola funding.&nbsp; As the stalemate continues, is that
 an area where you may be looking to free up some remaining funding, or not=
?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
that certainly would not be our preference.&nbsp; Look, when we were in the=
 midst of what was then described by many people publicly as an Ebola crisi=
s, there were legitimate questions asked by all
 of you in this room of me while I was standing here why we hadn&#8217;t do=
ne more to prepare for the situation.&nbsp; And we eventually were able to =
secure necessary resources from Congress to begin to take the appropriate s=
teps to ensure that our public health system
 and, frankly, the public health system in other countries where the Ebola =
virus is most likely to emerge, were oriented to try to protect us from the=
 Ebola virus.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Why we would now go and u=
ndermine those investments and dedicate them to something else only because=
 Congress wouldn't act is not a wise decision.&nbsp; The wise decision is t=
o take the investments that we've already
 made in protecting the country from Ebola, making sure they continue to be=
 effectively spent, and also using the resources of this country to protect=
 the American people from the Zika virus.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This is not that complica=
ted.&nbsp; This should be a pretty straightforward policy decision.&nbsp; B=
ut unfortunately, as I've mentioned, Republicans, who spent years in the mi=
nority throwing sand in the gears of government,
 have kept throwing the sand in the gears, despite the fact they are now in=
 charge of the government when it comes to the House of Representatives and=
 the United States Senate.&nbsp; That raises questions, frankly, why they c=
hose to run in the first place.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And o=
ne question on the campaign.&nbsp; It was around this time in 2008 when Sen=
ator Feinstein brokered a meeting between then Senator Obama and Hillary Cl=
inton to try and bring the two together and unite the party.&nbsp;
 Does the President at all feel obligated to try and foster a similar meeti=
ng between Senators Clinton and Sanders, and does he think that such a meet=
ing would benefit the candidates and the party at this point?<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm no=
t aware of any discussions about a brokered meeting, at least, that involve=
 the White House.&nbsp; Look, as you&#8217;ve heard me say on many occasion=
s, there were predictions in 2008 that the longer than
 expected Democratic primary was going to have a negative impact on the eve=
ntual nominee.&nbsp; That didn&#8217;t prove to be true.&nbsp; In some stat=
es that had not recently been the host of a competitive primary, it gave De=
mocrats in those states the opportunity to build
 an infrastructure.&nbsp; And it certainly created opportunities for Democr=
ats in 2008 to win in states that Democrats hadn&#8217;t won in a while.&nb=
sp; Indiana is a good example of that.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that's why I think you=
&#8217;ll find a lot of people, at least in this administration, who still =
have vivid memories of the 2008 race, that we understand that these kinds o=
f contests can sometimes go on longer than
 expected, but that's not automatically a bad thing -- particularly when th=
e debate is focused on substantive issues that are worthy of a significant =
public debate.&nbsp; And there certainly is no shortage of those.<o:p></o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
s, Josh.&nbsp; One thing that the Republicans on the Hill seem to repeatedl=
y ask for with regard to the Zika funding is a rundown of what exactly is n=
eeded for this year versus next year.&nbsp; And that's not an
 answer that they've gotten either from the White House or, they say, anywh=
ere else in the administration.&nbsp; Is that a number that's noble?&nbsp; =
Is there a reason that you haven&#8217;t provided that to them?&nbsp; Becau=
se they seem to be pointing to that as the reason that
 they can't go forward on figuring out what they might be able to free up f=
or this year.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
again, I think you get differing explanations depending on who you ask.&nbs=
p; Obviously there appears to be, based on public reports, an effort to put=
 specific numbers on paper on the Senate side.&nbsp;
 So certainly members of the Senate -- Democrats and Republicans -- feel li=
ke they have necessary information to start working on a bill.&nbsp; We hav=
en&#8217;t had the top to take a close look at it, so it's unclear at this =
point whether or not that's something that
 we would believe is sufficient for the task.&nbsp; So it's a little hard t=
o take seriously criticism from Republicans in the House that they don&#821=
7;t have enough information to write the bill when there are Republicans in=
 the Senate who are working with Democrats
 who are writing a bill.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think, separately, what=
 we've also gone to great lengths to try to explain is that while we are co=
ncerned about ensuring that we have sufficient resources over the course of=
 this summer and fall to fight Zika,
 we need to make sure we're laying the groundwork for an effective long-ter=
m response.&nbsp; For example, despite the remarkable scientific capacity o=
f the United States and the United States government, our experts do not an=
ticipate that we will have an effective
 vaccine against Zika available this summer.&nbsp; But if we want to have o=
ne available by next summer or the summer after that, we need to start doin=
g research now, and we need to start doing clinical trials now.&nbsp; And w=
e need to demonstrate a commitment from the
 federal government to be a customer for those vaccines so that private sec=
tor entities that have a capacity to manufacture that vaccine will pursue i=
t.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the point is, we are g=
oing to need resources and a commitment of resources over the long term.&nb=
sp; And this is something that we have discussed in both private and in pub=
lic with members of the House and the Senate.&nbsp;
 So it's just a little hard to take very seriously these complaints when th=
ere's ample information that's been provided.&nbsp; There are a wide range =
of discussions that have occurred.&nbsp; And those discussions have actuall=
y resulted in members of the Senate working
 in bipartisan fashion to draft legislation.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t understand=
 why they can't do that in the House.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But w=
hen you talk about long term, I mean, these are emergency funds that are be=
ing requested in a supplemental.&nbsp; So you can understand why there migh=
t be some opposition on the Hill to providing funding that
 you're talking about for a long-term response in an emergency fashion.&nbs=
p; I'm just wondering if you can distinguish between one and the other, if =
that's possible.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Right.=
&nbsp; It's an emergency because we need to start working on that vaccine r=
ight now.&nbsp; If we don&#8217;t start working now on that vaccine -- well=
, let me say it this way.&nbsp; The most effective way to protect
 the country from the Zika virus is to develop a vaccine.&nbsp; And we know=
 that developing a vaccine takes time.&nbsp; It also requires a long-term c=
ommitment of resources both to conduct clinical trials, but also to manufac=
ture a large quantity of the vaccine so that
 we can protect a large number of Americans.&nbsp; And every day that goes =
by now, where we haven&#8217;t made a long-term commitment to that vaccine,=
 is a day lost to the eventual implementation of that vaccine.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we need a commitment n=
ow.&nbsp; And we don&#8217;t just need a commitment now for two or three mo=
nths; we need a commitment for a couple of years, so that private sector ph=
armaceutical companies will know that there will
 be a customer for their vaccine if they implement the resources now to dev=
eloping it.&nbsp; And that's why it's urgent.&nbsp; It's urgent because we =
need to get started now.&nbsp; But it's not just going to apply to this fis=
cal year because it's going to take more than a
 year to develop tests and manufacture a vaccine.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just =
one more on a separate issue.&nbsp; Eighty-one senators wrote to the Presid=
ent earlier this week, asking for what they called a substantially enhanced=
 new long-term agreement with Israel with regard to U.S.
 military aid.&nbsp; Could you give us an update on where the talks stand w=
ith regard to sort of closing that 10-year deal?&nbsp; You've been negotiat=
ing now since December.&nbsp; We've heard you say repeatedly that the U.S. =
is willing to increase the level of aid, but it's
 not clear what the hang-up would be between now and December being able to=
 close the deal on it since Israel and the U.S. both seem to be willing to =
make an agreement.&nbsp; What's holding it up?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Julie, I think I want to start by just pointing out that the idea for exten=
ding this agreement between the United States and Israel originated with Pr=
esident Obama back in 2013.&nbsp; So it's the
 President who, for I believe three years now, has been advocating for the =
extension of this agreement. &nbsp;And the idea was that this agreement tha=
t I believe extends to -- the agreement that's currently in place I believe=
 extends to 2018.&nbsp; And the thought was
 that by beginning negotiations early, the United States can provide some s=
ignificant assurance to the nation of Israel that our commitment to their s=
ecurity is enduring.&nbsp; But over those three years, a lot has happened t=
hat has had an impact on the effective
 coordination related to those negotiations.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the talks continue.&n=
bsp; And what the United States has committed to do is to ramp up the assis=
tance that we provide to Israel in a way that would allow Israel to be the =
recipient of more national security aid than
 any other country has ever received from the United States.&nbsp; That is =
an indication of the depth of this country and this administration's commit=
ment to Israel's security.&nbsp; Working out the details, though, is compli=
cated.&nbsp; And there are a number of technical
 details that have to be worked through.&nbsp; There are also questions rel=
ated to reaching an assessment of the threat that Israel faces, and making =
sure that the assistance that is provided is most effectively oriented to c=
ounter that threat.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So these are issues that =
take some time to work through, but there is a strong commitment on the par=
t of this administration and on the part of this country to providing resou=
rces to the nation of Israel so that
 they can defend themselves.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But y=
ou&#8217;re making it sound like the President and this administration is c=
ommitted to it, and leaving open the question of whether Israel is really w=
illing to come to the table at this point.&nbsp; Have they refused
 these offers, these repeated offers of the most unprecedented military aid=
 that any nation has ever received from the United States?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think we have acknowledged previously that there was a period prior to la=
st December where there was at least some reticence on the part of the Isra=
elis to engage in these conversations.&nbsp; But
 those talks were restarted back in December.&nbsp; And since then, there h=
ave been active discussions between national security officials in both cou=
ntries about reaching this agreement.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I don&#8217;t have an=
 updated timeframe for you in terms of when we expect an agreement to be co=
mpleted, but the work to try to reach that agreement remains ongoing.<o:p><=

 people who are concerned around the world.&nbsp; I'm not asking to dispute=
 point by point what he said, because there was a lot of criticism in sayin=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; We mig=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- th=
at the U.S. treated Iran with tender love and care; that the U.S. is not a =
friend to Israel; that rivals no longer respect us, et cetera -- concluding=
 that the foreign policy is reckless, rudderless, and
 aimless.&nbsp; Just in general terms, can you tell us what is the Presiden=
t's thinking about what he has hoped to accomplish over the last two terms =
and his impact around the world.&nbsp; And also, how does the White House p=
repare for something like this when you have
 Trump coming out, dissecting this with this kind of criticism?&nbsp; Does =
the President anticipate world leaders, ambassadors, people starting to mak=
e phone calls of concern about what he is saying in light of the fact that =
he is so close to becoming the nominee?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think you've heard the President already speak at some length about the con=
cerns that he has heard from other world leaders about the tone and tenor o=
f the presidential debate in the United States.&nbsp; The President
 has already spoken to that.&nbsp; I think when it comes to this President'=
s foreign policy, there is no denying that the United States is safer and s=
tronger than we were when President Obama took office back in January of 20=
09.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there are a variety of =
ways to measure it.&nbsp; You can certainly carefully consider the economic=
 situation of the United States.&nbsp; That certainly has an impact on the =
influence that we wield around the world.&nbsp; Right now, the U.S. economy=
,
 because of the longest streak of private sector job growth in American his=
tory that we've enjoyed over the last 73 or so months resulting in more tha=
n 14 million private-sector jobs created, the United States continues to be=
 the envy of the world when it comes
 to having such a durable economy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it relates to protecting=
 the United States from very specific threats, when President Obama took of=
fice, there was a genuine concern about the likelihood that Iran would deve=
lop a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; And at the time, the international
 community was fractured in terms of considering how, exactly, to respond t=
o the situation.&nbsp; But because of President Obama's leadership, we unit=
ed the world in imposing stringent sanctions on the Iranian government and =
on the Iranian economy that compelled
 them to come to the table, and compelled them to agree to a diplomatic agr=
eement that prevents them from obtaining a nuclear weapon and establishes a=
 verification regime, inspections, that allow us to verify that Iran has no=
t developed a nuclear weapon and
 that they are actually abiding by the terms of the deal.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we've also seen is a s=
trengthening of our alliances around the world.&nbsp; We've seen an effecti=
ve renewed focus on the Asia Pacific region that has both positive economic=
 and strategic benefits for the United States.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the President has got =
a strong record to run on, to say nothing of the advances that we've made i=
n improving our relationship with countries throughout the Western Hemisphe=
re, in part because of the President's
 historic agreement or policy change to begin normalizing relations with Cu=
ba.&nbsp; This has revolutionized the kinds of relationships that the Unite=
d States has with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere.&nbsp; In fac=
t, a country like Argentina that had long
 elected leaders that were deeply skeptical of the United States has now el=
ected a leader that President Obama met with just last month who ran on a p=
latform of warmer relations with the United States.&nbsp; It didn't happen =
by accident.&nbsp; That happened because of
 a renewed commitment to engagement by this administration in the hemispher=
e, and a commitment to moving past the kinds of obstacles that have stood i=
n the way of those warmer relations for decades.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So historians will have amp=
le opportunity to consider this President's policies, and I wouldn't be sur=
prised if they're the subject of extensive debate over the next several mon=
ths and through the fall.&nbsp; In fact, we'd welcome that
 opportunity to have that debate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How muc=
h of the President's time is really devoted to reassuring allies and others=
 that there's not going to be a dramatic change in foreign policy?&nbsp; Be=
cause obviously there are many world leaders and people in the diplomatic
 community who are very, very concerned about what they hear from Trump.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, the President has been clear that this is something that comes up freq=
uently in his conversations, and the President's response has been to reass=
ure them that the President retains significant confidence
 in the wisdom of the American people to continue to pursue policies that a=
re in the best interest of the United States and are focused on strengtheni=
ng our alliances around the world, and ensuring the safety and security of =
the American people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On anot=
her matter, does the administration have any reaction to former Speaker Den=
ny Hastert, sentenced today by a judge to 15 months imprisonment?&nbsp; The=
 judge calling him a serial child molester, and Hastert apologizing for wha=
t
 he calls &quot;mistreating boys&quot; when he was a wrestling coach.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have a specific response to that.&nbsp; Obviously, this is part of our crim=
inal justice system carrying out its mandate.&nbsp; And I don't have a spec=
ific response to it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, I=
 want to ask you a couple things on two different subjects.&nbsp; One, on t=
he issue of Donald Trump, he brought up this issue of foreign policy today.=
&nbsp; And I want to ask you some things about ISIS.&nbsp; He said once he =
becomes President,
 he would eliminate ISIS.&nbsp; In your conversations with world leaders, n=
ational security, intelligence officials, as well as generals on the ground=
, has there ever been any concrete, one-stop-shop, we can eliminate ISIS in=
 your conversations over ISIS?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the President has been clear about what his strategy is for degrading=
 and ultimately destroying ISIL.&nbsp; And this is a strategy that requires=
 intensive cooperation with countries, partners, and allies around
 the world.&nbsp; And the President devoted a significant portion of his ju=
st-completed foreign trip to discussing how to intensify that coordination.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The progress that we've mad=
e on the ground against ISIL in both Iraq and in Syria has been noteworthy.=
&nbsp; In Iraq, the calculations are that we have driven ISIL out of about =
40 percent of the territory on the ground that they previously
 controlled.&nbsp; In Syria, the number is somewhat smaller, but it's about=
 16 percent, which represents important progress.&nbsp; And this isn't just=
 large swaths of unpopulated desert land; these are populated areas that ha=
ve been retaken from ISIL.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing that has at=
tracted a lot of attention in recent days is our ongoing efforts to shut do=
wn ISIL's financing.&nbsp; The United States has worked effectively with co=
untries around the world, including countries in the region,
 to counter ISIL's ability to finance their reign of terror.&nbsp; And we h=
ave worked closely with the Emirates, for example, to limit the ability of =
ISIL to access international financial networks.&nbsp; But we've also been =
able to coordinate among intelligence officials,
 finance officials, and military officials to actually carry out military s=
trikes against some of ISIL's cash stockpiles.&nbsp; And there is extensive=
 reporting to indicate that ISIL is now having trouble paying its fighters =
on time.&nbsp; In some cases, there is even
 evidence that ISIL has slashed payments to their fighters, and this has ha=
d a very negative impact on morale.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just give you one mo=
re example.&nbsp; The President has been focused, dating back to the fall o=
f 2014, on shutting down the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and in Syria.=
&nbsp; One of the concerns that the international community originally
 had was that ISIL was able to rather easily replenish its ranks and that e=
ven as Iraqi security forces or coalition airstrikes were able to take ISIL=
 fighters off the battlefield, there were so many ISIL fighters from around=
 the world that were being recruited
 that they could easily replace those fighters who had been killed.&nbsp; T=
here was even more concern about some of those fighters using their passpor=
ts to return home and carry out attacks in their home countries.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the coordinated =
diplomacy of the United States and many of our partners, we have drasticall=
y reduced the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and in Syria.&nbsp; This beg=
an with the President chairing a United Nations Security Council
 meeting to discuss this issue.&nbsp; It was enhanced by the efforts of our=
 allies in Turkey taking important steps to better secure their border with=
 Syria, but we know that the flow of foreign fighters has not been entirely=
 shut off, but it is significantly lower
 than it was before.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is all an indicatio=
n that we have made progress, important progress in the fight against ISIL,=
 progress that has made the American people safer -- progress that has yiel=
ded a degradation of ISIL forces.&nbsp; But there's a lot more
 work to be done.&nbsp; I think the critical part of this is the President =
is committed to making sure the United States is not doing this alone.&nbsp=
; This is not a burden that we're going to carry on our own.&nbsp; We're no=
t going to be the world's policeman.&nbsp; We're not
 going to impose a military solution on this situation.&nbsp; We're going t=
o work carefully with the international community that also has an importan=
t stake in this to continue this fight and to continue to make progress in =
degrading and destroying this terrorist
 organization.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You sai=
d something critical -- we're not going to impose a military solution.&nbsp=
; Donald Trump is -- I don't know, didn't get through the weeds with what h=
e was saying --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, you=
're probably not the only one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not=
 saying that to be smart, though.&nbsp; I'm not saying that to be smart.&nb=
sp; But he said that he could eliminate ISIS.&nbsp; So could a military sol=
ution eliminate ISIS?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
would encourage you to check with his advisors to get them to explain to yo=
u what it means to &#8220;eliminate ISIS.&#8221;&nbsp; Or at least what he =
means when he says that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before =
the end of the year, around December or so, President Obama from the Oval O=
ffice addressed the nation, and around that time, national security folks w=
ere saying that ISIS had been degraded about 25 percent.&nbsp; Are we still
 around that number, or is it higher or lower, even as they&#8217;re still =
carrying out acts of violence and terrorism?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The late=
st statistics that we've seen is that we've retaken about 40 percent of the=
 territory in Iraq that ISIL previously held, and about 16 percent of the t=
erritory in Syria -- populated territory in Syria that ISIL
 previously held.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All rig=
ht.&nbsp; And then on Flint, Michigan, will the President be making any new=
s when he travels there, particularly as it's still an ongoing situation?&n=
bsp; There have been charges.&nbsp; People are still pointing figures and t=
here are
 still long-term effects to include the lost generation of kids and some pe=
ople who were physically harmed by drinking this water.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'=
ll just point out that there have already been some serious steps taken by =
the administration to try to confront some of the potential long-term conse=
quences of the soiled Flint water supply.&nbsp; I can give you a
 couple of examples.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s been a signif=
icant expansion of Medicaid coverage so that more individuals can get acces=
s to treatment that would address any problems that they have sustained as =
a result of increased levels of lead in the water supply.&nbsp; There
 has been a widespread increase in testing to evaluate the impact on childr=
en in Flint as a result of the contaminated water supply.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What ar=
e you finding in that so far?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'=
d refer you to HHS and they can give you some more details on exactly what =
those studies and what those tests have found.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There also has been work to=
 provide additional assistance -- economic assistance to Flint.&nbsp; The c=
ontamination of the water supply has a ripple effect across the economy.&nb=
sp; You can understand that you're not likely to go and establish
 a new business in a community that doesn&#8217;t have access to clean wate=
r. So there&#8217;s a variety of economic assistance that's been provided t=
o the local government and to members of the community as they go through t=
his difficult situation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we've been mindful of th=
e longer-term challenges that Flint is facing, and we're going to continue =
to follow through with those commitments.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it relates to the Presid=
ent&#8217;s trip, I don't have any remarks to preview at this point.&nbsp; =
I suspect that the fact of the President&#8217;s trip is news in and of its=
elf.&nbsp; And he certainly is looking forward to the opportunity that he'l=
l
 have to meet with local officials, to meet with people in the community wh=
o have been affected, and both reassure them that the Obama administration =
is committed to following through on the commitments that we have made, but=
 also making a broader argument
 to the country about why investments in our infrastructure are so critical=
ly important.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we'll have more to say a=
bout that next week.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One las=
t question.&nbsp; Now there are charges, what is up -- can you say what thi=
s administration feels is at the root of this problem?&nbsp; Hillary Clinto=
n already said what she felt.&nbsp; What does this President and this admin=
istration
 feel is the root cause of this crisis?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, yo=
u&#8217;ll get an opportunity to hear directly from the President on that n=
ext week.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So will=
 he kind of reflect, mirror some of what Hillary Clinton said?&nbsp; Becaus=
e he&#8217;s been very vocal when it comes to issues of inequality, the les=
ser served, and race.&nbsp; Will he mirror her?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Stay tun=
ed.&nbsp; I'll let you draw that conclusion for yourself.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the =
Trump speech, you didn&#8217;t see it, right?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I did no=
t.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weren&#=
8217;t you curious?&nbsp; Didn&#8217;t you want to?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Not real=
ly.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not=
?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
know.&nbsp; I guess I have plenty more important things to be focused on, t=
o prepare for your serious questions, beyond what any individual presidenti=
al candidate might have to say.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pre=
sident was -- one thing about the speech was it was done very differently, =
apparently.&nbsp; A lot of commentators I think would agree.&nbsp; Even a t=
eleprompter appeared to be used.&nbsp; It was scripted.&nbsp; The setting w=
as much more structured.&nbsp;
 What do you think of Mr. Trump&#8217;s effort to do a foreign policy speec=
h in that manner?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'=
ve given up trying to divine the intentions of him or any other presidentia=
l candidate.&nbsp; Obviously he&#8217;s got plenty of people on his staff w=
ho can describe what they&#8217;re focused on doing there.&nbsp; But I woul=
dn't begin
 to describe what they had in mind.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don=
't think you're being too dismissive of him?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nbsp=
; I guess it's an ironic answer.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t view it that way.&nbs=
p; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But, no, I don't think so.&nbsp; Look, our process is =
structured so that individual voters all across the country can take stock =
of the candidates,
 and given the length of this campaign, they&#8217;ve had ample opportunity=
 to take stock of the candidates on both sides.&nbsp; And as the President,=
 himself, said, he&#8217;s got a lot of confidence in the American people t=
o make the right decision.&nbsp; And he certainly intends
 to spend some time advocating, making his preferences known.&nbsp; But the=
 time for that will be during the general election.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the =
Flint situation, the timing.&nbsp; These letters were exchanged some time a=
go, or received some time ago, correct?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
the President got the letter from this little girl in Flint last month.&nbs=
p;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why =
now?&nbsp; Did he just receive it?&nbsp; Or is there something about the si=
tuation there that he sees that changed his mind about going?&nbsp; Because=
 for so long he said he would not go.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think that -- I don't think the President said that he would not go.&nbsp; =
In terms of --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he =
said he wouldn't go --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; He hadn&=
#8217;t scheduled one.&nbsp; And, look, I think the President&#8217;s goal =
here is to go to the community of Flint and say in person to the people of =
Flint what he conveyed in the letter to this little girl, which is, we've n=
ot
 forgotten you.&nbsp; In fact, we're committed to making sure that this com=
munity has the support that they need to recover.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s happened there=
 is terrible.&nbsp; The President, himself, described what he thought it mu=
st be like for a parent to look at the news and see that their child has be=
en drinking poisoned water for months, if not years.&nbsp; I think many
 parents in Flint, like the President imagined, are beside themselves -- th=
ey still are.&nbsp; And the President feels it's important to go and signal=
 his continued support for that community even though it's not an everyday =
headline like it used to be.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I don't mean that as so=
me sort of criticism of the media, just a practical observation that if you=
 live in the city of Flint, there were satellite trucks and news photograph=
ers all over the streets.&nbsp; And understandably, attention
 has moved on to other things.&nbsp; And the President feels it's important=
 to go back to them and make it clear that while the intention of other peo=
ple has shifted onto other things, he continues to be focused on making sur=
e that we do right by the people of Flint.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just =
to clarify, there was a federal state of emergency declared, correct?&nbsp;=
 That's still in effect?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; So the=
re was an initial declaration.&nbsp; The President issued an emergency decl=

 in fact, you're saying a disaster area can't be declared between it's a ma=

 sure this problem gets solved?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Ron, I don&#8217;t think that there is anything that the federal government=
 could do in one day that is going to repair the trust that has been broken=
.&nbsp; I would acknowledge that that's the case.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think the way that you =
rebuild trust in a situation like this is demonstrating a sustained commitm=
ent to following through on what you say you're going to do.&nbsp; And what=
 the federal government has said that they
 were going to do is mobilize resources to help people have access to clean=
 water while the situation with the water supply is being fixed.&nbsp; So t=
hat's why you saw FEMA move in.&nbsp; They've now passed out 7.3 million li=
ters of water that has been provided by FEMA
 to people in Flint; 55,000 water filters and 243,000 replacement filter ca=
rtridges.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So just meeting the urgen=
t emergency needs of people is certainly an appropriate role for the federa=
l government.&nbsp; You also saw the federal government step in and expand =
Medicaid coverage so that more individuals
 up to the age of 21 could get access to reliable health care.&nbsp; You sa=
w grants from the Department of Health and Human Services to local health c=
are officials to make sure they could handle the capacity -- I'm sorry, to =
expand their capacity so that they could
 handle the increase in the number of patients that they were going to see =
on a regular basis.&nbsp; These are just some of the examples of the assist=
ance that's been provided by the federal government.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So there certainly is an =
important role for the federal government to play in responding to a situat=
ion like this.&nbsp; What's also true is there's a role for Congress to pla=
y.&nbsp; There are additional resources that could
 be used to make some changes to their aging water infrastructure and to pr=
ovide additional assistance to help the city of Flint recover and rebuild. =
Unfortunately, we've seen Republicans refuse to embrace that responsibility=
, and that's unfortunate.&nbsp; But the
 President is certainly committed to this.&nbsp; And it is fair to say that=
 the President is interested in any new ideas that are developed about addi=
tional assistance that can be provided within the authority of the executiv=
e branch.&nbsp; But there certainly is important
 assistance that could be provided by Congress; we just need to see Republi=
cans stop blocking it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Andrew.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The P=
resident travels to Vietnam soon.&nbsp; I was wondering if you could give u=
s the White House position on the lifting of the arms embargo against that =
country.&nbsp; And if you do support them, what would you like
 to see the Vietnamese do in return for that being lifted?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; At thi=
s point, Andrew, I'm not aware of a change in our position.&nbsp; Obviously=
 we'll keep you posted if something like that is being contemplated in adva=
nce of the trip.&nbsp; I anticipate that the President,
 when he travels to Vietnam, will actually spend most of his time talking a=
bout the increased focus of the United States on the Asia Pacific region.&n=
bsp; Vietnam has a dynamic economy and they have a rapidly growing middle c=
lass.&nbsp; And it's a country that is trying
 to decide exactly how it's going to orient its economy in the decades ahea=
d.&nbsp; And there's an opportunity for the United States, through the Tran=
s-Pacific Partnership, to which Vietnam is a party, to raise labor and envi=
ronmental standards in a way that creates
 more of a level playing field for American businesses.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That means that Vietnames=
e businesses that are interested in doing business in the United States nee=
d to change the way that they operate on a regular basis.&nbsp; What it als=
o means is it means that U.S. businesses
 will have more access to that growing middle class in Vietnam.&nbsp; It's =
a win-win for the U.S. economy.&nbsp; And the President will certainly high=
light that win-win when he travels to Vietnam.&nbsp; He'll also illustrate =
the risk that is posed by rejecting this agreement.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What we know is that Chin=
a would love to strengthen and deepen their economic ties with Vietnam.&nbs=
p; They recognize the same economic opportunities in Vietnam that we do.&nb=
sp; But if China is able to establish a foothold
 in Vietnam, China will surely say, well, we don&#8217;t really care anythi=
ng about your labor standards, we don&#8217;t care anything about your envi=
ronmental standards, we certainly don&#8217;t care anything about the human=
 rights standards in your country -- we just want
 to look for ways to do more business.&nbsp; There will be a race to the bo=
ttom, and that will only put American businesses at a greater disadvantage =
in trying to expand opportunities in one of the fastest-growing economies i=
n the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it's a pretty simple str=
ategic calculation.&nbsp; It's just one that we're going to continue to exp=
lain, and there's no better way to do that than having the President travel=
 to that country directly.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on =
a separate issue, one thing you may have agreed with Trump on today was his=
 suggestion that U.S. allies are not pulling their weight when it comes to =
the security program.&nbsp; Is the President considering deploying naval an=
d
 reconnaissance assets to the central Mediterranean, or is that a job for t=
he Europeans?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e President in his discussions with our European allies in Europe over the =
weekend and earlier this week did talk about the significant national secur=
ity of the situation that exists in the central Mediterranean.&nbsp;
 The flow of migrants across the Mediterranean Sea into southern Europe rep=
resents a significant challenge for our European allies.&nbsp; It has signi=
ficant consequences for their national security.&nbsp; And the President po=
inted out it wasn&#8217;t just their national security
 that was at risk, but the U.S. national security is affected as well.&nbsp=
; So we certainly have a stake in their ability to resolve that situation.&=
nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I don&#8217;t have anythi=
ng to announce, and the President certainly didn&#8217;t have anything to a=
nnounce in the aftermath of those meetings, but I think that should be a pr=
etty clear indication to you that the United States
 is prepared to offer our support as they work to find an appropriate solut=
ion.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">What's also true is the P=
resident did take advantage of the opportunity with some of strongest our a=
llies in the world sitting around the same table to make clear that we all =
need to follow through on commitments
 that we've made as it relates to funding our defense capacities.&nbsp; The=
re was a commitment that was made by our NATO allies a couple of years ago =
at the NATO meeting in the U.K., I believe, where each of the countries of =
NATO committed to dedicating 2 percent
 of their GDP to defense spending.&nbsp; The United States far exceeds that=
 goal.&nbsp; Our allies in the U.K. have met that goal, but too many others=
 haven&#8217;t.&nbsp; And the President reminded all of them of the importa=
nce of meeting that goal, particularly in the face of
 threats from ISIL, a migration flow in southern Europe that is potentially=
 destabilizing, and a steady increase in provocations from the Russians.&nb=
sp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This is exactly the wrong=
 time for our closest allies in the world to be insufficiently funding thei=
r defense capabilities.&nbsp; It's only by working together -- that's the e=
ssence of an alliance -- working together
 and adequately funding our capacity to work together is the way for us to =
provide for our mutual defense.&nbsp; And the President certainly did make =
that case to his partners and our allies in the context of that meeting and=
 other meetings that he's convened with
 them in recent months and years.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it f=
air to say that the President might be reluctant to deploy U.S. assets, sho=
uld he see that Europeans are not willing to put their own assets on the li=
ne as well?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the point of setting this two percent goal is ensuring that when a si=
tuation does arise that requires a commitment of resources, that our partne=
rs have the capacity to follow through on those commitments.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, =
I was specifically talking about the central Mediterranean.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Oh, okay=
.&nbsp; I mean, as it relates to that specific situation, we're obviously g=
oing to work closely with our European allies as they consider an appropria=
te response.&nbsp; But the President I think was pretty blunt in saying
 that the potential impact of the situation there doesn't just have an impa=
ct on national security in Europe, it has an impact on the national securit=
y of the United States.&nbsp; And I think that would signal to you that the=
 United States is prepared to actively
 support our European allies as they confront this challenge.<o:p></o:p></p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; I want to extend the conversation about the NSC that you had, =
in particular acknowledging that National Security Advisor Rice has, in fac=
t, trimmed her staff.&nbsp; Tell me about Mac Thornberry's suggestion that =
the
 NSC could be cut significantly more than that -- is he off-base?&nbsp; And=
 if so, how?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ke=
vin, I think even just the conversation in the briefing today is a useful i=
llustration of the wide range of threats and challenges that is being confr=
onted by our national security professionals every day.&nbsp; And
 ensuring that the Commander-in-Chief has access to the information and jud=
gment of his advisors not just here in the White House but across a variety=
 of national security agencies is critically important.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of diplo=
matic and -- well, let me say it this way:&nbsp; One way to ensure effectiv=
e decision-making is to effectively coordinate the actions of all of the di=
fferent agencies that are involved in protecting the country.&nbsp;
 And that is essentially the core function of the National Security Council=
 -- to make sure that all of these agencies who have significant responsibi=
lities related to national security are effectively coordinated so that the=
y can provide effective advice and
 information to the President of the United States, but also so that decisi=
ons that are made by the President of the United States are effectively imp=
lemented by that wide array of agencies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So given the risks that we =
are -- the wide range of risks that this country is confronting right now, =
it shouldn't be surprising to anybody that there is a robust structure in p=
lace, here at the White House, to make sure that these
 decisions are made and implemented effectively.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet=
 there has been criticism by some former Defense Secretaries that the West =
Wing is effectively trying to override, for lack of a more descriptive word=
, the intentions of the Pentagon, for example.&nbsp; In fact, one said, all
 too often they were subject to second-guessing, even to direct conversatio=
ns of commanders on the ground, coming from the NSC.&nbsp; Is that the prop=
er role?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ke=
vin, I think that it's probably true over the course of our nation's histor=
y that every Secretary of Defense has expressed some frustration about work=
ing with the White House.&nbsp; That is a built-in part of being
 part of the government.&nbsp; That's also part of being part of the chain =
of command.&nbsp; And I think the President is proud -- I can tell you conf=
idently that the President is proud of the performance of the Secretaries o=
f Defense that have served under him.&nbsp; He
 certainly is proud of the performance of Secretary Carter.&nbsp; It doesn'=
t mean that he's taken their advice every time.&nbsp; He hasn't.&nbsp; He's=
 the President of the United States.&nbsp; They're the Secretary of Defense=
.&nbsp; It's their responsibility to offer up their advice.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He surely has taken their a=
dvice more often than not, and I think a lot of our frustration actually st=
ems from Congress refusing to take the advice of our Secretaries of Defense=
 over the years.&nbsp; And whether that is failing to pass
 an authorization to use military force, something that our Secretaries of =
Defense have strongly advocated, our Secretaries of Defense -- I think all =
of them -- have actually time and again gone to Congress and asked for spen=
ding reforms that would save taxpayers
 money and make our national defense stronger.&nbsp; But yet, those reforms=
 have not been implemented.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is a strong record=
 of this White House working effectively with leaders of the military, civi=
lian and military, at the Department of Defense to implement policies that =
have made the country safer.&nbsp; And the President is certainly
 proud of the service of his Secretaries of Defense, and he's certainly pro=
ud of the way those decisions and the implementation of those policies has =
made our country safer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to=
 put a finer point on it, some of the suggestion was that the NSC is meddli=
ng -- sort of they've got his ear ahead of his direct Cabinet Secretaries.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
just disagree.&nbsp; I think the President carefully considered the advice =
that he received from each of his Secretaries of Defense.&nbsp; He valued t=
hat advice, and it played an important role as he made critically important
 policy decisions throughout this presidency.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last on=
e.&nbsp; The President has done well in communicating with young voters.&nb=
sp; There is a sense in 2016, a greater sense of disenfranchisement -- that=
 the process is rigged.&nbsp; You've heard that both on the Republican and =
on the Democratic
 side, and in particular some young voters feel like the fix is in.&nbsp; W=
hat would the President say to young voters, in particular as we get closer=
 to the conventions, about the process that they're seeing here in 2016?<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the President's message to young voters is the message that he has fo=
r all Americans, which is simply that casting a vote is the most effective =
and powerful way to have your voice heard.&nbsp; The President has
 talked about this most frequently I think in the context of the debate abo=
ut gun safety.&nbsp; The President has been greatly frustrated, profoundly =
frustrated at repeated congressional inaction and obstruction when it comes=
 to common-sense gun-safety bills.&nbsp; And
 the President I think has been pretty blunt about the fact that he doesn't=
 expect that environment in Congress to change until voters make their voic=
es heard and until voters make clear that this is something that is a prior=
ity to them.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the President wasn't sig=
naling that this environment would change if some billionaire started a sup=
er PAC.&nbsp; It's possible that could be the case, but there have already =
been super PACs created by billionaires that have tried to
 make this change that haven't succeeded, at least as much as we would like=
 them to.&nbsp; The way that this will get fixed, the way that we'll see co=
mmon-sense legislation passed that doesn't undermine the constitutional rig=
hts of law-abiding Americans is when
 voters across the country make clear that this is a priority to them.&nbsp=
; And they can do that in only one way, and that's by casting their votes a=
ccordingly.&nbsp; And I think that's a powerful message about the responsib=
ility that citizens in every party of every
 age all across the country has to contribute to our democracy and to make =
our country great.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me =
ask one on Chief Judge Garland.&nbsp; Any new activities coming down on him=
?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, he=
 is doing a handful of meetings today. He is meeting with Senator Rounds of=
 South Dakota and Senator Nelson of Florida.&nbsp; He&#8217;s also doing a =
meeting with Senators Lankford and Inhofe of Oklahoma.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I point this out because we=
 also saw some interesting comments for former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn =
yesterday -- maybe it was earlier today that he made these comments.&nbsp; =
He was often referred to as the conscience of the Senate, and
 he made clear, in his typical avuncular style, that the Senate should do i=
ts job, and that there&#8217;s no excuse for Republicans refusing to consid=
er voting on the nomination of Chief Judge Garland.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think that he was v=
owing to vote for Chief Judge Garland if he were still in the Senate, but h=
e was saying he would at least do his job.&nbsp; He would meet with the Chi=
ef Judge, and he would stand up before the American people
 and cast a vote. Obviously we would make a strong case to him that Chief J=
udge Garland is deserving of his support, but there is no denying, there&#8=
217;s no argument, even among people who disagree with the administration, =
about the wisdom of appointing Chief Judge
 Garland to the Supreme Court -- that at the very least, the President&#821=
7;s nominee deserves a hearing and a vote.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hopefully that counsel =
from the former Republican senator of Oklahoma will have an influence over =
the current Republican senators from Oklahoma.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toluse.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; When the President was in London, he said that, on Syria, that=
 we&#8217;d looked at all the options and none of them are great.&nbsp; I'm=
 wondering if the President has asked his Defense Department for any option=
s that would
 make it more difficult for the Assad regime to kill as many civilians as i=
t has, something short of a full occupation, but something that would make =
it more difficult for the Assad regime that seems to have pretty much carte=
 blanche to kill civilians.&nbsp; Has
 the President asked for any options that would specifically deal with that=
 without going as far as a full no-fly zone or a full occupation in Syria?<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, To=
luse, I guess I would just tell you that you should take the President at h=
is word that he has directed his team to consider all options about the bes=
t way for the United States to degrade and ultimately destroy
 ISIL and to do it in a way that is consistent with our national security i=
nterests and our objectives.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conducting another ground i=
nvasion of another Middle Eastern country is not in our interest.&nbsp; We'=
ve learned the lessons of the previous war in Iraq.&nbsp; We know that we'v=
e got the best military in the world -- primarily because the United
 States has the best sailors and soldiers and Marines and airmen in the wor=
ld.&nbsp; But risking their lives to go occupy another country, put them in=
 harm&#8217;s way, and to spend billions of dollars -- hundreds of billions=
 of dollars to risk their lives, thinking that
 we can impose a military solution on another country is foolish.&nbsp; <o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's not a criticism of o=
ur military.&nbsp; It's a criticism of policymakers who have failed to unde=
rstand the consequences of making a decision like that.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the President and the na=
tional security advisors and policymakers on his team are aware of those co=
nsequences and they have considered all of those consequences as they&#8217=
;ve looked for the best way for us to degrade and ultimately
 destroy ISIL and bring about the kind of political transition inside of Sy=
ria that is long overdue.&nbsp; And we're going to continue to press the Ru=
ssians to use the influence that they have with the Assad regime to bring a=
n end to the violence and engage in talks
 about a political transition.&nbsp; We're going to continue to marshal the=
 other influential countries in the region to encourage the opposition to e=
ngage constructively in those negotiations.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, it's a politica=
l solution that's required.&nbsp; President Assad&#8217;s failed political =
leadership is the root cause of all of these problems, and the only way we'=
re going to solve them is to allow for a political transition to
 a new leader that reflects the will and ambition of the Syrian people, tha=
t has the capacity to unite that country to counter the extremist threat th=
at has encroached on their territory.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I wouldn&#8217;t make t=
he case to you that that's a simple solution.&nbsp; It certainly is not a s=
olution that we're likely to see be imposed overnight.&nbsp; But it is the =
only solution that will achieve the objectives that the President has
 outlined.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pre=
sident also said that we're going to play this option out if the cessation =
falls apart, the U.S. going to try to put it together, and I think that sta=
nds in a bit of a contrast to folks who were talking about a plan B earlier
 on in this process.&nbsp; And I'm wondering if there still is a plan B.&nb=
sp; Is that something that the President and his advisors are still looking=
 at in terms of what to do if the cessation falls apart?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, To=
luse, I think this is exactly what the President was answering when he said=
 he and his advisors have looked at all of the options and that none of the=
m are good, and the United States is committed to supporting
 the international process to bring about a political transition inside of =
Syria.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, even the Russians hav=
e indicated that they believe a political transition is what&#8217;s requir=
ed.&nbsp; So it's just going to require the international community continu=
ing to chip away at this problem and try to bring all the parties
 to the table and jumpstart this process.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s no denyin=
g how difficult that is or how long it's likely to take.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few m=
ore on Mr. Trump.&nbsp; You say you have better things to do than to watch =
or listen to the speech.&nbsp; Is that indicative of the point of view of t=
he White House generally?&nbsp; In other words, how seriously does this Whi=
te House
 take the foreign policy or the lack thereof of Mr. Trump?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
it's indicative of the substantive questions I expected to receive in the c=
ontext of this briefing, so I certainly take seriously my responsibility to=
 try to prepare for it.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Look, I think what I said=
 is true, is that the American people will carefully consider the presentat=
ions of candidates in both parties and they&#8217;ll be watching closely, p=
articularly when making a decision as important
 as who should be the Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So in some ways, it doesn=
&#8217;t really matter whether or not, in my context as a White House spoke=
sperson, I spend a lot of time watching the speeches delivered by other can=
didates.&nbsp; I suppose that it does matter in
 the context of me as a voter.&nbsp; But in this case, the American people =
will have an opportunity to decide.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- th=
e President himself -- Mr. Trump, after all, is the man who calls himself t=
he presumptive Republican nominee.&nbsp; How seriously does the President t=
ake this speech?&nbsp; I don't think he had time to watch it
 because of a lunch with the Vice President, but how will he be informed of=
 it, and how interested is he in what was actually said?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
the one candidate that you named has certainly not struggled to get attenti=
on from all of you.&nbsp; And the President, as somebody who is an avid con=
sumer of the media&nbsp; -- as you&#8217;ve heard me observe
 on a number of occasions -- so he certainly is aware of the debate that's =
going on in the presidential race on both sides.&nbsp; And you won't have a=
ny -- again, given the amount of attention that's been lavished on a couple=
 of these candidates, the President doesn&#8217;t
 have any trouble keeping up to speed on what they&#8217;re saying.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One m=
ore, and I'll try and make it substantive.&nbsp; When Donald Trump says he =
wants to bring peace to the world, what do you make of that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think what is true is that President Obama, over the course of his presid=
ency, has worked to unite the international community to confront a wide ra=
nge of threats.&nbsp; And that is everything from
 uniting the international community, to completing an agreement to fight c=
limate change.&nbsp; That is making the American people safer.&nbsp; And th=
at is evidence of the United States using our influence to work with China =
and other countries with large economies to
 make an agreement like this possible.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This is also true when it=
 comes to Iran and their nuclear program.&nbsp; As I mentioned, when Presid=
ent Obama took office, the international community was fractured in terms o=
f considering how exactly to confront Iran
 in their nuclear ambitions.&nbsp; But President Obama demonstrated the lea=
dership that was required to unite the international community behind a str=
ategy that would impose sanctions on Iran until they came to the table and =
committed in a verifiable fashion to
 not pursuing a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; That's exactly what we've done.&nbsp;=
 That has also made the world safer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">At the same time, the Pre=
sident has not hesitated to order military action where necessary to protec=
t the American people.&nbsp; President Obama after all -- we're coming up o=
n the fifth anniversary of President Obama
 deciding to order our military to go after Osama bin Laden.&nbsp; And beca=
use of the bravery and courage and dedication of our national security prof=
essionals, including our men and women in uniform, that operation was succe=
ssful.&nbsp; And that certainly has enhanced
 our national security and made the American people safer.&nbsp; That's jus=
t one example of countless military operations that President Obama as a Co=
mmander-in-Chief has ordered to take terrorists off the battlefield.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And again, it's a testame=
nt to the bravery, courage and professionalism and skill of our men and wom=
en in uniform that those operations have taken a large number of terrorists=
 off the battlefield.&nbsp; That has made
 the American people safer.&nbsp; That's made the world a safer place.&nbsp=
; But there continue to be threats.&nbsp; And the President's success in st=
rengthening our alliances and strengthening our partnerships around the wor=
ld, building a coalition of 65 nations to counter
 ISIL, including a number of Muslim-majority nations in the Middle East, ha=
ve all been advances that have enhanced our standing in the world and enhan=
ced our national security.&nbsp; And so the President's record on those iss=
ues is quite strong, and to the extent
 that anybody wants to have a debate about that, the President will not shy=
 away from it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Dave.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has t=
he White House been in touch with former Senator Coburn about the nominatio=
n?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&=
#8217;t know of any -- I certainly don&#8217;t know of any presidential-lev=
el conversations with former Senator Coburn about Chief Judge Garland's nom=
ination.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any s=
ub-presidential talks?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm so=
rry?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do yo=
u know of any sub-presidential-level talks?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm no=
t aware of any off the top of my head, but I wouldn&#8217;t rule them out e=
ither.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One o=
ther thing.&nbsp; There's a House subcommittee tomorrow that's holding a he=
aring on the President's plan to transfer Gitmo detainees to the U.S.&nbsp;=
 There's going to be some local officials from South Carolina
 -- Governor Haley and some people from Kansas testifying in opposition to =
the plan, calling it dangerous.&nbsp; At this point, do you see any encoura=
ging signs that Congress will take up your plan and move forward on it this=
 year?&nbsp; Or it is a dead-end?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think it's unclear.&nbsp; There's no evidence I can point to.&nbsp; I thi=
nk I would just point out that there are national security professionals on=
 both sides who think that it's dangerous to keep the
 prison at Guantanamo Bay open and that the proposal that the President has=
 put forward is actually that makes us safer.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Just to go back to your p=
revious question, even though I don&#8217;t know of any conversations betwe=
en White House or administration officials and former Senator Coburn, obvio=
usly Senator Coburn was a pretty conservative
 Republican, and his personal affection for President Obama is well-known a=
nd certainly transcends their partisan differences, but I don&#8217;t have =
any reason to believe that he was communicating anything other than his own=
 personal view with his own personal conviction
 about how important it is for the Senate to vote on Chief Judge Garland's =
nomination because it's their constitutional responsibility to do so.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">John, I'll give you the l=
ast one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
 you, Josh.&nbsp; When the President met with Chancellor Merkel, did they h=
ave any discussions -- as we were previously led to expect -- about the con=
tinuing and rising economic crisis in Greece, as well as
 the refugee crisis?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&=
#8217;t have any more details to share in terms of their private conversati=
on.&nbsp; But I think I can just say as a general matter that there are a r=
ange of issues that were discussed that have a direct
 impact on the unity of the EU.&nbsp; And obviously questions about the eco=
nomy and the financial health of the European Union is something that was d=
iscussed, but I don&#8217;t know in how much detail they discussed the situ=
ation in Greece.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And i=
s there any concern within the White House about what appears to be an obvi=
ous deadlock between the creditors over the Greek debt situation and the In=
ternational Monetary Fund?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&=
#8217;t have any detailed knowledge of those ongoing discussions.&nbsp; Obv=
iously we're very supportive of the efforts that members of the EU have mad=
e to deal with the financial challenges posed by Greece's
 finances.&nbsp; Part of that agreement included Greece following through o=
n a number of structural reforms, and we certainly believe that Greece has =
a responsibility to do that.&nbsp; But we've been clear all along that effe=
ctive coordination among Greece and the other
 EU was going to be critical to resolving that situation in a way that didn=
&#8217;t undermine the fundamentals of the European economy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Thanks, everybody.&nbsp; =
We'll see you tomorrow.<o:p></o:p></p>
