Sanders Statement on Primary Elections


April 26, 2016
Contact: Michael Briggs (802) 233-8653

HUNTINGTON, W. Va. =96 U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday issued the follo=
wing statement:

=93I congratulate Secretary Clinton on her victories tonight, and I look fo=
rward to issue-oriented campaigns in the 14 contests to come.

=93I am proud that we were able to win a resounding victory tonight in Rhod=
e Island, the one state with an open primary where independents had a say i=
n the outcome. Democrats should recognize that the ticket with the best cha=
nce of winning this November must attract support from independents as well=
 as Democrats. I am proud of my campaign=92s record in that regard.

=93The people in every state in this country should have the right to deter=
mine who they want as president and what the agenda of the Democratic Party=
 should be. That=92s why we are in this race until the last vote is cast. T=
hat is why this campaign is going to the Democratic National Convention in =
Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive =
party platform that calls for a $15 an hour minimum wage, an end to our dis=
astrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up =
Wall Street financial institutions, ending fracking in our country, making =
public colleges and universities tuition free and passing a carbon tax so w=
e can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.=94
