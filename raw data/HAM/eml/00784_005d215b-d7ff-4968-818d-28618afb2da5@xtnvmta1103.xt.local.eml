By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)

Good Monday morning. PLAYBOOK CRYSTAL BALL: Behind the scenes, most top Republicans - in Congress, on K Street and beyond - assume a President Hillary Clinton. One veteran of GOP administrations gave us his forecast for QUICK WINS Clinton could achieve under divided government (a Democratic White House and a Republican House, plus a 50-50, Democratic or GOP Senate): "There will be a big push for infrastructure spending and it will succeed, and it's going to be way beyond the normal road-building -- deep into ports, deep into airports, just a massive national effort to build, rebuild, refurbish infrastructure. 

"You bring all the unions in there with you, every state and local government official. Even the Republicans are with you: It's very hard for Republicans to vote against fixing THEIR bridges, roads, airports, ports. And then, because the environmentalists will resist that mightily and lose, then she'll have to give the environmentalists something. So there will be a big environmental agenda, half of which won't go anywhere. 

"I think between that battle and the Supreme Court -- I think she'll get Garland [if she renominates him], but it's going to be a tough fight - that's the first session of Congress. ... [S]he's got some other legislative work that would be big for the tech industry: deal with intellectual property issues, deal with H-1B visa issues, ... but not deal with [comprehensive] immigration reform, not deal with tax reform -- deal with PIECES of things. What you can accomplish in divided government is more tactical." 

FIRST LOOK: Hillary's closing ad for tomorrow's Acela primary (Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island): "Grammy Award-nominated singer Andra Day provided vocals for the ad and wrote the lyrics to the featured music. Day previously performed at an event in March in support of Hillary Clinton at Radio City Music Hall with Elton John and Katy Perry." The 60-second ad, "Love and Kindness," begins today in Philly, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Hartford markets. YouTube http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac4734191bbf74434a545781f88bff725928037011212a79909d

2017 MOOD -- WSJ A1, bottom of page, "Campaign's Populist Tone Rankles America's CEOs," by Nick Timiraos and Ted Mann: "[E]xecutives worry that for now, the rhetoric of the election discussion could weigh on consumer confidence, thwart any immigration overhaul and derail a sweeping 12-nation trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that the U.S. struck last year and that many businesses support. ... Rhetoric from Republican candidates has grown more populist and less friendly to big business than at any time in decades. ...

"Clinton might appear to be the most business friendly option given her r&eacute;sum&eacute;, her close relations to some corporate donors and her message of delivering pragmatic results. But Mr. Sanders has pulled her away from centrist positions on financial regulation and trade. ... 'The center has collapsed,' said one technology CEO. 'Sanders and Trump will go away, but their supporters won't.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac47a3950783f03955e401d308b3c8c1b5835b851c0939a51c9f

ROGER STONE, on-again Trump adviser, takes us behind the scenes of Trumpworld, in a conversation with Glenn Thrush for his "Off Message" podcast, "Donald Trump's Donald Trump: Roger Stone, the coiffed kamikaze of Republican politics, is back. And he has one last dirty trick to play." Stone: "[Trump] envisioned a campaign which was all communications ... But the notion that you could combat - let's take Florida - $40 million worth of negative television simply by going on 'Fox and Friends' and responding, I rejected that idea ... He's going to have to better articulate himself on issues that are of concern to women ... 

"Without telling tales out of school, because I have a non-disclosure ... I envisioned a campaign that used the more traditional tools of polling and analytics and targeting and paid media, and a greater depth of organization ... Nobody puts words in Donald's mouth. He is his own conceptualizer. All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not. 

"When you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that ... Reagan was a big-picture guy. Trump is a big-picture guy. ... I think that obviously he has some challenges going into the general election. But I think they're all soluble." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac475b221b4a84da574ed815f1112d8c7dff471d0b6b46d60a6f ...

--JEFFREY TOOBIN in The New Yorker, "Bad Old Days" in the "Dept. of Fixers" in The Talk of the Town: "There's a wistfulness about Stone these days. ... [At the bar at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York] Stone instructed a waiter to bring him a 'Ketel One Martini up, with a couple of olives, very dry.' (His favorite Martini recipe came from Richard Nixon, who got it from Winston Churchill.)" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac475c96badf28517bb7bfd797d4f12e7707d0566a3da4efd8c3

DEBUT OF 1237, "POLITICO's deep-in-the-weeds blog on the real Republican primary: the shadow war for delegates," anchored by POLITICO's chief delegate wrangler Kyle Cheney and senior politics reporters Shane Goldmacher and Alex Isenstadt -- senior politics editor Charlie Mahtesian writes the debut post: "Trump is right: The GOP nominating process is rigged. Only it's not crooked in the way that Trump claims. ... [T]here are incentives for campaigns to focus on grassroots organization, since organizing is the lifeblood of any political party. But there are also trap doors ... put in place to ensure that no one ... can be bigger than the party." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac47f57fe09ae040ddb7b74a37a2708c3c0c214805739d8f7ba9

WILY ALLIANCE -- "Cruz and Kasich team up to stop Trump," by Katie Glueck and Kyle Cheney: "Cruz and John Kasich have begun coordinating ... to stop Donald Trump, an abrupt alliance announced [in back-to-back statements] Sunday night that includes Kasich quitting his efforts in Indiana and Cruz clearing a path for the Ohio governor in Oregon and New Mexico. ... 

"Trump fired back ... on Twitter, writing, 'Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION! ... Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac47e954a1d1fe53189bbbb925d7fdccde7d05e7141a8d98016a

2016 PLAYERS -- "Cruz campaign manager flashes 'Cruz 2016' sign on ESPN," by Shane Goldmacher: "Cruz's campaign manager Jeff Roe took the pursuit of earned media to a new level on Sunday night, sitting right behind home plate for ESPN's nationally broadcast Houston Astros game while holding a 'Cruz 2016' sign. ... Roe is an avid baseball fan and a former aspiring umpire and appeared to be seated next to senior Cruz adviser David Polyansky, who also held the Cruz sign at different moments." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac47bf2c3e967f8a1a93a152bade96141d6e4d658833961cc456 ...

FOX PRIMARY -- "Hannity's Choice ... Sean Hannity at center of bitter campaign competition," by AP Television Writer David Bauder: "Hannity's relationship with Trump became an issue when the liberal website Thinkprogress.org published a story that wondered how Hannity had been able to interview Trump so much without making news ... Trump [has] been a guest on Hannity's Fox show 32 times ... Hannity has said ... he does not support one Republican over another. ... Cruz had appeared ... 34 times since Cruz announced ... Kasich ... and ... Rand Paul ... had been on the show 20 times, with ... Rubio ... making 19 appearances.

"On [Hannity's] radio show, ... Cruz had logged more interview time than any other candidate - more than 188 minutes on the air. Trump's 112 minutes were third behind Rubio." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac47cf7ba054e2f478a36f6d3cdac29dd6317959badb1aef60b9

FUTURE OF NEWS - POLITICO architect "[Robert] Allbritton '92 Talks Future of Journalism Pt. 2," by Aaron Stagoff-Belfort in Wesleyan University's student paper, the Argus: "[Q:] 'Because of all the technological and economic changes we talked about, many students today at a school like Wesleyan view journalism as a very difficult career path to make a living in. Do you agree? Do you have any advice for young people who want to pursue journalism?" RA: "It's totally possible to do ... The thing that I think a lot of journalists have a problem with today is that it is becoming rapidly apparent that all journalists are not created equal. ... There are people out there who can get scoops, who
 can seriously drive readership ... 

"We are trying to expand what we can do, and the number of positions we have, in this industry. We are trying to do it in a sustainable model. But we are one shop, one publication. ... Over time, you've got a lot more entry level positions, but it's harder to move up the food chain. Whereas before, it was just a rite of passage: you stay long enough, you get the raise, and move on.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac47e3c04a20c7032618f7fd4bfd1bba147b36cb17a17a018eac ...

--N.Y. Times Business Day cover, "Politico Pierces the 'Brussels Bubble' With U.S.-Style Coverage," by Nicola Clark: "The offices of Politico Europe, the Brussels outpost of the American political news organization, are less than a five-minute walk from the Maelbeek subway station where a suicide bomber killed more than a dozen people in the terrorist attacks here last month. ... [T]o Matthew Kaminski, Politico Europe's executive editor, it was an event that lent itself naturally to Politico's brand of swift, flood-the-zone news coverage. 'We have the biggest newsroom in this town,' Mr. Kaminski said of the more than 40 journalists now under his command, 'and this was a hit on our
 community.' ... 

"The Brussels attacks punctuated what had already been an unusually newsy first year for Politico's European venture, which was started last April in partnership with the German publishing group Axel Springer. ... Politico Europe claims an audience of one million to 1.5 million unique monthly visitors to its free website, 30,000 readers of its weekly print newspaper and about 200 institutional subscribers to its Pro products, whose potential user base numbers in the 'tens of thousands,' [managing director Sh&eacute;h&eacute;razade] Semsar-de Boiss&eacute;son said." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac476bae4de8b7f6926df3eaf752fb582a12f566284575b42140 

METRO'S DESIGN FLAWS - WashPost p. A1, top of cols. 1-5, "Metro at 40: A mess of its own making," by Robert McCartney and Paul Duggan: "It's a story about a modern-era subterranean rail network constructed in a fast-paced, congested metropolitan area. Boston's and New York's systems, by contrast, were born in less-crowded regions more than a century ago. Metro was built with two tracks, not four as in New York - and with few pocket tracks, where trains can be parked out of the way - to hold down costs and minimize public disruption during the work. Now there is too little room in the narrow tunnels for maintenance and repair crews and hundreds of thousands of commuters together. ... 

"It's also a story about the agency's early faith in automation - that computers would negate human error - which seemed to stunt the development of a safety culture, resulting in disasters. ... Many employees fear being disciplined or branded as malcontents if they point out flaws. ... And it's a story about money, about elected leaders unwilling to seek a special tax to pay for Metro, afraid of a voter backlash." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac47577035d89a75529d5dd005eaee9658eedd538f902bcb64fa 

AFTER-BERN-- N.Y. Times p. A1, below fold, "Sanders Seeks To Shape Party After Primary," by Nick Confessore: "Aides to Mr. Sanders have been pressing party officials for a significant role in drafting the platform ... aiming to lock in strong planks on issues like a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, breaking up Wall Street banks and banning natural gas 'fracking.' ... Clinton is well positioned to block any proposals she would not want to defend in a general election.

"In January, [DNC Chair] Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... appointed dozens of Clinton supporters and advisers to the three standing committees of the Democratic Party convention. Of 45 potential members submitted by Mr. Sanders, she appointed just three, according to Mr. Sanders's campaign." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac47f986d11f8f49177e09f178dd5734da52ad49a2f82a1ebdff

--ADAM NAGOURNEY, leading NYT Sunday Review, "Can Clinton Feel The Bern? History shows that restoring party unity is tough but crucial to success in November": "She could offer Mr. Sanders a prime-time speaking spot at the convention. She could pick a vice president who shares the concerns that have animated Mr. Sanders's crowds. ... If Mr. Sanders ends up with a campaign debt, Mrs. Clinton can also promise to help pay it off, as President Obama did for her back in 2008." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac47e7919b9bb574647c83245065bd9cf8fe06fcb598dde1e334

FOURTH QUARTER -- "Obama's latest pivot - to Europe: After focusing on Asia and the Middle East, the president turns his attention to another continent in crisis," by Michael Crowley in London: "Europe is in crisis, many U.S. officials believe, and when Obama delivers a speech in Hanover, Germany, [today], aides say he will be addressing the whole continent as it grapples with terrorism, nationalism, refugees and questions about the European Union's survival. It also marks a turnabout in Obama's own thinking - amid grumbling by many European diplomats that the president hasn't given the continent the attention it needs. Even some Obama aides acknowledge that Europe has sometimes been
 overshadowed by Obama's other foreign priorities, like the Iran nuclear deal and relations with China." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac476a6dc1f77d6dc5fdaf39a46083ad0d40af3f2236b3faffc3

The race is the most expensive House primary in the country this election cycle ... Trone faces several prominent rivals, including Kathleen Matthews ... State Sen.

ENGAGED -- Brandon Henke of IHS proposed to Ali-Jae Asselstine of Google at sunrise Saturday on the summit of Old Rag Mountain in Shenandoah Valley.

WEEKEND WEDDINGS -- Chris Bond, comms. director for Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and Katie Troller, manager of federal gov't relations at Walgreens, got married Saturday night in her hometown of Cincinnati.

WELCOME TO THE WORLD - Brian Walsh of Rokk Solutions emails friends: "We're so proud to announce the arrival of our baby girl Emily Bonnie Walsh who entered the world [Sunday] morning at 4:35AM weighing in at a healthy 7lbs and 1oz. Mother and baby couldn't be doing better this morning and I'm just in awe of how strong Veronica was throughout this entire process. A little background, but as many of you know, in August we lost my Mom, Bonnie, to cancer. It was just a few short days after her funeral as our family was still gathered together and grieving that we were reminded yet again though that God works in mysterious ways and He is good - as we learned the great news that we were
 expecting.

PLAYBOOK CRYSTAL BALL:
</b> Behind the scenes, most top Republicans - in Congress, on K Street and beyond - assume a President Hillary Clinton. One veteran of GOP administrations gave us his forecast for QUICK WINS Clinton could achieve under divided government (a Democratic White House and a Republican House, plus a 50-50, Democratic or GOP Senate): <b>&quot;There will be a big push for infrastructure spending and it will succeed, and it's going to be way beyond the normal road-building</b> -- deep into ports, deep into airports, just a massive national effort to build, rebuild, refurbish infrastructure. </p><p><b>&quot;You bring all the unions in there with you,
</b> every state and local government official. Even the Republicans are with you: It's very hard for Republicans to vote against fixing THEIR bridges, roads, airports, ports. And then, because the environmentalists will resist that mightily and lose, then she'll have to give the environmentalists something. So there will be a big environmental agenda, half of which won't go anywhere. </p><p><b>&quot;I think between that battle and the Supreme Court</b> -- I think she'll get Garland [if she renominates him], but it's going to be a tough fight - that's the first session of Congress. ... [S]he's got some other legislative work<b> 
</b>that would be big for the tech industry: deal with intellectual property issues, deal with H-1B visa issues, ... but not deal with [comprehensive] immigration reform, not deal with tax reform -- <b>deal with PIECES of things.</b> What you can accomplish in divided government is more tactical.&quot; </p><p><b>FIRST LOOK:

</b> because I have a non-disclosure ... I envisioned a campaign that used the more traditional tools of polling and analytics and targeting and paid media, and a greater depth of organization ... Nobody puts words in Donald's mouth. He is his own conceptualizer. All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not. </p><p><b>&quot;When you write something for him,</b> keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that ... Reagan was a big-picture guy. Trump is a big-picture guy. ...

<b>METRO'S DESIGN FLAWS - WashPost p. A1, top of cols. 1-5, &quot;Metro at 40: A mess of its own making,&quot; by Robert McCartney and Paul Duggan: </b>&quot;It's a story about a modern-era subterranean rail network constructed in a fast-paced, congested metropolitan area. Boston's and New York's systems, by contrast, were born in less-crowded regions more than a century ago. Metro was built with two tracks, not four as in New York - and with few pocket tracks, where trains can be parked out of the way - to hold down costs and minimize public disruption during the work. Now there is too little room in the narrow tunnels for maintenance and repair crews and hundreds of thousands of commuters together. ... 
</p><p><b>&quot;It's also a story </b>about the agency's early faith in automation - that computers would negate human error - which seemed to stunt the development of a safety culture, resulting in disasters. ... Many employees fear being disciplined or branded as malcontents if they point out flaws. ... And it's a story about money, about elected leaders unwilling to seek a special tax to pay for Metro, afraid of a voter backlash.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=c11088aa5d8cac47577035d89a75529d5dd005eaee9658eedd538f902bcb64fa" target="_blank">http://wapo.st/1VwWHz1</a><b> </b></p><p><b>AFTER-BERN-- N.Y.
