By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)

Good Thursday morning. CNN's Cindy Rodriguez has "Cinco de Mayo do's and don'ts." Basically: Don't. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4876050fdd2dac436a6c1508c07dcf8cbf5a60128af8485449127de60db4ba04

BITE DU JOUR: Asked whether most Republican strategists and politicians will fall in for Trump, a famous Republican operative told Daniel: "It's not a genetically courageous group."

--@jmartNYT: "Was there a mass cell service outage today? Because a lot of elected Rs are 'traveling' today and somehow unable to access cell phones." ... Molly Ball (@mollyesque): "Just ran into @gov_gilmore. 'What a nightmare, what a nightmare,' he muttered. 'Are you going to vote for him?' 'Sure.'"

--"Trump begins in a massive hole ... trails Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders by polling margins not seen in a generation," by Steven Shepard: "Trump begins the general-election phase of the campaign facing the prospect of a near-historic blowout defeat. And pollsters think he might be so far in the hole that he can't dig himself out. ... A CNN/ORC International poll ... found Clinton leading Trump by 13 points among registered voters nationally, 54 percent to 41 percent." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4876050fdd2dac430c00001e1859cce20b9c144d54efe8d30b42ebf02459b692 

--"Hill GOP braces for Trump: Republicans are reckoning with the top of their fall ticket - but some would rather focus on Paul Ryan's agenda," by Jake Sherman and Rachael Bade: "Many of them are still in shock, and some of the chattiest of them won't answer their telephones. But slowly, Hill Republicans are coming to grips with a Donald Trump-driven Republican Party, and they are already strategizing how to navigate it. ... 

"In the Senate, all five Republican leaders indicated Wednesday that they would support Trump as the eventual nominee. And on both sides of the Rotunda, members from various corners of the House and Senate Republican conferences began jumping aboard the Trump Train." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4876050fdd2dac43f98e1c41b6107a89cbac82effb70ea74cb12995ef7df09aa 

SIREN -- SEN. BEN SASSE (R-Neb.), age 44, kicks of his 2020 presidential campaign (and signals his willingness to mount, or at least help with, an independent-conservative bid in 2016) with a Facebook manifesto and tweet storm (@BenSasse), "AN OPEN LETTER TO MAJORITY AMERICA ... If you are one of those rare souls who genuinely believe Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are honorable people ... then this letter is not for you. Instead, this letter is for the majority of Americans who wonder why the nation that put a man on the moon can't find a healthy leader who can take us forward together. ... 

"I trust the judgment of this farm town [Fremont, Neb.] way more than I trust DC. And so I'd like to share a dozen-ish observations on ... [my] Wal-Mart and other conversations today: ... 3. Young people despise the two parties even more than the general electorate. ... 4. ... [W]e've not passed along the meaning of America to the next generation. ... 5. These two national political parties are enough of a mess that I believe they will come apart. ... 6. In the history of polling, we've basically never had a candidate viewed negatively by half of the electorate. This year, we have two. ... 

"9. So ... let's have a thought experiment for a few weeks: Why shouldn't America draft an honest leader who will focus on 70% solutions for the next four years? You know ... an adult? ... (Such a leader should be able to campaign 24/7 for the next six months. Therefore he/she likely can't be an engaged parent with little kids. [Sasse and his wife, Melissa, home-school their three kids.]) ... 10. Imagine if we had a candidate: ... who didn't want to stitch together a coalition based on anger but wanted to take a whole nation forward ... 

"The sun is mostly set on the Platte River -- and the kids need baths. So g'night. Ben #WeCanDoBetter #GiveUsMoreChoices." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4876050fdd2dac43af4d041dc79234ae4eb43cbfe42e809a73ac9a8ed42d2172 ...

"JOE SCARBOROUGH: I won't vote for Trump if he doesn't change," by Nick Gass: If Trump maintains his call to bar Muslims from entering the United States, he'll lose badly, Scarborough said on "Morning Joe": "The convention offers him an opportunity - will be the first time a lot of Americans have really looked at Donald Trump the candidate. ... The vice presidential selection offers him an opportunity. ... If he goes into August with these numbers, I will say in August he's going to lose big time. The window, while we have six months, he's got about a two-month window to start turning this stuff around quickly or he will lose. ... 

"I gotta say I was surprised and disappointed ... that yesterday, he stuck by the Muslim ban. That's a loser. ... I'm never going to vote for a guy who says they are going to ban somebody because of the god they worship. And he's got to have to make that turn fast. He didn't do it yesterday. Maybe he does it over the next couple of weeks." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4876050fdd2dac43b3b167f1c3b5661b9767034c7f016efaea4560ad9c4d07d8

--"Trump deportation plan would wreak economic havoc, study says," by Nick Gass: "[A]ccording to a study released [today] by the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank, ... [r]ounding [illegal immigrants] up and deporting them, even temporarily, would result in a decrease of $381.5 billion to $623.2 billion of economic output." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4876050fdd2dac43b5773668e78cce9b7bee708abd10719769ba500c4b493433 ...

BUSINESS BURST -- WSJ editorial, "The Quickening: Why is Justice suing one of the nation's most careful FHA lenders?": "You'd never know it from Washington's tale of a reckless corporation endangering the public fisc, but instead of losing money, taxpayers appear to be making money off Quicken Loans. In a legal filing last year, the company said that, according to the government's own evaluations of mortgage lenders, 'the quality of loans originated by Quicken Loans today is more than twice as good as the national average, and the best among all large FHA lenders.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4876050fdd2dac43837b3fbe962ec0fae7265f24a31bd71815ac3d6f752afe22

CLICKER - MICHAEL KRUSE and NOAH WEILAND in Politico Magazine, "Donald Trump's Greatest Self-Contradictions: The many, many, MANY sides of the likely Republican nominee, in his own words": "To create the definitive archive of Trump's long argument with himself, POLITICO mined an almost limitless seam of his radio and TV interviews, newspaper and magazine profiles, books written about him and books written by him, rambling campaign speeches and late-night tweets. ...

SCOOP DU JOUR - "McCain on tape: Trump damages my reelection hopes," by Burgess Everett and Seung Min Kim: "Publicly, John McCain insists Donald Trump will have a negligible effect on his campaign for reelection. But behind closed doors at a fundraiser in Arizona last month, [he] offered a far more dire assessment to his supporters. 'If Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket, here in Arizona, with over 30 percent of the vote being the Hispanic vote, no doubt that this may be the race of my life,' McCain said ... 'If you listen or watch Hispanic media in the state and in the country, you will see that it is all anti-Trump. The Hispanic community is roused and angry in a way that I've never
 seen in 30 years.'" With 1-min. audio http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4876050fdd2dac433a8e4cf29061ffaac29b974891876cfcb2aa253100a43a8a

FLASHBACK -- "Trump in 2000: How I'll Be the First Celebrity President," by The Daily Beast: "In an eerily prescient interview in 2000, Donald Trump predicted his own political rise and laid out his plan to hack the media. ... Here's The Donald [in Gear magazine] ... applauding the 'celebrity culture in which athletes, movie stars and businessmen are considered for public office,' ripping 'the hypocrites (who) argue that a man who loves and appreciates beautiful women...shouldn't become a national leader' and trashing 'the whinnying culture critics and media hacks (who) bemoan the rise of celebrity culture.'"

BEN RHODES PROFILE - in the upcoming N.Y. Times Magazine, "The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama's Foreign-Policy Guru: How Ben Rhodes rewrote the rules of diplomacy for the digital age," by David Samuels: "Like Obama, Rhodes is a storyteller who uses a writer's tools to advance an agenda that is packaged as politics but is often quite personal. He is adept at constructing overarching plotlines with heroes and villains who materialize in digital space, with their conflicts and motivations supported by flurries of carefully chosen adjectives, quotations and leaks from named and unnamed senior officials.

"He is the master shaper and retailer of Obama's foreign-policy narratives, at a time when the killer wave of social media has washed away the sand castles of the traditional press. His ability to navigate and shape this new environment makes him a more effective and powerful extension of the president's will than any number of policy advisers or diplomats or spies. He doesn't think for the president, but he knows what the president is thinking, which is a source of tremendous power within a White House that has awarded itself vastly expanded authority over the operations of the American government, just as George Bush's and Bill Clinton's White Houses did.'"

SNEAK PEEKS -- "Is Donald Trump 'The Steve Jobs of Politics?' Newt Gingrich thinks so," by Bloomberg Businessweek's Joshua Green with Kevin Cirilli and Jennifer Jacobs: Newt Gingrich says of Trump, "He's been so creative, and he does things so differently, and he will be so dominant, that we have to figure out how we build around him ... This is one, singular person who is the Steve Jobs of modern politics. And he is going to drive the system." Gingrich also doesn't shoot down rumors he could be Trump's VP: "given an invitation to end the speculation by issuing a Shermaneque denial, he replied, 'Nobody from Georgia issues Shermanesque statements. It goes against the state constitution.'"

JARED KUSHNER PROFILE -- "First you get the newspaper ... Then you get the building ... Then you get the father-in-law ... Then you get the power," by Bloomberg Businessweek's Devon Leonard: "He began making major decisions at his family's real estate company ... when he was 23 in 2004, around the time his father, a prominent Democratic fundraiser and aspiring kingmaker, pleaded guilty to tax fraud, misleading federal election officials, and retaliating against a witness. ... People who think highly of Kushner, and those who don't, all talk about his impeccable manners. They say he never loses his temper, at least not in public. He's unfailingly polite. He remembers names and opens car
 doors for people. ... Kushner is also extremely guarded ... [and] often comes across as purposefully bland, as if he's trying to discourage interest in his activities-or himself." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4876050fdd2dac43a0bb615c926b5f0bc4d7daa142d47a83d699ab2b4e001f63

REMEMBERING BOB BENNETT - Salt Lake Tribune's Thomas Burr: "Bennett died Wednesday after fighting for months against pancreatic cancer and suffering a recent stroke. He was 82. The former Utah Republican senator's 6-foot-6 lanky frame inevitably led to comparisons with Washington Irving's character Ichabod Crane. But in recent years he took on a different persona: a symbol of the old-style politician who practiced the art of compromise being overwhelmed by the rising power of the tea party.

He is adept at constructing overarching plotlines with heroes and villains who materialize in digital space, with their conflicts and motivations supported by flurries of carefully chosen adjectives, quotations and leaks from named and unnamed senior officials.</p><p><b>&quot;He is the master shaper 
</b>and retailer of Obama's foreign-policy narratives, at a time when the killer wave of social media has washed away the sand castles of the traditional press. His ability to navigate and shape this new environment makes him a more effective and powerful extension of the president's will than any number of policy advisers or diplomats or spies. He doesn't think for the president, but he knows what the president is thinking, which is a source of tremendous power within a White House that has awarded itself vastly expanded authority over the operations of the American government, just as George Bush's and Bill Clinton's White Houses did.'&quot;
