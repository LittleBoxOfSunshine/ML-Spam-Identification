 Hello Gentlemen,
I wanted to know how Dr. Ami Bera was doing in his reelection bid. For some reason I thought he was up in 2015. Found out by stalking his pages and realizing his election is 2016 (LOL). Also, the $1,000 that I donated to his campaign did not translate to the DNC records. It is not a big deal considering that I didn't mind donating the extra $1,000 towards my WLF conference balance. Just wanted to make you aware that there may be a glitch in the system for those who donated to Dr. Bera's campaign. Again, I am perfectly fine....just worried that others might not be. Thanks for all you do for our party!
Stay blessed,Michelle Garcia-Daniels
