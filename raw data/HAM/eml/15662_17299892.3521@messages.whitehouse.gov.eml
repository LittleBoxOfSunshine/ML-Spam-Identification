THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

EMBARGOED UNTIL 6:00AM ET, SATURDAY, April 30, 2016



*WEEKLY ADDRESS: Its Time for the Senate To Do Its Job *



WASHINGTON, DC  In this week's address, the President repeated his call f=
or Republicans in the United States Senate to give Chief Judge Merrick Ga=
rland a fair hearing and a vote. It has been 45 days since President Obam=
a nominated Judge Garland to the Supreme Court. The President highlighted=
 that Senate Republicans have said that Judge Garland is a man of experie=
nce, integrity and impeccable qualifications. Despite this, most Senate R=
epublicans refused to do their job and give Judge Garland the considerati=
on he deserves. The President made clear that the Supreme Court must rema=
in above partisan politics, and that's why the President did his job in n=
ominating Merrick Garland. Now, it's time for the Senate to do its job.



The audio of the address and video of the address will be available onlin=
e at www.whitehouse.gov [ http://www.whitehouse.gov ] at 6:00 a.m. ET, Ap=
ril 30, 2016.=20

*Remarks of President Barack Obama as Delivered*

*Weekly Address*

*The White House*

*April 30, 2016*



Hi, everybody. Its now been 45 days since I nominated Judge Merrick Garla=
nd to the Supreme Court. Judge Garland is a man of experience, integrity,=
 and unimpeachable qualifications. Judge Garland is someone who Senate Re=
publicans are on record saying is a man of accomplishment and keen intell=
ect; a man whos honest and capable; a man whose reputation is beyond repr=
oach. Those are all quotes from Republicans in the Senate.



But so far, most Senate Republicans have refused to even meet with Judge =
Garland. Which means theyve also refused to do their job and hold a heari=
ng on his nomination, or an up-or-down vote. But theyve still found time =
to head home for recess over the next week.



This is an abdication of the Senates responsibility. Every Supreme Court =
nominee since 1875 who hasnt withdrawn from the process has received a he=
aring or a vote. For over 40 years, theres been an average of 67 days bet=
ween a nomination and a hearing. This time should be no different. This i=
s not about partisan politics  its about upholding the institutions that =
make our democracy work.=20



Theres a reason Judge Garland has earned the respect of people from both =
political parties. As a young lawyer, he left a lucrative private firm to=
 work in public service. He went to oversee the federal response to the O=
klahoma City bombing. For the last 19 years, Judge Garland has served on =
the D.C. Circuit Court  often called the Second Highest Court in the Land=
  and for the past three years, hes served as that courts Chief Judge. In=
 fact, Judge Merrick Garland has more federal judicial experience than an=
y other Supreme Court nominee in history. With a brilliant mind, a kind s=
pirit, and a good heart, he has dedicated his life to protecting our righ=
ts, and ensuring that the voices of everyday Americans are heard.



So there is absolutely no reason for Republican Senators to deny him the =
basic courtesy of a hearing and a vote  the same courtesy that has been e=
xtended to others. This refusal to treat a Supreme Court nomination with =
the seriousness it deserves is what makes people so cynical about Washing=
ton. Thats why poll after poll shows a majority of Americans think Senate=
 Republicans should do their job; give Judge Garland a hearing; and give =
Judge Garland a vote.



For all of our political differences, Americans understand that what unit=
es us is far greater than what divides us. And in the middle of a volatil=
e political season, it is more important than ever that we fulfill our du=
ties  in good faith  as public servants. The Supreme Court must remain ab=
ove partisan politics. Ive done my job  I nominated someone as qualified =
as Merrick Garland. Now its time for the Senate to dotheir job. Give Judg=
e Garland a hearing. Give Judge Garland an up-or-down vote. Treat him  an=
d our democracy  with the respect they deserve.=20



Thanks for listening, and have a great weekend.=20

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,serif">Hi, everybody.&nbsp; It=92s now been 45 days since =
I nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Judge Garland=
 is a man of experience, integrity, and unimpeachable qualifications.&nbsp;
 Judge Garland is someone who Senate Republicans are on record saying is =
=93a man of accomplishment and keen intellect;=94 a man who=92s =93honest a=
nd capable;=94 a man whose =93reputation is beyond reproach.=94&nbsp; Those=
 are all quotes from Republicans in the Senate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,serif">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,serif">But so far, most Senate Republicans have refused to=
 even meet with Judge Garland.&nbsp; Which means they=92ve also refused to =
do their job and hold a hearing on his nomination, or
 an up-or-down vote.&nbsp; But they=92ve still found time to head home for =
recess over the next week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,serif">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,serif">This is an abdication of the Senate=92s responsibil=
ity.&nbsp; Every Supreme Court nominee since 1875 who hasn=92t withdrawn fr=
om the process has received a hearing or a vote.&nbsp; For over
 40 years, there=92s been an average of 67 days between a nomination and a =
hearing.&nbsp; This time should be no different.&nbsp; This is not about pa=
rtisan politics =96 it=92s about upholding the institutions that make our d=
emocracy work.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,serif">There=92s a reason Judge Garland has earned the res=
pect of people from both political parties.&nbsp; As a young lawyer, he lef=
t a lucrative private firm to work in public service.&nbsp;
 He went to oversee the federal response to the Oklahoma City bombing.&nbsp=
; For the last 19 years, Judge Garland has served on the D.C. Circuit Court=
 =96 often called =93the Second Highest Court in the Land=94 =96 and for th=
e past three years, he=92s served as that court=92s
 Chief Judge.&nbsp; In fact, Judge Merrick Garland has more federal judicia=
l experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history.&nbsp; With a =
brilliant mind, a kind spirit, and a good heart, he has dedicated his life =
to protecting our rights, and ensuring that
 the voices of everyday Americans are heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,serif">So there is absolutely no reason for Republican Sen=
ators to deny him the basic courtesy of a hearing and a vote =96 the same c=
ourtesy that has been extended to others.&nbsp; This
 refusal to treat a Supreme Court nomination with the seriousness it deserv=
es is what makes people so cynical about Washington.&nbsp; That=92s why pol=
l after poll shows a majority of Americans think Senate Republicans should =
do their job; give Judge Garland a hearing;
 and give Judge Garland a vote.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bo=
ok Antiqua&quot;,serif">For all of our political differences, Americans und=
erstand that what unites us is far greater than what divides us.&nbsp; And =
in the middle of a volatile political season, it is
 more important than ever that we fulfill our duties =96 in good faith =96 =
as public servants.&nbsp; The Supreme Court must remain above partisan poli=
tics.&nbsp; I=92ve done my job =96 I nominated someone as qualified as Merr=
ick Garland.&nbsp; Now it=92s time for the Senate to do&nbsp;their
 job.&nbsp; Give Judge Garland a hearing.&nbsp; Give Judge Garland an up-or=
-down vote.&nbsp; Treat him =96 and our democracy =96 with the respect they=
 deserve.&nbsp;
