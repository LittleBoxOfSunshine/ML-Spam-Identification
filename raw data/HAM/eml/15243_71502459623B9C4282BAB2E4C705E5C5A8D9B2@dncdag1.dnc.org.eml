GOP Actions Speak Louder Than Report's Words<http://www.realclearpolitics.c=
om/articles/2015/03/19/gop_actions_speak_louder_than_reports_words.html>
REALCLEARPOLITICS // DNC CHAIR REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ
Two years ago, as RNC Chairman Reince Priebus reminded us yesterday, the Re=
publican National Committee published its report on what went wrong for the=
ir party in 2012. He talked a lot about targeting communities, ground game,=
 and shiny, new applications for reaching voters. And to be clear, I unders=
tand those are important to the success of a political party and we're prou=
d of the pioneering programs we Democrats have in place as well, but he rea=
lly missed the point. The item my counterpart failed to address in his anal=
ysis is that the Republican Party hasn't changed its policies that alienate=
 the communities they now claim to target.
The RNC said in its report that Republicans need to do a better job of show=
ing that they care about women, the middle class, our seniors, young people=
, the LGBT community and people of color. What the RNC has proven over the =
past two years, though, is that its policies are harmful for these groups a=
nd for the entire middle class and anyone trying to get into the middle cla=
ss. I didn't have to think very long to identify a few examples where Repub=
licans showed us how little they've changed over the past two years.
First, one of the major recommendations of the 2013 RNC report was that the=
 party "welcome in" Latino voters. At this point, we've seen the lengths th=
e Republican Party will go to avoid passing any sort of comprehensive immig=
ration reform. And beyond that, the lengths it will go to stop any assistan=
ce for the 11 million Americans living in limbo in this country. Threatenin=
g to shut down the Department of Homeland Security, a strategy led by GOP p=
residential candidate Ted Cruz but endorsed by many others in the potential=
 Republican presidential field, over President Obama's executive action to =
ease the burden on some of these individuals was a new low. Democrats have =
made it clear that we are more than eager to pass reform, and Republicans i=
n Congress along with the 2016 GOP presidential field will do everything th=
ey can to stand in the way.
When it comes to women, the Republican Party wants to take us back to the 1=
950s. Ahead of jobs, the economy, helping the middle class, strengthening o=
ur infrastructure or even improving our education system, Republicans intro=
duced five anti-women's health bills in the first three days of the new Con=
gress. In fact, on the very first day of the 114th Congress, Republicans in=
troduced a bill that would limit a woman's right to control her body. Actio=
ns speak so much louder than words.
The report also said that the party needs to show "gay Americans . . . we c=
are about them, too." I can think of a few ways to show that better than Re=
publicans opposing marriage equality, refusing to take up the Employment No=
n-Discrimination Act in the House, and supporting bills permitting LGBT-dis=
crimination at the state level. GOP presidential contender Rand Paul called=
 same-sex marriage "offensive" and others in the GOP field have joined him =
in his opposition to marriage equality.
And those communities are just the start of it. Across the board, Republica=
ns brush off the weakening of the Voting Rights Act and Republican-led stat=
e legislatures have pushed to make voting harder and more restrictive, whil=
e courting the vote of African-Americans. And Republicans in Congress block=
ed measures to help students pay off their student loans, while utilizing S=
napchat as their answer to satisfying young people. Any way you look at it,=
 they are missing the mark. But the real root of their problem is that they=
 are just completely out of touch with the middle class and people trying t=
o move into the middle class.
Last year, Republicans in Congress refused to extend unemployment insurance=
, while supporting the Ryan budget, which cut taxes for the wealthy. And wh=
en it comes to raising the federal minimum wage, Republicans are standing i=
n the way.  Jeb Bush called this effort just a "sound bite" and other Repub=
licans in their potential presidential field have opposed raising the feder=
al minimum wage. So much for helping hard-working middle-class Americans lo=
oking to get back on their feet.
A few weeks ago, Republicans held yet another vote -- we're now at more tha=
n 50 -- to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act. While this week, De=
mocrats proudly applauded the 16.4 million individuals who gained coverage =
under President Obama's landmark health care law, Republicans, including th=
e entire 2016 presidential field, continue to talk of full repeal.
Just this week, we also saw the kicker on their list of priorities. How can=
 you claim to understand the needs of everyday Americans when you want to e=
liminate the Medicaid expansion that has helped millions access affordable =
health insurance and slash Medicaid as a whole, plan to voucherize Medicare=
, freeze Pell grants, and undermine Wall Street reform? This stands strongl=
y in contrast to the values of the Democratic Party and the work President =
Obama has done during his time in office.
The fact is, two years later, Republicans' superficial renovations won't wo=
rk if their backwards policies remain exactly the same -- or have even gott=
en worse. Reince Priebus acknowledged in discussing the GOP report that Rep=
ublicans were doomed to lose presidential elections unless they made change=
s. Until the party goes beyond changing its rhetoric and starts changing it=
s policies, they'll remain the Republican Party of the past.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) is the chairwoman of the Democratic Na=
tional Committee.
