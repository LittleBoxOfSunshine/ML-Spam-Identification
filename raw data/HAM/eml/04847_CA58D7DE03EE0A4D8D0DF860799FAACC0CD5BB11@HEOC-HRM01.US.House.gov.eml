Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi, Chairman Upton and Representa=
tive Pallone, and Chairman Rogers and Representative Lowey,

The undersigned organizations committed to the health and wellbeing of our =
nation=92s families and communities urge you in the strongest terms to imme=
diately provide emergency supplemental funding to prepare for and respond t=
o the Zika virus here in the United States. We also urge that Congress prov=
ide new funding rather than repurpose money from other high priority progra=
ms at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other federa=
l agencies that ensure our health security and public health preparedness.

As you know, the Zika virus has been linked to microcephaly, a serious birt=
h defect of the brain, in babies of mothers who contracted the virus while =
pregnant. Thousands of devastating birth defects have been observed among i=
nfants born in South and Central America in recent months.  Zika has alread=
y been diagnosed in travelers returning to the U.S. from these areas.  As t=
he summer months approach and we enter mosquito season, our nation can expe=
ct to be exposed to mosquitos that can spread this virus.  Over four millio=
n babies are born in our nation each year, and many of their mothers could =
be at risk for contracting Zika during pregnancy.

With emergency supplemental funding to respond to the Zika virus, state and=
 local public health professionals would have access to increased virus rea=
diness and response capacity focused on areas with ongoing Zika transmissio=
n; enhanced laboratory, epidemiology and surveillance capacity in at-risk a=
reas to reduce the opportunities for Zika transmission and surge capacity t=
hrough rapid response teams to limit potential clusters of Zika virus in th=
e United States. Moreover, supplemental funding will assist the CDC and USA=
ID in efforts to contain the Zika virus in Zika-endemic countries and ensur=
e that there are resources for surveillance, vector control and services fo=
r affected pregnant women and children.

If we take immediate action, we may be able to dramatically slow the spread=
 of Zika, giving scientists time to develop and test a vaccine.  Without ac=
tion, however, we fear the number of newborns born with debilitating birth =
defects will only continue to rise.  In addition to the human toll on child=
ren and families, the CDC estimates that the average lifetime cost of carin=
g for each child born with microcephaly will likely be millions of dollars =
per child.  For hard-hit communities, an epidemic of severe birth defects c=
ould quickly overwhelm health care and social services systems, and put ext=
reme pressure on educational and other institutions.

The President has requested emergency funding to educate Americans about pr=
otecting themselves, reduce the mosquito population, and accelerate Zika va=
ccine research.  Each of these steps is vital to reducing the likelihood th=
at pregnant women will be exposed to the Zika virus.

Our nation has a brief window of opportunity to slow the spread of the Zika=
 virus and avert a wave of preventable birth defects.  We urge you to act i=
mmediately to provide the emergency resources necessary to protect pregnant=
 women, infants and children from this devastating infection.
