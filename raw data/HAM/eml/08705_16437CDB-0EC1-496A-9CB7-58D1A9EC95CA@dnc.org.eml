Sanders Statement on Indiana Primary Win


May 3, 2016
Contact: Michael Briggs (802) 233-8653

NEW ALBANY, Ind. =96 U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statemen=
t on Tuesday after The Associated Press projected that he won the Indiana p=
rimary:

=93I want to thank the people of Indiana for the great upset victory that t=
hey gave us tonight. This is the 18th state that we have won, and we expect=
 more victories in the weeks to come.

"The Clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over. They=92re wrong. Maybe =
it=92s over for the insiders and the party establishment, but the voters in=
 Indiana had a different idea. The campaign wasn=92t over for them. It isn=
=92t over for the voters in West Virginia. It isn=92t over for Democrats in=
 Oregon, New Jersey and Kentucky. It isn=92t over for voters in California =
and all the other states with contests still to come.

=93We understand that we have an uphill climb to victory but we have been f=
ighting uphill from the first day of this campaign. We are in this campaign=
 to win and we=92re going to fight until the last vote is cast. There is no=
thing I would like more than to take on and defeat Donald Trump, someone wh=
o must never become president of this country.

=93The voters in the remaining contests deserve a chance to compare my reco=
rd and Hillary Clinton=92s record on creating jobs, raising the minimum wag=
e, war and peace, the need for health care for all, breaking up big banks, =
combating climate change and other critical issues. To help voters make the=
 best-informed choice possible, I hope that Secretary Clinton will agree to=
 a date and place for a debate in California.=94
