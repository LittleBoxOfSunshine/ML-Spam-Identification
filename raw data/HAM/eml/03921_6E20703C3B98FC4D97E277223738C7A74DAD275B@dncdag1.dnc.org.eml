Excerpts from DNC Chair Rep. Wasserman Schultz at the ASDC Meeting in Philadelphia

PHILADELPHIA, PA -- Today, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz addressed a meeting of the Association of State Democratic Chairs. Below you will find excerpts as prepared for delivery:



"I'm excited to join you all here in Philadelphia, the home of our upcoming convention where we will show the world a Democratic Party ready for one of the most important General Elections of our time. I'm proud of the work that each and every one of you is doing in your states, managing what is never an easy delegate selection process, but one that will bring the values and diversity of our party and our country to this city in just 66 days!

...



"When Democrats from all across this great country come to the City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection, we will be energized, united and focused on making sure that we continue to build upon the progress we've made under President Obama by electing a Democrat as the 45th President of the United States of America.



"And that's really what this is all about. Making sure that together we launch our nominee into the White House with the support of a Democratic House and Senate and State Houses across the country so that we can continue to: Build a strong and safe future for our children and grandchildren, grow our economy and create good paying jobs; and move our country forward for all Americans, not just the wealthy and well connected!

...



"In just the last week, the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump has backpedaled away from his own pledge to release his tax returns, vowed to slash taxes for those at the top like himself, and seemingly lied about pretending to be his own publicist. He refused to address his well-documented history of misogyny and insulted one of our country's most important allies, Great Britain. His campaign called their selection of a white supremacist delegate a 'database error.'



"I don't know about you, but it didn't exactly put me at ease either, when Trump suggested we could always resolve debt by printing more money, and he legitimized a despotic North Korean dictator. Every day there's a new example of his knee-jerk recklessness, lack of judgment and unstable temperament.



"But we cannot gloss over the genuine concern that too many Americans are still feeling about their own pocketbooks and our place in the world. Donald Trump is promoting anxiety as a way to ease people's concern. We need to listen to them because our candidates have the most thoughtful solutions. That's why your work is so crucial. That's why, at the DNC, we're doing everything we can to support you and help you bring people into the general election energized, understanding what's at stake, and championing the values and priorities that make our party and our country great.

...

"Nearly 23 million people have participated in our primaries and both campaigns have worked so hard to advance ideas that will improve the lives of Americans. Supporters of both Clinton and Sanders deserve respect for the work they have put into their campaigns. That is a stark contrast with the divisive policies that have come from the Republicans. I will always stand up for party activists because they bring us energy and ideas. I will always stand up for the leaders of this party because they volunteer their precious time to guide our progressive future. We are Democrats and we welcome everyone in. More importantly, our agenda, unlike Republicans, is inclusive and welcomes everyone!

...

"Because of Democratic leadership: 20 million Americans have health insurance who didn't before. We've seen 74 straight months of private sector job growth creating over 14 million new jobs and we all remember the Great Recession, when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month when George W Bush left office. Well, we are not going back by allowing a Trump presidency.
...



"By working together as Democrats, we can accomplish great things for honest, hard-working people from every walk of life. Our record shows we can set and pass an agenda that promotes economic growth, fairness and opportunity. Yes, fellow Democrats: America's future is bright. When we stick together, anything is possible.  I'm excited for the future of our party, and I'm proud of your work that I know will carry us forward into a brighter future. On to victory!"
