 a reaction from us:

"The Democratic Party stands for diversity, inclusivity, and a level playin=
g field for all families -- and that includes marriage equality and equal p=
rotection under the law for all LGBT Americans. The Republican Party and ea=
ch of its presidential candidates would take the country back decades, part=
icularly when it comes to equality. Bush, Rubio, Walker, Kasich, Trump and =
all the rest have endorsed discriminatory policies against gay couples in o=
ne form or another. For LGBT Americans, the Republican candidates are all t=
he same."

NEW YORK TIMES // EDITORIAL BOARD

This past June, in the heat of their outrage over gay rights, congressional=
 Republicans revived a nasty bit of business they call the First Amendment =
Defense Act. It would do many things, but one thing it would not do is defe=
nd the First Amendment. To the contrary, it would deliberately warp the bed=
rock principle of religious freedom under the Constitution.

The bill, versions of which have been circulating since 2013, gained a sudd=
en wave of support after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nati=
onwide. It is being hawked with the specter of clergy members being forced =
to officiate such marriages. This is a ploy, as the bill's backers surely k=
now: There has never been any doubt that the First Amendment protects membe=
rs of the clergy from performing weddings against their will.

In reality, the act would bar the federal government from taking "any discr=
iminatory action" - including the denial of tax benefits, grants, contracts=
 or licenses - against those who oppose same-sex marriage for religious or =
moral reasons. In other words, it would use taxpayers' money to negate fede=
ral anti-discrimination measures protecting gays and lesbians, using the id=
ea of religious freedom as cover.

For example, a religiously affiliated college that receives federal grants =
could fire a professor simply for being gay and still receive those grants.=
 Or federal workers could refuse to process the tax returns of same-sex cou=
ples simply because of bigotry against their marriages.

It doesn't stop there. As critics of the bill quickly pointed out, the meas=
ure's broad language - which also protects those who believe that "sexual r=
elations are properly reserved to" heterosexual marriages alone - would per=
mit discrimination against anyone who has sexual relations outside such a m=
arriage. That would appear to include women who have children outside of ma=
rriage, a class generally protected by federal law.

This bizarre fixation on what grown-ups do in their bedrooms - which haslon=
g since been rejected by the Supreme Court and the vast majority of America=
ns - is bad enough. The bill makes matters worse by covering for-profit com=
panies, which greatly multiplies the potential scope of discrimination agai=
nst gays and lesbians.

These are radical proposals, but they are accepted without question by many=
 in today's Republican Party. In its current form, the bill has 148 co-spon=
sors in the House and 36 in the Senate - all Republicans but one, Represent=
ative Daniel Lipinski of Illinois. It has been endorsed by the Republican N=
ational Committee and at least four Republican presidential contenders. It =
is, in other words, a fair representation of right-wing reaction to the lon=
g overdue expansion of basic civil and constitutional rights to gays and le=
sbians.

Thankfully, the bill's chances of passage are low. Even if it were to get t=
hrough Congress, President Obama would surely veto it. Still, its symbolic =
power will embolden those looking for a legal justification to discriminate=
 - whether they are individuals like Kim Davis, the county clerk in Kentuck=
y who went to jail rather than obey the law and issue same-sex marriage lic=
enses, or states, where similar legislation has a much better chance of bec=
oming law. In Indiana and Arkansas, laws protecting such discrimination hav=
e already passed.

Both laws, of course, provoked a swift and emphatic backlash from the publi=
c and the corporate world, leading both states to scale them back. (Indiana=
's governor, Mike Pence, embarked on a bumbling effort to claim that his st=
ate's law would not provide cover for discrimination against gays and lesbi=
ans.)

Fear of a similar debacle at the national level may help explain why a comm=
ittee vote in Congress on the First Amendment Defense Act, which conservati=
ve Republicans pushed for in late July, was not scheduled.

The best outcome at this point would be for the bill to die where it is. Th=
e First Amendment needs no assistance in protecting religious freedom in Am=
erica.

Many religious leaders and clergy members are themselves deeply disturbed b=
y the proposed legislation; more than 3,000 signed a letteropposing it on t=
he grounds that genuine religious liberty "does not allow us to harm or dis=
criminate against others." The supporters of this bill, who are so eager to=
 talk about religious freedom, would do well to listen to the people they c=
laim to represent.
