Scott -- I've been a member of DNC LGBT leadership council via $100 monthly
donation (for past couple of years).  At this point in 2016, I've
contributed $500 (Jan-May), and the monthly charge hits my credit card
around 20th of month.

I'd like to stop the monthly contributions going forward, and make a
one-time payment of $700 to secure a ticket for the 2016 DNC LGBT gala.

Can you assist me with that transaction, or connect me with a staff member
who can work it out?

Thanks
Andy
