[Trump and Christie hostage]MAC STIPANOVICH: AN OPEN LETTER TO MY FELLOW RE=
PUBLICANS
May 4, 2016  By Guest Author<http://floridapolitics.com/archives/author/gue=
stauthor>



Each of us wants to believe that if we were tested in some fundamental way =
when the chips were down =97 morally, spiritually, or physically =97 that w=
e would pass the test.

But we do not really expect to be tested. That sort of thing only happens t=
o people we see on television and read about in books, heroes and such. And=
 if we were tested, surely we would know it. How could a literal moment of =
truth in our lives go unnoticed?

The answer is Normalcy Bias. That=92s the sense that this day, this problem=
, or, in the instant case, this election is pretty much like any other, dif=
ferent only in degree, not in kind, that everything will be alright, notwit=
hstanding overwhelming evidence to the contrary, because everything has alw=
ays been alright before.

We analyze, rationalize, and temporize until we fail the test by not taking=
 it.

Make no mistake, we Republicans stand on the threshold of a fundamental mor=
al test in the 2016 presidential election, a challenge so serious as to be =
existential. As Ronald Reagan said in 1964, it is a time for choosing, and =
the choice, while clear, is one Reagan could never have imagined.

Hillary Clinton on the one hand; Donald Trump on the other. Scylla and Char=
ybdis. The Devil and the deep blue sea. Or so it would appear.

But appearances deceive. Hillary Clinton is in the minds of many conservati=
ves an ethically challenged liberal, hatred of whom has become a reflexive =
part of Republican liturgy. But as flawed as she may be, she is different o=
nly in degree from past presidential candidates. She is business as usual c=
oncealed by a little progressive smoke here and a few populist mirrors ther=
e.

Donald Tump, on the other hand, is different in kind, and dangerously so.

On a personal level, Trump is a boor, a bully, a carnival barker, and an em=
barrassment. Politically, by intent or instinct, he is a neo-fascist =97 a =
nativist, an ultranationalist, a racist, a misogynist, an anti-intellectual=
, a demagogue, and a palingenetic (sorry) authoritarian to whom clings the =
odor of the political violence he encourages.

He appeals to our fears, preys on our anxieties, and exploits our ignorance=
. A worse candidate to sit in the Oval Office for the next four years canno=
t be imagined.

And he is our responsibility. We spawned Donald Trump; now we must stop him=
. We must deny him the presidency by not voting in the presidential electio=
n at all or voting for Hillary Clinton if conscience permits.

A drop of a few percentage points in the Republican vote for Trump will be =
enough, which is why the pressure to conform, to toe the Party line, will b=
e enormous. We cannot depend on our elected leaders to lead us. They, for t=
he most part, will fold like cheap lawn chairs, cowed by fear and fueled by=
 ambition.

It=92s up to us. Each one of us is being tested, and the choice each of us =
makes matters, for ourselves, for our grandchildren. As bad as the cure for=
 Trump=92s Caesarism will be for the Party and for the country, it will not=
 be bad as the disease, and both will survive.

So if anyone asks you, =93Et tu Brute?=94 answer proudly, =93Damned right.=
=94

***

John =93Mac=94 Stipanovich is a Republican lawyer and lobbyist who served a=
s Gov. Bob Martinez=92s chief of staff.
