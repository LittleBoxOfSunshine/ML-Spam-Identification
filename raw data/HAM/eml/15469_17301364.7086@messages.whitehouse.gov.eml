Subject: Travel Pool Report #7 -- Meeting at HS

Your Pool was led into the library at Northwestern high school, where POT=
US was taking a seat at a small, round table with nine residents of Flint=
. As the Pool entered, POTUS was asking each of the folks to introduce th=
emselves to him, and tell him how long theyve lived in Flint. Your pool h=
eard a couple of the answers, including one man who said he was born thre=
e months before POTUS. POTUS said the man looks better than he does.

Then your pool was led out and is now holding in the gymnasium, where POT=
US will deliver open-press remarks at around 4 pm.

Background from the White House:

Prior to his remarks at Northwestern High School, the President is taking=
 part in a roundtable with the following individuals to hear from Flint r=
esidents firsthand:

Sister Carol Weber

Sister Carol Weber is the co-founder and Director of St. Luke New Life Ce=
nter in Flint, which focuses on helping at-risk families through employme=
nt-preparation programs, and includes a food pantry and literacy center. =
Since the crisis, the St. Luke New Life Center has added additional progr=
amming for those whose health has been affected by the water crisis.

Jaslyn Morris

A senior at the University of Michigan-Flint, Jaslyn Morris is the outgoi=
ng President of the UM-Flint Black Student Union, which has worked to dis=
tribute water, water filters, nutritional supplements, and other supplies=
 to Flint residents. Jaslyn and her organization at UM-Flint co-hosted a =
discussion with Wayne State University on the water crisis.

Harold Harrington

Born and raised in Flint, Harold Harrington is the Business Manager for t=
he UA Local 370 Plumbers and Pipefitters, which since October 2015 has co=
mpleted 10,000 volunteer hours installing filters, faucets and delivering=
 bottled water to the residents of Flint and donated more than $50,000 fo=
r bottled water and filters. Harold has led these efforts, and experience=
d water in his own home with lead levels ten times the legal limit.

Nicholas Custer

In January, Nicholas Custer  a lifelong resident of Flint  wrote the Pres=
ident a letter expressing his frustrations with the situation on the grou=
nd in his community. Nicholas does outreach to the community for his empl=
oyer, the University of Michigan-Flint. The lead levels in Nicholas own h=
ome, which he purchased last year, were too high.

Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha

Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha is the director of the Pediatric Residency Program=
 at Hurley Medical Center. She has been a vocal advocate for the people o=
f Flint during the water crisis and directs the Michigan State University=
 and Hurley Childrens Hospital Public Health Initiative, which aims to re=
search, monitor, and mitigate the impact of lead in Flints drinking water=
.

Rev. Rigel Dawson

Reverend Rigel J. Dawson moved to Flint in 2009 where he is the full-time=
 pastor at North Central Church of Christ and the treasurer of Michigan F=
aith in Action. In 2014, his two children were affected by bathing in the=
 contaminated Flint water.

Tyrone Wooten

Tyrone Wooten created a YouTube video called Bottled Water, to show his f=
amilys struggles to deal with the water crisis when they were using betwe=
en 900 and 1,000 bottles of water a week. He says the video is meant to s=
how the day-to-day toll the crisis brings to everyone for something most =
Americans take for granted  clean water.

Nicole Spears

Nicole Spears, a married mother of six boys who lives in Flint, wrote to =
the President in January about the stresses and worries  economic and phy=
sical  that the water crisis in Flint has caused for her family.

Rick Vasquez

Rick Vasquez is a retired General Motors worker who volunteers as the wat=
er distribution coordinator for the Our Lady of Guadalupe Church in Flint=
, which serves a majority Spanish-speaking population. His whole family  =
even his pet dog  have experienced adverse reactions to the contaminated =
water, something he never thought he would face in the community hes live=
d in since he was three.
