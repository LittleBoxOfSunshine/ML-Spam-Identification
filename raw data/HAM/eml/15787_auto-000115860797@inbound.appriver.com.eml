I am attorney P. F Timmons Jr an international licensed attorney and a principal attorney of TIMMONS LAW FIRM of 8556 Katy Freeway, Suite 120 Houston Tx 7702-1806 USA with branches in United Kingdom and Africa, it delights me to inform you that I have concluded negotiations with CHASE BANK management 924 Broadway Ave, Bowling Green, KY 42101, branch&nbsp; United States of America for the release of the sum of [$2,000,000.00] Two million USD recovered in your name from Dept Management Board in Africa by men / authority of Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] as a Contract inheritance approved to be released to you since 2010 by Lagos State government.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
As the accredited attorney of Federal Bureau of Investigation appointed to negotiate the release of the aforementioned amount to you with the management of Chase bank 924 Broadway Ave, Bowling Green, KY 42101 branch where the money was transferred to.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
The $2million was transferred from Africa to Chase Bank 924 Broadway Ave, Bowling Green, KY 42101 branch on the instruction of FBI authority from Chase Bank affiliate bank in Africa [Zenith Bank Plc] last week to ensure that the release of it to you is not hampered by dubiousness given the happenings in Africa where the process of releasing funds to foreign fund beneficiaries were hampered by greed, deviousness, impersonation by miscreants cum scammers and lacuna created by officials of the agencies responsible for releasing the funds to their foreign beneficiaries in Africa&nbsp; which compels&nbsp; foreign&nbsp; fund beneficiaries to lose faith in the process and abandone their funds subsequently.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
As stated above, negotiation for the release of the $2million to you started between I, as the accredited attorney of FBI and Chase Bank management two [2] days after the arrival of the fund from Zenith bank Plc in Africa and I, agreed with Chase bank management that the fund should be released to you in three [3] phases as stated below to make it easier for you to finance the process.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
[a] The sum of $350 [ Three hundred and fifty USD] will process the release / transfer of $500,000.00 [ Five hundred thousand USD.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
[b] The sum of $500 [Five hundred USD] will process the release of $1,000,000.00 [One million USD]</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
[c] The sum of $1,500 [One thousand five hundred USD] will finance the release of the total principal amount $2million which includes all payables.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Having outlined this to you as agreed between I, and Chase Bank management, you should as a matter of urgency and necessity make known to me officially the phase you would want the release of the principal amount to you to commence with. Note that, Chase Bank management and I, are expected to report back to Federal Bureau of Investigation authority on the release of this amount to you within a given time frame by FBI authority therefore, adopt a proactive measure to ensure that we work within the time frame.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI]authority is not directly involve in the arrangement / negotiation to release this huge amount to you therefore, discard any report and email from any individual or group who may claim to be ‘Agent / Agents’ of FBI monitoring the release of the $2million to avoid&nbsp; been conned&nbsp; by con-men. </div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
