This has been a good week.
Earlier today, Mike Pence endorsed our campaign. Pence is a strong, principled conservative. Praises Pence for cutting taxes.
Hits federal government for being a weight on the back of Indiana.
Cruz: Isn't Carly fantastic? It was a deliberative process. It's one of the most solemn decisions you have to make. I was looking for three criteria when making the decision to select a VP. Cites knowledge being one.
Cruz: Carly's success in business is extraordinary. Touts her path from secretary to CEO. Also notes judgment and character.
It's tough being a woman in the business world and Carly endured it every step of the way.
I can picture Hillary thinking about Carly, tossing and turning in her jail cell.
Talks about supporting the coal industry. Says we're the Saudi Arabia of coal.
Hits Trump for wanting to impose a tariff and wanting to threaten Carrier.
Cruz: We're going to create an environment where Carrier comes back to Indiana.
Cruz: Trump came out in support in for allowing grown men to use the little girls restroom. It doesn't make any sense to let grown adult men, strangers, to use the bathroom with little girls. Anyone who says differently-it's the height of political correctness.
Cruz: I'll be the same yesterday, today and tomorrow.
Talks about how  Trump and Hillary agree on issues like Planned Parenthood, Iran deal, raising taxes, Obamacare mandate and Israel/Palestinians
Cruz: The single biggest fraud of this campaign is Donald Trump - the ultimate Washington insider.
Cruz: If you want to know who will stand up to Washington, ask yourselves who Boehner calls Lucifer.

--
This election will come down to jobs, freedom and security.
Cruz: lift the boot of the necks of small business.
Cruz: If I am elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. We will pass health insurance that's personal, portable and affordable. We will pass a simple flat tax so that every American can fill out our taxes on a postcard. After we do that, we should abolish the IRS.
Cruz: we're going to rein in the EPA, federal agencies that have descended like locusts killing jobs all across the country.
We're going stop amnesty, secure the border. We're going to end sanctuary cities, welfare benefits for those here illegally. Goes on to say that will bring back manufacturing jobs from China and Mexico..
We're going to see manufacturing jobs coming back
Next important thing at stake is freedom. Says two branches hang in the balance in this election. Goes on to talk about different rights at stake if another liberal Supreme Court justice is appointed. Guns rights, religious liberty, sovereignty and school choice
Hits Trump for suggesting he would compromise religious liberty and second amendment rights to keep and bear arms. Adds that he's been supporting left wing Democratic politicians for 40 years.
Cruz: I give you my solemn commitment that every justice I appoint will be a principled constitutionalist that will protect the Bill of Rights. I will not compromise your religious liberty or right to keep and bear arms.
Cruz hits Trump for saying he would be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians. Adds that he will stand unapologetically with Israel.
Talks about how readiness and morale in the military has plummeted. Goes on to talk about how he will rebuild the military by repealing Obamacare, adopting a flat tax and stopping amnesty.
Cruz: no longer will our military be governed by political correctness. Criticizes President Obama for not saying radical Islamic terrorism.
Cruz: We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. To the jihadist, your day of reckoning is coming. Speaks out against the rules of engagement that he says is tying the hands of our military men and women.
Cruz: If military force is needed we should use overwhelming force, kill the enemy and get the heck out.
We started with 17 candidates, young dynamic candidates. Democratic field consist of a wild-eyed socialist with views that are dangerous for America and the world and Bernie Sanders.
Cruz: We're seeing Republicans coming together and uniting behind this campaign. 60-75% of Republicans recognize that nominating Donald Trump would be a train wreck.
Touts the fact that 5 of 17 presidential candidates have endorsed his campaign.
Closes by asking for support

Flagging new Cruz remarks on Mike Tyson endorsement

Hits Trump for touting Mike Tyson's support. A convicted rapist, Cruz points out.
Cruz: I have news for Donald Trump. Rapists are not tough guys.
Cruz: Donald Trump is proud to stand with rapist, Mike Tyson.

When you cut taxes, you see opportunity expand. Hits federal government for being a 800 pound gorilla on Indiana.
My number one priority is jobs and economic growth, expanding opportunity for young people.
Cruz: if I'm elected president, we'll repeal Obamacare, pass a simple flat tax, end the IRS, rein in EPA regulators and end sanctuary cities.
Cruz: Pence's endorsement latest indication that Republicans are uniting behind our campaign
On Donald Trump protest in CA:
The first amendment protects everyone's right to speak. These protestors don't have the right to silence anyone. Suggests they're from moveon.org. Not acceptable to threaten violence like the protestors are doing.
Cruz on Pence: I am thrilled to have his support. He's a strong conservative. Dismisses media for saying his endorsement wasn't strong enough.
Cruz: John Boehner went out of his way to call me the devil, but praised Hillary Clinton and Trump.
Hillary and Trump are flip sides of the same coin. Notes that John Boehner is a part of the problem
When Trump was funding the gang of eight, I was fighting against it. Hits Trump for bringing in foreign workers to work for his hotel.
On Indiana -
Indiana is incredibly important. Eyes of entire country is on Indiana. Indiana will make a choice-what direction is the country and party is going to go. If we nominate Donald, he and Hillary are flip sides of the same coin. We will have failed the country and party if two rich, big government liberals are on the ballot. Hits Trump and Hillary for having the same position on many issues.
Cruz: naming Carly as VP presents a clear contrast.
We're campaigning through the end as long as we have a path to victory.  Notes that if you can't earn a majority, you aren't going to win a general. Says Trump can't earn a majority.
Cruz: a vote for John Kasich is a vote for Donald Trump. He's gone 1 for 41.
Hits Trump for touting Mike Tyson's support. A convicted rapist, Cruz points out.
Cruz: I have news for Donald Trump. Rapists are not tough guys.
