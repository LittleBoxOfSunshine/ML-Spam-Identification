I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but unfortunately US campaign finance
regulations and WH protocol dictate that only US citizens or green card
holders can participate in any political event - either in attendance or by
contribution.

What this means is we'll need to refund your contribution and you won't be
able to attend. I am terribly sorry for not having flagged this earlier.
Thank you for your willingness to participate - both in our event and here
generally - and again my profuse apologies. If you have any questions,
please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best,
Zach
