Ernest --

The Republican Party has a new leader: Donald Trump. I can't think
of a time in my life when I've been prouder to be a Democrat -- or
more committed to building a strong party.

Consider Trump's stated goals for his first 100 days in office: He
plans to undo some of President Obama's most important
accomplishments, like the Affordable Care Act and executive orders
on immigration, and he promises to appoint a Scalia-like justice to
the Supreme Court to rip away our dearest progress, like marriage
equality and a woman's right to choose.

Ernest, we absolutely cannot let those things happen. We need to protect
and build on President Obama's legacy -- for our shared values, and
for the future of the country we love. Your $10 contribution to the
Democratic National Committee today will do just that -- can you
help?

https://my.democrats.org/Stop-Donald-Trump

As Democrats, we have a very different vision for our country, from
protecting LGBT people and public education at the state level to
raising the minimum wage and confronting climate change as a
nation. We know that there are no magic solutions -- we get things
done by rolling up our sleeves and putting in hard work.

That starts with working to elect Democrats all across this country,
to protect President Obama's legacy, and to make sure Donald
Trump never, ever becomes president.

We can't win this fight without you, Ernest. Chip in now -- the world is
counting on us:=20
