SL: The =93King of Debt=94 and the GOP on the Economy

In less than a week since becoming the GOP=92s presumptive nominee, Donald =
Trump has already exposed himself as reckless and dangerous on the American=
 economy. His comments over the last few days promise to undermine  the rol=
e of the United States as a major economic power and potentially threaten t=
he global financial system.

On Taxes, Trump Can=92t Hide from GOP=92s Obsession with Trickle Down Econo=
mics =96 Yesterday, Trump tried to dismiss concerns about his reckless tax =
plan, claiming that =93the rich=94 are =93probably going to end up paying m=
ore.=94 This is the latest effort to mask the Republican Party=92s reckless=
 economic policies, that preceded the great recession, when we were losing =
800,000 jobs per month.
The fact is Trump=92s plan includes specific calls<http://www.reuters.com/a=
rticle/us-usa-election-trump-idUSKCN0XZ0I3> for reducing the top income tax=
 rate to 25 percent from 39.6 percent. Such a move would give<http://www.nb=
cnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-why-trump-s-flip-flop-taxes-matter=
s-n570431> the =93top 0.1% of income earners like himself an average tax cu=
t of more than $1.3 million (versus $2,700 for those in the middle class)=
=94. Trump also plans to substantially<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positio=
ns/tax-reform> reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, even beyond the=
 reckless plan put forth by Republican Speaker Paul Ryan.

Trump=92s plans are nearly identical to the proposal put forth by Paul Ryan=
 and Republicans in Congress who want to cut<http://www.taxjusticeblog.org/=
archive/2015/10/paul_ryan_wants_to_cut_taxes_f.php#.VzCi6oQrK70> the top ta=
x rate to 25 percent. Ryan would also cut corporate taxes down to 25 percen=
t. There=92s a name for this, Trickle Down Economics, and it doesn=92t work=
. Just ask the last two Republican Adminsitrations, which both left our cou=
ntry mired in recession and facing massive deficits.

On America=92s Debt: A Page Out of the GOP Playbook =96 This morning, Trump=
 doubled down on his statements that the United States should consider<http=
://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-no-debt-default-222957#ixzz48AeHAol=
A> playing fast and loose with our nation=92s finances. He noted this morni=
ng that he=92s =93the king of debt.=94 Trump also said, =93This is the Unit=
ed States government. First of all, you never have to default because you p=
rint the money.=94 Such reckless positions, if implemented, could threaten =
America=92s standing in the world and lead to chaos in the financial market=
s.

This is the same sort of behavior that Republicans in Congress undertook wh=
en they played politics last year with the debt ceiling (this was not the f=
irst time), leading one credit rating agency to remark<http://www.latimes.c=
om/business/la-fi-government-shutdown-credit-rating-fitch-20150923-story.ht=
ml> that any protracted fight over the issue could endanger America=92s cre=
dit rating.

=93Donald Trump=92s reckless tax policies and suggestion that we should pla=
y chicken with the country=92s finances are lifted directly from the Congre=
ssional Republican playbook. Trump can try to run from his positions but hi=
s record and those of Republican leaders is clear. America cannot afford a =
disastrous Trump presidency. Now more than ever we need to elect a Democrat=
 as our 45th president.=94
