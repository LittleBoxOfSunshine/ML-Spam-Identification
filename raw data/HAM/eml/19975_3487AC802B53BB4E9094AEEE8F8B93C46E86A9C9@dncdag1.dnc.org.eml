Adding Kate, Amy and Liana

1. Kate / Amy / Liana --> do you have contact info for the best POC for GK?
2. Yes - she will be coming from the JAHM reception where she has to put in decent amount of time

Yo, two questions:

1. Do you have a contact in GK's office we can coordinate the 5/12 PAC reception with?

2. Is 5pm the earliest DWS can get to our site visit in Philly on 5/5?

Thanks
