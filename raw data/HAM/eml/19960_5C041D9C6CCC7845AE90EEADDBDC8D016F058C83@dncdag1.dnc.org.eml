Can you loop me with someone from the SO, or do I need to wait until you get the RSVP report?

Not sure -- I assume they have gone out, but we haven't received RSVP reports yet so I can't check on individuals yet.

Morning! Do you know if the invites for this have gone it yet? A couple of the folks we submitted reached out saying that haven't received any word yet.
