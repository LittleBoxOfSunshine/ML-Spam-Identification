Luis --

We're headed into the part of this election that Barack likes to call
"silly season" -- when the back and forth can get heated and folks
can really start to lose perspective.

But through all the distractions, I hope you never forget that we're
fighting for the American dream. We're fighting to make sure that
every single person in this country has the opportunity to succeed.
And nothing can take away from just how meaningful that work is.

The next major fundraising deadline of this election is coming up
soon. I hope I can count on you to pitch in $3 or whatever you
can before then to help finish what we started together:
