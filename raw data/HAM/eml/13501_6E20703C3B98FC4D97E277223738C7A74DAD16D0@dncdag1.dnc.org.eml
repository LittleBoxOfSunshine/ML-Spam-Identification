TRUMP SAID "NO," THERE SHOULD NOT BE A FEDERAL FLOOR FOR WAGES


HEADLINE: "Trump Calls For End To Federal Minimum Wage As Views Shift." [The Guardian, 5/8/16<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/federal-minimum-wage-trump>]

Trump On Whether The Federal Government Should Set A Floor For Wages: "No." TRUMP: "I will -- I have seen what`s going on and I don`t know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude, but I`d rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide, because don`t forget, the states have to compete with each other."  TODD: "Right. You want the fed--" TRUMP: "So you may have--" TODD: "-- but should the federal government set a floor and then you let the state--" TRUMP: "No, I would--  No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck." TODD: "All right." TRUMP: "So I like the idea of let the states decide." [Meet The Press, NBC, 5/8/16]

TRUMP OPPOSED RAISING THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE


Trump Rejected The Idea Of A National Minimum Wage And Would "Rather Have The States Go Out And Do What They Have To Do" To Compete With One Another. Donald Trump has called for the elimination of the federal minimum wage, as he retreated from primary promises and once again refused to release his tax returns because of 'a link' to an audit. The presumptive Republican nominee for president repeatedly said he would support a higher minimum wage, a reversal from his position when he had conservative opponents. But he insisted on Sunday that states should decide such wages. 'I like the idea of 'let the states decide',' Trump told NBC's Meet the Press. 'But I think people should get more. I think they're out there. They're working. It is a very low number.' Asked 'should the federal government set a floor' - a national minimum wage - Trump replied: 'No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do.' 'And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other.' In a November debate, the businessman, who claims his net worth is worth more than $10bn, said: 'Taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world.'" [The Guardian, 5/8/16<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/federal-minimum-wage-trump>]

TRUMP THOUGHT SOME STATES MIGHT NOT EVEN NEED TO BOTHER RAISING THEIR MINIMUM WAGE


Trump Said That Some States Would Not Even Need To Bother Lifting Their Minimum Wage Because The Cost Of Living Was Lower And "Those People Live Very Well." TRUMP: "So I really like giving it to states to determine. Plus, they have to compete with each other among, you know, other things, but they have to compete with each other. So I like the concept of giving it to states. And in some states, where it's more expensive, maybe they do have to lift the minimum wage, and in others, they don't have to do it. And those people live very well. So that's the way it is. Now, they also have to compete with each other in business. So I really like the idea because it's so different -- you know, it's a big country -- it's so different and the cost of living is so different, I like letting the states set the minimum wage." [Hannity, Fox News, 5/12/16]

TRUMP: "HAVING A LOW MINIMUM WAGE IS NOT A BAD THING FOR THIS COUNTRY"

Trump: "I Think Having A Low Minimum Wage Is Not A Bad Thing For This Country." TRUMP: "Now -- I want to create jobs so that you don't have to worry about the minimum wage.  They're do a great job that they're making much more than the minimum wage.  But I think having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country, Mika." [Morning Joe, MSNBC, 8/20/15]

TRUMP REPEATEDLY CLAIMED AMERICAN WAGES WERE ALREADY "TOO HIGH"

Donald Trump Opposed Raising The Minimum Wage Because: "Wages Too High, We're Not Going To Be Able To Compete Against The World." TRUMP: "But, taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we cannot do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can't do it." CAVUTO: "So do not raise the minimum wage?" TRUMP: "I would not do it." [Republican Primary Debate, Milwaukee WI, 11/10/15]

Trump: "We Have To Become Competitive With The World.  Our Taxes Are Too High, Our Wages Are Too High.  Everything Is Too High." TRUMP: "But you know what? We have to become competitive with the world.  Our taxes are too high, our wages are too high.  Everything is too high." [Morning Joe, MSNBC, 11/11/15]

Donald Trump Said Companies Were Leaving The United States Because "Salaries Are Too High." TRUMP: "You have to keep our country competitive. One of the reasons companies are leaving is because salaries are too high. You look at what's going on in Vietnam and in China and so many different places, so we have to be very, very careful with that." [Varney & Co., Fox Business, 10/20/15]


TRUMP: LOW WAGES ARE AN "ADVANTAGE" OF RIGHT-TO-WORK STATES

Trump On South Carolina As A Right-To-Work State: "One Of The Advantages You Have Is You Have The Lower Wage." WILSON: "One of the things I am very proud of in South Carolina is we are the second least-unionized state in the country. We're a proud people, we love our right-to-work status, and several years ago unelected bureaucrats at the NLRB tried to prevent a small start-up company - you might have heard of it - called Boeing from expanding its operation to South Carolina. That did not succeed, it was able to go forward. The administration was quiet, they stood by silently while that happened. Would you have criticized that as president? What are your general views on the NLRB and the unions?" TRUMP: "Well I watched Boeing, I thought that was a disgrace, what was going on. They almost kept them out. I mean, you made a deal, and Boeing was coming in, and how they got involved in that, I thought that was disgraceful. I mean, one of the advantages you have is you have the lower wage, which means you might make more money if you're a worker because you don't have to pay all the dues and all the other things that come with union representation." [Conservative Leadership Project Presidential Forum, Aiken SC, 12/12/15]

Trump: "Got To Have Right-To-Work." SCOTT: "Talk to us about the right to work and the laws that we have." TRUMP: "Got to have right to work, got to have right to work." [Tim Scott Town Hall, Columbia SC, 9/23/15]

 &#8220;You have to keep our country competitive. One of the reasons companies are leaving is because salaries are too high. You look at what's going on in Vietnam and in China and so many different places, so we have to be very, very careful with that.&#8221; [Varney

 WILSON: &#8220;One of the things I am very proud of in South Carolina is we are the second least-unionized state in the country. We&#8217;re a proud people, we love our right-to-work status, and several years ago unelected bureaucrats at the NLRB tried to prevent a small
 start-up company &#8211; you might have heard of it &#8211; called Boeing from expanding its operation to South Carolina. That did not succeed, it was able to go forward. The administration was quiet, they stood by silently while that happened. Would you have criticized
 that as president? What are your general views on the NLRB and the unions?&#8221; TRUMP: &#8220;Well I watched Boeing, I thought that was a disgrace, what was going on. They almost kept them out. I mean, you made a deal, and Boeing was coming in, and how they got involved
 in that, I thought that was disgraceful. I mean, one of the advantages you have is you have the lower wage, which means you might make more money if you're a worker because you don't have to pay all the dues and all the other things that come with union representation.&#8221;
