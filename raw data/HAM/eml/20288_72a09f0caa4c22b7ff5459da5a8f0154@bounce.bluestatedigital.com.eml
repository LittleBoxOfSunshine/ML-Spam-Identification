Friend --

As of this week, Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican
nominee. The contrast between his values and the values our
Democratic candidates defend every day could not be more stark.
As Democrats, we have a lot on the line. It is crucial
that we push back on the backwards GOP rhetoric and make our
voices heard this election cycle.

Please join me for a reception in Knoxville, Tennessee on
Friday, June 3rd. This is your chance to ask me questions
about what the DNC is doing to fight back and to strategize
together with us about how to win in November.

You can RSVP through the following link:

https://finance.democrats.org/KnoxvilleReception

Thank you for all you do, and I look forward to seeing you
in Knoxville!

Debbie
