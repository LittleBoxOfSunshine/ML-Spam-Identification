*Republicans Are (Still) Rejecting Trump's Candidacy*

It's Thursday, so Republicans are continuing to reject Donald Trump's
unpredictable, risky and divisive candidacy. Trump has for years proven

 at
risk, and Republicans are continuing to acknowledge that a President Trump
would be too big a risk.
