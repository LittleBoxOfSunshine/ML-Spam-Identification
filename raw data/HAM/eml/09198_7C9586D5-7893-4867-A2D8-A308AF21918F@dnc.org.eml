DNC to offer Sanders a convention concession - The Washington Post<https://=
www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dnc-to-offer-sanders-a-convention-concessio=
n/2016/05/19/99706b54-1df4-11e6-8c7b-6931e66333e7_story.html>


n an attempt to head off an ugly conflict at its convention this summer, th=
e Democratic National Committee plans to offer a concession to Sen. Bernie =
Sanders =97 seats on a key convention platform committee =97 but it may not=
 be enough to stop Sanders from picking a fight over the party=92s policy p=
ositions.

Allies of both Clinton and Sanders have urged Democratic leaders to meet so=
me of Sanders=92s more mundane demands for greater inclusion at the Philade=
lphia convention. Their decision to do so is expected to be finalized by th=
e end of the week, according to two people familiar with the discussions. B=
ut growing mistrust between Sanders supporters and party leaders have threa=
tened to undermine that effort.

Even with the committee assignments, Sanders plans an aggressive effort to =
extract platform concessions on key policies that could prompt divisive bat=
tles at a moment when front-runner Hillary Clinton will be trying to unify =
the party. Among other issues, he plans to push for a $15 national minimum =
wage and argue that the party needs a more balanced position regarding Isra=
el and Palestinians, according to a Sanders campaign aide who requested ano=
nymity to speak candidly.
