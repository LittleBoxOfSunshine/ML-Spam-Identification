GUN SHOW: DONALD TRUMP's past support of gun control didn't stop him from securing the National Rifle Association's endorsement today - and using a speech in front of its members to attack HILLARY CLINTON.

Trump used his speech at the NRA's Leadership Forum in Louisville, Ky., to portray himself as a protector of the 2nd Amendment, POLITICO's Eli Stokols reports. And to cast Clinton as someone who would irrevocably harm gun rights. 

"The Second Amendment is on the ballot in November," Trump told the more than 7,000 NRA members gathered here for an annual meeting. "I will never let you down. I will protect our Second Amendment. I will protect our country."

Trump also railed against gun-free zones in remarks the GOP's presumptive nominee billed as off the cuff. 

"Gun-free zones. We're getting rid of gun-free zones, OK?" Trump said. "That I can tell you. We're getting rid of them."

It's Friday, Friday, gotta test out multiple attack lines on Friday. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=178524ce910299e6d245a58ce62fea2c0be175e7ba133f68d261ed5742ea54f6 Here's your 2016 Blast. Where we're always about fun, fun, fun. Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through the day's campaign news, so send your tips, complaints and weekend plans to: hjackson@politico.com. 

2) SCATTER SHOTS: Terrorism, marital infidelity, gun rights. DONALD TRUMP's topics were disparate, but the array of attacks he uncorked over the last 24 hours had only one target in mind: HILLARY CLINTON the not-quite-official Democratic nominee. In a statement and a series of media appearances Trump previewed a caustic general election. He mocked Clinton's response to the EgyptAir crash as naive. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7faadf3fe9c5937336b41e3fc3c81271d3ac2c10d5ed03d0b1c3a9cf3746af1d With all the subtlety of a bulldozer, he reminded the public of Bill Clinton's marital infidelity. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79b7c55cb745b7ec820fb54f1f31d6996e982203aec321efce3cfe1e7ff1c820 And before and during a speech in front of the NRA today Trump ripped Clinton's stance on guns, tweeting
 that she would like to overrule the Supreme Court on the Second Amendment. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79b7c55cb745b7ecb37bc78311f5ebcbadd80521de18e7c79d35d1eab514f153 

3) (NOT SO) FREE SPEECH: So, what is it like to give a six-figure speech? And what do you get for your money? POLITICO's Annie Karni does a bit of digging and gives you an idea: If you're paying $285,000 for Bill Clinton you get "a dose of the full Bubba, unplugged." And, apparently, a full accompaniment of presidential factoids: At one point, Clinton noted to a private audience that he'd learned that the combined weight of all the ants on Earth was greater than that of all the humans on the planet. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79b7c55cb745b7ecff10b6f5834c099d57b98ebb8f9278557f5870e8188d98c4 

4) HOSTILE TAKEOVER: From Never Trump to whatever, Trump. POLITICO's Alex Isenstadt looks at the swift resignation of big pieces of the Republican party to DONALD TRUMP's ascent. The thawing, Isenstadt writes, has already begun in ways big and small. That includes potential mega donors like Foster Friess to rank-and-file operatives. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79b7c55cb745b7ecab32a4e157bb0fac14932b6a0843b8758e7be6bfe290afa0 But elites more or less falling in line doesn't arrest some new electoral math, as POLITICO's Katie Glueck notes. GOP nominee DONALD TRUMP means some states that have been largely off the map for Democrats in recent cycles - think Georgia and Arizona - are at least nominally in play now. Recent polls show that
 Trump's candidacy opens the door for HILLARY CLINTON in both of those states. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79b7c55cb745b7ecc80e02a4fc90ce6d39971b7884b489600cb78be1a270669b 

5) ROMNEY 3.0: Not everyone is assimilating to DONALD TRUMP's Republican Party. Erick Erickson is a conservative writer and media personality who has been leading efforts to find a suitable, conservative third-party candidate. On Friday, he wrote on The Resurgent he had one in particular in mind: MITT ROMNEY. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79b7c55cb745b7eccf6f5b4abb385033a3d4f51f630b9e72150e71a441b15e57 The 2012 nominee has been as steadfastly anti-Trump as anyone and, Erickson writes, is a much better alternative than HILLARY CLINTON. POLITICO's Brianna Gurciullo has more here: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79b7c55cb745b7ec85db4af50295154f4e4bd49bf924a09a159a6ac3ddc3bab3 
BLAST NOTE: One reason this sticks out: Erickson has opposed Romney in his previous two bids for the presidency. 

TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, DONALD TRUMP schedules a meeting. Is London calling? The GOP's embrace in a chart. HILLARY CLINTON gets a come-and-get-me plea, but her graphics are panned. Philadelphia embraces the Bern. 

LISTEN UP: POLITICO's newest Nerdcast has dropped. Listen for insights on whether BERNIE SANDERS' most ardent supporters will come home to HILLARY CLINTON and Facebook's optics problem. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79b7c55cb745b7ec7f571336ed60be87f5fdd53a43424e9867b0c180c5fb77a8

IRON MAN: Former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau braves the Internet, uses choice words to describe DONALD TRUMP. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0baca106f482a5a5e7e3c88327e908698f8697b48386820f5a68be8346767e7f Noted: He and former Obama aide Dan Pfeiffer also have a podcast on the presidential race: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0baca106f482a5a501a32664af8ac39565931694ee59f7f2861c20b6289dfb27 

COME AND GET ME: Mark Cuban, again, offers himself up as a VP candidate for HILLARY CLINTON. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0baca106f482a5a5d25032446415b68a4c8cda246859a6125e602aece06a7fbc 

TRY HARDER: Vox thinks HILLARY CLINTON's graphics are ineffective. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0baca106f482a5a503f64b186d64ab62ae5f424a31a4c0105580fe5ee88e4843 So does Business Insider http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7faadf3fe9c59373227026fa1a06e47e26fd8560e301c2b7adb6181dd1e68451 

LET IT BERN: Philadelphia has approved four large pro-BERNIE SANDERS rallies during the DNC. What could go wrong? (NBC Philadelphia) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0fcd7ecbced9fb5d469586b3a0fa48cfca6644cd6eda6596094b6c65d16620ea 

WHAT'S NEXT: Candidates are locked in on the best coast. BERNIE SANDERS and Bill Clinton are both expected in San Diego this weekend and make other stops in California. Sanders is also in New Mexico tonight. HILLARY CLINTON speaks in Detroit on Monday. 

THEY SAID IT: "Congratulations on becoming a U.S. citizen, Alicia. Enjoy casting that vote."

- HILLARY CLINTON, tweeting to Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe who recently revealed that DONALD TRUMP called her "Miss Piggy." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=0fcd7ecbced9fb5d2e7da61e7882531b1ac7a2e8fb53544bcb31187dbadc3d77 

MAGIC NUMBER: 3 million. That's how much, in dollars, Bill Clinton's been paid for speeches since his wife announced her second presidential bid. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79b7c55cb745b7ecff10b6f5834c099d57b98ebb8f9278557f5870e8188d98c4
