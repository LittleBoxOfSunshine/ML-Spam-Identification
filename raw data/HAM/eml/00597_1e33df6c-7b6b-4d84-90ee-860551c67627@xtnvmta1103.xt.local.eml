With help from Cogan Schneier and Brianna Gurciullo 

FARA UPDATE:

- Former Sen. Al D'Amato's (R-N.Y.) Park Strategies inked a $15,000-a-month consulting deal with Polish defense conglomerate Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa. D'Amato's firm will promote Polish military initiatives, including an increased financial commitment to NATO, reach out to journalists, Congress, think tanks and U.S. arms companies, and assist with July's NATO summit in Warsaw.

- Amsterdam & Partners added Jim Arnold of Austin, Texas, to the Turkey account, for public relations strategic guidance and direct media outreach related to the case against Pennsylvania-based religious leader Fethullah Gulen. Arnold, who worked for the NRCC, NRSC and Rick Perry in the 1990s, will make $20,000 a month.

- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban paid Connie Mack's Liberty International Group $239,488.93 between October and February.

- APCO Worldwide is providing media relations and strategic communications to Ukraine for $20,000 this month.

- The Korean Embassy extended Rokk Solutions through September at $20,000 a month. The Ron Bonjean-Rodell Mollineau-Brian J. Walsh collaboration will provide political and media analysis for the 2016 elections; arrange events for members, journalists and other opinion leaders; and help with press releases, op-eds and speeches. 

- Holland & Knight has been conferring with congressional staff on behalf of Gibraltar about tax haven legislation.

SPACE ODDITY: As the House Armed Services Committee marks up the National Defense Authorization Act, more than 100 representatives from the 50 supplier companies in the United Launch Alliance (whose members include Lockheed Martin and Boeing) will hold meetings on Capitol Hill to discuss American access to space and the industry's economic impact. The International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers is supporting them in the effort to allow buying Russian-made RD-180 rockets. But Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform wrote Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) opposing the proposal as a gift to Vladimir Putin. Elon Musk's SpaceX is also lobbying against the proposal to lift the
 ban.

ICYMI: American Continental Group's David Urban, the former chief of staff to the late Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), is advising and volunteering for the Donald Trump campaign and was in Pennsylvania today. "Trump is going to be the nominee," Urban told PI. "You don't have to have unanimity to have unity." Urban's clients at ACG include blue chips like Comcast, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Raytheon.

HAPPY WEDNESDAY! Please send tips to iarnsdorf@politico.com.

ONLY IN D.C. ... or, to be precise, in a suburban congressional race (MD-08), would you see a lobbyist and his family in a candidate's mailer. Shout out to David Thomas of Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas for appearing in that Kathleen Matthews postcard. Thomas contributed $2,119.79 to the campaign. Matthews lost the primary Tuesday to state Sen. Jamie Raskin.

LIFTOFF: PR, marketing and advocacy firm The Moak Group hired Michael Wascom, previously managing director of government and international affairs at American Airlines, as SVP, and Ellen Huber, previously digital editor at the US-China Business Council, as a marketing & communications associate. The company, which Lee Moak and Michael Robbins co-founded in early 2015, also recently hired Boyd Bailey from Qatar Airways and Susan Fielders from the Air Line Pilots Association International. 

- The Bockorny Group promoted Marty DePoy, who has been with the firm since 2005, to senior vice president.

FINK TO CLF: Mason Fink, former senior adviser to Mitt Romney, will join the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aiming to protect and expand the House's Republican majority, POLITICO's Alex Isenstadt reports. House Speaker Paul Ryan personally reached out to Fink about serving on the group's board - the two became friends when Ryan ran as Romney's vice presidential nominee in 2012. Fink worked as Romney's finance director in both 2008 and 2012, and oversaw fundraising for the Right to Rise super PAC that backed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's failed presidential bid. Ryan has recruited other Romney alumni for House Republican fundraising, including former aide Spencer
 Zwick. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fa24ddd4c266356caa7390c1b5853b484a325f44a419a4f6df3d0a0e4faca86a

ON THE HILL: The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition brought 57 leaders from 35 organizations to meet with House and Senate appropriators on the International Affairs Budget. Participants include leaders from AIPAC, BD, Catholic Relief Services, Chemonics International, Friends of the Global Fight, Mercy Corps, and three retired Navy and Air Force flag officers.

CHEMISTRY: Sen. Shelly Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Reps. Brian Babin (R-Texas) and Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) attended a luncheon today to introduce the Chemical Industry Labor-Management Committee, a partnership between the chemical industry and organized construction labor, including the American Chemistry Council and North America's Building Trades Unions. Other founding members are Albemarle Corporation, Calgon Carbon Corporation, Solvay Americas, the Laborers' International Union of North America, the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers, and the United Association - Union of Plumbers, Fitters, Welders, & Service Techs.

- Also today, Reps. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.) and Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.) formed the Congressional Chemistry Caucus, cheered on by Thomas Connelly Jr. of the American Chemical Society, Cal M. Dooley of the American Chemistry Council and Eric Byer of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.

TARIFF TURMOIL: The Hill's Vicki Needham reports the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce both issued key vote alerts for a Miscellaneous Tariff Bill the House considers today, signaling to lawmakers the groups will be paying attention to how they vote on the bill. The measure would streamline the tariff relief application process, and business groups including NAM and the Chamber have been increasing their lobbying efforts on the issue. Conservative groups like The Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America have criticized the bill, saying Congress should do away with the specific tariff relief waivers and focus on eliminating all tariffs. Still, the
 measure has garnered support from government accountability groups, including the National Taxpayers Union, Taxpayers for Common Sense and the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fa24ddd4c266356ccf51da9a8238baaab8fee59d20fafd24535bed46e5256dd0

PARTLY CLOUDY: Pro Energy's Esther Whieldon and Andrew Restuccia report there's a possible rift in the solar industry's main lobbying group, the Solar Energy Industries Association. Following a victory last December when Congress extended a tax credit providing breaks for the solar industry, rooftop solar companies like SolarCity support pressing for policies favorable to the distributed generation model, while others, like First Solar, want to focus on supporting large, utility-supplying power plants. Since SEIA President Rhone Resch is stepping down, his successor will have to soothe the tensions. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fa24ddd4c266356c84e6c4e1daa9dce2f05dc829dbdae148d5e2c0d88693279c

Conservative groups like <b>The Club for Growth </b>and <b>Heritage Action for America
</b> have criticized the bill, saying Congress should do away with the specific tariff relief waivers and focus on eliminating all tariffs. Still, the measure has garnered support from government accountability groups, including the <b>National Taxpayers Union, Taxpayers for Common Sense </b>and the<b> Council for Citizens Against Government Waste. </b><a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=fa24ddd4c266356ccf51da9a8238baaab8fee59d20fafd24535bed46e5256dd0" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/24jLxiG</a></p><p><b>PARTLY CLOUDY:</b> Pro Energy's <b>Esther</b> <b>Whieldon</b> and <b>Andrew</b> <b>Restuccia</b> report there's a possible rift in the solar industry's main lobbying group, the <b>Solar Energy Industries Association
</b>. Following a victory last December when Congress extended a tax credit providing breaks for the solar industry, rooftop solar companies like <b>SolarCity</b> support pressing for policies favorable to the distributed generation model, while others, like <b>First Solar</b>, want to focus on supporting large, utility-supplying power plants. Since SEIA President<b> Rhone Resch</b> is stepping down, his successor will have to soothe the tensions.
