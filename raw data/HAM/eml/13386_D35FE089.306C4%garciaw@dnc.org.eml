When hotel security kicked the raucous Nevada Democratic Party convention o=
ut of the facility on Saturday night, Hillary Clinton and Democratic leader=
s across the country were put on notice: Expect serious turbulence before a=
rriving in Philadelphia this summer.

For several chaotic hours, legions of Bernie Sanders=92 backers lashed out =
in anger and frustration over Clinton=92s delegate win there. The Paris Las=
 Vegas hotel finally managed to shut down the event, but another group of a=
ngry Sanders fans descended on the state Democratic headquarters the next m=
orning.

To the state party officials across the nation who saw videos from the conv=
ention on the Internet and on cable news Monday morning, the Nevada debacle=
 served as a jarring reminder that the party is still a long way from unite=
d after its long slog of a primary.

=93I think maybe Nevada is a little bit of a wake-up call=94 to party leade=
rs, warned West Virginia Democratic Vice Chairman Christopher Regan. "If ev=
ery state chair is not talking about how we can make sure that doesn't happ=
en in our state, [for] those that have yet to go, you're just not doing you=
r job."

In interviews with state Democratic chairs and other party leaders in rough=
ly a dozen states =97 some of whom back Sanders, and some who support Clint=
on =97 the consensus is that the Nevada meltdown was an anomaly. But many w=
orry that it might also be a harbinger of trouble at upcoming state convent=
ions, and perhaps even the July national convention in Philadelphia.

=93It is really important for [Sanders], if it=92s clear to him by the time=
 the convention starts =97 and that=92s likely to happen =97 [that Clinton =
has won], that he send messages to his supporters through his lieutenants, =
through the heads of his delegations, that if Secretary Clinton has the nec=
essary delegates, then we=92ll have a roll call,=94 said former Pennsylvani=
a governor and DNC chairman Ed Rendell, the convention chairman and a veter=
an Clinton ally, conceding that a fight over the party=92s platform would s=
till be likely.

Democrats had hoped to portray the party as a picture of unity =96 to contr=
ast to what=92s expected to be a messy, contentious Republican affair a wee=
k earlier in Cleveland =96 but those hopes are fading as some level of unre=
st is now expected in various state Democratic conventions in upcoming week=
s.

Those concerns began surfacing in formal and informal communications on Sun=
day and Monday, said state Democratic officials =97 and it is certain to be=
 a glaring topic of conversation later this week in Philadelphia when state=
 party leaders gather for their quarterly meeting.

=93You=92ll see similar things happen in other state conventions elsewhere =
in the next few weeks. I don=92t know if it will be to the same extent as N=
evada,=94 predicted Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer=
-Labor Party, noting that he had already discussed the Nevada proceedings d=
uring a meeting with his own party on Monday morning, weeks before their ow=
n convention. =93I can=92t imagine that tensions will be this high come lat=
e July [at the national convention]. But obviously if they are, that would =
be a problem."

Others express a higher degree of alarm, and hope to head off any further c=
lashes by encouraging the Vermont senator to call for a cool-down.

=93I hope Senator Sanders would understand that he is not only damaging his=
 own reputation and standing, but also doing harm to the Democratic Party, =
unless he encourages his supporters to be more genteel in their protest,=94=
 said Don Fowler, the Democratic National Committee chairman from 1995 to 1=
997.

In Nevada, Saturday=92s convention fell into disarray even after Sanders an=
d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid =97 the state=92s leading Democrat =97 =
issued statements Friday urging a calm, respectful event following fraught =
county conventions last month.

The Vermont senator=92s backers at one point shouted down California Sen. B=
arbara Boxer, speaking on behalf of Clinton, while protesting party chairwo=
man Roberta Lange=92s stewardship of the event and accusing the local leade=
rship of stacking the rules and credentials against them when some delegate=
s =97 including those who were not registered Democrats =97 weren't accepte=
d.

Three hours after the event was scheduled to end, hotel security stepped in=
 to close out the proceedings but the turmoil didn=92t end there. Protestin=
g into the next day after Clinton came out on top, some angry participants =
posted Lange=92s phone number online, spurring thousands of death threats, =
according to the Nevada Democratic Party.

While many of the state Democratic conventions have gone off without a hitc=
h this year =97 both in states won by Clinton and by Sanders =97 the conten=
tiousness surrounding Nevada had some precedent.

In Colorado=92s April convention, Clinton-backing Sen. Michael Bennet was d=
rowned out by Sanders backers chanting =93change your vote,=94 referring to=
 his role as a super delegate. More recently in Maine, where Sanders won th=
e state=92s caucuses by a 2-1 margin but a majority of the state=92s 5 supe=
r delegates back Clinton, the Democratic convention approved a proposal for=
cing super delegates to proportionally align their support with the caucus =
results. Sanders supporters in the crowd booed and yelled =93sellout=94 and=
 =93go back to Massachusetts=94 at former Congressman Barney Frank, when he=
 called on them to unite behind Clinton.

State leaders said they can envision future gatherings getting even testier=
 as the race drags on and as Sanders keeps winning primaries, as he is expe=
cted to do on Tuesday.

"I am a little concerned about some of the procedural stuff, but I think we=
're prepared to have those conversations," said Wyoming Democratic Chairwom=
an Ana Cuprill, explaining that she had raised security concerns while plan=
ning the convention in her state, where Sanders won the popular vote but ti=
ed in the pledged delegate count.

To the Sanders team, such worries simply mean party officials should work o=
n finding a way to improve and clarify their procedures to be more inclusiv=
e toward supporters of a candidate who has won so many states and delegates=
.

=93We=92re still putting together the facts on what happened there at the t=
ime, but in general I can say that it would be in the Democratic Party=92s =
best interest for its leaders to figure out a way to welcome the millions o=
f people we have brought into Democratic Party politics this year, and make=
 them part of the process,=94 said Sanders=92 communications director Micha=
el Briggs. =93Smart, self-interested Democrats should figure out how to wel=
come those people rather than stiff-arm them."

"It=92s fair for [party leaders] to figure out what happened, and to try to=
 figure out a way to be more open and welcoming than the Nevada Democrats w=
ere for their own sake,=94 he added. =93Whoever is the nominee of this part=
y is going to need the support of as many people as possible, obviously, an=
d the way to do that is to take advantage of this boom in interest that has=
 happened because of Senator Sanders=92 message resonating all across the c=
ountry.=94

But most state leaders who spoke with POLITICO wouldn=92t commit to making =
changes, instead insisting, like Mississippi Democratic Chairman Rickey Col=
e, =93If you want to participate in the process, you have to know the rules=
."

Accordingly, those officials are now reviewing the plans for their own stat=
e conventions or gatherings =97 many spent Monday checking in with their st=
affs about their preparation. But they say they are more concerned about ho=
w Sanders=92 local fans read his campaign trail messaging, and fear that in=
sinuations that the nominating process is rigged =97 not to mention Sanders=
=92 consistent criticism of the party establishment =97 could lead to more =
unrest. They=92d prefer that the senator focus more of his campaign trail i=
re on Donald Trump.

South Carolina Democratic Chairman Jaime Harrison floated the idea of a pub=
lic event held in conjunction with Clinton, to send a message of party harm=
ony even if both candidates remain in the race for the foreseeable future.

In the meantime, in state after state, party leaders said they were aiming =
to ensure calm at their state conventions by explaining the rules and openi=
ng lines of communication between Clinton and Sanders supporters.

The alternative, said Texas Democratic Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, is a Tru=
mp presidency: =93If people walk away just because they don=92t get their w=
ay, it will result in the worst president in the history of the United Stat=
es."

Also, flagging that the top political reporter in Nevada, Jon Ralston, publ=
ished an article not so long ago in which he highlighted the fact that the =
NV Convention doesn=92t bode well for our Convention in July. Definitely so=
mething we should bear in mind going forward.

If what happens in Vegas happens in Philadelphia, the chances of a unified =
Democratic Party in the general election are virtually nonexistent and the =
odds of a President Trump suddenly don=92t look so long.

=85

Clinton has a difficult needle-threading job keeping the Sanders voters in =
the tent as she moves towards November. But if Sanders does not soon disavo=
w what his team here has overseen =96 and even the senator may not be able =
to douse the wildfire he lit =96 there is no reason to believe that what ha=
ppened at the Paris in May will not happen at the Wells Fargo Center in Jul=

NYT is out with a story. We expect to see a letter from the State Party sho=
rtly that is submitted to the Chairs of the Rules & Bylaws committee, but t=
hat doesn=92t ask anything of the DNC, just to register their concerns abou=
t the behavior coming from some of the supporters, including death threats.=
 Will circulate as soon as we have it.
