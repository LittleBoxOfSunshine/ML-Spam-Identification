THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release May 10, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20





1:16 P.M. EDT





 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Let me do a couple of announceme=
nts at the top before getting to your questions. The first is that, as yo=
u all know, today the President convened his National Security Council he=
re at the White House as part of an ongoing review of our efforts to degr=
ade and destroy ISIL. Todays meeting was the latest in a series of NSC me=
etings in recent months convened at the White House and at key department=
s and agencies, including most recently, the CIA, but also the Department=
 of State and the Department of Defense.



 The President was briefed on ongoing U.S. and coalition efforts to degra=
de ISILs core in Iraq and in Syria, while also checking ISILs ambitions f=
or expansion outside those countries. Noting recent efforts to reinforce =
the cessation of hostilities in Syria, the President and his team also di=
scussed options to further advance a political resolution to the Syrian c=
ivil conflict while continuing our efforts to pressure ISIL there. The Pr=
esident directed his National Security Council to continue to intensify o=
ur counter-ISIL operations across all military and civilian fronts, inclu=
ding disrupting foreign fighter networks, halting ISILs expansion outside=
 of Syria and Iraq, countering ISIL financing, disrupting any ISIL extern=
al plotting efforts and, of course, countering ISILs propaganda and messa=
ging.



 In addition to that, you may not know that Assistant to the President fo=
r Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco is in Brussels, Belg=
ium today, where she will meet with Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel=
 and other Belgian security and intelligence officials in our shared effo=
rts to disrupt terrorist plotting against the United States and Europe, a=
nd to degrade and destroy ISIL. Ms. Monaco will also meet with senior EU =
officials to discuss how we can support EU efforts to strengthen countert=
errorism coordination amongst its members.



 Ms. Monacos travel to Belgium is one of a series of high-level engagemen=
ts we're undertaking with our coalition partners to discuss ways we can e=
nhance our counterterrorism cooperation.



 The people of Brussels know all too well that ISIL continues to both plo=
t complex attacks against our interests and seeks to inspire lone wolves =
to attack us independently of ISIL command and control. That is why we ar=
e constantly looking at ways we can intensify our intelligence cooperatio=
n and further disrupt the flow of foreign fighters. We will work to share=
 with our partners lessons the United States learned following the Septem=
ber 11th terrorist attacks about breaking down information stovepipes and=
 protecting our homeland more effectively.



 The second thing I wanted to call to your attention -- that many of you =
have already reported on -- is that, in addition to continuing to meet wi=
th senators of both parties, Chief Judge Merrick Garland submitted his qu=
estionnaire to the Senate Judiciary Committee today. The questionnaire an=
d associated materials present an exhaustive picture of Judge Garlands di=
stinguished career and impeccable credentials as the nominee to the Supre=
me Court.=20



 He has more -- as youve heard me say on many occasions -- he has more fe=
deral judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee, and a len=
gthy record of consensus-building, judicial excellence, public service an=
d academic achievement. His record demonstrates that hes a careful, balan=
ced judge who follows the law. In fact, hes never written an opinion that=
s been reversed by the Supreme Court. And I think that's indicative of hi=
s careful and principled approach to jurisprudence.=20



His opinions reflect his widely recognized ability to forge consensus amo=
ng his colleagues on a range of challenging subjects, including national =
security, campaign finance, civil rights, criminal law and federalism. Th=
ese are the kinds of issues that any judge has to confront when you are s=
erving on the second highest court in the land, like Chief Judge Merrick =
Garland is. His litigation record reflects a decades long devotion to pub=
lic service and an exceptional record of legal achievement, including his=
 role in the Oklahoma City bombing and Unabomber cases.



We expect that upon receiving this questionnaire, the Senate Judiciary Co=
mmittee members will do their jobs by reviewing the information, notice a=
ny hearings so that the American people can hear directly from Chief Judg=
e Garland as he answers questions under oath, and then give him a fair ye=
s or no vote. This is the kind of hearing and/or vote that every nominee =
since 1875 has received, and we expect the Senate will give Chief Judge G=
arland the same fair consideration as prior nominees.



So, with that long windup and two important pieces of business out of the=
 way, Kathleen, why don't you get started with questions?



Q I'm actually going to have to start with the Presidents trip to Hiroshi=
ma.



MR. EARNEST: Okay.



Q It seemed like the White House, in addition to announcing the visit, wa=
nted to really stress that the President was not going to apologize in an=
y way for the bombing at Hiroshima. And I'm wondering if you could just a=
rticulate a little bit in more detail why it's so important that folks un=
derstand that that's not the mission of this trip. What would be so wrong=
 in apologizing, given the devastation and the size of the tragedy?=20



MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously this is a question that historians have cons=
idered and it's an entirely legitimate line of inquiry for historians. Th=
e President intends to visit to send a much more forward-looking signal a=
bout his ambition for realizing the goals of a planet without nuclear wea=
pons. This also is an opportunity for the visit to highlight the remarkab=
le transformation in the relationship between Japan and the United States=
.=20



If you would have imagined that one of our closest partners and allies in=
 Asia was Japan, just 70 years ago it would have been very difficult to i=
magine, given the hostilities between our two countries. But yet, thats e=
xactly what has occurred, based on a commitment of the leaders of our two=
 countries to forge closer bonds. Weve also seen deeper ties between our =
peoples. And even as we speak, there are thousands of U.S. military servi=
cemembers who are stationed in Japan, and they operate in bases in Japan =
that enhance not just the national security of the United States but also=
 contribute in important ways to the national security of our Japanese al=
lies.



 The United States and Japan also work effectively together, including th=
rough our militaries; on humanitarian relief efforts; on other emergency =
response efforts, including the natural disaster that the Japanese people=
 suffered as a result of a tsunami and an ensuing crisis at the nuclear f=
acility in Fukushima. All of this is a testament to the way that the U.S.=
-Japan relationship has dramatically changed over the last 70 years, and =
the President is certainly interested in further marking the progression =
of that relationship by visiting Hiroshima.



 Q But he doesnt need to go to Hiroshima to talk about the partnership be=
tween the U.S. and Japan, right? I mean, he has a message specifically ab=
out nuclear weapons, I assume, and there are a lot of groups saying that =
he shouldnt just go there -- he should go with something actually in hand=
, some new announcement to make.



 MR. EARNEST: There are a lot of people with a lot of opinions about this=
 trip. Theyre certainly entitled to them. So the President will be travel=
ing to Hiroshima. That visit, of course, will follow visits that were mad=
e by both the U.S. Ambassador to Japan and, recently, by Secretary of Sta=
te John Kerry, who attended a G7 ministerial meeting in Hiroshima. And th=
e President will have an opportunity to visit the Peace Park and offer up=
 his own reflections about his visit to that city.



 The President certainly does understand that the United States bears a s=
pecial responsibility. The United States continues to be the only country=
 to have used nuclear weapons, and it means that our country bears a spec=
ial responsibility to lead the world in an effort to eliminate them. And =
this is a goal that has been sought by both Democratic and Republican Pre=
sidents, and it is a goal that would make our country and our planet safe=
r.



 But, look, theres also no diminishing the important contribution of the =
greatest generation of Americans who didnt just save the United States, b=
ut, rather, saved the world from tyranny. And the courage and bravery of =
that generation of Americans is one that will go down in American history=
. And over the last decade or so, theres been an increasing effort to pay=
 tribute to them as that generation ages and, unfortunately, many of thos=
e American heroes have passed on. But I feel confident, and the President=
 is confident that future generations of Americans, long into our history=
, will recognize a significant debt of gratitude that they owe to those b=
rave Americans that ensured the United States and the defenders of freedo=
m prevailed in the Second World War.



 Q Okay, thanks. And on another topic, I assume the White House is follow=
ing some of the discussion about complaints that Facebook has been suppre=
ssing conservative voices and viewpoints. And Im just -- as the White Hou=
se uses Facebook quite a lot, and the President has spoken out about conc=
erns that people are siloed and get their news from sources that reinforc=
e their own views, Im wondering if you have any thoughts, or if this is s=
omething that the President is concerned about.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the White House certainly does use Facebook to commun=
icate with the American public. I believe the Associated Press uses Faceb=
ook to communicate with the American public, as do your media organizatio=
ns -- or your news organizations.=20



 We obviously are all dealing with a rapidly changing news environment, a=
nd communicating more effectively with the American people is a responsib=
ility that we all have. Obviously we were pleased to see the statement fr=
om Facebook making pretty clear that this was not something that they eng=
aged in. Obviously you can ask them directly for a better explanation of =
what people may be seeing. But theres no denying that the kind of media e=
nvironment that exists today places a special burden on consumers of news=
 to make a concerted effort to seek out opinions that may differ from the=
m.=20



The nature of Facebook is that it helps people connect over large distanc=
es, and it makes those connections based on shared opinions and shared ch=
aracteristics. And the media environment, the way that its structured now=
 certainly makes it easy for any individual to surround themselves with v=
oices and perspectives and opinions that they share.=20



And the President has given a number of speeches where hes talked about h=
ow important it is for citizens across the country to seek out differing =
opinions, to challenge their own assumptions, and doing so better educate=
s them about important issues and gives them a better perspective about t=
he diversity in our country and will ensure that our government makes bet=
ter decisions, and that the citizens across the country can inform themse=
lves about the debate, can engage in that debate, and be more effective i=
n pushing our countrys leaders to make the decisions that reflect the pre=
ferences and priorities of the American people.



 Tim.



 Q I want to talk about the Philippines.=20



 MR. EARNEST: We can if youd like to.



 Q President-elect Duterte -- does the White House have any qualms about =
his advocacy of hundreds, if not more, vigilante killings to wipe out cri=
me and drug trafficking?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, at this point, the United States is prepared to =
commend the Philippines on its May 9th elections. By all accounts, those =
elections appear to have gone smoothly and enjoyed historically high leve=
ls of participation. Those are all indications of a vibrant democracy. We=
re still awaiting the official results from officials in the Philippines,=
 and we look forward to congratulating and working with the winners of th=
ose elections on our active and close bilateral relationship.=20



Tim, I dont think you went on this trip, but obviously the President trav=
eled to the Philippines last November, spent several days there, and had =
multiple opportunities to underscore the depth of the U.S. relationship w=
ith the Philippines. Obviously weve got an important security relationshi=
p, and our efforts to coordinate with the Philippines as they provide for=
 some maritime security that has an impact on the economy here in the Uni=
ted States is important.



 We also value the important economic bilateral relationship between the =
United States and the Philippines, and the President had an opportunity t=
o discuss those issues with President Aquino when he was in the Philippin=
es last November, like I said. So thats an indication of how healthy the =
U.S. relationship is with the Philippines. And we look forward to strengt=
hening that relationship and deepening that relationship with whomever th=
e Filipino voters have decided should lead their country moving forward.



 Q But in the campaign, Duterte was talking about throwing away the human=
 rights laws. Does the White House hear any of the echoes of the past the=
re -- the authoritarian past?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I dont have any comments about the campaign platforms=
 or the rhetoric used by any of the individual candidates in the Filipino=
 election. Well wait for the official results, and we can comment more di=
rectly there about our ability to work with the winners of that election.=




 Q And just one more on the Philippines. Duterte has called for multilate=
ral talks to resolve some of the issues in the South China Sea. Is that a=
n option?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I dont have a specific comment on any of the p=
roposals that have been put forward by the candidates. In general, our ap=
proach to the situation in the South China Sea has been that the United S=
tates is not a claimant to any of the land features in the South China Se=
a, but the United States does believe that those who have competing claim=
s should find a way to resolve those differences through diplomacy and th=
rough established international procedure. And that continues to be our p=
osition, and we certainly encourage all parties in that region of the wor=
ld to pursue their differences and to resolve their differences in that w=
ay. Our interest is in making sure those differences are resolved peacefu=
lly in a way that doesnt disrupt the free flow of commerce in the region.=




 This is a region of the world where billions of dollars of commerce is s=
hipped every day, and we certainly are interested in preventing any sort =
of disruptions that flow of commerce and goods.



 Q On Zika, Senator Nelson of Florida is saying that hes confident that t=
he $1.9 billion that the administration is pushing for for Zika is going =
to pass the Senate and not even need -- on an emergency basis, so it woul=
dn't need any kind of -- need to be offset with any other spending cuts. =
Does the administration share his confidence in that?



 MR. EARNEST: I didnt hear who you said made those comments.=20



 Q Bill Nelson.



 MR. EARNEST: Okay. We certainly believe that's what Congress should have=
 done at least a month or two ago. This is a public health emergency that=
 our countrys leading scientists and public health experts have identifie=
d. I began the briefing yesterday by reading a statement from the Nationa=
l Governors Association, representing Democratic and Republican governors=
 across the country, who urged Congress to act quickly to provide resourc=
es both to our public health professionals but also to states and localit=
ies that are fighting the Zika virus.=20



 Failing to do so, or delaying action is going to have a negative impact =
on the public health and well-being of the American people. That's not ju=
st a statement that I've made; that's a statement we've heard from Democr=
atic and Republican governors, and it's a statement we've heard from publ=
ic health professionals.



 So Congress is past due in making this kind of commitment to Americas sa=
fety and the public health of the American people. The debate about passi=
ng these resources should not get bogged down in a partisan dispute about=
 how it's going to be paid for. This is emergency funding, and Congress s=
hould act quickly to pass it so that these resources can be used to start=
 expanding lab capacity so that we can make diagnostic tests more effecti=
ve; it can certainly ramp up our ability to develop, test and manufacture=
 a vaccine. And I think in the minds of these governors, theyre most inte=
rested in getting additional resources to help them fight mosquito popula=
tions in communities in their states where we're at risk of seeing these =
mosquitoes actually carry the Zika virus to more people.



 Q How is the White House reaching out to lawmakers?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think we've been pretty blunt about what it is that=
 we want both in terms of our public communications and our private commu=
nications. I'll just recall, because I carried it out here with me, that =
the White House did present to Congress on February 22nd of this year a v=
ery specific proposal of how much money is required and how that money wo=
uld be used. But since that time, we have not seen Congress take the nece=
ssary steps to act on this specific proposal.



 So, again, it is unconscionable for Republicans to continue to delay thi=
s kind of assistance to states that need it and to public health professi=
onals that are pretty concerned that adequate resources are not being mob=
ilized to confront this serious public health emergency.



 Bob.



 Q Josh, I'm probably way ahead of the game here, but --



 MR. EARNEST: You usually are, Bob. (Laughter.)=20



 Q When the President goes to Japan, Prime Minister Abe is probably going=
 to ask him about a potential Donald Trump presidency. And the fact that =
Trump keeps saying on the campaign trail hes going to rework trade deals =
with Japan and China -- to the best of my knowledge, the only trade deal =
we would have with Japan is the one that's coming up, the TPP, if I'm cor=
rect. I don't know, but anyway --=20



 MR. EARNEST: You are correct that Japan is part of the TPP agreement tha=
t's been reached.



 Q But what is he going to say to reassure Abe that the United States wil=
l live up to this commitment for this agreement, especially with reluctan=
ce on Capitol Hill to even vote for it?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Bob, what we do need in order to meet the -- in order=
 to complete this agreement is we do need congressional approval. And the=
 good news about that is we know that there is strong bipartisan support =
on Capitol Hill for a trade agreement like this one that would cut taxes =
that other countries impose on American goods -- 18,000 taxes, in fact. S=
o there are ample reasons for Congress to act to implement the Trans-Paci=
fic Partnership agreement.=20



 And the President will make clear to Prime Minister Abe that that contin=
ues to be a priority of his administration, and he'll reassure him that t=
here continues to be strong support among Democrats and Republicans, not =
just in Congress, but across the country, for this agreement. That's why =
youve seen organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and the American Fa=
rm Bureau come out and indicate their support for this agreement, because=
 they understand the positive economic impact it would have on the countr=
y. And the President certainly intends to work in bipartisan fashion to g=
et this done.



 Q What about the Trump factor? Has he been asked already about this in o=
ther locales -- I mean, directly from Japan, I guess is the best way to p=
ut it.



 MR. EARNEST: I can't speak to all of the private conversations that Pres=
ident Obama has had with Prime Minister Abe. But the President has observ=
ed that it's not unusual for world leaders to ask him about the state of =
the American political debate and to ask about particular candidates. I t=
hink the President has made his own views pretty clear, and I think what =
you hear the President say publicly about this is exactly the same thing =
he says privately to world leaders when they ask him about it.



 April.



 Q Josh, a couple questions. I want to go back to your packet or your let=
ter to Congress.



 MR. EARNEST: Sure. We can get you a copy. It doesnt just have to be mine=
.



 Q I would love a copy.



 MR. EARNEST: Okay. We'll get that done. Lets make a note here, guys. Apr=
il seems to be showing more interest than Republicans in Congress are on =
it. (Laughter.) So we certainly want to cultivate that interest and make =
sure you can take a close look at it.



 Q So tell me, I just want to know the construct of that letter or that p=
acket of information. Give me the components of that. I just want to know=
 a little bit more about it.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, look, it's long, but what I can tell you is that what=
 it does is, in rather detailed fashion, goes through exactly how much mo=
ney would be dedicated to the specific efforts to fight the Zika virus. I=
n some cases, it's funding to the CDC. In some cases, it's funding for th=
e NIH. Theres also extensive funding that's been requested to help local =
authorities fight the mosquito populations in their communities.=20



 We know that this is a virus that's transmitted by mosquito, and so this=
 is something that, I believe, Dr. Fauci talked about this when he was he=
re, that one of the things that we know would be helpful in fighting the =
Zika virus is if we know that theres someone in the community that's cont=
racted the Zika virus that there should be a special effort made to try t=
o eradicate the mosquito population around that persons house so that tha=
t person is less likely to get bit by a mosquito and have that mosquito t=
ransmit the virus to someone else.=20



 So having a nimble operation like that requires substantial funding, cer=
tainly more funding than is currently available to states and localities =
for fighting the mosquito population. And this is a common-sense way -- t=
here shouldnt be a partisan difference in fighting mosquitoes. I don't kn=
ow that Republicans are pro-mosquito. Though if they are, that would make=
 news. But so theres no reason that we shouldnt see bipartisan congressio=
nal action on something as common sense as this.



 Q So how much of that packet or is that letter dedicated to the dangers,=
 the potential pandemic, the reality -- the drastic realities of what cou=
ld happen? How much of that is --



 MR. EARNEST: Theres not an assessment that's included in here in terms o=
f what the longer-term projections are for the spread of the Zika virus. =
You might check with CDC to see if they have any materials like that. Thi=
s is really focused on what are the resources that are necessary to ensur=
e that federal, state, and local officials are doing everything possible =
to try and protect the American people from the Zika virus.



 Q All right, so not including an assessment -- do you think that's a goo=
d thing or a bad thing, especially when you're asking for money, to show =
that this is such a need?



 MR. EARNEST: There are available assessments. And if theres any doubt on=
 the part of members of Congress about the threat posed by the Zika virus=
, then I certainly would encourage them to be in touch with the CDC.



 Q Okay. And on two other subjects -- West Point. Do you have anything ne=
w to talk to us about that picture today?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, what I can tell you -- I don't know whether or not the=
 President has seen the picture. I've not spoken to him about it. But I c=
an assure you that the President has an enormous amount of pride in the m=
embers of the class of 2016 who are set to graduate from all of our servi=
ce academies, including West Point.



 Those of you who have covered the President for a while will remember th=
at the President has now delivered two commencement addresses at the Unit=
ed States Military Academy at West Point. The President is also looking f=
orward, in a month or so, to delivering the commencement address at the U=
nited States Air Force Academy out in Colorado Springs. It will be an opp=
ortunity for him to acknowledge the tremendous accomplishments of these f=
ine young Americans who have gone through four years of rigorous academic=
 and military training and have been prepared to lead their fellow servic=
emembers on the battlefield.



 And what is true is this particular photo that's gained a lot of currenc=
y online has generated some discussions about race relations in our count=
ry. But the real focus should be on the tremendous accomplishments of the=
se cadets and, as I mentioned, the fact that they will soon be leading so=
ldiers on missions around the world.



 Q Let me ask you this. Thinking about what the President said about heri=
tage and diversity at Howard -- again, that's the most recent piece where=
 hes talked about race -- thinking about what he said and looking at this=
 picture, does this White House feel it possibly is an unnecessary contro=
versy, an unnecessary critique of a picture showing black pride -- as the=
 President had talked about at Howard, knowing who you are?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not going to try to divine the message that those=
 cadets were attempting to send. What I can tell you is that the Presiden=
t is proud of all of our graduates at our military academies. Theyve made=
 a significant sacrifice and theyve dedicated the early part of their liv=
es as young adults to serving their country -- thats worthy of our respec=
t and our gratitude. And the President is certainly proud of the commitme=
nt that they have made to their country and is proud of the way that they=
 have prepared themselves to represent our country, to serve our country,=
 and even defend our country in missions around the world.



 Q And lastly, Ferguson -- has it come full circle now? There is now a bl=
ack police chief.



 MR. EARNEST: Ive seen those reports. Is there a question?



 Q I said, now has Ferguson come full circle, now that theres a black pol=
ice chief?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont think thats a judgment that I would render from here=
. Obviously the community of Ferguson -- I think all of the residents in =
that community would acknowledge that the work of strengthening that comm=
unity and repairing some of the bonds between government and citizens is =
going to take some time.=20



And in some ways, thats work thats never done. The sign of a strong commu=
nity is one that constantly challenges itself to improve and to make sure=
 that the will of the people is manifested in the day-to-day decisions of=
 the government. And I think what is certainly true is that the community=
 of Ferguson has made a lot of important progress. Many concerns and prob=
lems that were beneath the surface for a long time did erupt into public =
view, in tragic and violent ways sometimes.=20



 But by confronting these challenges head on and by being committed to re=
pairing that community, thats the path to success and theres no denying t=
hat theyve made a lot of important progress in that regard.



 Q Last question on this. Is this a positive step forward -- after the Ju=
stice Department has been watching them and working with them to fix many=
 of their problems thats come out in documentation that they have had pra=
ctices that were discriminatory?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, its the people of Ferguson that should sort of=
 render a judgment about how much progress that theyve made. But based on=
 the coverage, it does seem like they are beginning to make some importan=
t movements in the right direction, and that is a reflection of the advoc=
acy of people in that community, but also a commitment to public service =
on behalf of some people in that community that have decided to take on a=
 pretty tough assignment, including the new police chief.



 Olivier.



 Q Thanks, Josh. Two topics. One, does the President want to meet with an=
y of the survivors of the Hiroshima bombing?



 MR. EARNEST: All of the logistics for the Presidents trip have not been =
formulated at this point, so I dont know at this point whether or not he =
will have an opportunity to meet with any of the survivors, but well keep=
 you posted on that.



 Q Okay. And then, John Kerry is in Western Europe. He declared parts of =
Iran open for business. He said that=20
Western companies should not use the United States as an excuse for not d=
oing business in Iran. It sounds like you guys are pretty concerned that =
Western European companies might, in effect, cast a vote of no confidence=
 in the Iran deal. Is that the case? Are you concerned that if not enough=
 economic -- if not enough business is done with Iran that that might lea=
d to some unraveling of the deal? Or Iranian expressions of hostility in =
some other formats?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, I think the first thing it indicates is that=
 the dire warnings of the harshest critics of the deal werent true. They =
didnt come to pass. There were suggestions by many Republicans in Congres=
s that Iran was prepared to receive hundreds of billions in sanctions rel=
ief as a result of this agreement. And I have stood up here countless tim=
es and said that that wasnt true, and tried to explain why. And then this=
 is just the latest evidence that, again, those critics of the deal were =
either wrong or lying but that hasnt stopped them from continuing to do t=
hat.



 More generally, I can tell you that the goal of the Obama administration=
 and of the Secretary of State is to communicate as clearly as possible w=
ith the business community around the world about what is permissible and=
 in compliance with existing sanctions imposed by the United States and t=
he international community against Iran, and what isnt.=20



And there is an obligation on the part of the government to help people u=
nderstand how to comply with the sanctions that are currently in place. S=
anctions relief has been granted, which means that there are new opportun=
ities, but they are still subject to constraints based on sanctions that =
continues to be in place against Iran because of their ballistic missile =
program, because of their continued support for terrorism, because of the=
ir violations of human rights and some other things.



 But what we seek is to be clear as possible about what those sanctions a=
llow and what they prevent, and thats exactly what Secretary Kerry is eng=
aged in over in Europe.



 Q So in the last couple of weeks, Iran -- weve seen an uptick in anti-Am=
erican speeches, reports of missile tests, a threat to close the streets =
of Hormuz. Today, they apparently announced the delivery of S-300 missile=
 defense systems. These are not connected? Youre saying that theyre actua=
lly --



 MR. EARNEST: Those are all things they were doing before the deal. And t=
heyre doing them now. So I think its a little hard to draw a clear connec=
tion between those kinds of activities and the deal when they were taking=
 place before the deal and theyre taking place after the deal. So we have=
 been quite clear that the goal of this international agreement was to pr=
event Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. That was not just a priority =
that was chosen at random; that was the priority that was identified by P=
resident Obama, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and other leaders in the region=
 who were deeply concerned about the prospect of a nuclear armed Iran.=20=




 So President Obama made a strategic calculation, and said the most impor=
tant thing we can do when it comes to Iran is to prevent them from obtain=
ing a nuclear weapon. And he engaged in a concerted strategy to mobilize =
the international community to achieve that goal. And we have. Iran does =
not have a nuclear weapon -- thats not based on some sort of intelligence=
 assessment -- thats based on the verification of international inspector=
s who have checked, and they continue to check on a continuous basis that=
 has made the United States of America safer; that has made Israel safer;=
 that has made our partners in the Middle East safer.



 It has not resolved all of our concerns with Iran. We continue to be con=
cerned about the way that Iran menaces Israel. We continue to be concerne=
d about the way that Iran supports terrorism. We continue to be concerned=
 about the development of Irans ballistic missile program. But their ball=
istic missile program is a whole lot less dangerous when there is no risk=
 of them putting a nuclear weapon on top of one of those ballistic missil=
es, and that was only possible because of the Iran deal. So we certainly =
are gratified by whats been accomplished, but our efforts to continue to =
hold Iran for other aspects of their policies and behavior have not waned=
.=20



In fact, we have redoubled our efforts to counter Irans ballistic missile=
 program. There have been new sanctions that have been put in place as a =
result of more recent activity. Weve continued to cultivate our relations=
hip with our partners in the Gulf to enhance their capabilities to protec=
t themselves from Irans ballistic missile program. Weve worked with other=
 people, with other countries, both in the region and around the world, t=
o augment our efforts to prevent Iran from illicitly obtaining materials =
and equipment that could be used to advance their ballistic missile progr=
am.



 So our efforts here have been comprehensive and the results have been th=
at the United States, our allies, and our partners are safer. Iran is far=
ther away from obtaining a nuclear weapon than they have been before. And=
 the people who complained about the agreement were wrong or lying or bot=
h.=20



 Pam.



 Q Josh, is there a concern that the President going to Hiroshima will be=
 interpreted as an apology?



 MR. EARNEST: If people do interpret it that way, they will be interpreti=
ng it wrongly, so I dont think theres much risk of that.



 Q Was there any debate in the White House about whether the President sh=
ould go or not?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously there have been questions raised about whet=
her or not the President would travel to Hiroshima every time the Preside=
nt has traveled to Japan. Hes done that three or four times now. And on t=
he Presidents first visit to Japan, back in 2009, he observed that he wou=
ld like to have the opportunity to visit Hiroshima. And given the progres=
s that we have made to advance nuclear security, given the recent visits =
of the Ambassador and the Secretary of State, and given the fact that thi=
s will be the Presidents last visit to Japan as President, it seemed appr=
opriate for the President to make this visit.



 Q On the Garland questionnaire that was submitted, was that something th=
at the Judiciary Committee gave to him, or was that something that the Wh=
ite House had him fill out? And if it was the committee who gave it to hi=
m, do you interpret that as a good sign for the nomination?



 MR. EARNEST: My understanding is that he actually filled out the questio=
nnaire that essentially is filled out by federal judges who have been nom=
inated. And when asked about this earlier this year, Senator Grassley sai=
d basically -- when asked about whether or not Chief Judge Garland should=
 fill out a questionnaire, or whether or not the Judiciary Committee woul=
d be giving him a questionnaire, Senator Grassley said, Theyve got the qu=
estionnaire.=20



So we filled out the questionnaire that we got, and we submitted it today=
. And we certainly were pleased to see the Senate Judiciary Committee acc=
ept the questionnaire and to post it on the website. That is consistent w=
ith the way this process is supposed to work.=20



As I pointed out, the next step in the process here should be members of =
the committee should carefully consider the contents of the questionnaire=
 and schedule his hearing. We certainly are ready for them to do that.



 Q Last, I think you mentioned there were -- he had met with 10 Republica=
n senators. Has that changed at all? And is there any hope for meeting wi=
th more? Because there are a lot more there who he could meet with. (Laug=
hter.)



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Ill point out that there are a lot who have said that=
 they will not meet with him. So let me see if I have the latest tally he=
re in terms of -- hes met with 46 senators, total, including 14 Republica=
n senators. Later today, I can tell you that Chief Judge Garland will be =
meeting with Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Republican. Hell also be=
 meeting with Brian Schatz, a Democratic Senator from Hawaii. So that wou=
ld bring us up to 15 Republican senators after the meeting with Senator J=
ohnson.



 I recognize -- Pam, youre pretty good at math, so youve concluded that t=
hats not even a majority of Republican senators who serve in the Senate. =
But 15 is notable because youll remember that the opening bid by Republic=
an senators was issued by the Republican Leader in the Senate, who said t=
hat they wouldnt be meeting with the Presidents nominee, and, in fact, 15=
 Republican senators at the end of today will have done so.



 Q Im not 27, either. (Laughter.)



 MR. EARNEST: Well. (Laughter.)



 Ron.



 Q Im not 27, either. (Laughter.) Just for the math.

=20

 MR. EARNEST: Not my first day here -- (Laughter.)



 Q Is there any indication that any of the members of the committee have =
said that they will consider the content of the questionnaire and that th=
ey will schedule a hearing? Is there any -- because it feels, to be quite=
 frank about it, youre talking about a questionnaire being submitted as a=
 positive sign. We did the math about the small number of Republican sena=
tors who have actually met with Judge Garland.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, its 15 Republican senators who defied their Republica=
n leadership and agreed to meet with him.



 Q Well, thats one way of looking at it, but its also the rest who have n=
ot defied, and are holding strong to whats clearly been their position fr=
om the start -- that they are not going to consider this nomination.



 MR. EARNEST: Theyre not going to do their job. I recognize that the vast=
 majority of Republican senators have held to the position that they will=
 not do their job.



 Q Im not sure where we are now. Months later, do you still believe that =
Judge Garland is going to have a hearing before President Obama leaves --=
 before a lame duck session?



 MR. EARNEST: Yeah. We certainly believe that thats the direction that we=
re headed, and that is certainly what he deserves. Thats the way that it =
has worked for every single Supreme Court nominee since 1875. Ill point o=
ut that there is one new data point, and this is actually -- Senator Flak=
e was on your network over the weekend, and Senator Flake actually took a=
 more forward-leaning position than many of his Republican colleagues.=20=




He actually opened the door not just to giving Chief Judge Garland a hear=
ing before the election, not just to giving Chief Judge Garland a vote be=
fore the election -- he actually imagined a scenario in which the Senate =
would confirm Chief Judge Garland before the election. We certainly belie=
ve thats what they should do, and we were gratified to see a Republican s=
enator making that case. In fact, this is a Republican senator who serves=
 on the Judiciary Committee.



 Q So do you think more are going to come forward and make statements lik=
e this? Are there indications like that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, they should.



 Q They should, but are they? Is there concrete progress underway?



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, theres concrete progress. They started out with saying=
 that they werent going to meet with the guy, and now 15 Republican senat=
ors say they have. They started out saying that they wouldnt even conside=
r a hearing, and weve seen Senator Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, step=
 forward and say the Senate should man up and vote. Weve seen two former =
Supreme Court justices come out and say -- this is Justice Stevens and Ju=
stice OConnor -- indicate that they believe that the Senate should do the=
ir job. Weve seen Senator Collins from Maine come out and say that she wo=
uld welcome the opportunity to participate in a -- to watch a hearing and=
 to cast a vote. And now weve got Senator Flake out here who has gone eve=
n farther and said that he can imagine a scenario in which the Senate wou=
ld confirm him.=20



So all of this in the face of a Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, who, =
just hours after Justice Scalia died, said that the Senate would not do a=
nything to consider the Presidents nominee and the President shouldnt eve=
n bother putting someone forward. Well, the President did do his job. The=
 President nominated somebody that even Republicans acknowledge is a cons=
ensus nominee. And some Republicans have continued to block his progress.=
 But were going to continue to move forward. Were going to continue to do=
 everything that is required and typical of that process, and well see if=
 Republicans continue to try to block it.



 Q They, no doubt, will. When do you expect the hearing would happen?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, the Senate Judiciary Committee would have =
to schedule a hearing. The Senate Democrats who serve on that committee l=
aid out the typical schedule for the way that this would have worked if R=
epublicans were doing their job in the Senate, and they said that that he=
aring would have taken place in the last week in April. We certainly were=
 prepared to participate in the hearing had it been scheduled for them. S=
o Republicans are past due. And were prepared to participate in the heari=
ng as soon as they can get one on the books.



 Q And just to follow up on the Iran questions. Essentially what youre sa=
ying is that the Iran nuclear deal has made the U.S. and its allies and t=
he world safer.



 MR. EARNEST: Undeniably.



 Q But is it also clear that you have not seen any progress on any other =
front where the United States has concerns with Iran in terms of its miss=
ile programs, in terms of its involvement in Iraq and Syria, in terms of =
its support for terrorism and so forth, down the list. I mean, I think th=
ats what you were saying, is that you had to redouble your efforts in the=
se areas. So it would appear that -- not to minimize the nuclear threat -=
- but it seems also clear that theres no other area where you can point t=
o where theres been progress as a result of renewed communications or est=
ablishing communication --



 MR. EARNEST: There was that little thing where we got four American host=
ages out of Iran. I think that counts for something. We did have some suc=
cess in resolving this longstanding financial dispute in a way that saved=
 the American taxpayers billions of dollars with Iran. So I dont think ei=
ther of those are small matters.=20



I would acknowledge that we havent seen Iran stop supporting terrorism. W=
e certainly would welcome them doing that. But their support for terroris=
m is a whole lot less dangerous if they dont have a nuclear weapon sittin=
g in the closet. The same could be said of their ballistic missile progra=
m. Weve been concerned that they continue to carry out these tests -- we =
cant confirm the latest test that may have been conducted -- but those te=
sts are a whole lot less menacing if theres no risk of them putting a nuc=
lear weapon on top of it. The same is true of their support for the Assad=
 regime. That support for the Assad regime is not nearly as dangerous as =
it would be if there was the potential that they could use a nuclear weap=
on to protect Bashar al Assad.



 Q In the context of the nuclear deal, a lot was said about the benefits =
of diplomacy, of talking and having -- is there any area now where you wi=
ll clearly identify the administration is involved in some sort of negoti=
ation, active diplomacy, communication with the Iranians where you expect=
 to see some progress on some other front?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the other point of progress that I didnt acknowledge =
was the rather undramatic release of those American servicemembers who, e=
arlier this year, had been picked up in Iranian waters. That was clearly =
a testament to the effectiveness of the channel of communication between =
senior U.S. officials and senior Iranian officials.=20



 So those communications channels remain open. And I don't have anything =
to predict about what sort of announcements may be forthcoming, but even =
in just the few months of this year, whether it's the successful return o=
f American citizens whove been held unjustly in Iran, or the resolution o=
f those financial disputes, or even the rather drama-free release of thos=
e American servicemembers who drifted into Iranian waters -- in each case=
, the benefits of our improved communication with Iran we're beneficial t=
o the United States of America.



 Q But in terms of Iraq and Syria, theres been no -- the Iranians are as =
problematic as they ever were.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the situations in those countries are obviously compl=
icated. And we have not resolved all of our concerns with Irans behavior =
in the context of the nuclear agreement, but we have, despite the lies an=
d false predictions of our critics, have succeeded in preventing Iran fro=
m obtaining a nuclear weapon, and verifying that their nuclear program ha=
s been rolled back in ways that enhance the safety and security of the Am=
erican people.



 Margaret.



 Q On Iran, you said that your critics went to this wrong assumption that=
 there would be this huge payday for Iran because of the nuclear deal, an=
d implied there that the White House knew better. Does that mean the U.S.=
 knew that Iran actually never would be open for business, given the U.S.=
 financial system?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what the United States has done is demonstrat=
ed a clear commitment to upholding our end of the deal. We have only been=
 willing to do that after Iran not only lived up to their end of the deal=
, but allowed the international community to enter their country and veri=
fy that they had lived up to their end of the bargain. That included thin=
gs like disconnecting thousands of centrifuges, shipping out 98 percent o=
f their highly enriched uranium stockpile, essentially rendering harmless=
 their heavy-water plutonium reactor.=20



 Once we verified that they had taken all of those steps, then the United=
 States moved forward with implementing our end of the deal. What we indi=
cated is that there would be sanctions relief that Iran would get, and th=
ere would be resources that had been withheld from them that they would g=
et access to. The President acknowledged this both before the agreement w=
as completed and also in the statement that he delivered in announcing th=
at the agreement had been reached.



 What is false is people like Steve Scalise said that Iran would get hund=
reds of billions of dollars. So, again, I don't know if Mr. Scalise is ju=
st really poorly informed, or lying, but what he predicted is not true. W=
e said so at the time, and now we can actually evaluate the facts and det=
ermine whether or not he was right. Steve Scalise was wrong -- not for th=
e first time.



 Q But it puts this administration in kind of an awkward position when th=
e Secretary of State has to stand out there and say Iran is open for busi=
ness, because the U.S. is the reserve currency of the world, because the =
U.S. has such influence and control over the world economy and the world =
financial system that, as hes saying, some European institutions blame th=
e U.S. for keeping it out of Iran. Was that something that the White Hous=
e knew would happen going in, that this was sort of -- even if the sancti=
ons were lifted, that it wasnt Iran being open for business in the sense =
that money was going to flow in?



 MR. EARNEST: No, I think what we knew is that Iran would get access to s=
ome of the funds that had been withheld from them because of the sanction=
s put in place over their nuclear program. The point that I'm making is t=
hat the amount of relief that they would get was wildly and falsely overe=
stimated by critics of the deal.=20



 And again, there is a point where -- we had sort of this debate and disp=
ute about how much sanctions relief they would get. People like Steve Sca=
lise, who said that Iran would get hundreds of billions of dollars, again=
, were either wrong or lying. Unfortunately, it hasnt really prevented cr=
itics from continuing to make that case. I'm not really sure why that is.=
 But I think it is a whole lot more awkward for Steve Scalise to have to =
face up to the fact that Iran did not get hundreds of billions of dollars=
 in sanctions relief than it is for Secretary of State John Kerry to make=
 clear to the international community that the United States is committed=
 to helping people understand exactly whats in compliance with the sancti=
ons we have in place with Iran and whats not.



 Q You're not concerned about the deal unraveling because of the griping =
on the part of the Iranians that theyre not getting the kind of influx of=
 business that they expected?



 MR. EARNEST: No.=20



 Q You're not?



 MR. EARNEST: No.



 Q You're not. Another question on Iran. There was a lawsuit filed by one=
 of the four Americans that was released, Amir Hekmati, a former Marine. =
And he cites in some detail some of the torture that he experienced while=
 in captivity, and torture not just for being an American, but he says he=
 was accused of working for the U.S. government, et cetera. Is there any =
White House reaction to some of what he detailed?



 MR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the documents that hes filed in the context =
of this court case. Obviously the President was deeply concerned about th=
e well-being of those American citizens who were being wrongly held by Ir=
an, and that's why the President made it such a personal priority to secu=
re their release. And it's why the news of their release was greeted with=
 so much relief by people not just all across this White House, but peopl=
e all across the country. There was genuine concern that these Americans =
werent just being deprived of their ability to spend time with their fami=
lies, but that they were doing so, they were facing that deprivation in v=
ery hostile circumstances. And we were deeply concerned about the safety =
and health and well-being of these American citizens. That's why we worke=
d so hard to get them out.=20



 Q What he describes in the lawsuit is clear violations of the Geneva Con=
vention, clear torture. And also within the suit hes referred to as a hos=
tage. Does the U.S. believe that these Americans, particularly Amir Hekma=
ti, was a hostage, not just a prisoner?



 MR. EARNEST: When I was talking about this earlier I think I inaccuratel=
y described them as hostages. Our policy is that they were detainees, tha=
t they were unjustly detained by the Iranian government. And we worked ve=
ry diligently to secure their release because of our concern for their we=
ll-being and because of our concern about the conditions in which they we=
re being held. So the President made this a personal priority to secure t=
he release of these detainees.



 Q Is there any comment on the seeking compensation and seeking some rest=
itution from the Iranian government for what is described as torture?



 MR. EARNEST: I haven't looked at the specific documents that hes filed i=
n the court case. So if we have a position on that, I'll make sure we fol=
low up with you.=20



 Lana.



 Q The Citadel has recently decided that it would be a violation of schoo=
l policy to allow a Muslim student to wear a hijab. Does the President su=
pport the Citadels decision to deny this religious exemption? And does th=
e administration think more needs to be done to recruit young Muslim Amer=
icans to the top military academy for the U.S.?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not familiar with this specific case, and I'm certainly=
 not familiar with the dress code policy of the Citadel, so I'll defer co=
mment on that. I will say the President has often remarked about the prid=
e he has in the thousands of Muslims who serve the United States in our m=
ilitary. These are men and women who are committed to their faith and com=
mitted to the safety and security of the United States of America. These =
are patriotic Americans who are serving their country. The President is p=
roud of their service, and we all should be.



 Q But theres no thought on whether or not a hijab should be allowed at U=
.S. military academies?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not sure of the policies that are in place at the=
 Citadel, and I'm also not aware of the specific policies that are in pla=
ce at the four service academies. So I just wouldn't weigh in on them bec=
ause I'm not familiar with those details.



 Q And back to Merrick Garland. With North Carolinas HB2 possibly ending =
up in the Supreme Court, does this further fuel the Presidents belief tha=
t we need to get -- or that the administration needs to get Merrick Garla=
nd on the Court and appointed as soon as possible? Or does it make no dif=
ference to the administration?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President -- this President sort of has the same =
view that was taken by Republican President Ronald Reagan, who talked abo=
ut the fact that every day that goes by with a vacancy on the Supreme Cou=
rt is a day that the American people should be concerned that the Supreme=
 Court doesnt have the full complement of justices to deal with the impor=
tant issues before them.=20



So the President feels strongly that the Senate has a responsibility to m=
ake sure that the Supreme Court has all nine justices that our Framers en=
visioned. The President has fulfilled his constitutional responsibility t=
o conduct an exhaustive search after consulting with Democrats and Republ=
icans in the Senate. The President has chosen someone that even Republica=
ns have described as a consensus nominee. The President has chosen someon=
e with more experience on the federal bench than any other nominee in Sup=
reme Court history.=20



So it's really unprecedented for somebody with this much experience to be=
 nominated for this position. Unfortunately, whats also unprecedented is =
the degree to which Republicans are refusing to do their job and refusing=
 to give this Supreme Court nominee a hearing or a vote for the first tim=
e since 1875. Since 1875, every Supreme Court nominee has been given a he=
aring and/or a vote. And it's unprecedented for Republicans to withhold i=
t.



Q And yesterdays lawsuits do not raise the stakes at all for the administ=
ration in the Supreme Court battle?



MR. EARNEST: Well, whats clear is the Supreme Court is dealing with lots =
of very important issues that resonate with the American people on a rang=
e of matters not just related to social policy, but also matters related =
to national security and the economy. So there are a range of important i=
ssues before the Supreme Court, and I think the American people believe t=
hat they are best served by having the full complement of justices up the=
re making these important decisions.=20



Q And one other thing. Yesterday, when asked about if you could categoric=
ally state that no senior administration official ever lied publicly abou=
t the Iran nuclear deal, you said, No, Kevin, but the transcript omitted =
the no. Did somebody review those transcripts, or are you changing your a=
nswer?



MR. EARNEST: No. If I had changed my answer youd know about it.



Suzanne.=20



Q Back to the Presidents trip to Hiroshima. You said the intention is not=
 to apologize. If anybody interprets it as an apology that would be a mis=
interpretation. But does the President welcome the renewed debate that th=
e American people are having or will have when he goes to that city wheth=
er or not the United States should have dropped the atomic bomb?



MR. EARNEST: Listen, I don't think the President sees any benefit in tryi=
ng to muzzle debate. It's entirely legitimate for historians to carefully=
 look at the decision -- the fateful decision that President Truman had t=
o make. And President Truman made a decision that he believed was consist=
ent with our national security priorities. He believed that lives on both=
 sides of the conflict could be saved by dropping the bomb. And I'm confi=
dent this is a decision that any God-fearing, moral person would agonize =
over.=20



But President Truman did what Presidents have to do, which is he had to m=
ake a tough decision, and he had to make that tough decision when the sta=
kes were high. In some ways, the stakes might not have been -- may never =
have been higher. And it certainly is appropriate for historians to take =
a look at that decision, to consider how that decision was made, to evalu=
ate whether or not it was the right one, to consider whether or not there=
 might have been an alternative that would have produced a better result.=
 It's certainly appropriate for historians to examine what are the longer=
-term consequences of that decision. All of that is an entirely fair disc=
ussion for historians and for the American people to consider.=20



But that's not what President Obama will do when he visits Hiroshima. Wha=
t President Obama will do is make note of the fact that the relationship =
between the United States and Japan has emerged stronger than anybody cou=
ld have imagined back in 1945. And it's a remarkable testament to the com=
mitment of two great countries to try to find peace, and to look for oppo=
rtunities to work together and coordinate their efforts to advance the in=
terests of their people.



And the United States and Japan have been able to do that in remarkable f=
ashion, on a variety of issues -- whether it's the economy, or the recove=
ry from natural disasters, or even countering a country like North Korea =
that has in the past threatened to use nuclear weapons again.=20



So I think, looking toward the future, with that kind of relationship in =
mind, is something that I think is worth noting and the President is cert=
ainly looking forward to his visit for that reason.



 Q Is it part of his intention, his intent, the trip -- not just historia=
ns but the American people, just regular folks who take a look at that de=
cision and weigh the pros and the cons of whether or not that was appropr=
iate?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, look, thats certainly -- I would anticipate that in t=
he lead-up to the Presidents trip that all of you will be doing stories a=
bout that fateful decision in American history. I think its certainly -- =
thats a relevant discussion for our country to have and theres no reason =
that people should shy away from considering the impact of a decision lik=
e that. But, look, when the President goes to the Peace Park in Hiroshima=
 he is just going to offer some short, simple reflections on his visit an=
d that will include an observation about the way that the relationship be=
tween the United States and Japan has been transformed.



 Q Judge Garland -- the progress that you say is being made here -- there=
 are some Republicans who are gaming out the election campaign and are lo=
oking at a possible President Trump or President Clinton, and thinking th=
at perhaps Garland as a nominee would be a better option than someone who=
 would be put forth by either one of those presidents. Is that something =
that is playing into perhaps the softening of Republicans position? Is th=
at something the administration has heard, or seen, or is aware of?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, just based on all of your reporting and the kinds of =
conversations that each of you is having with Republican senators, its cl=
ear that they are feeling some pressure. And they recognize that -- let m=
e say it this way. It has been clear from the beginning that Republicans =
have not been comfortable with the posture of refusing to do their job wh=
en it comes to something as important as confirming a nominee to the Supr=
eme Court.=20



That position for Republicans became even more uncomfortable when the Pre=
sident put forward the name of a nominee that even leading Republicans ha=
d described as a consensus nominee. Even Republicans have vouched for Chi=
ef Judge Garland. Even Republicans who have had the opportunity to meet w=
ith him in private have remarked on his character and on his credentials.=
=20



 Senator Graham -- Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Caroli=
na, described Chief Judge Garland as a well-qualified man. Hes honest and=
 capable, and his reputation is beyond reproach. Senator Toomey, a Republ=
ican from Pennsylvania, described him as very, very smart, very knowledge=
able. And Senator Flake, who I referenced before, described Chief Judge G=
arland as obviously a man of accomplishment and keen intellect. So these =
are Republicans who are clearly uncomfortable with the idea of failing to=
 live up to their constitutional responsibility. And that discomfort was =
enhanced when it became clear that they were going to have to consider so=
mebody that they basically are acknowledging should be on the Supreme Cou=
rt. Somebody who does have the experience and the aptitude and the creden=
tials to serve with distinction on the Supreme Court in a lifetime appoin=
tment.



 I recognize that none of these senators would say that Chief Judge Garla=
nd was at the top of their list, but theyre also hard-pressed to deny him=
 a position because they acknowledge that he is qualified for it. So that=
, I think, is what has put Republicans in the most difficult position. Im=
 confident that the politics are a factor here, but what Im also confiden=
t is a factor is the fact that the President has put forward a nominee th=
at even Republicans say is well-qualified for the job.



 Q Do you see the politics as working in your favor?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think its hard to tell exactly what is going on wit=
h the politics right now. So Ill let well-paid pundits make those observa=
tions and they can sort of game this out. I think what is clear is that e=
ven setting aside the politics -- which is what Republicans, frankly, sho=
uld do -- there is no one who has come forward with a compelling case tha=
t somehow Chief Judge Garland does not deserve a lifetime appointment on =
the Supreme Court.



 Zeke.



 Q -- a couple of candidates most likely national security intelligence b=
riefings. The President began his in 2008 -- in September of 2008 is when=
 he had his first briefing. Is it the Presidents expectation that that pr=
ocess would begin sooner now, given the emphasis -- the President signed =
the Presidential Transition Act -- that that process would begin sooner t=
han the fall?



 MR. EARNEST: Not necessarily. The Office of the Director of National Int=
elligence will sort of make a plan for when to conduct this briefing with=
 the party nominees. I think that he has indicated that the briefing is n=
ot likely to occur until after the conventions. I believe thats why Presi=
dent Obama -- or then Senator Obama did not receive his briefing until Se=
ptember of 2008. Youll recall that the conventions in 2008 were much late=
r than they are this year. So I think thats whats driving the timeframe h=
ere. But you do make an accurate observation in that the President has ma=
de a smooth transition a top priority, and there are already resources th=
at have been dedicated to this effort by the administration and by senior=
 officials here in the White House to ensure that the next President, who=
mever the American people elect, will be ready to hit the ground running =
on January 20, 2017.



 Q There was another discussion last week of the content of that briefing=
, particularly given one of -- the presumptive nominee on the Republican =
side. Some were raising questions, can that person be trusted with classi=
fied information. Is the Presidents expectation that both nominees will b=
e presented with at least the same or more information than he was presen=
ted with when he was being briefed before the 2008 election?



 MR. EARNEST: The Presidents assumption is that our professionals in the =
intelligence community will determine what will be included in the briefi=
ng that the candidates are presented. And I believe that Director Clapper=
 has indicated that he expects both candidates to get the same informatio=
n, but what exactly is included there is something that our intelligence =
professionals will determine.



 Q Does that mean theres no -- the President wouldnt insist on the same l=
evel of information he was read in on eight years ago?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, presumably that information would be outdated by abou=
t eight years, so I think its hard to draw a line in terms of what the sa=
me information would be. But the President -- again, what Director Clappe=
r has said is that both the Democratic nominee and the Republican nominee=
 in 2016 will receive the same briefing. And what is included in that bri=
efing is something that will be determined by our intelligence profession=
als.



 Andrew.



 Q I want to go back to Hiroshima. The President is a student of history.=
 He must have studied the historical record from 1945. Would he have made=
 the same decision as Truman?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what the President would say is that its hard=
 to put yourself in that position from the outside. So I think its hard t=
o probably land on a specific, precise decision.=20



Look, I think what the President does appreciate is that President Truman=
 made this decision for the right reasons. President Truman was focused o=
n the national security interests of the United States. President Truman =
was focused on bringing an end to a terrible war, and President Truman ma=
de this decision fully mindful of the likely human toll. And President Tr=
uman evaluated this decision carefully and moved forward in the direction=
 that he believed was consistent with our countrys national security inte=
rests. And I think, given the way the President Truman approached this di=
lemma and given the outcome, I think its hard to look back and second-gue=
ss him too much.=20



 Q -- indicated that the President will use the trip to make the case for=
 a world without killer weapons. But are we right in saying that the Pres=
ident would use nuclear weapons if necessary?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, what the President has indicated is that we have a nu=
clear stockpile and its one that should be maintained both for safety rea=
sons but also for readiness reasons. And the President has also succeeded=
 in reducing that stockpile based on cooperative efforts with the Russian=
s earlier in his presidency.



 But the Presidents first job is to protect the safety and well-being of =
the American people. And the President believes that the best way to do i=
t is to rid the world of necessary weapons.



 Q And a final question. This year is the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbo=
r. Do you think that theres a need for some kind of reciprocal gesture fr=
om the Japanese?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have any announcements at this point about any sort=
 of presidential travel, or what the Japanese may do to mark that occasio=
n. Obviously that is a day that continues to live in infamy, as President=
 Roosevelt observed. And I don't have any announcements at this point abo=
ut how the President will observe the 75 anniversary of the day.



 Tolu.



 Q I wanted to follow up on the Hiroshima visit and the nuclear weapons i=
ssue. There have been some critics who have said that -- you've mentioned=
 that the President said that we should maintain our nuclear stockpile. B=
ut critics have said that the President has actually been upgrading and r=
efurbishing and modernizing that stockpile in a way that sort of counters=
 his statement that he wants a world without these nuclear weapons. And t=
hey've sort of reiterated those comments as this announcement has been ma=
de about the Hiroshima visit. Im wondering what your reaction is to that =
line of --=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I would react in a couple of ways. The first is that =
the President recognizes the special burden that the United States carrie=
s because we are the only country to have used nuclear weapons. And that =
does set the United States apart from others.=20



 Whats also true is that this President has worked aggressively to sign a=
greements with the Russians so that both sides can reduce our nuclear sto=
ckpiles. And we've made progress early in the presidency in that regard.



 This President has also led the international effort to block the prolif=
eration of nuclear weapons in the context of this international deal to p=
revent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The President is quite proud=
 of that aspect of his legacy. Whats also true is the President has made =
this issue -- nuclear security -- a top priority. He convened four intern=
ational summits, most recently this spring here in Washington, where seve=
ral dozen world leaders attended to focus on the issue of nuclear securit=
y.=20



 Much of the work to refurbish our nuclear weapons stockpile has been con=
ducted with the goal of ensuring the safety of those nuclear weapons, but=
 also enhancing their readiness. But none of that detracts from the topli=
ne goal that the President has set out, which is to rid the world of nucl=
ear weapons.



 And while there certainly is a moral dimension to adopting a policy like=
 that, theres also a direct national security dimension to that policy. T=
he President believes that the United States would be safer and the world=
 would be safer if we could rid the world of nuclear weapons. And that is=
 a goal that the President has laid out. Its a goal that previous Democra=
tic and Republican Presidents have also identified. And the President is =
proud of the progress that we've made in pursuit of that goal. But he ack=
nowledges that we surely have a long, long way to go.



 Q Just one on the other part of the Presidents trip. Hes going to be goi=
ng to Vietnam. And theres been some reports that the arms ban against Vie=
tnam may be lifted. I know you were asked about this a couple weeks ago, =
but Im wondering if that's under discussion. If there -- there have been =
a lot of backlash from the Hill, both parties, about that proposal. So Im=
 wondering if you've reached out to people on the Hill and if you are dis=
cussing potentially lifting an arms ban.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, there certainly has been a public discussion of this =
policy and of this issue. I don't have any comments about those public di=
scussions at this point, but well keep you posted if anything is going to=
 change.



 Kevin.=20



 Q Thanks, Josh. Did the President speak with the Attorney General follow=
ing her remarks yesterday? And what was his reaction to her impassioned c=
omments?



 MR. EARNEST: Im not aware of the President having an opportunity to spea=
k to the Attorney General yesterday. The President did see her comments. =
And she was making an announcement about an enforcement action that the D=
epartment of Justice has chosen to pursue. That decision about that enfor=
cement action was made independently by Department of Justice. It was not=
 influenced by the White House. But I agree with your observation that sh=
e did make a pretty impassioned defense of ensuring that every American h=
as their basic civil and human rights protected.



 And that's the kind of passion that has made her not just an effective p=
rosecutor throughout her career, but it has also made her a remarkably ef=
fective Attorney General.



 Q I wanted to ask you about the overtime expansion the President mention=
ed quite some time ago. And I know that there is a date coming up where i=
ts expected that the Department of Labor may announce an expansion so tha=
t people who are making $50,000 and less could then -- up to $50,000 coul=
d get more overtime. Is the President prepared to get moving on that? Or =
make an announcement on that end?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, this is -- you're right, this is a Department of Labo=
r rule that is currently being vetted by the Office of Management and Bud=
get. I don't have an update for you in terms of the timeline for when a d=
ecision could be announced. Obviously, Secretary Perez has spoken to the =
motivation behind putting forward this rule change. But I don't have any =
comment on it from here. But OMB may be able to give you a better timelin=
e for the completion of that consideration.



 Q Just a couple more. Gitmo detainees and a number of potential transfer=
s out of the facility. Can you give me an update on the number that are s=
till there? And if there is going to be an announcement soon of other tra=
nsfers?



 MR. EARNEST: The number is somewhere around 90 -- it may be in the high =
80s at this point. But every time we make a transfer, we publicly announc=
e it. So there have not been any transfers since the last time you and I =
discussed this.



 Q Is there any chance to get a number -- a specific number? Because usua=
lly when I ask, youll say around, or sort of, but you're not --=20



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, we can get you --=20



 Q Can you get that for me? I appreciate that. And lastly, sort of taking=
 a 30,000-foot view of the Presidents visit to Hiroshima -- for the peopl=
e who are not awash in this all the time, whats the message to America, i=
n particular to older Americans, who might view this curiously, to say th=
e least?=20



 MR. EARNEST: I think the message to them is the President, I think most =
powerfully, had the opportunity to show his gratitude to the Greatest Gen=
eration of Americans at the 70th Anniversary of D-Day just a couple of ye=
ars ago. And standing there, overlooking that beach in France, the Presid=
ent talked movingly about how that generation of Americans will go down i=
n history for the contribution that they have made not just to our freedo=
m, but to the worlds freedom.=20



 And that certainly was true when it came to the battlefields in Europe, =
but that was surely true in the Pacific theater, as well. And over the co=
urse of this trip, the President will certainly keep in mind the signific=
ant commitment and sacrifice that was made by millions of Americans to en=
sure that the freedom of the United States and the freedom of the world w=
ould be protected.



 There are -- when you travel around the world, other countries recognize=
 the tremendous sacrifice that that generation of Americans made. They sa=
ved the world. And it certainly is appropriate to consider the policy dec=
isions that were made at that time, but there is no denying and there is =
no questioning the patriotism, the courage, and the sacrifice that millio=
ns of Americans in the Greatest Generation made to protect our freedom.=20=




 Gregory, Ill give you the last one.



 Q Thank you. I want to go back to the Garland questionnaire. Most of thi=
s has already been a matter of public record, but there was one revealing=
 question where he was asked to cite what he believes the 10 most importa=
nt cases hes decided are. And those cases involved what would usually be =
considered liberal causes -- human rights, labor rights, environmental pr=
otection, open government, free press. There was a criminal case where he=
 ruled in favor of the defendant. What are we to make of this list? And h=
ow does the selection of these cases -- again, this isnt his entire recor=
d, but these are the cases he believes are most important. How does that =
make the case to Republicans who may be on the fence that he is a moderat=
e Supreme Court appointee?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Gregory, I think I would first observe there are 2,64=
0 merits cases that Chief Judge Merrick Garland has participated in, and =
he has authored 357 opinions in nearly two decades on the second highest =
court in the land. So you rightly pointed out that this is just a small s=
liver of a tremendous body of work that Chief Judge Garland has assembled=
 during his service on the D.C. Circuit. When it comes to the substance o=
f those decisions, and the substance of the opinions that he authored, I =
think this is exactly why theres a process for the Senate Judiciary Commi=
ttee to have hearings.=20



 The questions that you've raised are entirely appropriate. These are exa=
ctly the kinds of questions that Chief Judge Merrick Garland is prepared =
to answer. Hes prepared to answer them under oath, on camera, in public s=
o that everybody can see exactly what kind of judge he is. He is someone =
who understands that it is his job to interpret the law, not advance a po=
litical agenda. And hes demonstrated that over his 19 years on the federa=
l bench -- more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court =
nominee in history.



 And I got to tell you, Gregory, I think this is precisely why Republican=
s are blocking a hearing, because they know exactly what would happen if =
they were to grant Chief Judge Garland a hearing in the same way that eve=
ry Supreme Court nominee since 1875 has been granted. They know that he w=
ould do an incredible job of helping understand his approach to the law. =
And it would reveal somebody of remarkable intellect and a commitment to =
fairness that Americans in both parties can appreciate.



 He would make clear that he is deserving of a lifetime appointment on th=
e Supreme Court. I think that's precisely why Republicans are blocking hi=
s ability to participate in the hearing.



 Thanks, everybody. Well see you tomorrow.

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Good aft=
ernoon, everybody.&nbsp; Let me do a couple of announcements at the top bef=
ore getting to your questions.&nbsp; The first is that, as you all know, to=
day the President convened his National Security Council here at the
 White House as part of an ongoing review of our efforts to degrade and des=
troy ISIL.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s meeting was the latest in a series of NSC me=
etings in recent months convened at the White House and at key departments =
and agencies, including most recently, the
 CIA, but also the Department of State and the Department of Defense.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President was briefed o=
n ongoing U.S. and coalition efforts to degrade ISIL&#8217;s core in Iraq a=
nd in Syria, while also checking ISIL&#8217;s ambitions for expansion outsi=
de those countries. Noting recent efforts to reinforce the cessation
 of hostilities in Syria, the President and his team also discussed options=
 to further advance a political resolution to the Syrian civil conflict whi=
le continuing our efforts to pressure ISIL there.&nbsp; The President direc=
ted his National Security Council to
 continue to intensify our counter-ISIL operations across all military and =
civilian fronts, including disrupting foreign fighter networks, halting ISI=
L&#8217;s expansion outside of Syria and Iraq, countering ISIL financing, d=
isrupting any ISIL external plotting efforts
 and, of course, countering ISIL&#8217;s propaganda and messaging.<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to that, you ma=
y not know that Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counte=
rterrorism Lisa Monaco is in Brussels, Belgium today, where she will meet w=
ith Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and other Belgian
 security and intelligence officials in our shared efforts to disrupt terro=
rist plotting against the United States and Europe, and to degrade and dest=
roy ISIL.&nbsp; Ms. Monaco will also meet with senior EU officials to discu=
ss how we can support EU efforts to strengthen
 counterterrorism coordination amongst its members.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms. Monaco&#8217;s travel t=
o Belgium is one of a series of high-level engagements we're undertaking wi=
th our coalition partners to discuss ways we can enhance our counterterrori=
sm cooperation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people of Brussels know=
 all too well that ISIL continues to both plot complex attacks against our =
interests and seeks to inspire lone wolves to attack us independently of IS=
IL command and control.&nbsp; That is why we are constantly
 looking at ways we can intensify our intelligence cooperation and further =
disrupt the flow of foreign fighters.&nbsp; We will work to share with our =
partners lessons the United States learned following the September 11th ter=
rorist attacks about breaking down information
 stovepipes and protecting our homeland more effectively.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thing I wanted t=
o call to your attention -- that many of you have already reported on -- is=
 that, in addition to continuing to meet with senators of both parties, Chi=
ef Judge Merrick Garland submitted his questionnaire to
 the Senate Judiciary Committee today.&nbsp; The questionnaire and associat=
ed materials present an exhaustive picture of Judge Garland&#8217;s disting=
uished career and impeccable credentials as the nominee to the Supreme Cour=
t.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has more -- as you&#8217=
;ve heard me say on many occasions -- he has more federal judicial experien=
ce than any other Supreme Court nominee, and a lengthy record of consensus-=
building, judicial excellence, public service and academic achievement.&nbs=
p;
 His record demonstrates that he&#8217;s a careful, balanced judge who foll=
ows the law.&nbsp; In fact, he&#8217;s never written an opinion that&#8217;=
s been reversed by the Supreme Court.&nbsp; And I think that's indicative o=
f his careful and principled approach to jurisprudence.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">His opinions reflect his =
widely recognized ability to forge consensus among his colleagues on a rang=
e of challenging subjects, including national security, campaign finance, c=
ivil rights, criminal law and federalism.&nbsp;
 These are the kinds of issues that any judge has to confront when you are =
serving on the second highest court in the land, like Chief Judge Merrick G=
arland is.&nbsp; His litigation record reflects a decades&#8217; long devot=
ion to public service and an exceptional record
 of legal achievement, including his role in the Oklahoma City bombing and =
Unabomber cases.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We expect that upon recei=
ving this questionnaire, the Senate Judiciary Committee members will do the=
ir jobs by reviewing the information, notice any hearings so that the Ameri=
can people can hear directly from Chief
 Judge Garland as he answers questions under oath, and then give him a fair=
 yes or no vote.&nbsp; This is the kind of hearing and/or vote that every n=
ominee since 1875 has received, and we expect the Senate will give Chief Ju=
dge Garland the same fair consideration
 as prior nominees.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, with that long windup=
 and two important pieces of business out of the way, Kathleen, why don't y=
ou get started with questions?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a=
ctually going to have to start with the President&#8217;s trip to Hiroshima=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Okay.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It se=
emed like the White House, in addition to announcing the visit, wanted to r=
eally stress that the President was not going to apologize in any way for t=
he bombing at Hiroshima.&nbsp; And I'm wondering if you
 could just articulate a little bit in more detail why it's so important th=
at folks understand that that's not the mission of this trip.&nbsp; What wo=
uld be so wrong in apologizing, given the devastation and the size of the t=
ragedy?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
obviously this is a question that historians have considered and it's an en=
tirely legitimate line of inquiry for historians.&nbsp; The President inten=
ds to visit to send a much more forward-looking
 signal about his ambition for realizing the goals of a planet without nucl=
ear weapons.&nbsp; This also is an opportunity for the visit to highlight t=
he remarkable transformation in the relationship between Japan and the Unit=
ed States.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">If you would have imagine=
d that one of our closest partners and allies in Asia was Japan, just 70 ye=
ars ago it would have been very difficult to imagine, given the hostilities=
 between our two countries.&nbsp; But yet,
 that&#8217;s exactly what has occurred, based on a commitment of the leade=
rs of our two countries to forge closer bonds.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve also seen =
deeper ties between our peoples.&nbsp; And even as we speak, there are thou=
sands of U.S. military servicemembers who are stationed
 in Japan, and they operate in bases in Japan that enhance not just the nat=
ional security of the United States but also contribute in important ways t=
o the national security of our Japanese allies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States and Japan=
 also work effectively together, including through our militaries; on human=
itarian relief efforts; on other emergency response efforts, including the =
natural disaster that the Japanese people suffered as
 a result of a tsunami and an ensuing crisis at the nuclear facility in Fuk=
ushima.&nbsp; All of this is a testament to the way that the U.S.-Japan rel=
ationship has dramatically changed over the last 70 years, and the Presiden=
t is certainly interested in further
 marking the progression of that relationship by visiting Hiroshima.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he =
doesn&#8217;t need to go to Hiroshima to talk about the partnership between=
 the U.S. and Japan, right?&nbsp; I mean, he has a message specifically abo=
ut nuclear weapons, I assume, and there are a lot of groups saying that he =
shouldn&#8217;t
 just go there -- he should go with something actually in hand, some new an=
nouncement to make.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; There ar=
e a lot of people with a lot of opinions about this trip.&nbsp; They&#8217;=
re certainly entitled to them.&nbsp; So the President will be traveling to =
Hiroshima.&nbsp; That visit, of course, will follow visits that were made b=
y both
 the U.S. Ambassador to Japan and, recently, by Secretary of State John Ker=
ry, who attended a G7 ministerial meeting in Hiroshima.&nbsp; And the Presi=
dent will have an opportunity to visit the Peace Park and offer up his own =
reflections about his visit to that city.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President certainly doe=
s understand that the United States bears a special responsibility.&nbsp; T=
he United States continues to be the only country to have used nuclear weap=
ons, and it means that our country bears a special responsibility
 to lead the world in an effort to eliminate them.&nbsp; And this is a goal=
 that has been sought by both Democratic and Republican Presidents, and it =
is a goal that would make our country and our planet safer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, look, there&#8217;s al=
so no diminishing the important contribution of the greatest generation of =
Americans who didn&#8217;t just save the United States, but, rather, saved =
the world from tyranny.&nbsp; And the courage and bravery of that generatio=
n
 of Americans is one that will go down in American history.&nbsp; And over =
the last decade or so, there&#8217;s been an increasing effort to pay tribu=
te to them as that generation ages and, unfortunately, many of those Americ=
an heroes have passed on.&nbsp; But I feel confident,
 and the President is confident that future generations of Americans, long =
into our history, will recognize a significant debt of gratitude that they =
owe to those brave Americans that ensured the United States and the defende=
rs of freedom prevailed in the Second
 World War.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, t=
hanks.&nbsp; And on another topic, I assume the White House is following so=
me of the discussion about complaints that Facebook has been suppressing co=
nservative voices and viewpoints. And I&#8217;m just -- as the White House =
uses
 Facebook quite a lot, and the President has spoken out about concerns that=
 people are siloed and get their news from sources that reinforce their own=
 views, I&#8217;m wondering if you have any thoughts, or if this is somethi=
ng that the President is concerned about.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e White House certainly does use Facebook to communicate with the American =
public.&nbsp; I believe the Associated Press uses Facebook to communicate w=
ith the American public, as do your media organizations -- or your
 news organizations.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We obviously are all dealin=
g with a rapidly changing news environment, and communicating more effectiv=
ely with the American people is a responsibility that we all have.&nbsp; Ob=
viously we were pleased to see the statement from Facebook
 making pretty clear that this was not something that they engaged in.&nbsp=
; Obviously you can ask them directly for a better explanation of what peop=
le may be seeing.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s no denying that the kind of media=
 environment that exists today places a special
 burden on consumers of news to make a concerted effort to seek out opinion=
s that may differ from them.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The nature of Facebook is=
 that it helps people connect over large distances, and it makes those conn=
ections based on shared opinions and shared characteristics.&nbsp; And the =
media environment, the way that it&#8217;s structured
 now certainly makes it easy for any individual to surround themselves with=
 voices and perspectives and opinions that they share.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the President has giv=
en a number of speeches where he&#8217;s talked about how important it is f=
or citizens across the country to seek out differing opinions, to challenge=
 their own assumptions, and doing so better
 educates them about important issues and gives them a better perspective a=
bout the diversity in our country and will ensure that our government makes=
 better decisions, and that the citizens across the country can inform them=
selves about the debate, can engage
 in that debate, and be more effective in pushing our country&#8217;s leade=
rs to make the decisions that reflect the preferences and priorities of the=
 American people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want =
to talk about the Philippines.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; We can i=
f you&#8217;d like to.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preside=
nt-elect Duterte -- does the White House have any qualms about his advocacy=
 of hundreds, if not more, vigilante killings to wipe out crime and drug tr=
afficking?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ti=
m, at this point, the United States is prepared to commend the Philippines =
on its May 9th elections.&nbsp; By all accounts, those elections appear to =
have gone smoothly and enjoyed historically high levels of participation.&n=
bsp;
 Those are all indications of a vibrant democracy.&nbsp; We&#8217;re still =
awaiting the official results from officials in the Philippines, and we loo=
k forward to congratulating and working with the winners of those elections=
 on our active and close bilateral relationship.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Tim, I don&#8217;t think =
you went on this trip, but obviously the President traveled to the Philippi=
nes last November, spent several days there, and had multiple opportunities=
 to underscore the depth of the U.S. relationship
 with the Philippines.&nbsp; Obviously we&#8217;ve got an important securit=
y relationship, and our efforts to coordinate with the Philippines as they =
provide for some maritime security that has an impact on the economy here i=
n the United States is important.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also value the important=
 economic bilateral relationship between the United States and the Philippi=
nes, and the President had an opportunity to discuss those issues with Pres=
ident Aquino when he was in the Philippines last November,
 like I said.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s an indication of how healthy the U.S. r=
elationship is with the Philippines.&nbsp; And we look forward to strengthe=
ning that relationship and deepening that relationship with whomever the Fi=
lipino voters have decided should lead their country
 moving forward.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in =
the campaign, Duterte was talking about throwing away the human rights laws=
.&nbsp; Does the White House hear any of the echoes of the past there -- th=
e authoritarian past?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
don&#8217;t have any comments about the campaign platforms or the rhetoric =
used by any of the individual candidates in the Filipino election.&nbsp; We=
&#8217;ll wait for the official results, and we can comment more directly t=
here
 about our ability to work with the winners of that election.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And jus=
t one more on the Philippines.&nbsp; Duterte has called for multilateral ta=
lks to resolve some of the issues in the South China Sea.&nbsp; Is that an =
option?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I don&#8217;t have a specific comment on any of the proposals that hav=
e been put forward by the candidates.&nbsp; In general, our approach to the=
 situation in the South China Sea has been that the United States is not
 a claimant to any of the land features in the South China Sea, but the Uni=
ted States does believe that those who have competing claims should find a =
way to resolve those differences through diplomacy and through established =
international procedure.&nbsp; And that
 continues to be our position, and we certainly encourage all parties in th=
at region of the world to pursue their differences and to resolve their dif=
ferences in that way.&nbsp; Our interest is in making sure those difference=
s are resolved peacefully in a way that
 doesn&#8217;t disrupt the free flow of commerce in the region.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a region of the wor=
ld where billions of dollars of commerce is shipped every day, and we certa=
inly are interested in preventing any sort of disruptions that flow of comm=
erce and goods.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Zika=
, Senator Nelson of Florida is saying that he&#8217;s confident that the $1=
.9 billion that the administration is pushing for for Zika is going to pass=
 the Senate and not even need -- on an emergency basis, so it wouldn't need
 any kind of -- need to be offset with any other spending cuts.&nbsp; Does =
the administration share his confidence in that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I didn&#=
8217;t hear who you said made those comments.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill Ne=
lson.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Okay.&nb=
sp; We certainly believe that's what Congress should have done at least a m=
onth or two ago.&nbsp; This is a public health emergency that our country&#=
8217;s leading scientists and public health experts have identified.&nbsp; =
I began
 the briefing yesterday by reading a statement from the National Governors =
Association, representing Democratic and Republican governors across the co=
untry, who urged Congress to act quickly to provide resources both to our p=
ublic health professionals but also
 to states and localities that are fighting the Zika virus. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failing to do so, or delayi=
ng action is going to have a negative impact on the public health and well-=
being of the American people.&nbsp; That's not just a statement that I've m=
ade; that's a statement we've heard from Democratic and Republican
 governors, and it's a statement we've heard from public health professiona=
ls.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Congress is past due in =
making this kind of commitment to America&#8217;s safety and the public hea=
lth of the American people.&nbsp; The debate about passing these resources =
should not get bogged down in a partisan dispute about how it's going
 to be paid for.&nbsp; This is emergency funding, and Congress should act q=
uickly to pass it so that these resources can be used to start expanding la=
b capacity so that we can make diagnostic tests more effective; it can cert=
ainly ramp up our ability to develop,
 test and manufacture a vaccine.&nbsp; And I think in the minds of these go=
vernors, they&#8217;re most interested in getting additional resources to h=
elp them fight mosquito populations in communities in their states where we=
're at risk of seeing these mosquitoes actually
 carry the Zika virus to more people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is =
the White House reaching out to lawmakers?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think we've been pretty blunt about what it is that we want both in terms o=
f our public communications and our private communications.&nbsp; I'll just=
 recall, because I carried it out here with me, that the White House
 did present to Congress on February 22nd of this year a very specific prop=
osal of how much money is required and how that money would be used.&nbsp; =
But since that time, we have not seen Congress take the necessary steps to =
act on this specific proposal.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, again, it is unconscion=
able for Republicans to continue to delay this kind of assistance to states=
 that need it and to public health professionals that are pretty concerned =
that adequate resources are not being mobilized to confront
 this serious public health emergency.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, I=
'm probably way ahead of the game here, but --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; You usua=
lly are, Bob.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When th=
e President goes to Japan, Prime Minister Abe is probably going to ask him =
about a potential Donald Trump presidency.&nbsp; And the fact that Trump ke=
eps saying on the campaign trail he&#8217;s going to rework trade deals wit=
h Japan
 and China -- to the best of my knowledge, the only trade deal we would hav=
e with Japan is the one that's coming up, the TPP, if I'm correct.&nbsp; I =
don't know, but anyway --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; You are =
correct that Japan is part of the TPP agreement that's been reached.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But wha=
t is he going to say to reassure Abe that the United States will live up to=
 this commitment for this agreement, especially with reluctance on Capitol =
Hill to even vote for it?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Bo=
b, what we do need in order to meet the -- in order to complete this agreem=
ent is we do need congressional approval.&nbsp; And the good news about tha=
t is we know that there is strong bipartisan support on Capitol
 Hill for a trade agreement like this one that would cut taxes that other c=
ountries impose on American goods -- 18,000 taxes, in fact.&nbsp; So there =
are ample reasons for Congress to act to implement the Trans-Pacific Partne=
rship agreement.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the President will make=
 clear to Prime Minister Abe that that continues to be a priority of his ad=
ministration, and he'll reassure him that there continues to be strong supp=
ort among Democrats and Republicans, not just in Congress,
 but across the country, for this agreement. &nbsp;That's why you&#8217;ve =
seen organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Burea=
u come out and indicate their support for this agreement, because they unde=
rstand the positive economic impact it would
 have on the country.&nbsp; And the President certainly intends to work in =
bipartisan fashion to get this done.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What ab=
out the Trump factor?&nbsp; Has he been asked already about this in other l=
ocales -- I mean, directly from Japan, I guess is the best way to put it.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I can't =
speak to all of the private conversations that President Obama has had with=
 Prime Minister Abe.&nbsp; But the President has observed that it's not unu=
sual for world leaders to ask him about the state of the American
 political debate and to ask about particular candidates.&nbsp; I think the=
 President has made his own views pretty clear, and I think what you hear t=
he President say publicly about this is exactly the same thing he says priv=
ately to world leaders when they ask
 him about it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, a=
 couple questions.&nbsp; I want to go back to your packet or your letter to=
 Congress.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Sure.&nb=
sp; We can get you a copy.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t just have to be mine.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would=
 love a copy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Okay.&nb=
sp; We'll get that done.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s make a note here, guys.&nbsp; Ap=
ril seems to be showing more interest than Republicans in Congress are on i=
t.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So we certainly want to cultivate that interest =
and make sure you
 can take a close look at it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So tell=
 me, I just want to know the construct of that letter or that packet of inf=
ormation.&nbsp; Give me the components of that.&nbsp; I just want to know a=
 little bit more about it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, lo=
ok, it's long, but what I can tell you is that what it does is, in rather d=
etailed fashion, goes through exactly how much money would be dedicated to =
the specific efforts to fight the Zika virus.&nbsp; In some cases,
 it's funding to the CDC. In some cases, it's funding for the NIH.&nbsp; Th=
ere&#8217;s also extensive funding that's been requested to help local auth=
orities fight the mosquito populations in their communities.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that this is a viru=
s that's transmitted by mosquito, and so this is something that, I believe,=
 Dr. Fauci talked about this when he was here, that one of the things that =
we know would be helpful in fighting the Zika virus is
 if we know that there&#8217;s someone in the community that's contracted t=
he Zika virus that there should be a special effort made to try to eradicat=
e the mosquito population around that person&#8217;s house so that that per=
son is less likely to get bit by a mosquito
 and have that mosquito transmit the virus to someone else.&nbsp; <o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So having a nimble operatio=
n like that requires substantial funding, certainly more funding than is cu=
rrently available to states and localities for fighting the mosquito popula=
tion.&nbsp; And this is a common-sense way -- there shouldn&#8217;t
 be a partisan difference in fighting mosquitoes.&nbsp; I don't know that R=
epublicans are pro-mosquito.&nbsp; Though if they are, that would make news=
.&nbsp; But so there&#8217;s no reason that we shouldn&#8217;t see bipartis=
an congressional action on something as common sense as this.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how =
much of that packet or is that letter dedicated to the dangers, the potenti=
al pandemic, the reality -- the drastic realities of what could happen?&nbs=
p; How much of that is --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; There&#8=
217;s not an assessment that's included in here in terms of what the longer=
-term projections are for the spread of the Zika virus.&nbsp; You might che=
ck with CDC to see if they have any materials like that.&nbsp; This is real=
ly
 focused on what are the resources that are necessary to ensure that federa=
l, state, and local officials are doing everything possible to try and prot=
ect the American people from the Zika virus.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All rig=
ht, so not including an assessment -- do you think that's a good thing or a=
 bad thing, especially when you're asking for money, to show that this is s=
uch a need?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; There ar=
e available assessments.&nbsp; And if there&#8217;s any doubt on the part o=
f members of Congress about the threat posed by the Zika virus, then I cert=
ainly would encourage them to be in touch with the CDC.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&n=
bsp; And on two other subjects -- West Point.&nbsp; Do you have anything ne=
w to talk to us about that picture today?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, wha=
t I can tell you -- I don't know whether or not the President has seen the =
picture.&nbsp; I've not spoken to him about it.&nbsp; But I can assure you =
that the President has an enormous amount of pride in the members of
 the class of 2016 who are set to graduate from all of our service academie=
s, including West Point.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those of you who have cover=
ed the President for a while will remember that the President has now deliv=
ered two commencement addresses at the United States Military Academy at We=
st Point.&nbsp; The President is also looking forward, in a
 month or so, to delivering the commencement address at the United States A=
ir Force Academy out in Colorado Springs.&nbsp; It will be an opportunity f=
or him to acknowledge the tremendous accomplishments of these fine young Am=
ericans who have gone through four years
 of rigorous academic and military training and have been prepared to lead =
their fellow servicemembers on the battlefield.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what is true is this pa=
rticular photo that's gained a lot of currency online has generated some di=
scussions about race relations in our country.&nbsp; But the real focus sho=
uld be on the tremendous accomplishments of these cadets and,
 as I mentioned, the fact that they will soon be leading soldiers on missio=
ns around the world.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me =
ask you this.&nbsp; Thinking about what the President said about heritage a=
nd diversity at Howard -- again, that's the most recent piece where he&#821=
7;s talked about race -- thinking about what he said and looking at this pi=
cture,
 does this White House feel it possibly is an unnecessary controversy, an u=
nnecessary critique of a picture showing black pride -- as the President ha=
d talked about at Howard, knowing who you are?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'=
m not going to try to divine the message that those cadets were attempting =
to send.&nbsp; What I can tell you is that the President is proud of all of=
 our graduates at our military academies.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve made a signif=
icant
 sacrifice and they&#8217;ve dedicated the early part of their lives as you=
ng adults to serving their country -- that&#8217;s worthy of our respect an=
d our gratitude.&nbsp; And the President is certainly proud of the commitme=
nt that they have made to their country and is proud
 of the way that they have prepared themselves to represent our country, to=
 serve our country, and even defend our country in missions around the worl=
d.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And las=
tly, Ferguson -- has it come full circle now?&nbsp; There is now a black po=
lice chief.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#8217;=
ve seen those reports.&nbsp; Is there a question?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said,=
 now has Ferguson come full circle, now that there&#8217;s a black police c=
hief?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&#8=
217;t think that&#8217;s a judgment that I would render from here.&nbsp; Ob=
viously the community of Ferguson -- I think all of the residents in that c=
ommunity would acknowledge that the work of strengthening that community an=
d
 repairing some of the bonds between government and citizens is going to ta=
ke some time.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And in some ways, that&#8=
217;s work that&#8217;s never done.&nbsp; The sign of a strong community is=
 one that constantly challenges itself to improve and to make sure that the=
 will of the people is manifested in the day-to-day decisions
 of the government.&nbsp; And I think what is certainly true is that the co=
mmunity of Ferguson has made a lot of important progress.&nbsp; Many concer=
ns and problems that were beneath the surface for a long time did erupt int=
o public view, in tragic and violent ways
 sometimes.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But by confronting these ch=
allenges head on and by being committed to repairing that community, that&#=
8217;s the path to success and there&#8217;s no denying that they&#8217;ve =
made a lot of important progress in that regard.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last qu=
estion on this.&nbsp; Is this a positive step forward -- after the Justice =
Department has been watching them and working with them to fix many of thei=
r problems that&#8217;s come out in documentation that they have had practi=
ces that
 were discriminatory?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, it&#8217;s the people of Ferguson that should sort of render a judgmen=
t about how much progress that they&#8217;ve made.&nbsp; But based on the c=
overage, it does seem like they are beginning to make some important moveme=
nts
 in the right direction, and that is a reflection of the advocacy of people=
 in that community, but also a commitment to public service on behalf of so=
me people in that community that have decided to take on a pretty tough ass=
ignment, including the new police
 chief.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olivier.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; Two topics.&nbsp; One, does the President want to meet with an=
y of the survivors of the Hiroshima bombing?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; All of t=
he logistics for the President&#8217;s trip have not been formulated at thi=
s point, so I don&#8217;t know at this point whether or not he will have an=
 opportunity to meet with any of the survivors, but we&#8217;ll keep you po=
sted
 on that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&n=
bsp; And then, John Kerry is in Western Europe.&nbsp; He declared parts of =
Iran &#8220;open for business.&#8221;&nbsp; He said that
<br>
Western companies should not use the United States as an excuse for not doi=
ng business in Iran.&nbsp; It sounds like you guys are pretty concerned tha=
t Western European companies might, in effect, cast a vote of no confidence=
 in the Iran deal.&nbsp; Is that the case?&nbsp;
 Are you concerned that if not enough economic -- if not enough business is=
 done with Iran that that might lead to some unraveling of the deal?&nbsp; =
Or Iranian expressions of hostility in some other formats?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ol=
ivier, I think the first thing it indicates is that the dire warnings of th=
e harshest critics of the deal weren&#8217;t true.&nbsp; They didn&#8217;t =
come to pass.&nbsp; There were suggestions by many Republicans in Congress =
that Iran
 was prepared to receive hundreds of billions in sanctions relief as a resu=
lt of this agreement.&nbsp; And I have stood up here countless times and sa=
id that that wasn&#8217;t true, and tried to explain why.&nbsp; And then th=
is is just the latest evidence that, again, those
 critics of the deal were either wrong or lying but that hasn&#8217;t stopp=
ed them from continuing to do that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More generally, I can tell =
you that the goal of the Obama administration and of the Secretary of State=
 is to communicate as clearly as possible with the business community aroun=
d the world about what is permissible and in compliance
 with existing sanctions imposed by the United States and the international=
 community against Iran, and what isn&#8217;t.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And there is an obligatio=
n on the part of the government to help people understand how to comply wit=
h the sanctions that are currently in place.&nbsp; Sanctions relief has bee=
n granted, which means that there are new
 opportunities, but they are still subject to constraints based on sanction=
s that continues to be in place against Iran because of their ballistic mis=
sile program, because of their continued support for terrorism, because of =
their violations of human rights
 and some other things.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what we seek is to be c=
lear as possible about what those sanctions allow and what they prevent, an=
d that&#8217;s exactly what Secretary Kerry is engaged in over in Europe.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in t=
he last couple of weeks, Iran -- we&#8217;ve seen an uptick in anti-America=
n speeches, reports of missile tests, a threat to close the streets of Horm=
uz.&nbsp; Today, they apparently announced the delivery of S-300 missile de=
fense
 systems.&nbsp; These are not connected?&nbsp; You&#8217;re saying that the=
y&#8217;re actually --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Those ar=
e all things they were doing before the deal.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re doing=
 them now.&nbsp; So I think it&#8217;s a little hard to draw a clear connec=
tion between those kinds of activities and the deal when they were taking p=
lace before
 the deal and they&#8217;re taking place after the deal.&nbsp; So we have b=
een quite clear that the goal of this international agreement was to preven=
t Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; That was not just a priority =
that was chosen at random; that was the priority
 that was identified by President Obama, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and othe=
r leaders in the region who were deeply concerned about the prospect of a n=
uclear armed Iran.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So President Obama made a s=
trategic calculation, and said the most important thing we can do when it c=
omes to Iran is to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; And =
he engaged in a concerted strategy to mobilize the international
 community to achieve that goal.&nbsp; And we have.&nbsp; Iran does not hav=
e a nuclear weapon -- that&#8217;s not based on some sort of intelligence a=
ssessment -- that&#8217;s based on the verification of international inspec=
tors who have checked, and they continue to check on a
 continuous basis that has made the United States of America safer; that ha=
s made Israel safer; that has made our partners in the Middle East safer.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has not resolved all of =
our concerns with Iran.&nbsp; We continue to be concerned about the way tha=
t Iran menaces Israel. We continue to be concerned about the way that Iran =
supports terrorism.&nbsp; We continue to be concerned about the
 development of Iran&#8217;s ballistic missile program.&nbsp; But their bal=
listic missile program is a whole lot less dangerous when there is no risk =
of them putting a nuclear weapon on top of one of those ballistic missiles,=
 and that was only possible because of the
 Iran deal.&nbsp; So we certainly are gratified by what&#8217;s been accomp=
lished, but our efforts to continue to hold Iran for other aspects of their=
 policies and behavior have not waned.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In fact, we have redouble=
d our efforts to counter Iran&#8217;s ballistic missile program.&nbsp; Ther=
e have been new sanctions that have been put in place as a result of more r=
ecent activity.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve continued to cultivate our
 relationship with our partners in the Gulf to enhance their capabilities t=
o protect themselves from Iran&#8217;s ballistic missile program.&nbsp; We&=
#8217;ve worked with other people, with other countries, both in the region=
 and around the world, to augment our efforts to
 prevent Iran from illicitly obtaining materials and equipment that could b=
e used to advance their ballistic missile program.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So our efforts here have be=
en comprehensive and the results have been that the United States, our alli=
es, and our partners are safer.&nbsp; Iran is farther away from obtaining a=
 nuclear weapon than they have been before.&nbsp; And the people
 who complained about the agreement were wrong or lying or both.&nbsp; <o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pam.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, i=
s there a concern that the President going to Hiroshima will be interpreted=
 as an apology?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; If peopl=
e do interpret it that way, they will be interpreting it wrongly, so I don&=
#8217;t think there&#8217;s much risk of that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the=
re any debate in the White House about whether the President should go or n=
ot?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ob=
viously there have been questions raised about whether or not the President=
 would travel to Hiroshima every time the President has traveled to Japan.&=
nbsp; He&#8217;s done that three or four times now.&nbsp; And on the Presid=
ent&#8217;s
 first visit to Japan, back in 2009, he observed that he would like to have=
 the opportunity to visit Hiroshima.&nbsp; And given the progress that we h=
ave made to advance nuclear security, given the recent visits of the Ambass=
ador and the Secretary of State, and
 given the fact that this will be the President&#8217;s last visit to Japan=
 as President, it seemed appropriate for the President to make this visit.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the =
Garland questionnaire that was submitted, was that something that the Judic=
iary Committee gave to him, or was that something that the White House had =
him fill out?&nbsp; And if it was the committee who gave it to him, do you
 interpret that as a good sign for the nomination?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; My under=
standing is that he actually filled out the questionnaire that essentially =
is filled out by federal judges who have been nominated.&nbsp; And when ask=
ed about this earlier this year, Senator Grassley said basically
 -- when asked about whether or not Chief Judge Garland should fill out a q=
uestionnaire, or whether or not the Judiciary Committee would be giving him=
 a questionnaire, Senator Grassley said, &#8220;They&#8217;ve got the quest=
ionnaire.&#8221;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we filled out the ques=
tionnaire that we got, and we submitted it today.&nbsp; And we certainly we=
re pleased to see the Senate Judiciary Committee accept the questionnaire a=
nd to post it on the website.&nbsp; That is consistent
 with the way this process is supposed to work.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As I pointed out, the nex=
t step in the process here should be members of the committee should carefu=
lly consider the contents of the questionnaire and schedule his hearing.&nb=
sp; We certainly are ready for them to do
 that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, I=
 think you mentioned there were -- he had met with 10 Republican senators.&=
nbsp; Has that changed at all?&nbsp; And is there any hope for meeting with=
 more?&nbsp; Because there are a lot more there who he could meet with.&nbs=
p; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I&=
#8217;ll point out that there are a lot who have said that they will not me=
et with him.&nbsp; So let me see if I have the latest tally here in terms o=
f -- he&#8217;s met with 46 senators, total, including 14 Republican senato=
rs.&nbsp;
 Later today, I can tell you that Chief Judge Garland will be meeting with =
Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Republican.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll also be m=
eeting with Brian Schatz, a Democratic Senator from Hawaii.&nbsp; So that w=
ould bring us up to 15 Republican senators after
 the meeting with Senator Johnson.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recognize -- Pam, you&#82=
17;re pretty good at math, so you&#8217;ve concluded that that&#8217;s not =
even a majority of Republican senators who serve in the Senate.&nbsp; But 1=
5 is notable because you&#8217;ll remember that the opening bid by Republic=
an senators
 was issued by the Republican Leader in the Senate, who said that they woul=
dn&#8217;t be meeting with the President&#8217;s nominee, and, in fact, 15 =
Republican senators at the end of today will have done so.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217=
;m not 27, either.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well.&nb=
sp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217=
;m not 27, either.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Just for the math.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Not my f=
irst day here -- (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is ther=
e any indication that any of the members of the committee have said that th=
ey will consider the content of the questionnaire and that they will schedu=
le a hearing?&nbsp; Is there any -- because it feels, to be quite frank abo=
ut
 it, you&#8217;re talking about a questionnaire being submitted as a positi=
ve sign.&nbsp; We did the math about the small number of Republican senator=
s who have actually met with Judge Garland.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, it=
&#8217;s 15 Republican senators who defied their Republican leadership and =
agreed to meet with him.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, t=
hat&#8217;s one way of looking at it, but it&#8217;s also the rest who have=
 not defied, and are holding strong to what&#8217;s clearly been their posi=
tion from the start -- that they are not going to consider this nomination.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; They&#82=
17;re not going to do their job.&nbsp; I recognize that the vast majority o=
f Republican senators have held to the position that they will not do their=
 job.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217=
;m not sure where we are now.&nbsp; Months later, do you still believe that=
 Judge Garland is going to have a hearing before President Obama leaves -- =
before a lame duck session?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yeah.&nb=
sp; We certainly believe that that&#8217;s the direction that we&#8217;re h=
eaded, and that is certainly what he deserves.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the way t=
hat it has worked for every single Supreme Court nominee since 1875.&nbsp; =
I&#8217;ll point out that
 there is one new data point, and this is actually -- Senator Flake was on =
your network over the weekend, and Senator Flake actually took a more forwa=
rd-leaning position than many of his Republican colleagues.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">He actually opened the do=
or not just to giving Chief Judge Garland a hearing before the election, no=
t just to giving Chief Judge Garland a vote before the election -- he actua=
lly imagined a scenario in which the
 Senate would confirm Chief Judge Garland before the election.&nbsp; We cer=
tainly believe that&#8217;s what they should do, and we were gratified to s=
ee a Republican senator making that case.&nbsp; In fact, this is a Republic=
an senator who serves on the Judiciary Committee.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So do y=
ou think more are going to come forward and make statements like this?&nbsp=
; Are there indications like that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
ey should.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sh=
ould, but are they?&nbsp; Is there concrete progress underway?<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, the=
re&#8217;s concrete progress.&nbsp; They started out with saying that they =
weren&#8217;t going to meet with the guy, and now 15 Republican senators sa=
y they have.&nbsp; They started out saying that they wouldn&#8217;t even co=
nsider a hearing,
 and we&#8217;ve seen Senator Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, step forwar=
d and say the Senate should &#8220;man up and vote.&#8221;&nbsp; We&#8217;v=
e seen two former Supreme Court justices come out and say -- this is Justic=
e Stevens and Justice O&#8217;Connor -- indicate that they believe
 that the Senate should do their job.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen Senator Collin=
s from Maine come out and say that she would welcome the opportunity to par=
ticipate in a -- to watch a hearing and to cast a vote.&nbsp; And now we&#8=
217;ve got Senator Flake out here who has gone even farther
 and said that he can imagine a scenario in which the Senate would confirm =
him.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So all of this in the fac=
e of a Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, who, just hours after Justice Sc=
alia died, said that the Senate would not do anything to consider the Presi=
dent&#8217;s nominee and the President shouldn&#8217;t
 even bother putting someone forward.&nbsp; Well, the President did do his =
job.&nbsp; The President nominated somebody that even Republicans acknowled=
ge is a consensus nominee.&nbsp; And some Republicans have continued to blo=
ck his progress.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re going to continue to
 move forward.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to do everything that is=
 required and typical of that process, and we&#8217;ll see if Republicans c=
ontinue to try to block it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They, n=
o doubt, will.&nbsp; When do you expect the hearing would happen?<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ob=
viously, the Senate Judiciary Committee would have to schedule a hearing.&n=
bsp; The Senate Democrats who serve on that committee laid out the typical =
schedule for the way that this would have worked if Republicans
 were doing their job in the Senate, and they said that that hearing would =
have taken place in the last week in April.&nbsp; We certainly were prepare=
d to participate in the hearing had it been scheduled for them.&nbsp; So Re=
publicans are past due.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re prepared
 to participate in the hearing as soon as they can get one on the books.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And jus=
t to follow up on the Iran questions.&nbsp; Essentially what you&#8217;re s=
aying is that the Iran nuclear deal has made the U.S. and its allies and th=
e world safer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Undeniab=
ly.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But is =
it also clear that you have not seen any progress on any other front where =
the United States has concerns with Iran in terms of its missile programs, =
in terms of its involvement in Iraq and Syria, in terms of its support
 for terrorism and so forth, down the list.&nbsp; I mean, I think that&#821=
7;s what you were saying, is that you had to redouble your efforts in these=
 areas.&nbsp; So it would appear that -- not to minimize the nuclear threat=
 -- but it seems also clear that there&#8217;s no other
 area where you can point to where there&#8217;s been progress as a result =
of renewed communications or establishing communication --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; There wa=
s that little thing where we got four American hostages out of Iran.&nbsp; =
I think that counts for something.&nbsp; We did have some success in resolv=
ing this longstanding financial dispute in a way that saved the American
 taxpayers billions of dollars with Iran.&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t think eith=
er of those are small matters.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I would acknowledge that =
we haven&#8217;t seen Iran stop supporting terrorism.&nbsp; We certainly wo=
uld welcome them doing that.&nbsp; But their support for terrorism is a who=
le lot less dangerous if they don&#8217;t have a nuclear weapon
 sitting in the closet.&nbsp; The same could be said of their ballistic mis=
sile program.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been concerned that they continue to carry =
out these tests -- we can&#8217;t confirm the latest test that may have bee=
n conducted -- but those tests are a whole lot less menacing
 if there&#8217;s no risk of them putting a nuclear weapon on top of it. Th=
e same is true of their support for the Assad regime.&nbsp; That support fo=
r the Assad regime is not nearly as dangerous as it would be if there was t=
he potential that they could use a nuclear
 weapon to protect Bashar al Assad.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the =
context of the nuclear deal, a lot was said about the benefits of diplomacy=
, of talking and having -- is there any area now where you will clearly ide=
ntify the administration is involved in some sort of negotiation, active
 diplomacy, communication with the Iranians where you expect to see some pr=
ogress on some other front?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e other point of progress that I didn&#8217;t acknowledge was the rather un=
dramatic release of those American servicemembers who, earlier this year, h=
ad been picked up in Iranian waters.&nbsp; That was clearly a testament
 to the effectiveness of the channel of communication between senior U.S. o=
fficials and senior Iranian officials.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So those communications cha=
nnels remain open.&nbsp; And I don't have anything to predict about what so=
rt of announcements may be forthcoming, but even in just the few months of =
this year, whether it's the successful return of American citizens
 who&#8217;ve been held unjustly in Iran, or the resolution of those financ=
ial disputes, or even the rather drama-free release of those American servi=
cemembers who drifted into Iranian waters -- in each case, the benefits of =
our improved communication with Iran we're
 beneficial to the United States of America.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in =
terms of Iraq and Syria, there&#8217;s been no -- the Iranians are as probl=
ematic as they ever were.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e situations in those countries are obviously complicated.&nbsp; And we hav=
e not resolved all of our concerns with Iran&#8217;s behavior in the contex=
t of the nuclear agreement, but we have, despite the lies and false predict=
ions
 of our critics, have succeeded in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear=
 weapon, and verifying that their nuclear program has been rolled back in w=
ays that enhance the safety and security of the American people.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Iran=
, you said that your critics went to this wrong assumption that there would=
 be this huge payday for Iran because of the nuclear deal, and implied ther=
e that the White House knew better.&nbsp; Does that mean the U.S. knew that
 Iran actually never would be open for business, given the U.S. financial s=
ystem?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think what the United States has done is demonstrated a clear commitment to=
 upholding our end of the deal.&nbsp; We have only been willing to do that =
after Iran not only lived up to their end of the deal, but allowed
 the international community to enter their country and verify that they ha=
d lived up to their end of the bargain.&nbsp; That included things like dis=
connecting thousands of centrifuges, shipping out 98 percent of their highl=
y enriched uranium stockpile, essentially
 rendering harmless their heavy-water plutonium reactor.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we verified that they =
had taken all of those steps, then the United States moved forward with imp=
lementing our end of the deal. &nbsp;What we indicated is that there would =
be sanctions relief that Iran would get, and there would be
 resources that had been withheld from them that they would get access to.&=
nbsp; The President acknowledged this both before the agreement was complet=
ed and also in the statement that he delivered in announcing that the agree=
ment had been reached.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is false is people lik=
e Steve Scalise said that Iran would get &#8220;hundreds of billions of dol=
lars.&#8221;&nbsp; So, again, I don't know if Mr. Scalise is just really po=
orly informed, or lying, but what he predicted is not true.&nbsp; We said s=
o
 at the time, and now we can actually evaluate the facts and determine whet=
her or not he was right.&nbsp; Steve Scalise was wrong -- not for the first=
 time.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it =
puts this administration in kind of an awkward position when the Secretary =
of State has to stand out there and say Iran is open for business, because =
the U.S. is the reserve currency of the world, because the U.S. has such
 influence and control over the world economy and the world financial syste=
m that, as he&#8217;s saying, some European institutions blame the U.S. for=
 keeping it out of Iran.&nbsp; Was that something that the White House knew=
 would happen going in, that this was sort
 of -- even if the sanctions were lifted, that it wasn&#8217;t Iran being o=
pen for business in the sense that money was going to flow in?<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, I th=
ink what we knew is that Iran would get access to some of the funds that ha=
d been withheld from them because of the sanctions put in place over their =
nuclear program. The point that I'm making is that the amount
 of relief that they would get was wildly and falsely overestimated by crit=
ics of the deal.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And again, there is a point=
 where -- we had sort of this debate and dispute about how much sanctions r=
elief they would get.&nbsp; People like Steve Scalise, who said that Iran w=
ould get hundreds of billions of dollars, again, were either
 wrong or lying.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it hasn&#8217;t really prevented crit=
ics from continuing to make that case.&nbsp; I'm not really sure why that i=
s.&nbsp; But I think it is a whole lot more awkward for Steve Scalise to ha=
ve to face up to the fact that Iran did not get hundreds
 of billions of dollars in sanctions relief than it is for Secretary of Sta=
te John Kerry to make clear to the international community that the United =
States is committed to helping people understand exactly what&#8217;s in co=
mpliance with the sanctions we have in
 place with Iran and what&#8217;s not.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're =
not concerned about the deal unraveling because of the griping on the part =
of the Iranians that they&#8217;re not getting the kind of influx of busine=
ss that they expected?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nbsp=
; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're =
not?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're =
not.&nbsp; Another question on Iran.&nbsp; There was a lawsuit filed by one=
 of the four Americans that was released, Amir Hekmati, a former Marine.&nb=
sp; And he cites in some detail some of the torture that he experienced whi=
le in captivity,
 and torture not just for being an American, but he says he was accused of =
working for the U.S. government, et cetera.&nbsp; Is there any White House =
reaction to some of what he detailed?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I haven'=
t seen the documents that he&#8217;s filed in the context of this court cas=
e.&nbsp; Obviously the President was deeply concerned about the well-being =
of those American citizens who were being wrongly held by Iran, and that's
 why the President made it such a personal priority to secure their release=
.&nbsp; And it's why the news of their release was greeted with so much rel=
ief by people not just all across this White House, but people all across t=
he country.&nbsp; There was genuine concern
 that these Americans weren&#8217;t just being deprived of their ability to=
 spend time with their families, but that they were doing so, they were fac=
ing that deprivation in very hostile circumstances.&nbsp; And we were deepl=
y concerned about the safety and health and
 well-being of these American citizens.&nbsp; That's why we worked so hard =
to get them out.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What he=
 describes in the lawsuit is clear violations of the Geneva Convention, cle=
ar torture.&nbsp; And also within the suit he&#8217;s referred to as a host=
age.&nbsp; Does the U.S. believe that these Americans, particularly Amir He=
kmati, was
 a hostage, not just a prisoner?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; When I w=
as talking about this earlier I think I inaccurately described them as host=
ages.&nbsp; Our policy is that they were detainees, that they were unjustly=
 detained by the Iranian government.&nbsp; And we worked very diligently
 to secure their release because of our concern for their well-being and be=
cause of our concern about the conditions in which they were being held.&nb=
sp; So the President made this a personal priority to secure the release of=
 these detainees.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is ther=
e any comment on the seeking compensation and seeking some restitution from=
 the Iranian government for what is described as torture?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I haven'=
t looked at the specific documents that he&#8217;s filed in the court case.=
&nbsp; So if we have a position on that, I'll make sure we follow up with y=
ou.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lana.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cit=
adel has recently decided that it would be a violation of school policy to =
allow a Muslim student to wear a hijab.&nbsp; Does the President support th=
e Citadel&#8217;s decision to deny this religious exemption?&nbsp; And does=
 the administration
 think more needs to be done to recruit young Muslim Americans to the top m=
ilitary academy for the U.S.?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
familiar with this specific case, and I'm certainly not familiar with the d=
ress code policy of the Citadel, so I'll defer comment on that.&nbsp; I wil=
l say the President has often remarked about the pride he has in
 the thousands of Muslims who serve the United States in our military.&nbsp=
; These are men and women who are committed to their faith and committed to=
 the safety and security of the United States of America.&nbsp; These are p=
atriotic Americans who are serving their country.&nbsp;
 The President is proud of their service, and we all should be.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the=
re&#8217;s no thought on whether or not a hijab should be allowed at U.S. m=
ilitary academies?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'=
m not sure of the policies that are in place at the Citadel, and I'm also n=
ot aware of the specific policies that are in place at the four service aca=
demies.&nbsp; So I just wouldn't weigh in on them because I'm not
 familiar with those details.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bac=
k to Merrick Garland.&nbsp; With North Carolina&#8217;s HB2 possibly ending=
 up in the Supreme Court, does this further fuel the President&#8217;s beli=
ef that we need to get -- or that the administration needs to get Merrick G=
arland on the
 Court and appointed as soon as possible?&nbsp; Or does it make no differen=
ce to the administration?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e President -- this President sort of has the same view that was taken by R=
epublican President Ronald Reagan, who talked about the fact that every day=
 that goes by with a vacancy on the Supreme Court is a day
 that the American people should be concerned that the Supreme Court doesn&=
#8217;t have the full complement of justices to deal with the important iss=
ues before them.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the President feels st=
rongly that the Senate has a responsibility to make sure that the Supreme C=
ourt has all nine justices that our Framers envisioned.&nbsp; The President=
 has fulfilled his constitutional responsibility
 to conduct an exhaustive search after consulting with Democrats and Republ=
icans in the Senate.&nbsp; The President has chosen someone that even Repub=
licans have described as a consensus nominee.&nbsp; The President has chose=
n someone with more experience on the federal
 bench than any other nominee in Supreme Court history.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So it's really unpreceden=
ted for somebody with this much experience to be nominated for this positio=
n.&nbsp; Unfortunately, what&#8217;s also unprecedented is the degree to wh=
ich Republicans are refusing to do their job and
 refusing to give this Supreme Court nominee a hearing or a vote for the fi=
rst time since 1875.&nbsp; Since 1875, every Supreme Court nominee has been=
 given a hearing and/or a vote.&nbsp; And it's unprecedented for Republican=
s to withhold it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And y=
esterday&#8217;s lawsuits do not raise the stakes at all for the administra=
tion in the Supreme Court battle?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
what&#8217;s clear is the Supreme Court is dealing with lots of very import=
ant issues that resonate with the American people on a range of matters not=
 just related to social policy, but also matters
 related to national security and the economy.&nbsp; So there are a range o=
f important issues before the Supreme Court, and I think the American peopl=
e believe that they are best served by having the full complement of justic=
es up there making these important decisions.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And o=
ne other thing.&nbsp; Yesterday, when asked about if you could categoricall=
y state that no senior administration official ever lied publicly about the=
 Iran nuclear deal, you said, &#8220;No, Kevin,&#8221; but the transcript
 omitted the &#8220;no.&#8221;&nbsp; Did somebody review those transcripts,=
 or are you changing your answer?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nb=

<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back =
to the President&#8217;s trip to Hiroshima.&nbsp; You said the intention is=
 not to apologize.&nbsp; If anybody interprets it as an apology that would =
be a misinterpretation.&nbsp; But does the President welcome the renewed
 debate that the American people are having or will have when he goes to th=
at city whether or not the United States should have dropped the atomic bom=
b?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Listen=
, I don't think the President sees any benefit in trying to muzzle debate.&=
nbsp; It's entirely legitimate for historians to carefully look at the deci=
sion -- the fateful decision that President Truman
 had to make.&nbsp; And President Truman made a decision that he believed w=
as consistent with our national security priorities.&nbsp; He believed that=
 lives on both sides of the conflict could be saved by dropping the bomb.&n=
bsp; And I'm confident this is a decision that
 any God-fearing, moral person would agonize over. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But President Truman did =
what Presidents have to do, which is he had to make a tough decision, and h=
e had to make that tough decision when the stakes were high.&nbsp; In some =
ways, the stakes might not have been -- may
 never have been higher.&nbsp; And it certainly is appropriate for historia=
ns to take a look at that decision, to consider how that decision was made,=
 to evaluate whether or not it was the right one, to consider whether or no=
t there might have been an alternative
 that would have produced a better result.&nbsp; It's certainly appropriate=
 for historians to examine what are the longer-term consequences of that de=
cision.&nbsp; All of that is an entirely fair discussion for historians and=
 for the American people to consider.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But that's not what Presi=
dent Obama will do when he visits Hiroshima.&nbsp; What President Obama wil=
l do is make note of the fact that the relationship between the United Stat=
es and Japan has emerged stronger than anybody
 could have imagined back in 1945.&nbsp; And it's a remarkable testament to=
 the commitment of two great countries to try to find peace, and to look fo=
r opportunities to work together and coordinate their efforts to advance th=
e interests of their people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the United States and=
 Japan have been able to do that in remarkable fashion, on a variety of iss=
ues -- whether it's the economy, or the recovery from natural disasters, or=
 even countering a country like North
 Korea that has in the past threatened to use nuclear weapons again.&nbsp; =
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I think, looking towar=
d the future, with that kind of relationship in mind, is something that I t=
hink is worth noting and the President is certainly looking forward to his =
visit for that reason.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it p=
art of his intention, his intent, the trip -- not just historians but the A=
merican people, just regular folks who take a look at that decision and wei=
gh the pros and the cons of whether or not that was appropriate?<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, lo=
ok, that&#8217;s certainly -- I would anticipate that in the lead-up to the=
 President&#8217;s trip that all of you will be doing stories about that fa=
teful decision in American history.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s certainly -- t=
hat&#8217;s a
 relevant discussion for our country to have and there&#8217;s no reason th=
at people should shy away from considering the impact of a decision like th=
at.&nbsp; But, look, when the President goes to the Peace Park in Hiroshima=
 he is just going to offer some short, simple
 reflections on his visit and that will include an observation about the wa=
y that the relationship between the United States and Japan has been transf=
ormed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge G=
arland -- the progress that you say is being made here -- there are some Re=
publicans who are gaming out the election campaign and are looking at a pos=
sible President Trump or President Clinton, and thinking that perhaps
 Garland as a nominee would be a better option than someone who would be pu=
t forth by either one of those presidents.&nbsp; Is that something that is =
playing into perhaps the softening of Republicans&#8217; position?&nbsp; Is=
 that something the administration has heard, or
 seen, or is aware of?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ju=
st based on all of your reporting and the kinds of conversations that each =
of you is having with Republican senators, it&#8217;s clear that they are f=
eeling some pressure.&nbsp; And they recognize that -- let me say it this
 way.&nbsp; It has been clear from the beginning that Republicans have not =
been comfortable with the posture of refusing to do their job when it comes=
 to something as important as confirming a nominee to the Supreme Court.&nb=
sp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That position for Republi=
cans became even more uncomfortable when the President put forward the name=
 of a nominee that even leading Republicans had described as a consensus no=
minee.&nbsp; Even Republicans have vouched
 for Chief Judge Garland.&nbsp; Even Republicans who have had the opportuni=
ty to meet with him in private have remarked on his character and on his cr=
edentials.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Graham -- Senator L=
indsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, described Chief Judge Garl=
and as a &#8220;well-qualified man.&#8221;&nbsp; He&#8217;s &#8220;honest a=
nd capable, and his reputation is beyond reproach.&#8221;&nbsp; Senator Too=
mey, a Republican from
 Pennsylvania, described him as &#8220;very, very smart, very knowledgeable=
.&#8221;&nbsp; And Senator Flake, who I referenced before, described Chief =
Judge Garland as &#8220;obviously a man of accomplishment and keen intellec=
t.&#8221;&nbsp; So these are Republicans who are clearly uncomfortable
 with the idea of failing to live up to their constitutional responsibility=
.&nbsp; And that discomfort was enhanced when it became clear that they wer=
e going to have to consider somebody that they basically are acknowledging =
should be on the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Somebody
 who does have the experience and the aptitude and the credentials to serve=
 with distinction on the Supreme Court in a lifetime appointment.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recognize that none of th=
ese senators would say that Chief Judge Garland was at the top of their lis=
t, but they&#8217;re also hard-pressed to deny him a position because they =
acknowledge that he is qualified for it.&nbsp; So that, I think,
 is what has put Republicans in the most difficult position.&nbsp; I&#8217;=
m confident that the politics are a factor here, but what I&#8217;m also co=
nfident is a factor is the fact that the President has put forward a nomine=
e that even Republicans say is well-qualified for
 the job.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you =
see the politics as working in your favor?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think it&#8217;s hard to tell exactly what is going on with the politics ri=
ght now.&nbsp; So I&#8217;ll let well-paid pundits make those observations =
and they can sort of game this out.&nbsp; I think what is clear is that eve=
n setting
 aside the politics -- which is what Republicans, frankly, should do -- the=
re is no one who has come forward with a compelling case that somehow Chief=
 Judge Garland does not deserve a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court=
.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- a co=
uple of candidates most likely national security intelligence briefings.&nb=
sp; The President began his in 2008 -- in September of 2008 is when he had =
his first briefing.&nbsp; Is it the President&#8217;s expectation that that=
 process would
 begin sooner now, given the emphasis -- the President signed the President=
ial Transition Act -- that that process would begin sooner than the fall?<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Not nece=
ssarily.&nbsp; The Office of the Director of National Intelligence will sor=
t of make a plan for when to conduct this briefing with the party nominees.=
&nbsp; I think that he has indicated that the briefing is not likely
 to occur until after the conventions.&nbsp; I believe that&#8217;s why Pre=
sident Obama -- or then Senator Obama did not receive his briefing until Se=
ptember of 2008.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll recall that the conventions in 2008 wer=
e much later than they are this year.&nbsp; So I think that&#8217;s
 what&#8217;s driving the timeframe here.&nbsp; But you do make an accurate=
 observation in that the President has made a smooth transition a top prior=
ity, and there are already resources that have been dedicated to this effor=
t by the administration and by senior officials
 here in the White House to ensure that the next President, whomever the Am=
erican people elect, will be ready to hit the ground running on January 20,=
 2017.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There w=
as another discussion last week of the content of that briefing, particular=
ly given one of -- the presumptive nominee on the Republican side.&nbsp; So=
me were raising questions, can that person be trusted with classified infor=
mation.&nbsp;
 Is the President&#8217;s expectation that both nominees will be presented =
with at least the same or more information than he was presented with when =
he was being briefed before the 2008 election?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The Pres=
ident&#8217;s assumption is that our professionals in the intelligence comm=
unity will determine what will be included in the briefing that the candida=
tes are presented.&nbsp; And I believe that Director Clapper has indicated
 that he expects both candidates to get the same information, but what exac=
tly is included there is something that our intelligence professionals will=
 determine.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does th=
at mean there&#8217;s no -- the President wouldn&#8217;t insist on the same=
 level of information he was read in on eight years ago?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, pr=
esumably that information would be outdated by about eight years, so I thin=
k it&#8217;s hard to draw a line in terms of what the same information woul=
d be.&nbsp; But the President -- again, what Director Clapper has said
 is that both the Democratic nominee and the Republican nominee in 2016 wil=
l receive the same briefing.&nbsp; And what is included in that briefing is=
 something that will be determined by our intelligence professionals.<o:p><=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want =
to go back to Hiroshima.&nbsp; The President is a student of history.&nbsp;=
 He must have studied the historical record from 1945.&nbsp; Would he have =
made the same decision as Truman?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think what the President would say is that it&#8217;s hard to put yourself =
in that position from the outside. So I think it&#8217;s hard to probably l=
and on a specific, precise decision.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Look, I think what the Pr=
esident does appreciate is that President Truman made this decision for the=
 right reasons.&nbsp; President Truman was focused on the national security=
 interests of the United States.&nbsp; President
 Truman was focused on bringing an end to a terrible war, and President Tru=
man made this decision fully mindful of the likely human toll.&nbsp; And Pr=
esident Truman evaluated this decision carefully and moved forward in the d=
irection that he believed was consistent
 with our country&#8217;s national security interests.&nbsp; And I think, g=
iven the way the President Truman approached this dilemma and given the out=
come, I think it&#8217;s hard to look back and second-guess him too much.&n=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- indi=
cated that the President will use the trip to make the case for a world wit=
hout killer weapons.&nbsp; But are we right in saying that the President wo=
uld use nuclear weapons if necessary?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, wh=
at the President has indicated is that we have a nuclear stockpile and it&#=
8217;s one that should be maintained both for safety reasons but also for r=
eadiness reasons.&nbsp; And the President has also succeeded in reducing
 that stockpile based on cooperative efforts with the Russians earlier in h=
is presidency.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the President&#8217;s f=
irst job is to protect the safety and well-being of the American people.&nb=
sp; And the President believes that the best way to do it is to rid the wor=
ld of necessary weapons.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a f=
inal question.&nbsp; This year is the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor.&nbs=
p; Do you think that there&#8217;s a need for some kind of reciprocal gestu=
re from the Japanese?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have any announcements at this point about any sort of presidential travel,=
 or what the Japanese may do to mark that occasion.&nbsp; Obviously that is=
 a day that continues to live in infamy, as President Roosevelt
 observed.&nbsp; And I don't have any announcements at this point about how=
 the President will observe the 75 anniversary of the day.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tolu.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wante=
d to follow up on the Hiroshima visit and the nuclear weapons issue.&nbsp; =
There have been some critics who have said that -- you've mentioned that th=
e President said that we should maintain our nuclear stockpile.&nbsp; But c=
ritics
 have said that the President has actually been upgrading and refurbishing =
and modernizing that stockpile in a way that sort of counters his statement=
 that he wants a world without these nuclear weapons.&nbsp; And they've sor=
t of reiterated those comments as this
 announcement has been made about the Hiroshima visit.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wond=
ering what your reaction is to that line of --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
would react in a couple of ways.&nbsp; The first is that the President reco=
gnizes the special burden that the United States carries because we are the=
 only country to have used nuclear weapons.&nbsp; And that does set the
 United States apart from others.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s also true is t=
hat this President has worked aggressively to sign agreements with the Russ=
ians so that both sides can reduce our nuclear stockpiles.&nbsp; And we've =
made progress early in the presidency in that regard.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This President has also led=
 the international effort to block the proliferation of nuclear weapons in =
the context of this international deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuc=
lear weapon.&nbsp; The President is quite proud of that aspect
 of his legacy.&nbsp; What&#8217;s also true is the President has made this=
 issue -- nuclear security -- a top priority.&nbsp; He convened four intern=
ational summits, most recently this spring here in Washington, where severa=
l dozen world leaders attended to focus on the issue
 of nuclear security. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the work to refurbi=
sh our nuclear weapons stockpile has been conducted with the goal of ensuri=
ng the safety of those nuclear weapons, but also enhancing their readiness.=
&nbsp; But none of that detracts from the topline goal that
 the President has set out, which is to rid the world of nuclear weapons.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And while there certainly i=
s a moral dimension to adopting a policy like that, there&#8217;s also a di=
rect national security dimension to that policy.&nbsp; The President believ=
es that the United States would be safer and the world would be safer
 if we could rid the world of nuclear weapons.&nbsp; And that is a goal tha=
t the President has laid out.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a goal that previous Democra=
tic and Republican Presidents have also identified.&nbsp; And the President=
 is proud of the progress that we've made in pursuit
 of that goal.&nbsp; But he acknowledges that we surely have a long, long w=
ay to go.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on=
e on the other part of the President&#8217;s trip.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going t=
o be going to Vietnam.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s been some reports that the a=
rms ban against Vietnam may be lifted.&nbsp; I know you were asked about th=
is a couple weeks ago, but
 I&#8217;m wondering if that's under discussion.&nbsp; If there -- there ha=
ve been a lot of backlash from the Hill, both parties, about that proposal.=
&nbsp; So I&#8217;m wondering if you've reached out to people on the Hill a=
nd if you are discussing potentially lifting an arms ban.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
ere certainly has been a public discussion of this policy and of this issue=
.&nbsp; I don't have any comments about those public discussions at this po=
int, but we&#8217;ll keep you posted if anything is going to change.<o:p></=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; Did the President speak with the Attorney General following he=
r remarks yesterday?&nbsp; And what was his reaction to her impassioned com=
ments?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#8217;=
m not aware of the President having an opportunity to speak to the Attorney=
 General yesterday.&nbsp; The President did see her comments.&nbsp; And she=
 was making an announcement about an enforcement action that the Department
 of Justice has chosen to pursue.&nbsp; That decision about that enforcemen=
t action was made independently by Department of Justice.&nbsp; It was not =
influenced by the White House.&nbsp; But I agree with your observation that=
 she did make a pretty impassioned defense of ensuring
 that every American has their basic civil and human rights protected.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's the kind of pass=
ion that has made her not just an effective prosecutor throughout her caree=
r, but it has also made her a remarkably effective Attorney General.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wante=
d to ask you about the overtime expansion the President mentioned quite som=
e time ago.&nbsp; And I know that there is a date coming up where it&#8217;=
s expected that the Department of Labor may announce an expansion so that p=
eople
 who are making $50,000 and less could then -- up to $50,000 could get more=
 overtime.&nbsp; Is the President prepared to get moving on that?&nbsp; Or =
make an announcement on that end?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
is is -- you're right, this is a Department of Labor rule that is currently=
 being vetted by the Office of Management and Budget.&nbsp; I don't have an=
 update for you in terms of the timeline for when a decision could
 be announced.&nbsp; Obviously, Secretary Perez has spoken to the motivatio=
n behind putting forward this rule change.&nbsp; But I don't have any comme=
nt on it from here.&nbsp; But OMB may be able to give you a better timeline=
 for the completion of that consideration.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a =
couple more.&nbsp; Gitmo detainees and a number of potential transfers out =
of the facility.&nbsp; Can you give me an update on the number that are sti=
ll there?&nbsp; And if there is going to be an announcement soon of other t=
ransfers?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The numb=
er is somewhere around 90 -- it may be in the high 80s at this point.&nbsp;=
 But every time we make a transfer, we publicly announce it.&nbsp; So there=
 have not been any transfers since the last time you and I discussed
 this.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is ther=
e any chance to get a number -- a specific number?&nbsp; Because usually wh=
en I ask, you&#8217;ll say around, or sort of, but you're not --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, we =
can get you -- <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you=
 get that for me?&nbsp; I appreciate that.&nbsp; And lastly, sort of taking=
 a 30,000-foot view of the President&#8217;s visit to Hiroshima -- for the =
people who are not awash in this all the time, what&#8217;s the message to =
America, in particular
 to older Americans, who might view this curiously, to say the least? <o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
the message to them is the President, I think most powerfully, had the oppo=
rtunity to show his gratitude to the Greatest Generation of Americans at th=
e 70th Anniversary of D-Day just a couple of years ago.&nbsp; And
 standing there, overlooking that beach in France, the President talked mov=
ingly about how that generation of Americans will go down in history for th=
e contribution that they have made not just to our freedom, but to the worl=
d&#8217;s freedom.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that certainly was true=
 when it came to the battlefields in Europe, but that was surely true in th=
e Pacific theater, as well.&nbsp; And over the course of this trip, the Pre=
sident will certainly keep in mind the significant commitment
 and sacrifice that was made by millions of Americans to ensure that the fr=
eedom of the United States and the freedom of the world would be protected.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are -- when you trave=
l around the world, other countries recognize the tremendous sacrifice that=
 that generation of Americans made.&nbsp; They saved the world.&nbsp; And i=
t certainly is appropriate to consider the policy decisions that
 were made at that time, but there is no denying and there is no questionin=
g the patriotism, the courage, and the sacrifice that millions of Americans=
 in the Greatest Generation made to protect our freedom.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory, I&#8217;ll give yo=
u the last one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou.&nbsp; I want to go back to the Garland questionnaire.&nbsp; Most of thi=
s has already been a matter of public record, but there was one revealing q=
uestion where he was asked to cite what he believes the 10 most important c=
ases
 he&#8217;s decided are.&nbsp; And those cases involved what would usually =
be considered liberal causes -- human rights, labor rights, environmental p=
rotection, open government, free press.&nbsp; There was a criminal case whe=
re he ruled in favor of the defendant. &nbsp;What are
 we to make of this list?&nbsp; And how does the selection of these cases -=
- again, this isn&#8217;t his entire record, but these are the cases he bel=
ieves are most important.&nbsp; How does that make the case to Republicans =
who may be on the fence that he is a moderate Supreme
 Court appointee?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Gr=
egory, I think I would first observe there are 2,640 merits cases that Chie=
f Judge Merrick Garland has participated in, and he has authored 357 opinio=
ns in nearly two decades on the second highest court in the
 land.&nbsp; So you rightly pointed out that this is just a small sliver of=
 a tremendous body of work that Chief Judge Garland has assembled during hi=
s service on the D.C. Circuit.&nbsp; When it comes to the substance of thos=
e decisions, and the substance of the opinions
 that he authored, I think this is exactly why there&#8217;s a process for =
the Senate Judiciary Committee to have hearings.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The questions that you've r=
aised are entirely appropriate.&nbsp; These are exactly the kinds of questi=
ons that Chief Judge Merrick Garland is prepared to answer.&nbsp; He&#8217;=
s prepared to answer them under oath, on camera, in public so that everybod=
y
 can see exactly what kind of judge he is.&nbsp; He is someone who understa=
nds that it is his job to interpret the law, not advance a political agenda=
.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s demonstrated that over his 19 years on the federal b=
ench -- more federal judicial experience than any
 other Supreme Court nominee in history.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I got to tell you, Greg=
ory, I think this is precisely why Republicans are blocking a hearing, beca=
use they know exactly what would happen if they were to grant Chief Judge G=
arland a hearing in the same way that every Supreme Court
 nominee since 1875 has been granted.&nbsp; They know that he would do an i=
ncredible job of helping understand his approach to the law.&nbsp; And it w=
ould reveal somebody of remarkable intellect and a commitment to fairness t=
hat Americans in both parties can appreciate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would make clear that he=
 is deserving of a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.&nbsp; I think=
 that's precisely why Republicans are blocking his ability to participate i=
n the hearing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.&nbsp; We=
&#8217;ll see you tomorrow.<o:p></o:p></p>
