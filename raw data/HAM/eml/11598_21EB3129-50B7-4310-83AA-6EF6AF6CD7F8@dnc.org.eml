Alaska Introduction for DWS
5 minutes

Good evening Alaska Democrats!!

This has been an incredible convention.  I have never seen such enthusiasm =
in all my years in Democratic politics and it is a testament to both our ca=
ndidates=92 championship for hardworking American families and the reality =
TV show that has been the Republican nomination process.  If there is anyth=
ing more frightening in this election than President Donald Trump taking th=
e reins at the White House, I don=92t know what is.

Now, well before the Republicans had a nominee and well before our primary =
process had even started, our Chair Casey Steinau set her goals high and pe=
rsonally asked DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz to join us in Alaska.  Th=
at was over a year ago and even with her hectic schedule =96 being a Mom, M=
ember of Congress, a candidate, and Chair of the national Party =96 she sai=
d YES!  Kay [Brown] can tell you how many times we got a call from the DNC =
and crossed our fingers hoping she wouldn=92t have to cancel=85and of cours=
e not!!  Her staff told us time and time again:  DWS couldn=92t wait to get=
 to Alaska=85 even though this is her twin=92s 17th birthday weekend.

We are all very excited for you to hear from the Chairwoman this evening.  =
Since becoming Chair in May 2011, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has traveled to =
47 states and participated in nearly 1,800 events for the national and stat=
e parties.  Now, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a woman who truly knows how to=
 make it all work.  She=92s heading back tonight on a redeye so she can coo=
k a birthday dinner for her twins.

Before I continue my introduction of Chair Wasserman Schultz, I want to ack=
nowledge a very special guest in the audience.  Where is Shelby Schultz?  W=
ill everyone join me to give a big Alaska welcome to the Chairwoman=92s 12 =
year old daughter who is making her first trip to Alaska just for this Conv=
ention.  I hear she=92s the adventurous one in the family and had a great t=
ime driving up to the mountains for an up close and personal view of one of=
 Alaska=92s great treasures =96 our glaciers.  Welcome to Alaska, Shelby!

Now, where Debbie Wasserman Schultz=92s heart is and the job she cherishes =
like no other is being a legislator.  Debbie has served her constituents in=
 South Florida for nearly 25 years.  She was the youngest woman elected to =
the Florida state legislature - at 26 - and the first Jewish woman elected =
to the U.S. Congress from the state of Florida.

Just ten weeks after taking office in Washington, D.C., she led the fight a=
nd stood up to the GOP establishment and President George W. Bush when Cong=
ress took action to require Terri Schiavo=92s husband to keep her on life s=
upport =96 a complete slap in the face to our constitutional right to priva=
cy and separation of church and state.

There is no advocate for women, children, and young families like Debbie Wa=
sserman Schultz.  In 2007, she sponsored the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool & S=
pa Safety Act named after Secretary of State James Baker=92s granddaughter =
who died when she became trapped in a pool drain.  Drowning is the number o=
ne cause of unintentional death for children under 5 years of age and since=
 this law was passed, there have been NO drownings in the entire country du=
e to entrapments like what happened to Virginia.

Next, she teamed up with then Senator Joe Biden to pass the Protect Our Chi=
ldren Act.  This bill gave law enforcement the tools and resources they nee=
d to track down and prosecute criminals exploiting children online.  Even w=
hen GOP obstructionist number one, Tom Coburn, held up the bill, Debbie Was=
serman Schultz fought tooth and nail to get it passed into law.

In 2008, while campaigning for then Senator Barack Obama, she quietly faced=
 her own personal battle with breast cancer.  After seven surgeries, winnin=
g her own reelection, and electing the first African American President to =
the White House, she told the world her cancer story by doing what else -  =
holding a press conference to introduce the Education and Awareness Require=
s Learning Young Act - the EARLY Act.  This law provides critical funds and=
 directs the Centers for Disease Control to educate young women and health =
care providers, that young women in fact can and do get breast cancer and b=
uild awareness for those women who are at higher or genetic risk for this d=
isease.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been a champion for progressive values and wor=
king families her entire career.  She's used her voice and her vote to supp=
ort a $15 minimum wage, was a champion for the Affordable Care Act, and is =
the lead sponsor in Congress to fully fund the Zika virus crisis which is a=
 major health concern in her home state of Florida and across the country.

Michelle Obama was right when President Obama nominated her to chair the DN=
C: =93If you want something done, give it to a busy woman.=94  Well, Presid=
ent Barack Obama found the busiest one out there and named her DNC Chair no=
t once, but TWICE!

Thank you for heading to Alaska, Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz!  We are so e=
xcited to have you here.

 never seen such enthusiasm in all my years in Democratic politics and it i=
s a testament to both our candidates=92 championship for hardworking Americ=
an families and the reality TV show that
 has been the Republican nomination process.&nbsp; If there is anything mor=
e frightening in this election than President Donald Trump taking the reins=
 at the White House, I don=92t know what is.
<o:p class=3D""></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p class=3D"">&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Now well before the Republicans had a nominee and we=
ll before our primary process had even started, our Chair Casey Steinau set=
 her goals high and personally asked DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz to =
join us in Alaska.&nbsp; That was over
 a year ago and even with her hectic schedule =96 being a Mom, Member of Co=
ngress, a candidate, and Chair of the national Party =96 she said YES!&nbsp=
; Kay [Brown] can tell you how many times we got a call from the DNC and cr=
ossed our fingers and toes hoping she wouldn=92t
 have to cancel=85 of course not!!&nbsp; Her staff told us time and time ag=
ain:&nbsp; DWS couldn=92t wait to get to Alaska=85 even though this is her =
twin=92s 17th birthday weekend.&nbsp;
<o:p class=3D""></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p class=3D"">&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">We are all very excited for you to hear from the Cha=
irwoman this evening.&nbsp; Since becoming Chair in May 2011, Debbie Wasser=
man Schultz has traveled to 46 states and participated in nearly 1,800 even=
ts for the national and state parties.&nbsp;
 Now, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a woman who truly knows how to make it al=
l work.&nbsp; She=92s heading back tonight on a redeye so she can cook a bi=
rthday dinner for her twins.&nbsp;
<o:p class=3D""></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p class=3D"">&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Before I continue my introduction of Chair Wasserman=
 Schultz, I want to acknowledge a very special guest in the audience.&nbsp;=
 Where is Shelby Schultz?&nbsp; Will everyone join me to give a big Alaska =
welcome to the Chairwoman=92s 12 year old daughter
 who is making his first trip to Alaska just for this Convention.&nbsp; I h=
ear she=92s the adventurous one in the family and had a great time driving =
up to the mountains for an up close and personal view of one of Alaska=92s =
great treasures =96 our glaciers.&nbsp; Welcome
 to Alaska, Shelby! <o:p class=3D""></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p class=3D"">&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Now where Debbie Wasserman Schultz=92s heart is and =
the job she cherishes like no other is being a legislator.&nbsp; Debbie has=
 served her constituents in South Florida for nearly 25 years. &nbsp;She wa=
s the youngest woman elected to the Florida state
 legislature and the first Jewish woman elected to the U.S. Congress from t=
he state of Florida.&nbsp;
<o:p class=3D""></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p class=3D"">&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Just six weeks after taking office in Washington, D.=
C., she stood up to the GOP establishment and President George W. Bush when=
 Congress took action to require Terri Schiavo=92s family to keep her on li=
fe support =96 a complete slap in the
 face to our constitutional right to privacy and separation of church and s=
tate.&nbsp;
<o:p class=3D""></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p class=3D"">&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">There is no advocate for women, children, and young =
families like Debbie Wasserman Schultz.&nbsp; In 2007, she sponsored the Vi=
rginia Graeme Baker Pool &amp; Spa Safety Act named after Secretary of Stat=
e James Baker=92s granddaughter who died when
 she became trapped in a pool drain.&nbsp; Drowning is the number one cause=
 of unintentional death for children under 5 years of age and since this la=
w was passed, there have been NO drownings in the entire country due to ent=
rapments like what happened to Virginia.&nbsp;
<o:p class=3D""></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p class=3D"">&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Next, she teamed up with then Senator Joe Biden to p=
ass the Protect Our Children Act.&nbsp; This bill gave law enforcement the =
tools and resources they need to track down and prosecute criminals exploit=
ing children online.&nbsp; Even when GOP obstructionist
 number one, Tom Coburn, held up the bill, Debbie Wasserman Schultz fought =
tooth and nail to get it passed into law.&nbsp;
<o:p class=3D""></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p class=3D"">&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">In 2008, while campaigning for then Senator Barack O=
bama, she quietly faced her own personal battle with breast cancer.&nbsp; A=
fter seven surgeries, winning her own reelection, and electing the first Af=
rican American President to the White House,
 she told the world her cancer story but doing what else but holding a pres=
s conference to drop the Early Awareness and Learning Requires Young (EARLY=
) Act.&nbsp; This law provides critical funds directs the Centers for Disea=
se Control to increase knowledge that
 young women, in fact do get breast cancer and build awareness for those wo=
men who are at genetic risk for this disease.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p class=
=3D""></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p class=3D"">&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been a champion for pro=
gressive values and working families her entire career.&nbsp; She supports =
a $15 minimum wage, was a champion for the Affordable Care Act, and is the =
lead sponsor in Congress to fully fund
 the Zika virus crisis which is a major health concern in her home state of=
 Florida and across the country.&nbsp;
<o:p class=3D""></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p class=3D"">&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Michelle Obama was right: =93If you want something d=
one, give it to a busy woman.=94&nbsp; Well President Barack Obama found th=
e busiest one out there and named her DNC Chair not once, but TWICE!<o:p cl=
ass=3D""></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p class=3D"">&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Thank you for heading to Alaska, Chairwomen Wasserma=
n Schultz!&nbsp; We are so excited to have you here.&nbsp;
