Donald Trump responded to criticism from Carly Fiorina that he was touting =
in Indiana the endorsement of Mike Tyson, who was convicted of rape in the =
state.

=93Well, a lot guys have endorsed me, a lot of people,=94 Trump said on the=
 Mike Slater Show on Friday. =93I noticed that Mike Tyson endorsed me over =
the internet and we will take the endorsement.=94

=93Look, he=92s a tough cookie,=94 Trump continued. =93He had difficulty, b=
ut a lot of people had difficulty, but Mike Tyson did me endorse me. What d=
oes she want me to do, tell him I don=92t want his endorsement? Should I do=
 that? You think I should do that? I don=92t think so. So, I really know no=
thing about it other than I heard Mike Tyson endorsed me.=94

On the same show earlier in the day, and in other appearances, Fiorina had =
taken Trump to task for touting Tyson=92s endorsement.

=93I=92ll take Mike Pence over convicted rapist Mike Tyson,=94 she said. =
=93Not a tough guy, not a champ.=94

Trump defended Tyson in 1992 when he was convicted of rape (for which he sp=
ent three years in prison), saying Tyson was =93railroaded=94 in his case a=
nd suggesting the victim hadn=92t been raped at all.
