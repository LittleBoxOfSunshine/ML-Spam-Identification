                VP Stakes:

Most important thing is someone who can take over as president

Understands process and can get 100 day agenda done - cut taxes, reduce deficit, trade deals

Not gender or geography as biggest issues but who would be best partner



Five or six possibilities?

Small group of people. Trump will decide if he can work with them

Reaction to Paul Ryan?

Trump and Ryan have lots in common - balanced budget, tax cuts to middle class. Everyone in GOP agrees. How we get there? Not sure



Sabotage by Ryan?

Trump nominee, he will be head of party. Important to understand he sets the agenda in November and onward



Team is bigger now

-Small but efficient. More delegates, going to be nominee, but you have to grow. We're going after Clinton machine. Candidate Trump will expand the map. We're putting new states in play, MI, NY, MA, Indiana. In Washington state, he had 22,000. Message is resonating.



Rick Perry was on. Said supporting Trump no-brainer. Team of governors - one of them maybe? Team of rivals for SOS, Defense?

I don't want to get too far ahead of it. Great governors out there who are CEO of states. Need to follow that model, like Rick Scott in Florida. Jindal in Louisiana. Something to be said for balanced budget requirements.



Two areas where conservatism federally successful, under Reagan and under Gingrich contract. People feel betrayed by DC. Time for a national campaign where everyone runs on set of principals?

Good idea but you have to understand DC broken for 30 years. Reason Trump successful is because blue collar people want change. Trump can fundamentally change system. Trump has raised issues where opponents said you can't do that, but then they all take his side 3 weeks later.



When Trump said I'll announce 14 people for Supreme Court to show conservatives he is serious, wouldn't that give people comfort knowing what will happen in first 100 days?

He's laid out priorities on the campaign trail. He's done more events and media than anyone. Laid out people he would consider - Pryor, Diane Sykes (sp?). Difference is we have presidential candidates that can appoint up to 5 justices that can fundamentally change the way America works. It's not up to judges to legislate from bench.
