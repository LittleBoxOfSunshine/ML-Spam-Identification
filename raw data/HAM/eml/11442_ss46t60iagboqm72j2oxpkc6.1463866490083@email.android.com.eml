Dear Luis,
It was a pleasure to meet you and Debbie at the Alaska Democratic Conventio=
n dinner last week. Did you get the DVD copy of =93Statehood!=94 that I lef=
t for you at the Historic Anchorage Hotel?
In our brief conversation Debbie seemed fascinated to learn about the criti=
cal and decisive role played by then-Senate Majority Leader, Lyndon Baines =
Johnson and Speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn in securing passage of the Al=
aska Statehood Act. Their important role is little known today, even up her=
e.
I=92d be flattered if someday Debbie viewed the entire two-hour show. Howev=
er, understanding that she=92s going to have little time for non-critical t=
asks these days, may I suggest that she can use the Chapter Menu at the ope=
ning of the DVD program to jump right to sections that cover passage of the=
 Bill and the Texans=92 role in it.
First there is a brief discussion of the political backdrop created by the =
national Civil Rights movement and Dixiecrat opposition to Alaska statehood=
. Find this by selecting =93Part One Chapter Menu,=94 then Chapter 13: =93D=
ixiecrats.=94 The story quickly moves on to President Eisenhower=92s ambiva=
lence about statehood.
Passage of the Alaska Statehood Act and the role of Johnson and Rayburn spa=
ns three chapters, found in the =93Part Two Chapter Menu;=94 19, 20 and 21,=
 which combined run about seven minutes.
If viewing these chapters only, you should know that Bob Bartlett, whom the=
y reference several times, was the Territory=92s (voteless) Democratic, Del=
egate to Congress, who was enormously popular and surprisingly effective in=
 the House.
In telling the Alaska statehood story objectively there was no way to avoid=
 the conclusion that Alaska Democrats started the push for statehood and le=
d it all the way to victory. At the national level the same was true.
Best regards,

Larry Goldin
