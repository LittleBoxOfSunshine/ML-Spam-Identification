THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the First Lady

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

April 26, 2016=20



*FACT SHEET: Celebrating Progress in Expanding College Opportunity for Ev=
ery Student on College Signing Day*

Expanding opportunity for more students, especially disadvantaged student=
s, to enroll and succeed in college is vital to building a strong economy=
 and a strong middle class. The chance of a child born in the bottom hous=
ehold income quintile making it to the top quintile nearly quadruples wit=
h a college degree. Yet fewer than 10 percent of those born into low-inco=
me households earn a bachelors degree by age 25, compared with over 50 pe=
rcent of students born into upper-income households. Decades of research =
have shown how higher education offers large benefits to students in term=
s of labor market earnings, health, and happiness  and to the community a=
t large.=20

Thats why President Obama has made historic progress around college oppor=
tunity, affordability, and completion by doubling investments in Pell Gra=
nts and tax credits; made student loans more affordable by cutting intere=
st rates and allowing borrowers to cap student loan payments at 10 percen=
t of income; made access to financial aid and college information simpler=
 and faster; and promoted innovation and competition to bring down costs =
and improve college quality. Today, more students are graduating college =
than ever, and student loan defaults, delinquencies, and forbearances are=
 on the decline. Through the President and First Ladys Call-to-Action on =
College Opportunity, hundreds of schools, organizations, and counselors h=
ave reported that they have already helped students access more than $5 b=
illion in financial aid, enrolling 1 million more students in college, an=
d setting 10 million more students on track to complete on time within th=
e decade.=20

The Administration and the country have made significant progress to ensu=
re more students can access an affordable, high-quality college education=
 and succeed. Each spring, however, the buzz around the thousands of stud=
ent-athletes deciding where to play college football overshadows the mome=
ntous decision tens of millions of students make to pursue a postsecondar=
y degree. Working hard in school should be celebrated just as much as wor=
king hard on the field. That is why First Lady Michelle Obama will be cel=
ebrating National College Signing Day [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/=
default/files/docs/national_college_signing_day_emessage.pdf ] as part of=
 her Better Make Room [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/=
10/19/fact-sheet-first-lady-announces-better-make-room-campaign ] campaig=
n. Last October, as part of her Reach Higher [ https://www.reachhigher.go=
v/ ] initiative, the First Lady launched Better Make Room, a public aware=
ness campaign targeted at Generation Z, or young people ages 14-19, to ce=
lebrate education, change the national conversation, and give students th=
e tools and resources they need  from the FAFSA [ https://fafsa.ed.gov/ ]=
 to the College Scorecard [ http://collegescorecard.ed.gov/ ]  to continu=
e their education past high school. The Better Make Room campaign engages=
 actors, singers, and sports icons in celebrating students for pursuing t=
heir higher education.=20

During her College Signing Day event, the First Lady will honor graduatin=
g high school seniors who will go on to pursue a postsecondary degree. Du=
ring her College Signing Day [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-offic=
e/2016/04/11/first-lady-michelle-obama-host-2016-college-signing-day-even=
t-new-york ] event at New York Citys Harlem Armory, the First Lady will c=
elebrate college enrollment and success alongside more than 4,000 high sc=
hool students. In addition, over 1,000 communities around the country wil=
l host College Signing Day events to celebrate student success. Mrs. Obam=
a first announced her Reach Higher initiative at a College Signing Day ev=
ent in San Antonio, TX in 2014, and last year led a call to action culmin=
ating in 600 events around the country and her own celebration on Detroit=
, MI. On April 29, Education Secretary John B. King Jr. will give remarks=
 in Washington, D.C. at the College Signing Day celebration hosted by the=
 Office of the State Superintendent of Education.

*Ensuring Every Student has a Fair Shot at a High-Quality Education*

Today, we celebrate not only the start of a college education for many st=
udents, but also the progress that our nation has made to ensure that all=
 hard-working students have a fair shot at earning their degrees and cred=
entials. Thats why the President set a north-star goal for the country to=
 once again lead the world in college attainment. To achieve this bold go=
al for college completion, ensure that Americas students and workers rece=
ive the education and training needed for the jobs of today and tomorrow,=
 and provide more security for the middle class, this Administration has =
worked to make college more accessible, affordable, and attainable for al=
l American families.

 *_Making College More Affordable by Doubling Investments in Pell and Tax=
 Credits._*_ _Since the President took office, we have increased the maxi=
mum Pell [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/25/fact-sh=
eet-how-recovery-act-helped-save-us-second-great-depression-and ] award b=
y over $1,000, and for the first time, tied aid to inflation to maintain =
its value. These efforts have cut the cost of college [ https://www.white=
house.gov/sites/default/files/docs/150507_final_-_state-by-state_progress=
_report_on_college_affordability.pdf ] by about $3,700 for over 8 million=
 students last year, and resulted in 2 million additional Pell Grants awa=
rded to students each year since the President took office. This Administ=
ration also established the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), which=
 provides a maximum credit of $2,500 per yearor up to $10,000 over four y=
earsto expand and replace the Hope higher education credit. The bipartisa=
n tax and budget agreement signed into law in December 2015 made the AOTC=
 permanent. In 2016, the AOTC will cut taxes by over $1,800, on average, =
for nearly 10 million families.=20



 *_Making the FAFSA Available Earlier and a New College Scorecard to Supp=
ort Families to Make Strong College Choices. _*To help more students acce=
ss over $180 billion available annually in Federal financial aid and mill=
ions more in state, institutional, and private scholarships, this Adminis=
tration has simplified the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFS=
A) and cut the time it takes to complete the form by two-thirds. To furth=
er streamline and simplify the financial aid process [ https://www.whiteh=
ouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/14/fact-sheet-president%E2%80%99s-plan-=
early-financial-aid-improving-college-choice ], the Administration has ma=
de the form available 3 months earlier  starting on October 1, 2016  to e=
nsure students can apply for aid earlier and have the most accurate finan=
cial aid eligibility information through the FAFSA [ https://fafsa.ed.gov=
/ ] and College Scorecard [ http://collegescorecard.ed.gov/ ] when it mat=
ters most, as they search for, apply to, and select a college.



 *_Improving College Choice and Performance. _*For the first time, studen=
ts and their families have access to comprehensive reliable data on colle=
ge costs, graduation rates, loan repayment rates, and labor market outcom=
es in one easily accessible source. Students can use the College Scorecar=
d [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/12/fact-sheet-emp=
owering-students-choose-college-right-them ] to find a good-value school =
where they can pursue their educational and career goals while others in =
the public  policymakers, schools, parents, teachers, researchers  can us=
e the data to help support colleges in improving their performance and se=
rving students better.



This Administration has also worked to ensure schools are accountable to =
the public and that they serve students well. These efforts include crack=
ing down on career colleges with unscrupulous practices; since 2009, fina=
ncial aid going to for-profits has decreased by 36 percent while enrollme=
nt at those institutions has dropped 25 percent. These complete efforts t=
o create pathways to allow defrauded students to get loan relief, and imp=
lementing the Gainful Employment [ http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/=
obama-administration-announces-final-rules-protect-students-poor-performi=
ng-career-college-programs ] rules that require poor-performing programs =
at career collegeswhich are currently leaving over 800,000 students with =
debts they cannot affordto either improve performance or lose eligibility=
 for federal financial aid; and advancing legislation that would reward c=
olleges that successfully enroll and graduate students from all backgroun=
ds through the College Opportunity and Graduation Bonus program, which wo=
uld recognize and provide a bonus to high-performing colleges that enroll=
 and graduate a significant number of low- and moderate-income students, =
as demonstrated by high graduation rates for Pell Grant recipients and lo=
w cohort default rates, and encourage all institutions to improve their p=
erformance.=20



 *_Strengthening Community Colleges. _*The Administration also recognizes=
 that Americas more than 1,100 community colleges, serving 43 percent of =
all undergraduates, are the backbone of the nations postsecondary educati=
on and training system and are critical to ensuring all Americans have an=
 opportunity to earn a quality, affordable degree or credential. This is =
why President Obama announced Americas College Promise [ https://www.whit=
ehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/09/fact-sheet-white-house-unveils-ame=
rica-s-college-promise-proposal-tuitio ] to make two years of community c=
ollege free for hard-working students in his 2015 State of the Union. Sin=
ce then, Sen. Baldwin (WI) and Rep. Bobby Scott (VA) introduced Americas =
College Promise Act of 2015 at the federal level while at least 25 new st=
ates, communities, and schools are driving progress [ https://www.whiteho=
use.gov/sites/default/files/docs/progressreportoncommunitycollege.pdf ] b=
y announcing their own free community college programs. Administration ha=
s also invested $70 billion in community colleges through Pell Grants, Ti=
tle III, Title V, and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College a=
nd Career Training program. Building on these investments, the White Hous=
e announced $100 million in Americas Promise Grants [ https://www.whiteho=
use.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/25/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-new-1=
00-million-competition-expand ] to expand tuition-free community college =
programs that connect Americans to in-demand jobs.



 *_Empowering More Students to Earn College Degrees. _*This Administratio=
n has worked to open more doors to students, particularly for non-traditi=
onal, low-income, and underrepresented students. Since the President took=
 office, over one million more black and Hispanic students enrolled in co=
llege. More independent students, older students, and parents are also en=
rolling in college for the first time. Meanwhile, more students are gradu=
ating college than ever before; there have already been well over 27 mill=
ion college degrees and credentials awarded since the President took offi=
ce. Building on this record, the Administration proposed new Pell investm=
ents [ http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-helping-more-amer=
icans-complete-college-new-proposals-success ] to help students accelerat=
e progress towards their degrees and increase their likelihood of on-time=
 completion. These two proposals include Pell for Accelerated Completion,=
 which would allow full-time students to take courses in a third semester=
, and On-Track Pell Bonus, which offers $300 for students to take 15-cred=
its, which would accelerate progress towards a degree. To further decreas=
e costs and increase completion rates, the Administration has encouraged =
greater innovation and a stronger evidence base around effective strategi=
es to promote college success through 42 First in the World grants that f=
und and test interventions and 15 experimental sites that pilot reforms t=
o existing higher education policies.=20



 *_Ensuring Every Student Has the Resources to Manage Her Debt Successful=
ly. _*This Administration recognizes that ensuring all students have the =
opportunity to invest in their education requires a student loan system t=
hat is both affordable and easy to navigate. This is why we have eliminat=
ed subsidies to banks making student loans and transitioned to 100 percen=
t Direct Loans, reinvesting billions into the Federal Pell Grant program =
and strengthening the financial aid infrastructure. To ensure student loa=
ns are manageable, the Administration has cut student loan interest rates=
, saving a typical student $1,000 over the life of loans borrowed this ye=
ar, and began implementing the Student Aid Bill of Rights [ https://www.w=
hitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/10/fact-sheet-student-aid-bill-rig=
hts-taking-action-ensure-strong-consumer- ] to strengthen loan servicing =
and make it easier for students to access the information they need to ch=
oose repayment plans. The Administration has also capped student loan pay=
ments at 10 percent of income for current and future students through the=
 Pay As You Earn repayment plan. Already, nearly 5 million Direct Loan bo=
rrowers have enrolled in income-driven repayment plans  including Pay As =
you Earn  a 140 percent increase from December 2013. Meanwhile, defaults,=
 delinquencies, and forbearances are on the decline.=20



*Celebrating Progress on College Opportunity under the President and Firs=
t Ladys Call to Action*

Each students success is a result of collective effort; it is possible fo=
r students to reach this significant milestone of choosing a college when=
 they and countless others in the communityfamily, friends, teachers, cou=
nselors, schools, colleges, policymakers, and higher education organizati=
onsjoin in the efforts to make each educational opportunity count. Thats =
why we are also celebrating College Opportunity commitment-makers tremend=
ous progress and unity around making a college degree more within reach f=
or students.=20

As part of the White House College Opportunity Days of Action on January =
16, 2014 [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/16/fact-sh=
eet-president-and-first-lady-s-call-action-college-opportunity ] and Dece=
mber 4, 2014 [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/12/04/pre=
sident-and-first-lady-s-call-action-college-opportunity ], the President =
and First Lady announced over 700 commitments to expand opportunity for m=
ore students to enroll and succeed in college. Collectively, these effort=
s will substantially grow the number of college graduates; expand student=
s college opportunities and support them to make strong college choices t=
hat meet fit their educational goals and career aspirations; and strength=
en the pipeline to college and improve college remediation to ensure stud=
ents from all backgrounds are prepared to succeed in college.=20

Altogether, the collective actions taken by college and system presidents=
, education and community leaders, and organizations have accelerated pro=
gress [ http://go.wh.gov/Q6D96a ] in supporting students to and through c=
ollege. These commitments have already:


  * *_Increased the number of college graduates:_** *These new networks o=
f colleges and organizations are devoted to producing more college gradua=
tes who are career-ready and are defining plans to help hundreds of thous=
ands more students complete a college degree or credential by 2025.

These commitment-makers report already setting more than 10 million stude=
nts on track to graduate on time by 2025, which would help those families=
 save at least $2 billion on tuition collectively. A significant part of =
these efforts involve reforms to remediation, which are already on track =
to save over 350,000 students from taking remediation courses unnecessari=
ly.=20


  * *_Enhanced College Readiness Through K-16 Partnerships:_* Partnership=
s among high schools, community colleges, and four-year colleges and univ=
ersities are setting goals and pursuing collaborative strategies to help =
over 100,000 more students become college-ready by tying together academi=
c expectations, student support systems, and community resources.

Already, the commitment-makers report adding $135 million in new investme=
nts to higher education to strengthen collective work on college access, =
affordability, and success. The work of all commitment-makers has catalyz=
ed more than 40,000 new partnerships between high schools, colleges, coun=
selors, access groups, non-profits, and businesses.


  * *_Improved Access to Highly Trained School Counselors:_*__Tens of tho=
usands more students will gain access to high-quality college advising th=
rough the training of more than 5,000 school counselors and advisors in h=
igh-need districts and schools.

Commitment-makers reported helping students submit at least 1 million add=
itional FAFSAs and access more than $5 billion in financial aid, and expe=
ct to multiply this impact ten-fold by 2025. Commitment-makers also repor=
ted helping students submit at least 6 million more college applications,=
 and enrolling about 1 million more students in college.=20

 *_Strengthened STEM Education:_*__ Institutions and organizations have m=
ade more than 100 individual commitments towards the Presidents goals to =
graduate an additional 1 million STEM graduates and prepare 100,000 excel=
lent K-12 STEM teachers over a decade.=20

*__*

Over 45 institutions reported that they have set an additional 100,000 ST=
EM majors on track to graduate, which projects to graduating 600,000 more=
 STEM majors by 2025.



*Sustained Efforts to Expand College Opportunity and Increase Student Suc=
cess*

New efforts to expand college opportunity include:**

 *_More Exposure to College Campuses that Serve Students Well. _*As part =
of its mission to organize the world's information and make it universall=
y accessible and useful, Google is making over 100 college and career tou=
rs available through Google Expeditions starting today. In collaboration =
with the First Lady's Reach Higher initiative, students can virtually vis=
it college campuses all across the country, making them more accessible t=
o students everywhere. Students can also take Career Expeditions to help =
them explore future careers by showing them a virtual day in the life of =
professionals including a computer scientist, veterinarian, and many more=
. Teachers can choose from a library of more than 150 Expeditions, making=
 them easy to incorporate into existing curriculum. Schools can sign up t=
o bring Google Expeditions to their schools.



 *_Direct Engagement to Ensure Every Student Can Access Better Informatio=
n to Select and Enroll in College._*Admissions officers from the Coalitio=
n for Access, Affordability, and Success  a group of nearly 100 diverse i=
nstitutions united in improving the college admissions process for all st=
udents  will conduct outreach at 500 high schools, community-based organi=
zations, and community librarieswhere their students and other local comm=
unity college students can benefit significantly from early engagement an=
d greater support in the college preparation process. These college appli=
cation outreach sessions willbe offered this summer and fall and willincl=
ude tutorials on applying for Federal financial aid and using tools like =
the College Scorecard to find good-value schools.



 *_Access to Mentors and a Support Network_**. *Salesforce.org is committ=
ing to developing and bringing to market a unique mobile and social mento=
rship solution to drive higher student admission and graduation rates. Wi=
th a focus on driving long-term student success, the app will give studen=
ts the ability to connect with a network that will demonstrate the behavi=
ors, skills and practices needed to succeed in post-secondary education a=
nd beyond. A prototype of the application was created by Salesforce.org i=
n collaboration with teachers and counselors as part of First Lady Michel=
le Obama's Reach Higher initiative.



 *_Better College Preparation Resources and College Application Support_*=
*. *This year, ACT will provide millions of students and families with in=
formation and tips to prepare for college. ACTs commitment to equity in l=
earning can be found in its efforts to increase access to ACT resourcesth=
rough ACT testing fee-waivers, free ACT Kaplan Online Prep Live and ACT O=
nline Prep for low-income students, and free ACT Profile accounts, where =
students, families and educators can use free digital tools to help stude=
nts plan and prepare for college and career readiness and success.=20



 *_Early Access to Financial Aid. _*Raise.me is a social enterprise focus=
ed on expanding access to higher education by improving the impact of fin=
ancial aid. Rather than waiting until the end of high school to earn scho=
larships, which often happens too late to impact a student's college ambi=
tions or choices, Raise.me enables students to earn scholarships from nea=
rly 150 partner colleges, starting as early as 9th grade, for doing what =
best prepares them to succeed, whether thats getting good grades, volunte=
ering in the community or joining an extracurricular activity. As part of=
 College Signing Day, Raise.me has committed to serving over 250,000 low =
income, minority and first generation students during the 2016-2017 acade=
mic year and will launch a new dashboard for community-based organization=
s that work with students on college preparedness.=20



 *_Financial Literacy and More College Savings. _*Napkin Finance breaks d=
own financial concepts in a simple, engaging, and visual way in 30 second=
s or less. Most importantly, it teaches teens and young adults how to mak=
e smart money decisions and build a lifetime of financial well-being. For=
 the First Ladys Better Make Room initiative, Napkin Finance has created =
a course with napkins that prepare students for the financial challenges =
of a college education. The Better Make Room collaboration with Napkin Fi=
nance will inspire and empower teens to fill out the FAFSA, learn more ab=
out options for paying for college, understand how student loans work, an=
d encourage ongoing engagement with the Reach Higher platform.



 *_More Inclusive Communities_**. *Facing History and Ourselves works to =
end bigotry through education, reaching more than 4 million secondary sch=
ool students each year across the globe. Facing History and Reach Higher =
will partner around their shared mission of empowering U.S. high school s=
tudents to create a better future for themselves and their communities. I=
n Fall 2016, we will launch a co-branded national public service announce=
ment campaign to showcase inspiring students who've learned that they can=
 make a difference in the world and plan to continue their education as a=
 means of doing so. The organizations will also partner to involve high s=
chool students in online games and activities through Facing History and =
the First Lady's Better Make Room campaign.

 *_Civic-Minded Students Dedicated to Public Service. _*The Corporation f=
or National and Community Service (CNCS), the Jefferson Awards Foundation=
 (JAF), and PVBLIC have partnered to develop a digital campaign highlight=
ing public service as a pathway to higher education that supports the Bet=
ter Make Room campaign. Students involved in youth programs with Jefferso=
n Awards Foundation and CNCS Stars of Service will be featured in PSA's d=
eveloped by PVBLIC. JAFs Students In Action program powers teenagers to d=
iscover their public service passions and have maximum measurable impact.=
 More than 4,000 students are trained each year with leadership training =
using civic engagement as a pathway to success in life. 99% of SIA studen=
ts graduate high school, and 71% go to four year colleges. JAFs GlobeChan=
gers and LEAD360 youth programs also engage students in public service an=
d put them on the path to higher education. CNCS, the Federal agency that=
 engages millions of Americans in service and in developing community sol=
utions through AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, and the Social Innovation Fund, =
administers Stars of Service, an award launched by President Obama to rec=
ognize young people who are outstanding examples of volunteering and serv=
ice.



 *_Spreading the College Signing Day Message. _*American Eagle Outfitters=
, a global specialty retailer offering high-quality, on-trend clothing, a=
ccessories and personal care products, will feature the College Signing D=
ay on its digital billboards in Times Square and will help spread the wor=
d to target demographics during the event across its social platforms. Th=
ese efforts builds on American Eagle Outfitters' strong commitment to you=
th empowerment and education.

 *_Making Room for College Dreams. _*College visits, freshman orientation=
 and graduation ceremonies are important milestones in any students life,=
 especially for low-income and first-generation college students. Unfortu=
nately, many high school students lack the support network and financial =
resources required to achieve these milestones. Thats why Airbnb is teami=
ng up with Better Make Room and youth development organizations like Summ=
er Search and United Negro College Fund to help remove these hidden barri=
ers and travel costs associated with attending college. In 2015, Airbnb b=
egan working with Summer Search to provide free accommodations for studen=
ts and their families who are visiting colleges, attending freshman orien=
tation weekends, and going to graduation ceremonies. Initially focused on=
 serving students in New York and San Francisco, Airbnb is expanding the =
program in 2016 to reach all Summer Search students in Seattle, Boston, P=
hiladelphia, New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area. In addition, A=
irbnb in partnership with United Negro College Fund, will provide UNCF sc=
holars and their families with free accommodations for freshman move-in w=
eekends. Freshman orientation weekend is a particularly critical time of =
transition for any student  especially for those who are the first in the=
ir family to attend college or those that have not travelled extensively =
beyond their hometown or neighborhood. Airbnb and UNCF will launch these =
efforts for students starting classes at Historically Black Colleges and =
Universities (HBCUs) in Atlanta, Georgia.



 *_Stronger Support for Teachers. _*Dozens of Facebook employees have wor=
ked with Reach Higher, IDEO's Teacher's Guild, and other leading nonprofi=
ts to develop new solutions for teachers to help students get to and thro=
ugh college. Facebook employees provided engineering, design, and busines=
s support to teachers from across the country. Facebook will also host a =
hack-a-thon to bring the top ideas to life.

is vital to building a strong economy and a strong
 middle class.&nbsp; The chance of a child born in the bottom household inc=
ome quintile making it to the top quintile nearly quadruples with a college=
 degree. Yet fewer than 10 percent of those born into low-income households=
 earn a bachelor&#8217;s degree by age 25,
 compared with over 50 percent of students born into upper-income household=

and promoted innovation and competition
 to bring down costs and improve college quality. Today, more students are =
graduating college than ever, and student loan defaults, delinquencies, and=
 forbearances are on the decline. Through the President and First Lady&#821=

 hundreds of schools, organizations, and counselors have reported that they=
 have already helped students access more than $5 billion in financial aid,=
 enrolling 1 million more students in college, and setting 10 million more =
