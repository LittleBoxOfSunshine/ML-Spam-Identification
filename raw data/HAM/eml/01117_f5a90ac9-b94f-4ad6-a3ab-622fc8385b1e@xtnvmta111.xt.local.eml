2016 Nerdcast: Is Trump really making nice with the GOP?
By Kristin Roberts, Kenneth P. Vogel, Eli Stokols, Charlie Mahtesian and Scott Bland
05/13/2016 05:48 AM EDT


It's time for Episode 2 of the "2016 Nerdcast," POLITICO's new podcast on the race for the White House. Tune in each week to geek out with us as we dive deep into this amazing presidential race, the latest numbers that actually matter, plus backstage dope on how politics really works. We're the kind of folks who like to spend our Friday nights poring over poll numbers or the latest Federal Election Commission reports - so if you want to understand how the modern politics game is played, this is the podcast for you.

(Subscribe to the 2016 Nerdcast on iTunes or download from Soundcloud here.)

In this week's episode, national editor Kristin Roberts, senior investigative reporter Ken Vogel, senior political correspondent Eli Stokols, senior politics editor Charlie Mahtesian, and campaigns editor Scott Bland discuss Donald Trump's fraught relations with the Republican National Committee and his calculations about picking a running mate, Hillary Clinton's inability to put away Bernie Sanders, and the polls that may or may not show a general-election race that's tighter than anyone thought.

Podcast produced by Matthew Sobocinski.
