sked about Clinton bringing up his comments on the "woman card." "And I kno=
w a lot of people would say you can't say that about a woman, because of co=
urse a woman doesn't shout. But the way she shouted that message was not =
=E2=80=94 that's the way she said it, and I guess I'll have to get used to =
a lot of that over the next four or five months."
