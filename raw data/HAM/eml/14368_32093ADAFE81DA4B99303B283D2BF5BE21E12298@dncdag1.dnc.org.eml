REUTERS // LAWRENCE WILKERSON

President George W. Bush left office in January 2009 with some of the lowes=
t poll numbers ever recorded. Nowhere were his policies more reviled than i=
n foreign policy. U.S. global leadership had suffered severely during his a=
dministration, and voters, well aware of the damage to America's reputation=
 and the enormous addition to the national debt, handed the White House to =
the Democrats.

So why are so many of the candidates for the 2016 Republican presidential n=
omination rushing to revive the exact same Bush-era approach to internation=
al affairs?

The best case in point is the recently concluded Iran nuclear deal. The agr=
eement blocks any path to an Iranian bomb, establishes unprecedented verifi=
cation procedures, largely eliminates Iran's enriched uranium and sharply c=
urtails Tehran's other nuclear research.

In the Bush administration, there was a definite preference for unilateral =
action - international cooperation was downplayed. The White House undertoo=
k the major foreign-policy gamble of the new century - invading Iraq - almo=
st alone.

By contrast, President Barack Obama chose diplomacy with Iran to make clear=
 to the world that such unilateralism had ended. His administration slowly =
and painstakingly built a sanctions regime that brought to bear the combine=
d power of the world's major economies and dozens of other countries. It wa=
s a slower, more methodical approach.

Though most now agree that "crippling sanctions" brought Iran to the negoti=
ating table, many tend to gloss over the fact that it was diplomatic engage=
ment - not unilateral action - that made the sanctions possible and produce=
d the agreement. We should also not forget that many of the current opponen=
ts of the agreement strongly opposed the diplomatic effort to build that in=
ternational consensus.

Yet leading Republican candidates are now struggling to outdo one another o=
ver who would abandon U.S. allies first. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker ha=
s implied that military action might be required on "Day One" of his presid=
ency. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has implied that it might take a lit=
tle longer. There's little sign that either of them realize the critical im=
portance of Washington leading an international effort.

And if U.S. allies are of little importance to these candidates, internatio=
nal institutions like the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency=
 appear to be held in even lower esteem. In denouncing the pact with Iran, =
despite its unprecedented verification and enforcement provisions, several =
candidates declared their outrage over the fact that the atomic energy agen=
cy was responsible for the details of inspections. Given that the agreement=
 was successfully negotiated by all the permanent members of the United Nat=
ions Security Council, it was expected that critical enforcement of the agr=
eement would be managed by the atomic energy agency.

All this brings to mind George W. Bush's similar dismissal of existing inte=
rnational institutions. For example, when the head of the U.N. inspectors i=
n Iraq, Hans Blix, reported in early 2003 that he had doubts about the pres=
ence of weapons of mass destruction there, and that, in any event, a few mo=
re months of inspections would settle the issue, Bush disregarded his couns=
el and invaded Iraq. We all know now that there were no WMD in Iraq.

In stark contrast to that foreign-policy disaster, the Iran agreement has t=
he unanimous support of the Security Council, as well as backing from major=
 economic powers, including Germany, India and Japan. This week, the Gulf C=
ooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qat=
ar and the United Arab Emirates, joined Egypt in fully endorsing the deal.

The value of this global support is immeasurable. It is a force multiplier =
of enormous consequence. By contrast, if the deal is abandoned, and the Uni=
ted States finds itself moving toward war with Iran, Washington should expe=
ct to fight that war alone. Even if America does not bomb or invade Iran, i=
t would still be a pariah because the other countries will resume relations=
 without Washington - again relegating the United States to lower status in=
 the world.

For decades, the Republican Party - my party - was widely viewed as a party=
 of wise and thoughtful national-security leadership. That brand was severe=
ly damaged by the Bush administration. It now appears that the field of Rep=
ublican presidential candidates is looking to make that damage permanent.
