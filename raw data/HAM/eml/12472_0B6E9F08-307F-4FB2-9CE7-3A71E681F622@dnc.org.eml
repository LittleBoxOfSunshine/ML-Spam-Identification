BI writing a story on cable news and the politics of 2016, with a focus on booking. To this end they called me and Anna Sugg (RNC's booker). The inspiration for the story came when they noticed DWS, Luis, Reince, Spicer were on different networks at the same time two weeks ago. They want to include photos and videos from what we and RNC think of as our best hits. I have some ideas for the photoshoot.
