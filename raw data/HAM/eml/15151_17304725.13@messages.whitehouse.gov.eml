Pool Report #7

=20

Pool escorted into a most unusual state dinner just before 9. It was not =
in the State dining room but rather in a tent under the stars on the Sout=
h Lawn. Calling this expansive (albeit temporary) structure a tent is lik=
e calling a Pyramid a tool shed. The vaulting ceiling plexiglass panels h=
ad holiday-style lights strung beneath them and the trees above were illu=
minated by spotlights outside. Quite a sight.

Per White House, this is the headtable:

THE PRESIDENT and MRS. OBAMA

HIS EXCELLENCY SAULI NIINIST, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FINLAND

MRS. JENNI HAUKIO

HER EXCELLENCY ERNA SOLBERG, PRIME MINISTER OF NORWAY

MR. SINDRE FINNES

HIS EXCELLENCY STEFAN LFVEN, PRIME MINISTER OF SWEDEN

MRS. ULLA LFVEN

HIS EXCELLENCY LARS LKKE RASMUSSEN, PRIME MINISTER OF DENMARK

MRS. SLRUN LKKE RASMUSSEN

HIS EXCELLENCY SIGURUR INGI JHANNSSON, PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF =
ICELAND

MRS. INGIBJRG ELSA INGJALDSDTTIR

=20

The president started off the evening's round of toasts with a riff on Vi=
kings, contrasting their raucous behavior of centuries gone by with the m=
odesty and politeness of today's Nordic population.

(Check transcript) ``We can all admit the Vikings could be a little rough=
. They didn't have the best manners at the dining table. Their outfits we=
ren't always appropriate. But times have changed. And tonight our Nordic =
friends are much better behaved.''

He quoted an old Norse saying and couldn't keep from laughing as he descr=
ibed one of Norway's favorite TV shows, ``National Firewood Night.''=20

It's ``logs burning for hours . . .and hours. It's crazy,'' the president=
 said. But he quickly added that all the Nordic countries are orderly and=
 clean, and they have an argument going on over ``which country is happie=
st.'' They've even debated the hometown of Santa Claus, he added.

But then the jokes ended and the president got serious. ``We stand togeth=
er so our citizens can live together in peace.'' He reiterated common int=
erests in education and fighting climate change. He also talked about Nor=
dic influence on the famous Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, which wa=
s a training ground for a generation of civil rights champions including =
Ralph Abernathy, John Lewis and MLK himself. The president said he himsel=
f would not be standing there if it were not for ``the ripple effect'' of=
 the teachings and philosophy of such places.

He reiterated his ``punch above their weight'' line about the Nordic coun=
tries' values and contributions. He toasted common values and equality fo=
r all, finishing with ``Skoll, cheers!''

The Prime Minister of Iceland, SIGURUR INGI JHANNSSON, had a funny line a=
bout strong connections to the U.S., and values and culture that ``yes, s=
ometimes includes artists in swan dresses.''

But the Prime Minister of Denmark LARS LKKE RASMUSSEN, brought the house =
down. He teased President Obama about the ``punching above its weight'' l=
ine, saying that ``after tonight's dinner, we will all step up to a new w=
eight class.''=20

He went through the various artists in America of Nordic dissent, includi=
ng Scarlet Johansen and Matt Damon. But he slyly left Norway out and when=
 he finally came around to them, he said: ``Well, they gave you Karl Rove=
!''

He paid the president the ultimate compliment by saying ``you're the best=
 president you (the U.S.) ever had.'' He hinted at his admiration for ``t=
he Donald'' before revealing he was talking about Donald Tusk, the Polish=
 president of the European Council.

When he finished, POTUS paid him the ultimate compliment: ``I think we ju=
st identified the next comic for the White House Correspondents Dinner.''=
