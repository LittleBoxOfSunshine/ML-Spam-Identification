Notes
Strength, creative problem solving and analysis
Weakness, emotional involvement in work- can get focused on a mistake and not brush it off as needed
5 years, I can see several paths (politics, finance, music) but this experience would provide an invaluable source of development toward any of those
Me, I've always balanced music and academia, and more recently politics. Each has benefited the other and I believe it's vital to my growth professionally to continue to challenge myself to think in new ways
You, I would like to know more about the organization and how the unit functions. Have their been difficulties in the past? What do you consider the most important aspects of the job and traits of the candidate?
