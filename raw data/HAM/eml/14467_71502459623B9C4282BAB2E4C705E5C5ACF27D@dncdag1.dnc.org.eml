Guest Opinion: Hawkeyes know the real Rand Paul<http://www.dailyiowan.com/2=
015/04/10/Opinions/41710.html>
THE DAILY IOWAN // CARTER BELL

This week, newly declared Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul will =
bring his announcement tour to the University of Iowa. The stop is as much =
about Iowa's status as the home of the first caucuses as it is an acknowled=
gement of the critical role students and young voters will play in next yea=
r's election. But despite his posturing, Sen. Paul is the wrong candidate t=
o deliver a message that appeals to young voters.

The amount of praise being heaped on Paul for his attempt to reach out to y=
oung voters far exceeds anything he's actually done to earn it. In fact, hi=
s actions are noteworthy only because of how rare it is to find anything - =
whether in Paul's record or from Republicans generally - that isn't at odds=
 with our priorities and values. It only takes a glance at Paul's record to=
 see why a President Paul is the last thing we need.

Most of us are here, at least in part, because we've been told our entire l=
ives how important it is to go to college and get a good education. It's li=
kely that at some point, somebody imparted on you that higher education is =
the key to achieving the American dream. But Paul wants to undermine the fi=
nancial support that brings that dream within reach.

He called a plan to help graduates refinance their student loans - the same=
 way our parents can refinance their mortgages - a threat to the "stability=
" and "fabric" of society. And he doesn't believe in investing in federal s=
tudent grants. His budget proposals would freeze Pell Grants at levels not =
seen since some of us were still in middle school.

How can Republicans such as Paul talk about investing in our future when th=
ey would put us at a financial disadvantage before we even start our career=
s?

Paul doesn't respect the issues we care about, either.

Name a problem in our society, and odds are you can find some convoluted th=
ink piece pinning the blame for it on millennials. But how often do we get =
credit for the positive work our generation is doing to reshape our society=
 as one that is more tolerant and accepting?

It's extraordinary how much progress has been made toward LGBT equality in =
just a few short years. That progress was hard fought after decades of stru=
ggles, but Paul wants to throw it all away. He's said the concept of same-s=
ex marriage "offends" him, and he literally doesn't believe in the concept =
of "gay rights" because he thinks it means handing out "rights based on you=
r behavior."

He's also terrible on women's rights. It's not just abortion; his strong su=
pport of personhood legislation could lead to a ban on common forms of birt=
h control. These are health-care decisions that should be made between a wo=
man and her doctor, not politicians such as Rand Paul in Washington. He als=
o opposed the Violence Against Women Act and compared equal-pay legislation=
 to Soviet Russia.

Paul keeps telling us that he's a different type of Republican. But he want=
s to cut funding for higher education to pay for a "flat tax" that would me=
an huge tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. On social issues, he wou=
ld drag us back to the 1950s. That doesn't sound like a new type of Republi=
can to me; it sounds like more of the failed old policies that would hurt c=
ollege students and our country.

Carter Bell, president
University of Iowa Democrats
