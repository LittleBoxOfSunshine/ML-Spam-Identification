DNC Chair Statement on Tonight=92s Primary Results



WASHINGTON - DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statem=
ent on tonight=92s Indiana primary results:



=93Tonight=92s results in Indiana are the culmination of what can only be d=
escribed as a disastrous week for the Republican Party. Clearly the GOP=92s=
 problems go well beyond their convention.



=93In just seven days, Republicans saw their former House Speaker call one =
of their candidates =91Lucifer in the flesh,=92 watched a desperate, mathem=
atically-eliminated campaign announce a Vice Presidential pick and get ridi=
culed for it, and then kicked off the Indiana primaries this morning with a=
ccusations that Ted Cruz=92s father was tied to Lee Harvey Oswald. The absu=
rdity of that last allegation was compounded by the fact that Dangerous Don=
ald Trump, who is just a hair=92s-breadth away from securing the Republican=
 nomination, based it on a tabloid story he saw in the National Enquirer.



=93No wonder the Republican Party is less popular than it=92s been in more =
than two decades. Just today, exit polls in Indiana showed that 53 percent =
of Indiana Republican primary voters say they feel betrayed by the Republic=
an Party. And in recent weeks, exit polls in primary after primary have sho=
wn that a majority of Republican voters believe their primary has been divi=
sive, with as much as a third preferring to either stay home or vote for an=
 alternative, rather than voting for their eventual nominee.



=93Meanwhile, Democratic voters are proud of their candidates and it shows =
each time they go to the polls. Last week, in Connecticut and Pennsylvania =
respectively, 67% and 71% of Democrats reported feeling energized by our pr=
imary. Today in Indiana it was three-quarters of Democratic voters who said=
 our primary has energized our party, and a majority of Democrats who voted=
 today expressed support for either one of our candidates.



=93Today it=92s clearer than ever that none of the Republican candidates ha=
s the judgment or temperament to serve as our Commander in Chief. The next =
President of the United States will be nominated at our Democratic conventi=
on in Philadelphia.=94
