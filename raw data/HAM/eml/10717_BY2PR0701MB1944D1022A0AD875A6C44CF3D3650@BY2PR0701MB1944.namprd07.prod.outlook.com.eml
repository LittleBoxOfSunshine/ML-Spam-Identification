Today in the fight for a full and functioning Supreme Court: Judiciary Chai=
rman Grassley admits that a Trump Supreme Court nominee is a "gamble," lega=
l experts and professors write to Senate leadership regarding the importanc=
e of a hearing and up-or-down vote on Chief Judge Garland's nomination, Okl=
ahoma Senators issue statement praising Chief Judge Garland's managing role=
 in the Oklahoma City bombing case, and voters continue to tell Senate Repu=
blicans to do their job. Tomorrow the Constitutional Responsibility Project=
 will host a press call announcing new recess activities and poll on Pennsy=
lvania voter attitudes.
TIME CHANGE: Friday, April 29, 2016 at 11:00 am ET, the Constitutional Resp=
onsibility Project will host a press conference call to announce its latest=
 slate of recess activities to press Senate Republicans to end their unprec=
edented Supreme Court obstructionism and give Chief Judge Garland a public =
hearing and up-or-down vote. The Constitutional Responsibility Project in c=
onjunction with Hart Research and the League of Conservation Voters will di=
scuss a new poll finding that Pennsylvanians, including a majority of indep=
endents, disagree with Senator Pat Toomey's decision to block Chief Judge M=
errick Garland from having a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote on his nom=
ination. Please RSVP to nraps@skdknick.com<mailto:nraps@skdknick.com>.
Chuck Grassley Admits It's 'A Gamble' To Let Trump Fill SCOTUS Vacancy
As reported by the Huffington Post<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chuc=
k-grassley-trump-supreme-court_us_57223b28e4b0f309baefffb3?b03lqudpu496hia4=
i>:

"Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) conceded Thursday that there's a flaw in the =
GOP's plan to block President Barack Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court: =
Who the hell would a President Donald Trump pick for the seat?"

"If Trump's elected president, it probably is a little more unknown than if=
 there's a [Sen. Ted] Cruz elected president," Grassley said Wednesday in a=
n interview with Robert Leonard of KNIA/KRLS radio in Iowa. "I would have t=
o admit it's a gamble."

Senate Republican obstruction has hit a new low.
In a statement<http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/04-28-16-leahy-stat=
ement> from Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), the Ranking Member of the Senate Jud=
iciary Committee:

Sen. Leahy: "It is our job to ensure that the Federal Judiciary - a co-equa=
l and independent branch - can perform its function under our Constitution.=
  That is not happening right now.  Vacancies have increased from 43 to 79 =
since Republicans took over the majority.  In some states, vacancies have r=
eached such high levels that it is hard to see how individuals can obtain p=
rompt justice."

After meeting with Chief Judge Merrick Garland, Sen. Nelson urges his colle=
agues to confirm Garland "as soon as possible."
The Miami Herald<http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2016/04/bill-=
nelson-meets-with-supreme-court-nominee-merrick-garland.html> reports:

Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL): "Judge Garland is obviously qualified and should b=
e confirmed as soon as possible."

Chemerinsky: The Senate cannot constitutionally refuse to act on nominees f=
or the Supreme Court.
Writing in the Orange County Register<http://www.ocregister.com/articles/co=
urt-713865-senate-supreme.html>:

Erwin Chemerinsky, Dean of the UC Irvine School of Law: "The law concerning=
 separation of powers stresses that one branch of government cannot interfe=
re with the functioning of another branch. The Senate's refusal to consider=
 Garland's nomination for the Supreme Court is very much interfering with t=
he ability of the judiciary to perform its essential constitutional roles..=
.A court with only eight justices, and for a prolonged period of time, cann=
ot perform this essential function."

Sen. Inhofe finds Chief Judge Garland to be a "likeable guy" yet continues =
to support the Senate GOP's obstruction of his nomination.
During their meeting with Chief Judge Garland yesterday, Sens. Jim Inhofe (=
R-OK) and James Lankford (R-OK) praised his service as the lead prosecutor =
in the Oklahoma City bombing case but refused to give him a hearing or up-o=
r-down vote.

Joint Statement: During our time with Judge Garland, we extended Oklahoma's=
 gratitude for the many weeks he spent in our state working for justice for=
 those who lost loved ones from the Oklahoma City bombing. [News Ok, 04/28/=
16<http://newsok.com/article/5494609>]

Law professors, legal and human rights organizations write to GOP Leadershi=
p urging them to move forward on Chief Judge Garland's nomination.

The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights: "We urge Senators not =
to be swayed by ideological extremists who have been urging this body to st=
all Judge Garland's confirmation through disingenuous and constitutionally =
unsound arguments ...To any honest observer, it is abundantly clear that Ju=
dge Garland is a highly thoughtful and well respected jurist with a rich di=
versity of experience, who will play an important role in healing a fractur=
ed Court and in protecting the rights of all Americans."[4/27/16<http://civ=
ilrightsdocs.info/pdf/policy/letters/2016/Leadership-Conference-Letter-on-G=
arland-Nomination-4-27-2016.pdf>]

West Virginia University Law Professors: "Chief Judge Garland's fitness to =
serve on the Supreme Court is unquestioned. He has more federal judicial ex=
perience than any Supreme Court nominee in history, having served the past =
19 years on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia=
 Circuit. In that time, he has demonstrated an exemplary judicial temperame=
nt, acute intelligence, and an unwavering commitment to impartiality, fairn=
ess, and the rule of law...Of course it is entirely appropriate for every s=
enator to thoroughly review Chief Judge Garland's record and qualifications=
. However, an outright refusal to even consider his nomination runs counter=
 to the Senate's obligation," [4/22/16<http://www.afj.org/wp-content/upload=
s/2016/04/WVU-Law-Professor-letter.pdf>]

National Conference of Women's Bar Associations: "The Supreme Court's inter=
pretation of the Constitution and laws that affect the legal rights of wome=
n and girls influence us for generations. It is critical for the Court to b=
e in full force, doing its job for everyone across this country... The refu=
sal to consider the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, in derogation of b=
oth history and precedent, will cause additional litigants and citizens to =
suffer needless delays and effectively eliminate each citizen's right to a =
substantive judicial decision rendered by a full Supreme Court." [4/12/16]

A look ahead:
