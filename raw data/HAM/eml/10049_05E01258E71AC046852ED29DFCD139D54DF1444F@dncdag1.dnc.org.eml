Murph, I'm proud of you and all you've accomplished. Can't wait to see what you do with this, it's exciting! I'll be back in NY soon so we can celebrate. :)

Good morning! Its official: I've left CBS and officially started a media agency here in New York. The firm, 360bespoke, will handle PR/ marketing/ branding/ unique content creation and media strategies for a small collection of clients operating in the luxury and arts space: travel, fashion and beauty, food, lifestyle, pursuits, and performers with international profiles. As many of you know those have been areas of great interest for me, whether through Watch magazine, travel writing or my own journeys around the world. I hope to harness all that I've learned in 25 years in media to offer clients unique perspectives and strategies that come with that experience.

Though we (myself and colleagues) will open our doors this fall, we've already signed up terrific clients, including: Dream, a luxury one of skin products started by London-based Deborah Mitchell; Cornelia, a global spa and wellness brand; Waldan International, the rarest and most exclusive maker of Swiss watches; Charlie Siem, the world famous 30-year-old violin virtuoso and also the face of Dior; up-and-coming Hollywood leading Dylan Bruce, an original cast member of "Orphan Black"; style icon Robert Konjic, who was discovered by Mario Testino and as Tom Ford's muse became the face of Gucci; Alexi Tavel, whose company, Two of Wands, creates knit wear for discerning clients around the world; and the non-profit Empowers Africa, a public charity that supports human empowerment, wildlife protection and land conservation in sub-Saharan Africa. I hope to announce a few more clients in the coming week, and will send detailed information about all when we officially announce later this month.

It has been a whirlwind these past several weeks and I am very excited with this new opportunity. If you know any young go-getters who want to get their feet wet working for a start-up, please send my way. And thank you for all your support during the last 10 years running CBS Watch magazine. I'm so proud of what we created, and am excited to see where it goes next. They have a terrific team in place that will no doubt keep reaching for the stars (figuratively and literally). Meanwhile, I can't wait to start this new adventure.

Thanks so much,
Jeremy
