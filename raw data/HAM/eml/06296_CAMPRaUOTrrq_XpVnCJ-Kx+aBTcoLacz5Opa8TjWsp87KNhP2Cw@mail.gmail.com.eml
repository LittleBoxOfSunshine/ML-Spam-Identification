Masto speaks at Churchill Democrats dinner


As Nevada=E2=80=99s former attorney general, Catherine Cortez Masto ensured=
 she
visited every Nevada county during her eight years in office so residents
and government agencies could find solutions for the challenges facing the
Silver State.

Now, as a the Democratic candidate running for the U.S. Senate seat being
vacated by the retiring Harry Reid, Masto said it is time Congress begins
working in a bipartisan manner to solve and pass legislation.

Masto delivered the keynote address Thursday art the annual Sawyer-Bryan
Democrat Dinner at the Fallon Convention Center. Formerly known as the
Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, local Democrats changed the annual dinner=E2=80=
=99s name
to reflect more on Nevada=E2=80=99s values.

Since she announced her candidacy, Masto has been visiting communities
around the state meeting people and discussing issues. Her stop in Fallon
was no different.

=E2=80=9CI am running to become your next U.S senator,=E2=80=9D she said to=
 thunderous
applause.

Masto, who grew up in Las Vegas, said she was tired of seeing Washington,
D.C. politicians fail to stop the partisan bickering.

=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s time for the politicians in Washington to start solvi=
ng problems
instead of creating them,=E2=80=9D she added.

During her eight years as attorney general, Masto said she worked for
Nevadans as they faced a foreclosure crisis and the big banks taking
advantage of the state=E2=80=99s residents. At one time during the crisis, =
Masto
said 77,000 homeowners risked losing their homes.

While she faced the problems head on, she also kept in touch with local
communities.

=E2=80=9CI made it a point to get to the rural counties and talk about the =
issues
and how we would work them, address them and solve them,=E2=80=9D Masto poi=
nted out.

She visited Fallon several times to discuss domestic violence prevention,
substance abuse and abuses senior citizens faced. She also met with
representatives from the Fallon Paiute Shoshone Tribe to learn more about
their law enforcement and justice system, and how law enforcement could
crack down on the substance abuse.

Masto, though, said her proudest moment as attorney general came during her
second term.

=E2=80=9COne of the proudest moments for me as attorney general was watchin=
g Brian
Sandoval, our governor, sign into law legislation that I sponsored to
address sex trafficking in Nevada,=E2=80=9D she said, adding victims could =
come
forward and stand up to the sex traffickers.

The legislation called for increased prison terms for pimps, predators and
sex offenders, expanded the sex offender registry and gave victims the
right to sue their captors.

=E2=80=9CIt put them (the victims) on a new pathway to a new beginning,=E2=
=80=9D she said.

Masto also touted the bipartisan spirit of the Nevada Legislature that
passed many bills she supported.

=E2=80=9CThe Democrats and Republicans worked together to get things done,=
=E2=80=9D she
said.

Masto would also like to see additional attention paid to rural
communities, especially more attention into investing, building and funding
roads and schools, increasing the access to high-speed broadband and
improving medical and treatment services through telemedicine.

Furthermore, Masto said she favors more policemen on the beat and favors
the passage of comprehensive immigration reform. The daughter of a Mexican
father and Italian mother, Masto said she and her sister were the first
from their family to graduate from the University of Nevada, Reno.

Although Masto preached that bipartisan was needed in the nation=E2=80=99s =
capital,
she assailed her Republican opponents, Congressman Joe Heck and former 2010
Republican senate candidate Sharron Angle. Masto said Heck votes with the
right-wing/Tea Party component 90 percent of theme, and along with Angle,
they both oppose comprehensive immigration refund, support defunding
Planned Parenthood, abolish the Department of Education and refuse to
support a hearing for a new justice to the U.S.. Supreme Court.

=E2=80=9CWe need to protect Social Security, but Heck and Angle want to pri=
vatize
it,=E2=80=9D she said.

Masto said the new president of the United States needs a Democratic
majority in the Senate to make =E2=80=9Cthings happen=E2=80=9D and as she a=
sked for
Churchill County=E2=80=99s support, Masto said her campaign is going to wor=
k hard
to represent the interests of Nevadans.

As one of the first Attorneys General to sue the Big Banks, I helped secure
$1.9 billion in relief to these families. While my opponents, Sharron Angle
and Congressman Dr. Joe Heck side with anti-immigrant extremists like
Donald J. Trump on the issues that matter most, Nevada Latinos know I am
from their community and on their side.
