Hey everyone - there's been a lot of press on this and I think there's an opportunity for us to weigh in.
Bit late in the day for this, so I'd like to roll this out on Monday. Want to get thoughts from this group first, then I will take to ADL / NJDC / Bend the Arc
Thanks - let me know.

DNC Chair, Jewish Community Leaders Denounce Anti-Semitic Vitriol Against Jewish Reporters in 2016 campaign

Today, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz joined with Jewish community leaders from the Anti-Defamation League, the National Jewish Democratic Council, and Bend the Arc to denounce anti-Semitic vitriol against Jewish reporters in the 2016 campaign.

Throughout the 2016 campaign, journalists reporting on Donald Trump's candidacy have been met with hatred and vitriol inspired by the Republican nominee.  In fact, the Wall Street Journal recently reported on Trump's inspiring of white supremacists in a story titled: "White Nationalists See Advancement Through Donald Trump's Candidacy<http://www.wsj.com/articles/white-nationalists-see-advancement-through-donald-trumps-candidacy-1463523858>." Whether it's Trump's campaign manager assaulting a female reporter, or Donald Trump commanding the crowd to direct their anger towards the press during his rallies, it's clear Trump's supporters derive this kind of violent behavior and extreme rhetoric towards the press from the man standing behind the podium.

Furthermore, the Trump camp has shown no remorse or sympathy for reporters who are subjected to abuse by Trump supporters. When GQ reporter Julia Ioffe received<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/28/julia-ioffe-journalist-melania-trump-antisemitic-abuse?CMP=share_btn_fb> hateful messages in response to a profile she penned about Melania Trump, Ms. Trump blamed the reporter, saying she "provoked<http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/17/politics/melania-trump-dujour/>" the anti-Semitic abuse. Mr. Trump declined<http://www.jta.org/2016/05/05/news-opinion/politics/trump-no-message-for-followers-who-flooded-reporter-with-anti-semitic-abuse> to denounce the followers who flooded that reporter with invective, saying he had "no message," for them. According to Politico, Jewish leaders on both sides of the aisle were dismayed by Trump's refusal to combat

Yesterday, Robert Kagan wrote this in the Washington Post about the fascist threat posed by Trump's candidacy<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/this-is-how-fascism-comes-to-america/2016/05/17/c4e32c58-1c47-11e6-8c7b-6931e66333e7_story.html>: "A mass political movement is thus a powerful and, to those who would oppose it, frightening weapon. When controlled and directed by a single leader, it can be aimed at whomever the leader chooses."

Predictably, when Jonathan Weisman of the New York Times, tweeted out a passage from that op-ed, he was treated to similar anti-Semitic abuse<https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/05/19/new-york-times-staffer-tweets-out-op-ed-critical-of-trump-faces-anti-semitic-avalanche/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter> from Trump supporters.

This is unacceptable. Until Trump makes a forceful denouncement of the anti-Semitic vitriol his supporters have directed at Jews and Jewish reporters, he is condoning his followers' comments.
