Trump on New Day:

- Met with Mike Pence. Says Pence may not endorse anybody or may endorse him.
- Said Manafort actually really likes the way he speaks. Says its the best he's ever seen
- Not going to change. I'm presidential anyway
- Presidential means being a lower key version of myself
- Presidential means not using offensive words, which I've used in the past for emphasis
- "I may tone it down or I may tone it up. I can't tell you what I'm going to do. I don't know"
