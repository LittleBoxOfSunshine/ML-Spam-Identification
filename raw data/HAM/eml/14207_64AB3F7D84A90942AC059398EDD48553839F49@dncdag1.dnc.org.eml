THE NEW YORK TIMES // PATRICK HEALY
Donald J. Trump is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but=
 he is also keenly aware that many in his own party =97 and many Americans,=
 frankly =97 are scared and anxious about the idea of him in the Oval Offic=
e. Even he is not sure how a deeply divided nation would adjust to the firs=
t 100 days of a Trump presidency.

What he does know, however, is what he wants to do in those early months. I=
n a series of recent interviews, he sketched out plans that include showdow=
ns with business leaders over jobs and key roles for military generals, exe=
cutives and possibly even family members in advising him about running the =
country.

Shortly after the Nov. 8 election, President-elect Trump and his vice presi=
dent =97 most likely a governor or member of Congress =97 would begin inter=
viewing candidates for the open Supreme Court seat and quickly settle on a =
nominee in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia.

He would launch a charm offensive to start =93building a government based o=
n relationships,=94 perhaps inviting the Republican leaders Paul D. Ryan an=
d Mitch McConnell to escape the chilly Washington fall and schmooze at Mar-=
a-Lago over golf and two-pound lobsters.

On Inauguration Day, he would go to a =93beautiful=94 gala ball or two, but=
 focus mostly on rescinding Obama executive orders on immigration and calli=
ng up corporate executives to threaten punitive measures if they shift jobs=
 out of the United States.

And by the end of his first 100 days as the nation=92s 45th leader, the wal=
l with Mexico would be designed, the immigration ban on Muslims would be in=
 place, the audit of the Federal Reserve would be underway and plans to rep=
eal the Affordable Care Act would be in motion.

=93I know people aren=92t sure right now what a President Trump will be lik=
e,=94 he said. =93But things will be fine. I=92m not running for president =
to make things unstable for the country.=94

The New York Times interviewed Mr. Trump three times over the past two mont=
hs, most recently on Saturday, as well as several campaign advisers and Tru=
mp confidants.

The possibility of Mr. Trump in the Oval Office =97 an outcome that once se=
emed fanciful =97 became less remote on Tuesday night when Mr. Trump=92s ma=
in challenger, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, quit the race and on Wednesday, G=
ov. John Kasich, indicated he would withdraw too.

Despite his radical vision of how to remake America, and all his outrageous=
 talk on juvenile subjects like his anatomy =97 to say nothing of the polls=
 showing him behind Hillary Clinton =97 Jan. 20 may find the most underesti=
mated politician in America assuming the presidency.

While professing some surprise at his success, Mr. Trump increasingly sound=
s like a man who thinks he knows where he will be eight months from now, an=
d the unrivaled power he will hold. He talked of turning the Oval Office in=
to a high-powered board room, empowering military leaders over foreign affa=
irs specialists in national security debates, and continuing to speak harsh=
ly about adversaries. He may post on Twitter less, but everyone will still =
know what he thinks.

=93As president, I=92ll be working from the first day with my vice presiden=
t and staff to make clear that America will be changing in major ways for t=
he better,=94 Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview on Saturday. =93We ca=
n=92t afford to waste time. I want a vice president who will help me have a=
 major impact quickly on Capitol Hill, and the message will be clear to the=
 nation and to people abroad that the American government will be using its=
 power differently.=94

But he also acknowledged that he might face significant and incessant prote=
sts =97 even thousands of demonstrators massing on the National Mall as he =
takes the oath of office nearby at the Capitol.

Mr. Trump said he would try to unite Republicans and disaffected Democrats =
and independents over the next six months before the November election, and=
 then work in office to show Americans that his chief interest was fighting=
 for their needs. He argued that the fact that he would not have to rely on=
 wealthy donors to finance his campaign would ultimately prove appealing to=
 many voters as they realize he is not =93bought and paid for.=94

=93I know everyone won=92t like everything I do, but I=92m not running to b=
e everyone=92s favorite president,=94 Mr. Trump said. =93Things are serious=
ly wrong in this country. People are hurting, business is hurting. I=92m ru=
nning to move quickly to make big changes.=94

Several friends and allies of Mr. Trump said that =93negotiating=94 was the=
 word he used the most to encapsulate his first 100 days in office. He want=
s to put strong-willed people =97 business executives and generals are ment=
ioned most often =97 in charge of cabinet agencies and throughout his senio=
r staff, and direct them to negotiate deals and plans with congressional le=
aders and state officials, as well as insurance companies and others in the=
 private sector. They say he will accomplish the things he has promised or =
else keep trying, well aware that his supporters will have his head if he d=
oes not.

=93He=92s not going to depart from the agenda he=92s laid out, not a bit,=
=94 said Roger Stone, a longtime adviser and confidant. Mr. Stone declined =
to describe details of his private conversations with Mr. Trump, except to =
say: =93Having gone out a thousand times to say =91I=92m going to build a w=
all,=92 he has to build a wall. He has said he would scrap trade deals; his=
 voters will demand he scrap trade deals. He knows that.=94

Modern America has never seen anything like a Trump administration. Busines=
s leaders and even entertainment figures new to politics have been elected =
governors, of course, and insurgents like Newt Gingrich rose to power.

But this is different. A Manhattan real estate developer and bombastic real=
ity television star, Mr. Trump would be a president like no other. Yet most=
 historians suggest the country would adjust: He would quickly find himself=
 consumed with the urgent and normalizing tasks of building a cabinet, asse=
mbling senior staff and reassuring Wall Street and the public that he was c=
apable of governing America.

=93Trump is predicting he=92ll be able to do all these things, but his work=
load will be pretty enormous and his power would be so limited by precedent=
, by the bureaucracy, by the Constitution,=94 said Robert Dallek, a preside=
ntial historian. =93Even in trade and immigration, where Trump says he will=
 make revolutionary changes, Congress has a say on those things. A lot of p=
eople have a say. The president is not king.=94

But Mr. Trump pledged in the interviews to deliver on his campaign promises=
, even if they prove disruptive or explosive.

On his first day in office, he said, he would meet with Homeland Security o=
fficials, generals, and others =97 he did not mention diplomats =97 to take=
 steps to seal the southern border and assign more security agents along it=
. He would also call the heads of companies like Pfizer, the Carrier Corpor=
ation, Ford and Nabisco and warn them that their products face 35 percent t=
ariffs because they are moving jobs out of the country. Democrats and some =
Republicans have warned that financial markets would react poorly and that =
Mr. Trump=92s protectionist stances might plunge the country into recession=
, but he insisted that trade is =93killing the country=94 and =93the market=
s would be fine.=94

=93Bilateral talks with Mexico would start pretty quickly on the wall, and =
I would have chief executives into the Oval Office soon, too,=94 he said. =
=93The Oval Office would be an amazing place to negotiate. It would command=
 immediate respect from the other side, immediate understanding about the n=
ation=92s priorities.=94

As for which foreign leader he would call first as president, he said =93th=
ey would not necessarily be a priority.=94

=93We have to take a tougher stand with foreign countries,=94 Mr. Trump sai=
d. =93We=92re like the policemen of the world right now. So I wouldn=92t be=
 calling them up right away and getting more entangled.=94

For good or ill, he would command the nation=92s attention unlike any moder=
n president, and not simply because of his penchant for redecorating in gol=
d and renaming planes and buildings after himself. (For the record, he said=
 he had no ambitious renovation plans.)

=93His first 100 days would be riveting,=94 said Ari Fleischer, a former pr=
ess secretary for President George W. Bush. =93The question would be whethe=
r he is capable of downshifting from the hot rhetoric of his campaign to th=
e serious business of building a presidency based on sound judgment and nec=
essary coalition building.=94

Mr. Fleischer said it was possible that Mr. Trump would make the adjustment=
, given his frequent comments about negotiating with Democrats and Republic=
ans to reach compromises.

=93That side of him intrigues me,=94 Mr. Fleischer said. =93He keeps alludi=
ng to how well he gets along with people. It=92s almost like Trump is playi=
ng a shrewd game. Tough campaigner today. Great deal maker later.=94 He add=
ed, =93Of course, if he wins he=92ll have some level of strength and moment=
um akin to a mandate. That would help.=94

Mr. Trump did seem aware that his early months could be consumed with tryin=
g to win confirmation for his cabinet and perhaps a new Supreme Court justi=
ce and with making appointments throughout the bureaucracy.

He made it clear that he was not interested in delegating these tasks and t=
hat he wanted to make sure his appointees shared his governing philosophy. =
One of his closest advisers, his daughter Ivanka, would probably stay with =
his company, but he said he would seek counsel from her and her husband, th=
e businessman Jared Kushner, and noted that family members had served in ad=
ministrations before.

=93I think about a U.N. ambassador, about a secretary of defense and secret=
ary of treasury, but I think more about winning first,=94 Mr. Trump said. =
=93Otherwise I=92m wasting time. I want people in those jobs who care about=
 winning. The U.N. isn=92t doing anything to end the big conflicts in the w=
orld, so you need an ambassador who would win by really shaking up the U.N.=
=94

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">For good or ill, he would command the nation=92s att=
ention unlike any modern president, and not simply because of his penchant =
for redecorating in gold and renaming planes and buildings after himself. (=
For the record, he said he had no ambitious
 renovation plans.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=93His first 100 days would be riveting,=94 said Ari=
 Fleischer, a former press secretary for President George W. Bush. =93The q=
uestion would be whether he is capable of downshifting from the hot rhetori=
c of his campaign to the serious business
 of building a presidency based on sound judgment and necessary coalition b=
uilding.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Mr. Fleischer said it was possible that Mr. Trump wo=
uld make the adjustment, given his frequent comments about negotiating with=
 Democrats and Republicans to reach compromises.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=93That side of him intrigues me,=94 Mr. Fleischer s=
aid. =93He keeps alluding to how well he gets along with people. It=92s alm=
ost like Trump is playing a shrewd game. Tough campaigner today. Great deal=
 maker later.=94 He added, =93Of course, if he
 wins he=92ll have some level of strength and momentum akin to a mandate. T=
hat would help.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Mr. Trump did seem aware that his early months could=
 be consumed with trying to win confirmation for his cabinet and perhaps a =
new Supreme Court justice and with making appointments throughout the burea=
ucracy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">He made it clear that he was not interested in deleg=
ating these tasks and that he wanted to make sure his appointees shared his=
 governing philosophy. One of his closest advisers, his daughter Ivanka, wo=
uld probably stay with his company,
 but he said he would seek counsel from her and her husband, the businessma=
n Jared Kushner, and noted that family members had served in administration=
s before.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=93I think about a U.N. ambassador, about a secretar=
y of defense and secretary of treasury, but I think more about winning firs=
t,=94 Mr. Trump said. =93Otherwise I=92m wasting time. I want people in tho=
se jobs who care about winning. The U.N. isn=92t
 doing anything to end the big conflicts in the world, so you need an ambas=
sador who would win by really shaking up the U.N.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
