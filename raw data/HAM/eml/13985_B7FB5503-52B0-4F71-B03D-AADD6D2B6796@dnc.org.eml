Truly, Donald Trump knows nothing. He is more ignorant about policy than yo=
u can possibly imagine, even when you take into account the fact that he is=
 more ignorant than you can possibly imagine. But his ignorance isn=92t as =
unique as it may seem: In many ways, he=92s just doing a clumsy job of chan=
neling nonsense widely popular in his party, and to some extent in the chat=
tering classes more generally.

Last week the presumptive Republican presidential nominee =97 hard to belie=
ve, but there it is =97 finally revealed his plan to make America great aga=
in. Basically, it involves running the country like a failing casino<http:/=
/www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/us/politics/donald-trumps-idea-to-cut-national-=
debt-get-creditors-to-accept-less.html?_r=3D0>: he could, he asserted, =93m=
ake a deal=94 with creditors that would reduce the debt burden if his outla=
ndish promises of economic growth don=92t work out.

The reaction from everyone who knows anything about finance or economics wa=
s a mix of amazed horror and horrified amazement. One does not casually sug=
gest throwing away America=92s carefully cultivated reputation as the world=
=92s most scrupulous debtor =97 a reputation that dates all the way back to=
 Alexander Hamilton<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/opinion/in-hamiltons-=
debt.html?rref=3Dcollection%2Fcolumn%2Fpaul-krugman&action=3Dclick&contentC=
ollection=3Dopinion&region=3Dstream&module=3Dstream_unit&version=3Dlatest&c=
ontentPlacement=3D5&pgtype=3Dcollection>.

The Trump solution would, among other things, deprive the world economy of =
its most crucial safe asset, U.S. debt, at a time when safe assets are alre=
ady in short supply.

Of course, we can be sure that Mr. Trump knows none of this, and nobody in =
his entourage is likely to tell him. But before we simply ridicule him =97 =
or, actually, at the same time that we=92re ridiculing him =97 let=92s ask =
where his bad ideas really come from.

First of all, Mr. Trump obviously believes that America could easily find i=
tself facing a debt crisis. But why? After all, investors, who are willing =
to lend to America at incredibly low interest rates, are evidently not worr=
ied by our debt. And there=92s good reason for their calmness: federal inte=
rest payments<http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/where-do-trumps-b=
ad-ideas-come-from/?smid=3Dtw-share> are only 1.3 percent of G.D.P., or 6 p=
ercent of total outlays.

These numbers mean both that the burden of the debt is fairly small and tha=
t even complete repudiation of that debt would have only a minor impact on =
the government=92s cash flow.

So why is Mr. Trump even talking about this subject? Well, one possible ans=
wer is that lots of supposedly serious people have been hyping the alleged =
threat posed by federal debt for years. For example, Paul Ryan, the speaker=
 of the House, has warned repeatedly about a =93looming debt crisis.=94<htt=
p://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/288629-ryan-gop-budget-best-c=
hance-to-make-down-payment-on-debt-crisis> Indeed, until not long ago the w=
hole Beltway elite seemed to be in the grip of BowlesSimpsonism, with its a=
ssertion that debt was the greatest threat facing the nation.

A lot of this debt hysteria was really about trying to bully us into cuttin=
g Social Security and Medicare, which is why so many self-proclaimed fiscal=
 hawks were also eager to cut taxes on the rich. But Mr. Trump apparently w=
asn=92t in on that particular con, and takes the phony debt scare seriously=
. Sad!

Still, even if he misunderstands the fiscal situation, how can he imagine t=
hat it would be O.K. for America to default? One answer is that he=92s extr=
apolating from his own business career, in which he has done very well by r=
unning up debts, then walking away from them.

But it=92s also true that much of the Republican Party shares his insoucian=
ce about default. Remember, the party=92s congressional wing deliberately s=
et about extracting concessions from President Obama, using the threat of g=
ratuitous default via a refusal to raise the debt ceiling.

And quite a few Republican lawmakers defended that strategy of extortion<ht=
tp://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/us/politics/many-in-gop-offer-theory-defaul=
t-wouldnt-be-that-bad.html> by arguing that default wouldn=92t be that bad,=
 that even with its access to funds cut off the U.S. government could =93pr=
ioritize=94 payments, and that the financial disruption would be no big dea=
l.

Given that history, it=92s not too hard to understand why candidate Trump t=
hinks not paying debts in full makes sense.

The important thing to realize, then, is that when Mr. Trump talks nonsense=
, he=92s usually just offering a bombastic version of a position that=92s w=
idespread in his party. In fact, it=92s remarkable how many ridiculous Trum=
pisms were previously espoused by Mitt Romney in 2012, from his claim<http:=
//www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/11/donald-trump/dona=
ld-trump-repeats-pants-fire-claim-unemployment/> that the true unemployment=
 rate vastly exceeds<https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post=
/mitt-romneys-claim-that-the-unemployment-rate-is-really-11-percent/2012/10=
/06/a0de96cc-0fd4-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_blog.html> official figures to his=
 claim that he can bring prosperity by starting a trade wa<http://krugman.b=
logs.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/republicans-and-trade-wars/>r with China.

None of this should be taken as an excuse for Mr. Trump. He really is frigh=
teningly uninformed; worse, he doesn=92t appear to know what he doesn=92t k=
now. The point, instead, is that his blithe lack of knowledge largely follo=
ws from the know-nothing attitudes of the party he now leads.

Oh, and just for the record: No, it=92s not the same on the other side of t=
he aisle. You may dislike Hillary Clinton, you may disagree sharply with he=
r policies, but she and the people around her do know their facts. Nobody h=
as a monopoly on wisdom, but in this election, one party has largely corner=
ed the market in raw ignorance.
