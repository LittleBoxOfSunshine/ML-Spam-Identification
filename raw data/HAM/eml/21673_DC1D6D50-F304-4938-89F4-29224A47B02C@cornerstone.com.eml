Wanted to follow up regarding the convention. I think it would be a good ex=
perience for my 9 year old son, who is very interested in government, polit=
ics, and policy issues (he's also interested in things like sports and Star=
 Wars, but less relevant here). The main line package generally looks ok, b=
ut I want to be sure this will work well for us. Knowing Philadelphia (went=
 to grad school at Wharton), I want to be sure our hotel is reasonably conv=
enient and that getting around from there will be safe. I usually stay at t=
he four seasons, occasionally Ritz, but could go down from there if it work=
s otherwise. The other issue is  we generally stay in connecting rooms (or =
a suite with two beds in separate rooms). I understand you have a lot of pe=
ople to handle. If the logistics can work I think we would be interested.

Hi Jon,



I hope the timing works out, it would be great to have you there! As for th=
e ticket levels, we=92ve found this election season that some folks have wa=
nted to max out in light of our opposition. The difference is mostly in nam=
e only, but it also allows your name to be listed on the invitation as part=
 of the host committee. In your case, attending at the co-host level would =
also qualify you for the Main Line convention package. I=92ve attached our =
convention package descriptions for your reference, but please feel free to=
 reach out if you have any questions.



I hope that helps!



Thanks,

Dan

Thanks. Trying to see if can make that timing work. What is the difference =
between cohost and guest levels?

Jonathan,



I hope you are well. I want to personally invite you to our upcoming event =
with President Obama  on the evening of June 8th. We will be advertising th=
is event more publicly in the coming days, but I wanted to make sure you we=
re among the first to know. Ken Lerer and Katherine Sailer are hosting what=
 promises to be an intimate evening with remarks from the President and the=
 chance to ask any questions you may have. We are expecting no more than 60=
 guests and each person will have the opportunity for a photo with the Pres=
ident.



We=92d love to see you there if you are available. I=92ve included the invi=
tation for your reference and you can RSVP here<https://finance.democrats.o=
rg/page/contribute/NYDinnerJun8>. Please let me know if you have any questi=
ons about the event. I hope we=92ll see you in June!



Best,
