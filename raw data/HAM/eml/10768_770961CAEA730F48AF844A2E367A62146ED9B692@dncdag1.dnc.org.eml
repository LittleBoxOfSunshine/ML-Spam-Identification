Buzzfeed =96 Andrew Kaczynski

In early 2005, Donald Trump explained to radio host Howard Stern that he ha=
d considered hosting a version of his show The Apprentice pitting black con=
testants vs. white ones.

Trump thought the concept, which BuzzFeed News reported Thursday Trump push=
ed the idea on his syndicated radio show, would be the highest rated show o=
n television.

=93On The Apprentice there was a concept, okay, thrown out by some person, =
nine blacks against nine whites,=94 said Trump. =93And it would be nine bla=
cks against nine whites, all highly educated, very smart, strong, beautiful=
. Do you like it? Do you like it, Robin?=94

=93I think you=92re gonna have a riot,=94 Stern co-host Robin Quivers said,=
 after Stern said he liked the idea.

=93It would be the highest-rated show on television,=94 interjected Trump.

Stern went on to ask Trump a series of questions.

=93Very dark blacks, or light-skinned blacks?=94 Stern asked.

=93Assortment,=94 Trump responded, =93against whites.=94

When a laughing Quivers asked how many blondes, Trump added he wanted all n=
ine whites to be blonde.

=93This was a thought that was given to us, and I don=92t think NBC is thri=
lled with the idea, with the concept,=94 says Trump.

=93Wouldn=92t that set off a racial war?=94 asks Stern.

=93Actually, I don=92t think it would,=94 responded Trump. =93I think it wo=
uld be handled very beautifully by me. Because, as you know, I=92m very dip=
lomatic=85 Also, I think you=92d have 35 million people a night watching.=
=94

Stern said that on some level the idea was wrong, but he=92d watch it. =93Y=
ou=92d have to, because you want to know when the riots start,=94 Quivers s=
aid.

=93There=92s something wrong with it, but I don=92t know, maybe we should t=
hink about it,=94 Trump said.
