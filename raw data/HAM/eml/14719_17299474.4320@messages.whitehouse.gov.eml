 For Immediate Release April 28, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

TO COLLEGE REPORTERS



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room





3:53 P.M. EDT

 THE PRESIDENT: I hear there's some hotshot journalists here. Josh was sp=
eaking for me, and I wanted to make sure he was getting it right.

 How's it going, everybody? Are you guys having an interesting time here?=


 AUDIENCE: Yes!

 THE PRESIDENT: Was Josh thorough in his briefing? Well, I heard you guys=
 were around today, so I wanted to stop by and say hello. I also have a b=
it of breaking news for you, and then I might take some questions.

 I overheard Josh talking about student loans, and I know that's a big pr=
iority for a lot of your listeners and readers. And that's one of the rea=
sons why my administration has spent a lot of time focused on college aff=
ordability. So we expanded Pell grants to make sure that more young peopl=
e could access it. We created the Pay As You Earn program that ensures th=
at people can cap the amount that they're repaying on their loans each mo=
nth, so that young people who want to go into jobs that arent as lucrativ=
e are still able to pursue their passions and their dreams while managing=
 their debt load.

 Today I want to announce that we're aiming to enroll 2 million more peop=
le in Pay As Your Earn by this time next year, and you can find out how a=
t StudentLoans.gov/repay. That's StudentLoans.gov/repay. And we're also g=
oing to be making some additional announcements about how we're going to =
get our agencies coordinating so that, as young people are managing their=
 student loan debt, there's one-stop shopping, they can figure out how to=
 do it, and they can make sure that there are consumer protections in ter=
ms of how they're being treated in the repayment process.

 While I have you here, I might as well mention a couple of other things.=
 You may have heard that there is a Supreme Court vacancy. For those of y=
ou who have been studying our system of government, we have three branche=
s, and one of the most important is the judiciary. And right now, our Sup=
reme Court is absent one sitting member, with the passing of Justice Scal=
ia. I've nominated an individual named Merrick Garland, who's currently t=
he Chief Judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is the second =
most important court in the land. By all accounts, he's extremely well-qu=
alified.=20

And traditionally, what's happened is, is that the Senate then, exercisin=
g its constitutional duties of advice and consent, will meet with the jud=
ge and then have a hearing for him, and then have a vote. In part because=
 politics have gotten so polarized lately, and the importance of this sea=
t, so far at least the Republican Leader on the Senate side, Mitch McConn=
ell, has refused to have the Republican caucus meet with him and schedule=
 an actual vote. Although, to their credit, there have been a number of R=
epublicans who have broken ranks and gone ahead and met with Judge Garlan=
d.

I mention this because I think it's important for all of you, while you'r=
e in town, and many of you who are going to end up being journalists cove=
ring important national policy, to recognize that our system only works w=
hen, even when we have big disagreements, even when there are big policy =
disputes, there's still a willingness to follow the rules and treat peopl=
e fairly -- especially those who are on the other side of the debate. Tha=
t's something that's been lost a little bit in this town of late.=20

And I said at my State of the Union address, my hope is, is that despite =
some of the unusual rhetoric that we've been hearing during this presiden=
tial campaign, that it's young people like you who are going to restore t=
hat sense of us being able to work together and make this democracy funct=
ion effectively. And journalists play a critical role in that. Sometimes =
both Josh and I probably have our disagreements with the press corps, and=
 feel picked on or misunderstood, but the truth of the matter is -- and I=
've said this before -- what separates us out in part from a lot of other=
 countries in the world is we've got this incredible free press that poke=
s and prods and calls into account our leaders. And that is how we can ma=
ke sure that leaders are accountable to the people who elect them. And th=
at's how we make sure that you dont see major abuses of power. And when y=
ou do, that, in fact, the American people know about it and are able to m=
ake changes.

And so you guys are going to have a critical role, those of you who end u=
p following journalism. I hope many of you do. I want to thank the White =
House Press Corps, because I understand they gave you a lot of time today=
. And some of the best journalists in the country operate here. I normall=
y dont say nice things about them in front of them -- (laughter) -- but I=
 figured since they took the time to work with you, I wanted to make sure=
 to acknowledge the great work that they are doing.

All right? So with that, I'm going to take a couple of questions.

Let's see. We'll start with that young man right there, in the black suit=
 -- or blue, I guess. Right here, in the red tie. But I may get to you, t=
oo.

Q Mr. President, it's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dan Corey, and I=
'm the Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Targum, the second-oldest college new=
spaper in the United States. And it serves the Rutgers University-New Bru=
nswick community.

THE PRESIDENT: Outstanding.

Q We recently ran a student referendum to keep our presence on campus. We=
've asked and we're allowed to continue publishing. And we're actually go=
ing to reach a historic 150 years of publication.

THE PRESIDENT: Congratulations.

Q Thank you very much. I'm also very nervous right now. (Laughter.)=20

THE PRESIDENT: You're doing great so far. Just never admit that you're ne=
rvous. Just pretend like this is routine. (Laughter.)

Q Well, in light of the news of you speaking at our commencement, I was w=
ondering, would you be interested in being interviewed by our newspaper?

THE PRESIDENT: That's a good use of your time right there. (Laughter.) I =
have to say that normally I coordinate carefully with my press team befor=
e we grant interviews, but I am favorably disposed towards giving you a l=
ittle bit of time. It may not be a really long interview, but I figure we=
 can give the college newspaper a little bit of play.

MR. EARNEST: That's a good idea.

THE PRESIDENT: All right. Young lady, right here.

Q Mr. President, it's an absolute pleasure. My question is, you announced=
 the other day that you'll be visiting Flint, Michigan, based on a letter=
 received from a young girl. What are you planning to do during your visi=
t there? And have you heard from the girl in response to your visit? And =
if possible, after, may I take a photo with you? (Laughter.)=20

THE PRESIDENT: The photo I can't do, because if I do, then I've got a lon=
g line. But I will be visiting Flint. And obviously, since the news of th=
e terrible things that have been taking place there -- the lead in the dr=
inking water and the potential health hazards, as well as the people who =
were responsible for the health and safety of those residents not carryin=
g out their duties the way they need to -- I think it's important not onl=
y for us to have responded as we have, with FEMA -- that's the Federal Em=
ergency Management Agency that responds to a lot of problems like this --=
 it's important not only that we are helping the city plan over the long =
term, but I think it's also important for me to shine a spotlight on the =
fact that Flint, although extreme, is not unique; that we have underinves=
ted in some of our basic infrastructure that we rely on for our public he=
alth. And hopefully it will give me a chance to speak to the nation as a =
whole about how we need to ensure that our air is clear, our water is cle=
an, and that our kids are safe. And I hope I get a chance to meet that yo=
ung lady, as well.

All right, young man right here.

Q Hello, it's a pleasure. I'm Jesse Yamba (ph) from the University of Nor=
th Texas, and I just had some questions for you. First of all, what is yo=
ur proudest achievement you've achieved here in these eight years? And af=
ter January 20th, what are your goals or plans after you leave the White =
House?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm proud of a lot of stuff: Providing health insura=
nce to 20 million people who didnt have it, and setting us on a path wher=
e hopefully everybody has health insurance that's affordable and high qua=
lity. I'm proud about the work we did to save the economy. Because right =
after I came in, we were in freefall and could have experienced a worldwi=
de depression. I'm proud of the reforms we've done on Wall Street to make=
 sure that the recklessness that led to the crisis hopefully doesnt happe=
n again.=20

I'm proud of the work we've done in education to make sure that millions =
of kids who previously couldnt afford to go to college can, and that in a=
ddition to the work we've done on student debt and reducing that, we've a=
lso been doing things to make the process of encouraging young people to =
go to college easier. And this is a good time for me to give a shout-out =
to the First Lady, who, as many of you know, just this week had her annua=
l signup, getting young people to apply for the FAFSA form that is the ga=
teway for you to be able to get financial aid. She was up in New York, bu=
t it was I think 1,000 participants nationwide who are helping to let you=
ng people know, if are willing to work hard and have a vision for your fu=
ture, then nothing is preventing you from getting the kind of higher educ=
ation that you need.

So I'm proud of all that stuff. Probably the thing I'm most proud of is, =
mainly as the assistant to Michelle Obama -- (laughter) -- I've raised tw=
o daughters who are amazing and I'm really, really proud of. And being ab=
le to do that while still focused on my job I think is something I'll loo=
k back on and appreciate.=20

I'm really busy right now, so I'm not thinking too much about after the p=
residency. Typically, Presidents build libraries, but I'm more interested=
 in the programming, not just the building. And I'm very confident that a=
 lot of the programming that I do will relate to young people and how I c=
an encourage them to get involved in civic life.

Let's see. I'm trying to alternate boy-girl-boy-girl here, just to be fai=
r. The young lady right there, in the red. Yes, you.

Q Hey --

THE PRESIDENT: Hey! (Laughter.)=20

Q My name is Daniela Orteza (ph) and I'm reporting for Ole Miss at the Un=
iversity of Mississippi. And pending the Supreme Court's decision, will t=
his administration take further action on immigration?

THE PRESIDENT: As you know, we took some initial steps to try to make a m=
ore rational, smarter immigration process. Our immigration system has bee=
n broken for quite some time. On the one hand, you've had some serious wo=
rk by our administration and previous administrations to slow the flow of=
 undocumented workers across the border, to strengthen border security, t=
o improve how we manage the influx of folks who come in by air, and to ma=
ke sure that they're not overstaying their visas and so forth.=20

On the other hand, we also want to remind everybody this is a nation of i=
mmigrants, and immigration has been a source of strength for our country,=
 and that we have people here who may not have initially come here legall=
y, but have since that time put down roots, raised families. They're our =
neighbors, they're our friends. They may be, in some cases, seeing their =
sons and daughters go off to war in our country's uniform, and that it do=
esnt make sense for us to simply pretend like we're going to send all tho=
se folks out, and instead we should bring them out of the shadows and giv=
e them a chance to earn legal residence and ultimately citizenship.

So we put forward a plan. Part of it we were able to implement -- the DRE=
AM Act kids who we were able to make sure were treated like the young Ame=
ricans that they are. We then had an additional program through administr=
ative action that the Supreme Court put a stay on -- or the lower courts =
put a stay on, and is about to go to the Supreme Court. In part, the proc=
ess takes a long time generally. With the Supreme Court one justice short=
, it will be interesting to see whether or not they can come to a ruling =
or whether they arrive at a tie -- a 4-4 tie. We dont know yet. That's pe=
nding.=20

In the meantime, we're still implementing a number of reforms and changes=
 to make the legal immigration system smoother, not as expensive, fairer =
to people, to treat families with more respect. We have changed our prior=
ities in terms of enforcement so that we're not deporting and separating =
families as much, and more focused on going after criminals and people wh=
o pose a security threat to the community. But our hands are a little bit=
 tied on some of the bigger things until the Supreme Court rules.

Now, even if we do all that, it's critically important that we still push=
 Congress to pass legislation -- because my executive orders can be overt=
urned by the next President. And the only way to have a permanent solutio=
n to this problem is for the kind of legislation to pass that we saw the =
Senate actually pass on a bipartisan basis that would continue to strengt=
hen border security, but also give a pathway to citizenship for those who=
 had been here for quite some time. That way we can be a nation of laws a=
nd a nation of immigrants, and it is the right thing to do. I am not opti=
mistic about us getting the legislation done before I leave, given the ma=
keup of this Congress, but I think this is going to be a major issue in t=
he election and people need to pay attention to it.

All right, I'm going to take two more. Two more questions. Let's see. You=
're all very good-looking people, I've got to say. (Laughter.) This gentl=
eman over here. I havent forgotten about you over there. Go ahead.

Q I work for the Indiana News Student at Indiana University. My question =
is about the Syrian refugees.

THE PRESIDENT: I thought you were going to ask about basketball wins. (La=
ughter.)=20

Q We can do that if you want. (Laughter.)=20

THE PRESIDENT: No, go ahead.

Q As the deadline for your pledge to let in 10,000 Syrian refugees gets k=
ind of closer, starting to creep up on us, it looks kind of iffy whether =
thats going to be made. Do you have any plans to speed up that flow or en=
courage more Syrian refugees coming into the country?



THE PRESIDENT: Well, were going to keep on pushing. And part of what has =
made this challenging is that we want to make sure that we can, as much a=
s possible, provide the American people an assurance that everybody here =
has been vetted at a very high standard.=20



As you will recall, there was a lot of emotions around our initial announ=
cement that we should be admitting some Syrian refugees, and people makin=
g claims that somehow this would be letting potential terrorists onto our=
 shores. The truth of the matter is, is that the refugee process generall=
y is much more rigorous in its screening and its vetting than the average=
 tourist who comes in here. These are people who themselves have been vic=
tims of terrorism, and victims of incredible violence and suffering at th=
e hands of the Assad regime in Syria.



It is the right thing to do. Our closest friends and allies, like Canada,=
 like Germany and other European countries, as well as countries borderin=
g Syria like Turkey and Jordan, have taken on an enormous burden. And as =
the most powerful nation on Earth, its important for us to do our duty as=
 well here, our humanitarian obligation. And its important for us to send=
 a signal around the world that we care about these folks.



So administratively, I think now we have the process to speed it up. Ther=
e may be efforts on the part of Congress to try to block us, but our goal=
 is to continue to try to make the case to Congress and to the American p=
eople this is the right thing to do. And we believe that we can hit those=
 marks before the end of the year.



More broadly, one of the things were going to be doing is, at the United =
Nations were going to convene at the margins of the United Nations Genera=
l Assembly, which takes place in September every year. Were going to try =
to make sure that we have an international conference around how we can d=
eal with much larger refugee flows generally. Some of them, as a conseque=
nce of conflict, in some cases because of drought or other natural disast=
ers -- there are about 60 million displaced people around the world. And =
Ive met with some of them, not just those who are fleeing areas like Syri=
a, but also in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. A lot of these folks a=
re your age or younger, have the same hopes, dreams, aspirations, and hav=
e just been dealt a very bad hand.=20



We cant solve every problem in the world, but we have to make sure that w=
e take leadership in trying to help stabilize their lives.



All right, Ill take two more, because I promised that I was going to get =
that young man who thought I had called on him. Yes, go ahead.



Q Thank you, Mr. President, for joining us here today. In light of your P=
ell grant announcement today, it seems like a central tenet of your admin=
istrations strategy in addressing college affordability is increasing acc=
ess to grants and loans. How sustainable would you say the strategy is in=
 addressing the long-term rising trends of the cost of college?



THE PRESIDENT: Thats a great question. It is not sustainable if the overa=
ll cost of college keeps on going up as fast as its going up. So one of t=
he things that we have to do, even as we make sure that were providing mo=
re access to grants, keeping loans manageable, interest rates at a reason=
able level, we still have to work with colleges and universities to figur=
e out new ways to reduce costs. And weve actually seen universities aroun=
d the country begin experiments that are having some impact. Ill just giv=
e you a couple of examples.=20



I made an announcement a while back about our initiative for making the f=
irst two years of community college free. Thats something that is afforda=
ble for most states to do, and we are prepared to help with federal suppo=
rt. If we are able to do that -- and we could just close a few loopholes =
that corporations currently use to avoid paying taxes to pay for it -- th=
en for a large proportion of young people who either get their primary or=
 secondary school education from a community college, or started at commu=
nity college and then transferred to a four-year university for graduatio=
n, their costs are being cut anywhere from half to 100 percent, down to z=
ero. And this is something achievable.=20



Now, Congress has not moved on our proposal. But what weve also seen is t=
hat there have been 27 jurisdictions around the country that have taken u=
s up on this challenge and are doing it themselves, are figuring out ways=
 to make this happen. So thats one example.



A second example. Some of you, because I can tell that you guys were high=
-achieving, type A folks -- (laughter) -- unlike the kind of slacker kid =
that I was -- (laughter) -- some of you, I suspect, were taking college-c=
redit courses while you were in high school. And what weve seen is a numb=
er of high school systems, or public school systems partner with communit=
y colleges and universities so that they make arrangements. You start tak=
ing your college credits while in high school, and you extend your -- wha=
t seems like high school for an extra year, and when you graduate you now=
 have an associates degree, so you have the equivalent of a community col=
lege degree. When you then go to a four-year institution, you have enough=
 credits that you can graduate in three years instead of four. That, agai=
n, by eliminating one year, means that youve just reduced your costs sign=
ificantly.=20



Theres been discussion of how can we use technology to cut costs -- are t=
here ways in which we can take the best practices of online learning and =
make that more accessible for young people who may not have the luxury of=
 being on a campus for four years with room and board; might have to work=
 part time because they need to help their families or support themselves=
, are there ways that we can make that work.=20



And we have to be careful about that because there have been some for-pro=
fit institutions that, frankly, havent done a very good job. They take th=
e money, but the young person who is taking classes with them doesnt end =
up getting a degree thats useful for them getting a job, and then they ha=
ve problems repaying their loans. But theres no doubt that, if done well,=
 that technology potentially can reduce costs.=20



And then were talking to colleges and universities about what are the con=
tributors to these higher costs. And this may be sensitive to some folks,=
 but Ive said this before -- if you have the option of cutting your colle=
ge costs in half but your dorm rooms arent quite as nice, or the sports f=
acilities or the student center of the cafeteria arent as good, is that a=
 deal youre willing to take? And can we figure out how to empower more pa=
rents and more students to demand a lower-cost option that still gives yo=
u a great education but maybe doesnt have all the bells and whistles to i=
t.=20



And thats part of the reason why weve put forward this college report car=
d. The idea is just -- it provides you online data so that as youre selec=
ting a college or university that youre able to see, all right, what are =
the costs, what are the graduation rates -- all the indicators and benchm=
arks of getting good value for what youre spending.



And this has been a long-term trend of ever-rising college costs. The goo=
d news is, is that through the work that weve done over the last several =
years, weve started to see some good trends. Delinquencies, hardship defe=
rrals, defaults on student loans have started to go in a better direction=
. They were skyrocketing. Some of that is the improvement of the economy =
generally; some of it is some of the policies that weve engaged in. But w=
ere going to have to keep on working with universities to make sure that =
were doing a smarter, better job in order for the people who are coming b=
ehind you to be able to afford college.



Last question. The gentleman right there.



Q Hi, Mr. President. Earlier today, we spoke about --=20



THE PRESIDENT: Whats your name?



Q Patrick Forrest (ph) from the Fresno City College Rampage.



THE PRESIDENT: From the what?



Q Fresno City College, the Rampage.



THE PRESIDENT: Fresno City College. Fantastic.



Q Earlier today, one thing we talked about was civic engagement, and a li=
ne was used in the State of the Union address of dont give into the cynic=
ism of the day. A poll released by Reuters yesterday shows that nearly ha=
lf of Americans feel that the elections are rigged in some way. Is there =
any goal or plan of the administration to help revitalize the faith in de=
mocracy that seems to be lacking?



THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know what, this is something that Ive tried to d=
o ever since I got into public office. As you know, I came into this work=
 as a community organizer and strongly believed that our democracy only w=
orks when people participate.=20



There are a lot of forces that feed cynicism. And theres no dispute that =
our democracy is not working as well as it should. I can tell you some of=
 the reasons for that. One of it is that we have set up a system for elec=
ting state legislatures and members of Congress that involve the drawing =
of district lines that are gerrymandered. For those of you who are unfami=
liar with the phrase, it basically means that those who are already in po=
wer draw the maps in such a way where they can be assured that these are =
either going to be Democratic seats or Republican seats. And what thats d=
one is its made very few seats competitive.=20



So, for example, in the last election, in 2012, Democrats actually cast s=
ubstantially more votes in congressional elections, but ended up with sub=
stantially fewer seats. And the reason for that is, in 2010, when the cen=
sus was done and re-districting of congressional and House legislative se=
ats were drawn, Republican governors and Republican majorities were respo=
nsible for drawing most of the seats.=20



Now, I want to be clear, Democrats arent blameless on this, either. But C=
alifornia, for example, has gone to a process of nonpartisan districting.=
 The advantage there is not only do you make more seats competitive, but =
it also means that politicians have to compete for everybodys votes becau=
se theyre not in safe seats, theyre not in a safely Republican district o=
r a Democratic district. And what that does is it means theyve got to not=
 just appeal to the extremes of their party.



Part of the reason weve seen polarization and gridlock here in Washington=
 is because theres been this great sorting, and Democrats have moved much=
 further -- have moved left. Republicans have just gone way to the right.=
 And its harder, then, to compromise, because members of Congress -- and =
the same thing is true in state legislatures -- are always looking over t=
heir shoulder seeing if somebody in their own party might challenge them.=
 And then the system doesnt work.=20



So thats a big chunk of why people are cynical -- because they feel like =
their votes dont count. And if you draw districts that are ironclad one p=
arty or another, then theyre not entirely wrong.



Another reason that people are cynical is money in politics. The Supreme =
Court issued a ruling -- Citizens United -- that allowed super PACs and v=
ery wealthy individuals to just finance all these ads that you guys see o=
n TV all the time. Half the time nobody knows whos funding them. And that=
 makes you cynical partly because most of this money is spent on negative=
 ads. So youre just hearing constantly how horrible everybody is. That wi=
ll make you feel pretty bad about the political process.



And Im a strong believer in finding ways in which we can make the financi=
ng of campaigns more democratic. Now, weve seen some interesting work bei=
ng done. Youve got to give Bernie Sanders, for example, credit, building =
off some of the work that I did. I, in turn, built off the work that Howa=
rd Dean did for smaller donations, grassroots donors to be able, in small=
 contributions, to allow candidates to be competitive.



But I think that -- we dont want to leave that to chance. And thats much =
harder to do for members of Congress who are lower profile so they dont g=
et the sort of viral presence that allows them to raise that kind of mone=
y to compete. So were going to have to solve money in politics.



You as journalists are going to have a role to play in reducing cynicism.=
 It is very hard to get good stories placed. People will assign you stori=
es about whats not working. Its very hard for you to write a story about,=
 wow, this thing really works good.=20



And just to take the federal government as an example, every day Ive got =
2 million people who work for the federal government -- whether in our mi=
litary, our law enforcement, our environmental protection, et cetera -- a=
nd theyre doing great work. And you rely on it in all kinds of ways, incl=
uding when you check the weather, because you can thank the National Weat=
her Service for putting satellites up so your smartphones tell you whethe=
r to bring an umbrella or not. But we just take that for granted.=20



And if, out of those 2 million employees, one person screws up somewhere =
-- which every day you can count on somebody out of 2 million people prob=
ably doing something they shouldnt be doing -- thats whats going to get r=
eported on. Now, that helps keeps government on its toes and accountable.=
 But one of the things we have to think about is how do we tell a story a=
bout the things we do together that actually work so that people dont fee=
l so cynical overall.=20



But look, heres the bottom line, is that -- lets take the political proce=
ss. As cynical as everybody is, and everybody is always trying to come up=
 with these radical new plans to try to fix our democracy, and we need to=
 do this and we need to do that -- the truth is, is that part of the reas=
on why our government doesnt work as well is because in a good presidenti=
al year, slightly more than half the people vote who are eligible, and th=
e other half dont. And during an off-year election, when the President is=
 not at the top of the ticket, and people arent getting as much attention=
, 40 percent of the people vote.=20



Now, this system doesnt work if people opt out. And the easiest cure, the=
 simplest cure for what ails our democracy is everybody voting. Now, its =
true that there are some states that purposely make it hard for people to=
 vote. Were the only major democracy in the world that actively makes it =
hard for people to vote. And so you should be, particularly in your stude=
nt newspapers, as you go back to your home states, you should be asking w=
hy is it that we have laws that are purposely making it harder for people=
 to vote, purposely making it harder for young people to vote.



And theres a political agenda there. The people in power dont want things=
 to change. They want cynicism, because obviously the existing system, as=
 frustrating as it is for everybody else, works for them. Well, if you wa=
nt to upend that, weve got to vote.



But even in those states that purposely make it harder to vote, the truth=
 of the matter is, on your college campuses, half the folks, maybe two-th=
irds of the folks who dont vote dont vote because theyre just not paying =
attention. They dont consider it important. And theyre not willing to tak=
e the 15 minutes or half hour that it takes to make sure that youre regis=
tered and make sure you actually vote.



Well, if you care about climate change, you care about college costs, you=
 care about career opportunities, you care about war and peace and refuge=
es, you cant just complain. Youve got to vote. And whats interesting is, =
is young people as a voting bloc are the least likely to vote, but when y=
ou do vote, have the biggest impact on elections.=20



During a presidential year, young people account for like 19 percent of t=
he total vote. During an off-year election, when folks arent paying as mu=
ch attention, they account for 12 percent. And that means that the kinds =
of candidates that get elected and the priorities that they reflect are e=
ntirely different, just based on whether or not you guys are going to the=
 polls.



So dont let people tell you that what you do doesnt matter. It does. Dont=
 give away your power. That should be the main message that you deliver a=
ll the time. And it doesnt matter whether youre a Republican, Democratic,=
 independent; whether youre conservative on some issues, liberal on other=
s. If you participate and you take the time to be informed about the issu=
es, and you actually turn out and your peers turn out, you change the cou=
ntry. You do. It may not always happen as fast as youd like, but youll ch=
ange it.



So Ill keep on talking about this even after I leave the presidency. You =
got me started. I went on a rant, didnt I? (Laughter.)=20



All right. So Im counting on you guys. Dont let me down, all right? Dont =
let the country down. You guys are going to be delivering the message to =
your peer group that this is the greatest country on Earth, but only beca=
use we have great citizens who are willing to invest their time and energ=
y and effort to become informed on the issues, to argue about it in a res=
pectful way, and to try to collectively solve the many challenges that we=
 face.



The good news is, is that there are no challenges, as JFK said, that man =
creates that man cant solve. I would add women to that. (Laughter.)=20



All right? Good luck, guys. Bye-bye. (Applause.)=20

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">3:53 P.M. EDT<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I hear=
 there's some hotshot journalists here.&nbsp; Josh was speaking for me, and=
 I wanted to make sure he was getting it right.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How's it going, everybody?&=
nbsp; Are you guys having an interesting time here?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Was Jo=
sh thorough in his briefing?&nbsp; Well, I heard you guys were around today=
, so I wanted to stop by and say hello.&nbsp; I also have a bit of breaking=
 news for you, and then I might take some questions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I overheard Josh talking ab=
out student loans, and I know that's a big priority for a lot of your liste=
ners and readers. And that's one of the reasons why my administration has s=
pent a lot of time focused on college affordability.&nbsp;
 So we expanded Pell grants to make sure that more young people could acces=
s it.&nbsp; We created the Pay As You Earn program that ensures that people=
 can cap the amount that they're repaying on their loans each month, so tha=
t young people who want to go into jobs
 that aren&#8217;t as lucrative are still able to pursue their passions and=
 their dreams while managing their debt load.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I want to announce th=
at we're aiming to enroll 2 million more people in Pay As Your Earn by this=
 time next year, and you can find out how at StudentLoans.gov/repay.&nbsp; =
That's StudentLoans.gov/repay.&nbsp; And we're also going to be
 making some additional announcements about how we're going to get our agen=
cies coordinating so that, as young people are managing their student loan =
debt, there's one-stop shopping, they can figure out how to do it, and they=
 can make sure that there are consumer
 protections in terms of how they're being treated in the repayment process=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I have you here, I mi=
ght as well mention a couple of other things.&nbsp; You may have heard that=
 there is a Supreme Court vacancy.&nbsp; For those of you who have been stu=
dying our system of government, we have three branches, and one
 of the most important is the judiciary.&nbsp; And right now, our Supreme C=
ourt is absent one sitting member, with the passing of Justice Scalia.&nbsp=
; I've nominated an individual named Merrick Garland, who's currently the C=
hief Judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals,
 which is the second most important court in the land.&nbsp; By all account=
s, he's extremely well-qualified.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And traditionally, what's=
 happened is, is that the Senate then, exercising its constitutional duties=
 of advice and consent, will meet with the judge and then have a hearing fo=
r him, and then have a vote.&nbsp; In part
 because politics have gotten so polarized lately, and the importance of th=
is seat, so far at least the Republican Leader on the Senate side, Mitch Mc=
Connell, has refused to have the Republican caucus meet with him and schedu=
le an actual vote.&nbsp; Although, to
 their credit, there have been a number of Republicans who have broken rank=
s and gone ahead and met with Judge Garland.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I mention this because I =
think it's important for all of you, while you're in town, and many of you =
who are going to end up being journalists covering important national polic=
y, to recognize that our system only
 works when, even when we have big disagreements, even when there are big p=
olicy disputes, there's still a willingness to follow the rules and treat p=
eople fairly -- especially those who are on the other side of the debate.&n=
bsp; That's something that's been lost
 a little bit in this town of late.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I said at my State of=
 the Union address, my hope is, is that despite some of the unusual rhetori=
c that we've been hearing during this presidential campaign, that it's youn=
g people like you who are going to restore
 that sense of us being able to work together and make this democracy funct=
ion effectively.&nbsp; And journalists play a critical role in that.&nbsp; =
Sometimes both Josh and I probably have our disagreements with the press co=
rps, and feel picked on or misunderstood,
 but the truth of the matter is -- and I've said this before -- what separa=
tes us out in part from a lot of other countries in the world is we've got =
this incredible free press that pokes and prods and calls into account our =
leaders.&nbsp; And that is how we can
 make sure that leaders are accountable to the people who elect them.&nbsp;=
 And that's how we make sure that you don&#8217;t see major abuses of power=
.&nbsp; And when you do, that, in fact, the American people know about it a=
nd are able to make changes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so you guys are going=
 to have a critical role, those of you who end up following journalism.&nbs=
p; I hope many of you do.&nbsp; I want to thank the White House Press Corps=
, because I understand they gave you a lot of
 time today.&nbsp; And some of the best journalists in the country operate =
here.&nbsp; I normally don&#8217;t say nice things about them in front of t=
hem -- (laughter) -- but I figured since they took the time to work with yo=
u, I wanted to make sure to acknowledge the great
 work that they are doing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All right?&nbsp; So with =

&nbsp; Right here, in the red tie.&nbsp; But I may get to you, too.<o:p></o=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. P=
resident, it's a pleasure to meet you.&nbsp; My name is Dan Corey, and I'm =
the Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Targum, the second-oldest college newspape=
r in the United States.&nbsp; And it serves the Rutgers University-New
 Brunswick community.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Outs=
tanding.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We re=
cently ran a student referendum to keep our presence on campus.&nbsp; We've=
 asked and we're allowed to continue publishing.&nbsp; And we're actually g=
oing to reach a historic 150 years of publication.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Cong=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; You'=

st pretend like this is routine.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,=
 in light of the news of you speaking at our commencement, I was wondering,=
 would you be interested in being interviewed by our newspaper?<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; That=
's a good use of your time right there.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I have to s=
ay that normally I coordinate carefully with my press team before we grant =
interviews, but I am favorably disposed towards giving
 you a little bit of time.&nbsp; It may not be a really long interview, but=
 I figure we can give the college newspaper a little bit of play.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That's=
 a good idea.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; All =
right.&nbsp; Young lady, right here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. P=
resident, it's an absolute pleasure.&nbsp; My question is, you announced th=
e other day that you'll be visiting Flint, Michigan, based on a letter rece=
ived from a young girl.&nbsp; What are you planning to do during
 your visit there?&nbsp; And have you heard from the girl in response to yo=
ur visit?&nbsp; And if possible, after, may I take a photo with you?&nbsp; =
(Laughter.)
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; The =
photo I can't do, because if I do, then I've got a long line.&nbsp; But I w=
ill be visiting Flint.&nbsp; And obviously, since the news of the terrible =
things that have been taking place there -- the lead
 in the drinking water and the potential health hazards, as well as the peo=
ple who were responsible for the health and safety of those residents not c=
arrying out their duties the way they need to -- I think it's important not=
 only for us to have responded as
 we have, with FEMA -- that's the Federal Emergency Management Agency that =
responds to a lot of problems like this -- it's important not only that we =
are helping the city plan over the long term, but I think it's also importa=
nt for me to shine a spotlight on
 the fact that Flint, although extreme, is not unique; that we have underin=
vested in some of our basic infrastructure that we rely on for our public h=
ealth.&nbsp; And hopefully it will give me a chance to speak to the nation =
as a whole about how we need to ensure
 that our air is clear, our water is clean, and that our kids are safe.&nbs=
p; And I hope I get a chance to meet that young lady, as well.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All right, young man righ=
t here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello=
, it's a pleasure.&nbsp; I'm Jesse Yamba (ph) from the University of North =
Texas, and I just had some questions for you.&nbsp; First of all, what is y=
our proudest achievement you've achieved here in these eight
 years?&nbsp; And after January 20th, what are your goals or plans after yo=
u leave the White House?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well=
, I'm proud of a lot of stuff:&nbsp; Providing health insurance to 20 milli=
on people who didn&#8217;t have it, and setting us on a path where hopefull=
y everybody has health insurance that's affordable and
 high quality.&nbsp; I'm proud about the work we did to save the economy.&n=
bsp; Because right after I came in, we were in freefall and could have expe=
rienced a worldwide depression.&nbsp; I'm proud of the reforms we've done o=
n Wall Street to make sure that the recklessness
 that led to the crisis hopefully doesn&#8217;t happen again.&nbsp; <o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I'm proud of the work we'=
ve done in education to make sure that millions of kids who previously coul=
dn&#8217;t afford to go to college can, and that in addition to the work we=
've done on student debt and reducing that,
 we've also been doing things to make the process of encouraging young peop=
le to go to college easier.&nbsp; And this is a good time for me to give a =
shout-out to the First Lady, who, as many of you know, just this week had h=
er annual signup, getting young people
 to apply for the FAFSA form that is the gateway for you to be able to get =
financial aid.&nbsp; She was up in New York, but it was I think 1,000 parti=
cipants nationwide who are helping to let young people know, if are willing=
 to work hard and have a vision for your
 future, then nothing is preventing you from getting the kind of higher edu=
cation that you need.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I'm proud of all that =
stuff.&nbsp; Probably the thing I'm most proud of is, mainly as the assista=
nt to Michelle Obama -- (laughter) -- I've raised two daughters who are ama=
zing and I'm really, really proud of.&nbsp; And
 being able to do that while still focused on my job I think is something I=
'll look back on and appreciate.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I'm really busy right now=
, so I'm not thinking too much about after the presidency.&nbsp; Typically,=
 Presidents build libraries, but I'm more interested in the programming, no=
t just the building.&nbsp; And I'm very confident
 that a lot of the programming that I do will relate to young people and ho=
w I can encourage them to get involved in civic life.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Let's see.&nbsp; I'm tryi=
ng to alternate boy-girl-boy-girl here, just to be fair.&nbsp; The young la=
dy right there, in the red.&nbsp; Yes, you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey -=
-<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hey!=
&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My na=
me is Daniela Orteza (ph) and I'm reporting for Ole Miss at the University =
of Mississippi.&nbsp; And pending the Supreme Court's decision, will this a=
dministration take further action on immigration?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; As y=
ou know, we took some initial steps to try to make a more rational, smarter=
 immigration process.&nbsp; Our immigration system has been broken for quit=
e some time.&nbsp; On the one hand, you've had some
 serious work by our administration and previous administrations to slow th=
e flow of undocumented workers across the border, to strengthen border secu=
rity, to improve how we manage the influx of folks who come in by air, and =
to make sure that they're not overstaying
 their visas and so forth.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">On the other hand, we als=
o want to remind everybody this is a nation of immigrants, and immigration =
has been a source of strength for our country, and that we have people here=
 who may not have initially come here
 legally, but have since that time put down roots, raised families.&nbsp; T=
hey're our neighbors, they're our friends.&nbsp; They may be, in some cases=
, seeing their sons and daughters go off to war in our country's uniform, a=
nd that it doesn&#8217;t make sense for us to simply
 pretend like we're going to send all those folks out, and instead we shoul=
d bring them out of the shadows and give them a chance to earn legal reside=
nce and ultimately citizenship.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we put forward a plan.=
&nbsp; Part of it we were able to implement -- the DREAM Act kids who we we=
re able to make sure were treated like the young Americans that they are.&n=
bsp; We then had an additional program through
 administrative action that the Supreme Court put a stay on -- or the lower=
 courts put a stay on, and is about to go to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; In pa=
rt, the process takes a long time generally.&nbsp; With the Supreme Court o=
ne justice short, it will be interesting to
 see whether or not they can come to a ruling or whether they arrive at a t=
ie -- a 4-4 tie.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t know yet.&nbsp; That's pending.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In the meantime, we're st=
ill implementing a number of reforms and changes to make the legal immigrat=
ion system smoother, not as expensive, fairer to people, to treat families =
with more respect.&nbsp; We have changed
 our priorities in terms of enforcement so that we're not deporting and sep=
arating families as much, and more focused on going after criminals and peo=
ple who pose a security threat to the community.&nbsp; But our hands are a =
little bit tied on some of the bigger
 things until the Supreme Court rules.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, even if we do all th=
at, it's critically important that we still push Congress to pass legislati=
on -- because my executive orders can be overturned by the next President.&=
nbsp; And the only way to have a permanent
 solution to this problem is for the kind of legislation to pass that we sa=
w the Senate actually pass on a bipartisan basis that would continue to str=
engthen border security, but also give a pathway to citizenship for those w=
ho had been here for quite some
 time.&nbsp; That way we can be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants=
, and it is the right thing to do.&nbsp; I am not optimistic about us getti=
ng the legislation done before I leave, given the makeup of this Congress, =
but I think this is going to be a major issue
 in the election and people need to pay attention to it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All right, I'm going to t=
ake two more.&nbsp; Two more questions.&nbsp; Let's see.&nbsp; You're all v=
ery good-looking people, I've got to say.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; This gent=
leman over here.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t forgotten about you over there.&nbsp=
;
 Go ahead.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wor=
k for the Indiana News Student at Indiana University.&nbsp; My question is =
about the Syrian refugees.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I th=
ought you were going to ask about basketball wins.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ca=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No, =
go ahead.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the deadline for your pledge to let in 10,000 Syrian=
 refugees gets kind of closer, starting to creep up on us, it looks kind of=
 iffy whether that&#8217;s going to be made.&nbsp; Do you have any plans to=
 speed up that flow or encourage more Syrian refugees coming
 into the country?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re going to keep on pushing.&nbsp; And =
part of what has made this challenging is that we want to make sure that we=
 can, as much as possible, provide the American people an assurance that ev=
erybody here has been vetted at a very high standard.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

As you will recall, there was a lot of emotions around our initial announce=
ment that we should be admitting some Syrian refugees, and people making cl=
aims that somehow this would be letting potential terrorists onto our shore=
s.&nbsp; The truth of the matter is,
 is that the refugee process generally is much more rigorous in its screeni=
ng and its vetting than the average tourist who comes in here.&nbsp; These =
are people who themselves have been victims of terrorism, and victims of in=
credible violence and suffering at the
 hands of the Assad regime in Syria.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
It is the right thing to do.&nbsp; Our closest friends and allies, like Can=
ada, like Germany and other European countries, as well as countries border=
ing Syria like Turkey and Jordan, have taken on an enormous burden.&nbsp; A=
nd as the most powerful nation on Earth, it&#8217;s
 important for us to do our duty as well here, our humanitarian obligation.=
&nbsp; And it&#8217;s important for us to send a signal around the world th=

So administratively, I think now we have the process to speed it up.&nbsp; =
There may be efforts on the part of Congress to try to block us, but our go=
al is to continue to try to make the case to Congress and to the American p=
eople this is the right thing to do.&nbsp;
 And we believe that we can hit those marks before the end of the year.<o:p=

More broadly, one of the things we&#8217;re going to be doing is, at the Un=

Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President, for joining us here today.&nb=
sp; In light of your Pell grant announcement today, it seems like a central=
 tenet of your administration&#8217;s strategy in addressing college afford=
ability is increasing access to grants and loans.&nbsp; How sustainable
 would you say the strategy is in addressing the long-term rising trends of=
 the cost of college?<o:p></o:p></p>

THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a great question.&nbsp; It is not sustain=
able if the overall cost of college keeps on going up as fast as it&#8217;s=
 going up.&nbsp; So one of the things that we have to do, even as we make s=
ure that we&#8217;re providing more access to grants, keeping loans
 manageable, interest rates at a reasonable level, we still have to work wi=
th colleges and universities to figure out new ways to reduce costs.&nbsp; =
And we&#8217;ve actually seen universities around the country begin experim=
ents that are having some impact.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll just
 give you a couple of examples.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

I made an announcement a while back about our initiative for making the fir=
st two years of community college free.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something that i=
s affordable for most states to do, and we are prepared to help with federa=
l support.&nbsp; If we are able to do that -- and
 we could just close a few loopholes that corporations currently use to avo=
id paying taxes to pay for it -- then for a large proportion of young peopl=
e who either get their primary or secondary school education from a communi=
ty college, or started at community
 college and then transferred to a four-year university for graduation, the=
ir costs are being cut anywhere from half to 100 percent, down to zero.&nbs=
p; And this is something achievable.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
Now, Congress has not moved on our proposal.&nbsp; But what we&#8217;ve als=
o seen is that there have been 27 jurisdictions around the country that hav=
e taken us up on this challenge and are doing it themselves, are figuring o=
ut ways to make this happen.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s one
 example.<o:p></o:p></p>

A second example.&nbsp; Some of you, because I can tell that you guys were =
high-achieving, type A folks -- (laughter) -- unlike the kind of slacker ki=
d that I was -- (laughter) -- some of you, I suspect, were taking college-c=
redit courses while you were in high
 school.&nbsp; And what we&#8217;ve seen is a number of high school systems=
, or public school systems partner with community colleges and universities=
 so that they make arrangements.&nbsp; You start taking your college credit=
s while in high school, and you extend your -- what
 seems like high school for an extra year, and when you graduate you now ha=
ve an associate&#8217;s degree, so you have the equivalent of a community c=
ollege degree.&nbsp; When you then go to a four-year institution, you have =
enough credits that you can graduate in three
 years instead of four.&nbsp; That, again, by eliminating one year, means t=
hat you&#8217;ve just reduced your costs significantly.&nbsp;

There&#8217;s been discussion of how can we use technology to cut costs -- =
are there ways in which we can take the best practices of online learning a=
nd make that more accessible for young people who may not have the luxury o=
f being on a campus for four years with
 room and board; might have to work part time because they need to help the=
ir families or support themselves, are there ways that we can make that wor=

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
And we have to be careful about that because there have been some for-profi=
t institutions that, frankly, haven&#8217;t done a very good job.&nbsp; The=
y take the money, but the young person who is taking classes with them does=
n&#8217;t end up getting a degree that&#8217;s useful for
 them getting a job, and then they have problems repaying their loans.&nbsp=
; But there&#8217;s no doubt that, if done well, that technology potentiall=
y can reduce costs.&nbsp;

And then we&#8217;re talking to colleges and universities about what are th=
e contributors to these higher costs.&nbsp; And this may be sensitive to so=
me folks, but I&#8217;ve said this before -- if you have the option of cutt=
ing your college costs in half but your dorm rooms
 aren&#8217;t quite as nice, or the sports facilities or the student center=
 of the cafeteria aren&#8217;t as good, is that a deal you&#8217;re willing=
 to take?&nbsp; And can we figure out how to empower more parents and more =
students to demand a lower-cost option that still gives
 you a great education but maybe doesn&#8217;t have all the bells and whist=
les to it.&nbsp; <o:p>

And that&#8217;s part of the reason why we&#8217;ve put forward this colleg=
e report card.&nbsp; The idea is just -- it provides you online data so tha=

to see, all right, what are the costs, what are the graduation
 rates -- all the indicators and benchmarks of getting good value for what =

And this has been a long-term trend of ever-rising college costs.&nbsp; The=
 good news is, is that through the work that we&#8217;ve done over the last=

 started to go in a better direction.&nbsp; They were skyrocketing.&nbsp; S=

 of the policies that we&#8217;ve engaged in.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re going t=

 we&#8217;re doing a smarter, better job in order for the people who are co=

Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier today, one thing we talked about was civic enga=
gement, and a line was used in the State of the Union address of &#8220;don=
&#8217;t give into the cynicism of the day.&#8221;&nbsp; A poll released by=
 Reuters yesterday shows that nearly half of Americans feel that the electi=
ons
 are rigged in some way.&nbsp; Is there any goal or plan of the administrat=
ion to help revitalize the faith in democracy that seems to be lacking?<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, you know what, this is something that I&#8217;ve=
 tried to do ever since I got into public office.&nbsp; As you know, I came=
 into this work as a community organizer and strongly believed that our dem=
ocracy only works when people participate.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
There are a lot of forces that feed cynicism.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s no di=
spute that our democracy is not working as well as it should.&nbsp; I can t=
ell you some of the reasons for that.&nbsp; One of it is that we have set u=
p a system for electing state legislatures and members
 of Congress that involve the drawing of district lines that are gerrymande=
red.&nbsp; For those of you who are unfamiliar with the phrase, it basicall=
y means that those who are already in power draw the maps in such a way whe=
re they can be assured that these are
 either going to be Democratic seats or Republican seats.&nbsp; And what th=
at&#8217;s done is it&#8217;s made very few seats competitive.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
So, for example, in the last election, in 2012, Democrats actually cast sub=
stantially more votes in congressional elections, but ended up with substan=
tially fewer seats.&nbsp; And the reason for that is, in 2010, when the cen=
sus was done and re-districting of congressional
 and House legislative seats were drawn, Republican governors and Republica=
n majorities were responsible for drawing most of the seats.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
Now, I want to be clear, Democrats aren&#8217;t blameless on this, either.&=
nbsp; But California, for example, has gone to a process of nonpartisan dis=
tricting.&nbsp; The advantage there is not only do you make more seats comp=
etitive, but it also means that politicians have
 to compete for everybody&#8217;s votes because they&#8217;re not in safe s=
eats, they&#8217;re not in a safely Republican district or a Democratic dis=
trict.&nbsp; And what that does is it means they&#8217;ve got to not just a=
ppeal to the extremes of their party.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
Part of the reason we&#8217;ve seen polarization and gridlock here in Washi=
ngton is because there&#8217;s been this great sorting, and Democrats have =
moved much further -- have moved left.&nbsp; Republicans have just gone way=
 to the right.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s harder, then, to compromise,
 because members of Congress -- and the same thing is true in state legisla=
tures -- are always looking over their shoulder seeing if somebody in their=
 own party might challenge them.&nbsp; And then the system doesn&#8217;t wo=
rk.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
So that&#8217;s a big chunk of why people are cynical -- because they feel =
like their votes don&#8217;t count.&nbsp; And if you draw districts that ar=
e ironclad one party or another, then they&#8217;re not entirely wrong.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
Another reason that people are cynical is money in politics.&nbsp; The Supr=
eme Court issued a ruling -- Citizens United -- that allowed super PACs and=
 very wealthy individuals to just finance all these ads that you guys see o=
n TV all the time.&nbsp; Half the time nobody
 knows who&#8217;s funding them.&nbsp; And that makes you cynical partly be=
cause most of this money is spent on negative ads.&nbsp; So you&#8217;re ju=
st hearing constantly how horrible everybody is.&nbsp; That will make you f=
eel pretty bad about the political process.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
And I&#8217;m a strong believer in finding ways in which we can make the fi=
nancing of campaigns more democratic.&nbsp; Now, we&#8217;ve seen some inte=
resting work being done.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got to give Bernie Sanders, for=
 example, credit, building off some of the work that I did.&nbsp;
 I, in turn, built off the work that Howard Dean did for smaller donations,=
 grassroots donors to be able, in small contributions, to allow candidates =
to be competitive.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
But I think that -- we don&#8217;t want to leave that to chance.&nbsp; And =
that&#8217;s much harder to do for members of Congress who are lower profil=
e so they don&#8217;t get the sort of viral presence that allows them to ra=
ise that kind of money to compete.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re going to have
 to solve money in politics.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

You as journalists are going to have a role to play in reducing cynicism.&n=
bsp; It is very hard to get good stories placed.&nbsp; People will assign y=
ou stories about what&#8217;s not working.&nbsp; It&#8217;s very hard for y=
ou to write a story about, wow, this thing really works good.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
And just to take the federal government as an example, every day I&#8217;ve=
 got 2 million people who work for the federal government -- whether in our=
 military, our law enforcement, our environmental protection, et cetera -- =
and they&#8217;re doing great work.&nbsp; And you
 rely on it in all kinds of ways, including when you check the weather, bec=
ause you can thank the National Weather Service for putting satellites up s=
o your smartphones tell you whether to bring an umbrella or not.&nbsp; But =
we just take that for granted.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=
t-indent:.5in">
And if, out of those 2 million employees, one person screws up somewhere --=
 which every day you can count on somebody out of 2 million people probably=
 doing something they shouldn&#8217;t be doing -- that&#8217;s what&#8217;s=
 going to get reported on.&nbsp; Now, that helps keeps
 government on its toes and accountable.&nbsp; But one of the things we hav=
e to think about is how do we tell a story about the things we do together =
that actually work so that people don&#8217;t feel so cynical overall.&nbsp=
;
<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tex=

But look, here&#8217;s the bottom line, is that -- let&#8217;s take the pol=
itical process.&nbsp; As cynical as everybody is, and everybody is always t=
rying to come up with these radical new plans to try to fix our democracy, =
and we need to do this and we need to do that --
 the truth is, is that part of the reason why our government doesn&#8217;t =
work as well is because in a good presidential year, slightly more than hal=
f the people vote who are eligible, and the other half don&#8217;t.&nbsp; A=
nd during an off-year election, when the President
 is not at the top of the ticket, and people aren&#8217;t getting as much a=
ttention, 40 percent of the people vote.&nbsp;

Now, this system doesn&#8217;t work if people opt out.&nbsp; And the easies=
t cure, the simplest cure for what ails our democracy is everybody voting.&=
nbsp; Now, it&#8217;s true that there are some states that purposely make i=
t hard for people to vote.&nbsp; We&#8217;re the only major democracy
 in the world that actively makes it hard for people to vote.&nbsp; And so =
you should be, particularly in your student newspapers, as you go back to y=
our home states, you should be asking why is it that we have laws that are =
purposely making it harder for people
 to vote, purposely making it harder for young people to vote.<o:p></o:p></=

And there&#8217;s a political agenda there.&nbsp; The people in power don&#=
8217;t want things to change.&nbsp; They want cynicism, because obviously t=
he existing system, as frustrating as it is for everybody else, works for t=
hem.&nbsp; Well, if you want to upend that, we&#8217;ve got to vote.<o:p></=

But even in those states that purposely make it harder to vote, the truth o=
f the matter is, on your college campuses, half the folks, maybe two-thirds=
 of the folks who don&#8217;t vote don&#8217;t vote because they&#8217;re j=
ust not paying attention.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t consider it
 important.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re not willing to take the 15 minutes or h=

are about career opportunities, you care about war and peace and refugees, =
you can&#8217;t just complain.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got to vote.&nbsp; And wh=

During a presidential year, young people account for like 19 percent of the=
 total vote.&nbsp; During an off-year election, when folks aren&#8217;t pay=
