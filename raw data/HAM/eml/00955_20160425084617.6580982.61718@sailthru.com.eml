THE BIG IDEA:=C2=A0Tuesday will offer a valuable gauge of just how much jui=
ce Barack Obama has with Democrats in the eighth year of his presidency.

YORK, Pa.=E2=80=94Katie McGinty was running through the Pittsburgh airport =
last month when her phone rang with a number she didn=E2=80=99t recognize. =
The Democratic Senate candidate normally wouldn=E2=80=99t pick up, but she =
felt an urge to. It was Joe Biden, calling to say that he and President Oba=
ma wanted to endorse her.

At that point, she trailed in public and private polling to Joe Sestak. The=
 retired admiral and former congressman won the 2010 Democratic primary des=
pite Obama=E2=80=99s support for Arlen Specter, who had switched parties af=
ter realizing he could not get reelected as a Republican.

The race has moved in McGinty=E2=80=99s direction since Obama=E2=80=99s end=
orsement. With the primary tomorrow, polls now show a tight contest that co=
uld go either way. Monmouth University <http://link.washingtonpost.com/clic=

=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s been electrifying,=E2=80=9D McGinty said in an interv=

Stand Up

-- =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s going to have that much of a=
n effect,=E2=80=9D Sestak said in an interview. =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t get =
me wrong, I have the greatest respect for him =E2=80=A6 But I haven=E2=80=
=99t asked anyone for an endorsement.=E2=80=9D He complained that people ar=
e tired of back-room deals and power brokers telling them what to do.

As we spoke, though, his body man held a stack of flyers that included an o=
ld picture of Obama =E2=80=93 from before he became president =E2=80=93 cam=
paigning with Sestak when he was running for House. The flyer noted that he=
 =E2=80=9CPassed Obamacare=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CSupported President Obama=
=E2=80=99s 2009 stimulus bill.=E2=80=9D

Sestak has been running non-stop since he lost six years ago. He literally =
walked 422 miles across the state. He said he put 260,000 miles on his car =
and appeared at more than 800 events before even declaring his candidacy. T=
he relationships he=E2=80=99s made, he=E2=80=99s convinced, matter more tha=
n an endorsement from an out-of-stater, even the president.

Joe Sestak=C2=A0debates=C2=A0Katie McGinty=C2=A0(Abby Drey/Centre Daily Tim=
es via AP)

-- The winner of tomorrow=E2=80=99s primary will face Republican Sen. Pat T=
oomey this fall in one of the highest-profile and costliest congressional r=
aces of 2016. The Democratic establishment cannot stand Sestak. Party leade=
rs see him as ornery and unwilling to take advice. He says they=E2=80=99re =
trying to control him. They say he could not defeat Toomey because he=E2=80=
=99s not willing to run a professional campaign. The Democratic Senatorial =
Campaign Committee has spent more than $1 million on TV ads to help McGinty=
 through the primary.

-- The presidential primary, which Hillary Clinton is favored to win by dou=
ble digits, will drive up turnout. The state=E2=80=99s vastness puts a prem=
ium on television advertising, and McGinty has a greater than two-to-one ad=
vantage in the air war. Bob Casey, the state=E2=80=99s senior senator, said=
 he expects more than 1 million votes to be cast in the Democratic primary.=
 He said most of these voters do not have deep impressions of McGinty, who =
he supports, because local news has been so saturated with coverage of Dona=
ld Trump and the Republicans. He thinks that makes the president=E2=80=99s =
endorsement =E2=80=93 and ad =E2=80=93 more potent.

-- Democrats familiar with private polling say that 58 percent of likely pr=
imary voters in Pennsylvania hold a =E2=80=9Cvery positive=E2=80=9D view of=
 the president and 22 percent hold a =E2=80=9Csomewhat=E2=80=9D positive vi=
ew. The numbers, which came from a survey conducted at the very end of Marc=
h, mean that 8 in 10 likely voters have good vibes about POTUS. Biden got s=
imilar marks: 49 percent saw him =E2=80=9Cvery=E2=80=9D positively and 32 p=
ercent saw him =E2=80=9Csomewhat=E2=80=9D positively.

Private focus groups have shown that, while many Democrats are in an anti-e=
stablishment mood, base voters do not want to see Obama=E2=80=99s key legis=
lative accomplishments rolled back by Republicans. The president has tailor=
ed his messaging accordingly.

-- Focused on his legacy and trying to win back the Senate, Obama is more w=
illing to wade into contested Democratic primaries than he was in the past.=
 He endorsed Ted Strickland in Ohio and Patrick Murphy in Florida over riva=
ls to their left.

-- Bigger picture: What a difference two years makes. In 2014, Democrats ac=
ross the map were afraid to be seen with the president. Very few are now. T=
rying to re-activate his coalition, Hillary Clinton links herself with the =
president every chance she gets. It=E2=80=99s a constant reminder of how mu=
ch the atmospherics have changed since the midterms.

Another factor is that the battle for control of the Senate is being fought=
 in blue states this year. In 2014, Democrats had to defend seven seats in =
states Obama had lost in 2012. In 2016, Republicans must defend seven senat=
es in states Obama carried four years ago.

Barack Obama speaks at the NAACP's convention in Philadelphia last summer.=
=C2=A0(Reuters/Kevin Lamarque)

-- The Obama endorsement could make the biggest difference in the African A=
merican community. Hillary bested Obama by 9 points in the Pennsylvania Dem=
ocratic primary eight years ago. That year, exit polls showed African Ameri=
cans accounted for 13 percent of the electorate.

Sestak visited eight black church services yesterday. McGinty attended a mo=
ther-daughter communion event at her home church. =E2=80=9CThe bummer is, i=
n the Catholic Church, they don=E2=80=99t let you preach,=E2=80=9D she told=
 three retired school principals afterward.

She made the joke as she worked the brunch crowd at Relish, a popular hango=
ut in a heavily African American section of northwest Philadelphia. She was=
 accompanied by Gov. Tom Wolf, who hired her as his chief of staff after be=
ating her in a 2014 gubernatorial primary. They reminded diners that Obama=
=E2=80=99s supporting her.

On Saturday afternoon, both candidates spoke at an NAACP forum in York, abo=
ut 100 miles west of Philly.

Sestak repeatedly quoted Martin Luther King Jr. and said he could not have =
won the primary in 2010 without African American support. =E2=80=9CYou embr=
aced me when no one else did,=E2=80=9D he told a crowd of 75.

McGinty name-dropped Beyonc=C3=A9 and spoke about working to expand Medicai=
d and putting a moratorium on the death penalty. She read the names of acti=
vists she=E2=80=99d worked with off a cue card.

d at the end of her speech. =E2=80=9CBut his good wishes won=E2=80=99t carr=

-- A NEW PHASE IN THE GOP RACE: Ted=C2=A0Cruz and John=C2=A0Kasich are coor=
dinating in an effort to stop Donald Trump from clinching the nomination be=
fore Cleveland. With Trump favored to win all five states that=C2=A0vote=C2=

denced by a pro-Cruz TV ad released last week that urged voters not to back=

The backstory:=C2=A0The deal was discussed privately last week on the sidel=
ines of the Republican National Committee meeting in Florida=C2=A0and final=
ized yesterday in phone calls between Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe and Ka=
sich adviser John Weaver.=C2=A0

Both campaigns urged outside groups to follow their lead. The two campaigns=
 released statements=C2=A0within minutes of one another.=C2=A0This is what =
campaigning in a post Citizens United world looks like:
"We would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead," Roe sa=
id in his=C2=A0statement.=C2=A0   "We would expect independent third-party =
groups to do the same and honor the commitments made by the Cruz and Kasich=
 campaigns," Weaver said in his.
Reality check: This alliance would have been much=C2=A0more effective if th=
e campaigns had=C2=A0agreed to it a month ago. It might be too little, too =
late.

Could it backfire? There is a real risk that this will look like backroom d=
eal-making and boost Trump's case to voters that the establishment is tryin=
g to rig the race to stop him. It might galvanize his supporters.=C2=A0

blican Sen. Pat Toomey this fall in one of the highest-profile and costlies=
t congressional races of 2016. </strong>The Democratic establishment cannot=
 stand Sestak. Party leaders see him as ornery and unwilling to take advice=
. He says they=E2=80=99re trying to control him. They say he could not defe=
at Toomey because he=E2=80=99s not willing to run a professional campaign. =
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has spent more than $1 million=
 on TV ads to help McGinty through the primary.</p><p><strong>-- The presid=
ential primary, which Hillary Clinton is favored to win by double digits, w=
ill drive up turnout.</strong> The state=E2=80=99s vastness puts a premium =
on television advertising, and McGinty has a greater than two-to-one advant=
age in the air war. Bob Casey, the state=E2=80=99s senior senator, said he =
expects more than 1 million votes to be cast in the Democratic primary. He =
said most of these voters do not have deep impressions of McGinty, who he s=
upports, because local news has been so saturated with coverage of Donald T=
rump and the Republicans. He thinks that makes the president=E2=80=99s endo=
rsement =E2=80=93 and ad =E2=80=93 more potent.</p><p><strong>-- Democrats =
familiar with private polling say that 58 percent of likely primary voters =
in Pennsylvania hold a =E2=80=9Cvery positive=E2=80=9D view of the presiden=
t and 22 percent hold a =E2=80=9Csomewhat=E2=80=9D positive view.</strong> =
The numbers, which came from a survey conducted at the very end of March, m=
ean that 8 in 10 likely voters have good vibes about POTUS. Biden got simil=
ar marks: 49 percent saw him =E2=80=9Cvery=E2=80=9D positively and 32 perce=
nt saw him =E2=80=9Csomewhat=E2=80=9D positively.</p><p><strong>Private foc=
us groups have shown that, while many Democrats are in an anti-establishmen=
t mood, base voters do not want to see Obama=E2=80=99s key legislative acco=
mplishments rolled back by Republicans.</strong> The president has tailored=
 his messaging accordingly.</p><p><strong>-- Focused on his legacy and tryi=
ng to win back the Senate, Obama is more willing to wade into contested Dem=
ocratic primaries than he was in the past. </strong>He endorsed Ted Strickl=
and in Ohio and Patrick Murphy in Florida over rivals to their left.</p><p>=
<strong>-- Bigger picture: What a difference two years makes. </strong>In 2=
014, Democrats across the map were afraid to be seen with the president. Ve=
ry few are now. Trying to re-activate his coalition, Hillary Clinton links =
herself with the president every chance she gets. It=E2=80=99s a constant r=
eminder of how much the atmospherics have changed since the midterms.</p><p=
><strong>Another factor is that the battle for control of the Senate is bei=
ng fought in blue states this year.</strong> In 2014, Democrats had to defe=
nd seven seats in states Obama had lost in 2012. In 2016, Republicans must =
defend seven senates in states Obama carried four years ago.</p><img style=

Trump's case to voters that the establishment is trying to rig the race to =
