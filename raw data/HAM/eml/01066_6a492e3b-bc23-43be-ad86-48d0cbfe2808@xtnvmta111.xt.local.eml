GET SMART FAST - "Trump is not expanding the GOP ... [E]arly-voting data shows little evidence for one of the Republican nominee's core claims," by Shane Goldmacher: "While Trump's insurgent candidacy has spurred record-setting Republican primary turnout in state after state, the early statistics show that the vast majority of those voters aren't actually new to voting or to the Republican Party, but rather they are reliable past voters in general elections ... In Iowa, Republican caucus turnout smashed its past record by 50 percent ... [but] 95 percent of the 2016 caucus-goers had previously voted in at least one of the last four presidential elections - and almost 80 percent had voted in
 at least three of the last four."  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7c0bce190f62dec2f47125a29e4b544f59e423fbd516f33f110ac48d73a1b794

 

--"Trump creating committees to raise big money for GOP: The presumptive Republican nominee is finalizing details for vehicles that will allow him to raise money for other candidates," by Alex Isenstadt and Ken Vogel: "Trump's presidential campaign is poised to form a joint fundraising committee with the [RNC] and at least 10 state parties ... That committee would be able to accept maximum checks of at least $136,100 per person ... Plans call for a second joint committee that would include the Trump campaign and the GOP's two congressional campaign committees - the [NRSC] and the [NRCC] ... [which] would be able to accept maximum checks of at least $69,500 per person."

Fabrizio polled for Trump's opponent, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, earlier in the year and has also worked for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and GOP presidential candidates Bob Dole in 1996 and Rick Perry in 2012, and dozens of congressmen, senators and political groups." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7c0bce190f62dec24d98b15a11644df73239a1a15092234a0a5f70de83c8b7e3

TRUMP STRATEGERY - N.Y. Times A15, "Little to Be Off Limits as Trump Plans Attack on Clintons' Character: Democratic allies see another crucible of sordid and scandalous accusations," by Patrick Healy: "Trump plans to throw Bill Clinton's infidelities in Hillary Clinton's face on live television during the presidential debates this fall, questioning whether she enabled his behavior and sought to discredit the women involved. Mr. Trump will try to hold her accountable for security lapses at the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and for the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens there. And he intends to portray Mrs. Clinton as fundamentally corrupt ...

"Drawing on psychological warfare tactics that Mr. Trump used to defeat 'Lyin' Ted' Cruz, 'Little Marco' Rubio and 'Low-Energy' Jeb Bush in the Republican primaries, the Trump campaign is mapping out character attacks on the Clintons to try to increase their negative poll ratings and bait them into making political mistakes ... Another goal is to win over skeptical Republicans ... Attacking [the Clintons] could also deflect attention from Mr. Trump's vulnerabilities, such as his treatment of women." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=7c0bce190f62dec264bab6050e57deacd16ead036a8671440dcac389e3a74f53

THE BUZZ -- Chris Krueger, Guggenheim Securities Washington Strategist, headlines today's D.C. Download, "Portlandia: Oregon Ready to Feel the Bern -- Democratic Contested Convention Rising": "Bernie Sanders is going to win more contests this cycle than Hillary Clinton won in 2008 - and he could actually win more contests than Clinton in 2016. Sanders has won 20 contests ... with two more likely today [AP: "Ky. polls close at 6 p.m. EDT; Ore. voting deadline is 11 p.m. EDT"] and at least two more between the Virgin Islands, South Dakota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Montana, and California (New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and DC are very unlikely) thus far to Clinton's 26. Clinton won 23 contests in
 2008.

 

"Clinton has won nearly 56% of the popular vote to Sanders' 42.3% and Sanders still trails Clinton among bound delegates 1,719 TO 1,425, though it is now possible (however unlikely) that Sanders could go into Philadelphia (~40 days after the final primaries) with a lead in bound delegates. 19% of the total delegates are the Super Delegates who are overwhelmingly currently supporting Clinton 524-40 (out of 712). If Clinton does not hit the needed 2,382 in BOUND delegates before Philadelphia (926 still to be awarded - Clinton needs 67% of remaining bound delegates, which seems UNLIKELY), ... prepare for a hot mess in Philadelphia."

DESSERT -- NYT p. B4, "Fox Revives '24' With a New Leading Man, but a Familiar Look: In many ways '24' ushered in the era of binge viewing," by Brooks Barnes in L.A.: "Built by the same team of producers who turned the original series into a cultural touchstone ... '24: Legacy' will arrive in early 2017, with a debut after the Super Bowl. ... Early '24: Legacy' video ... revealed a lavish action series that is both the same (the ticking clock, the split screens, the against-all-odds heroism) and new: Instead of following the secret agent Jack Bauer, played by Kiefer Sutherland, the new show focuses on a young, tormented Army Ranger who is being hunted by terrorists."
