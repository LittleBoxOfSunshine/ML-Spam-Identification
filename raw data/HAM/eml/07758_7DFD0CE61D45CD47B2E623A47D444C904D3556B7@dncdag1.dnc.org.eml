How an old hotel covered with glass, underwritten by his father, became the=
 Donald=92s first big success as a =93self-made=94 man.


By Simon van Zuylen-Wood

May 12, 2016


On the evening of April 14, Donald Trump put on a tuxedo and delivered an u=
nusually restrained speech at the annual fundraising gala of the New York s=
tate Republican Party. Though the crucial New York primary was a week away,=
 Trump decided he wouldn=92t bother using his allotted 30 minutes to pump h=
is conservative credentials. =93Politics gets a little boring,=94 he told t=
he crowd of 300 political dignitaries. What he wanted to talk about was a b=
uilding.

Significantly for him, the party had booked its event at the Grand Hyatt Ho=
tel, which happens to be the very first building Trump developed, about 40 =
years ago. So Trump told the story of the hotel they sat in, of the deal th=
at would form the foundation of his real estate empire. =93It turned out,=
=94 he told the audience, more than once, =93to be a great, great, success =
as a hotel.=94


The point of Trump=92s speech at the Republican gala was not to tout the pr=
esent state of the Grand Hyatt, which he no longer owns, but to buff the le=
gend he peddles of himself as an underdog success story=97as a self-made ty=
coon who disproved the haters and remade the Manhattan skyline in his image=
. =93When I did the building, everybody said, =91Don=92t do it, it can=92t =
be done, never gonna happen,'=94 Trump said. =93My father, who was in Brook=
lyn and Queens =85 was so against me coming into Manhattan. And then this b=
ecame so successful, and he said, =91Wow.=92=94Of course, in New York, real=
 estate is politics. And few real estate deals in New York history were as =
laden with back-room negotiations as the one that permitted the renovation =
of a hulking commuter hotel into a luxe four-star affair. Wedged between th=
e Beaux Arts Grand Central Terminal and the art deco Chrysler Building, the=
 Grand Hyatt stands as a curious and very Trumpian amalgam: a turn-of-the-c=
entury brick building blanketed by sheets of mirrored, =9180s-era glass. It=
 could have been airlifted from Dallas. =93When he wanted to glaze the buil=
ding, I put up a big battle=97I was more interested in preserving the build=
ing,=94 the project=92s architect, Ralph Steinglass, told me recently. =93T=
rump sold [Hyatt] on the fact that he would be able to refashion the buildi=
ng, really recreate it into a bright, shiny object.=94

In truth, Fred C. Trump wasn=92t an obstacle to the deal. He was the main r=
eason the deal got done at all.

Fred Trump has surfaced periodically as a point of political contention. Do=
nald=92s erstwhile Republican opponents accused him of inheriting upward of=
 $200 million. This overinflated figure is about as misleading as Trump=92s=
 claim that all he ever received from dad was a =93small=94 million-dollar =
loan. In determining Fred Trump=92s influence on his son=92s success, thoug=
h, the exact numerical figure is at best a distraction. The Grand Hyatt rep=
resented Donald=92s entry into Manhattan, and to pull it off, Donald relied=
 not only on his father=92s cash, but his connections=97and this is not a T=
rumpian exaggeration=97to some of the most powerful politicians, lawyers an=
d bankers in New York. A decade later, when Donald=92s boardwalk empire in =
Atlantic City was underwater and the Grand Hyatt was looking un-Grand, Dona=
ld again needed Fred=92s resources to bail him out.

The inside story of the Grand Hyatt doesn=92t showcase the vaunted business=
 sense Trump credits with leading him to the threshold of the GOP president=
ial nomination. Rather, it reveals the crucial role Fred Trump played in ge=
tting his son=92s career off the ground, and keeping it airborne. Without F=
red=92s help, there would be no Hyatt. And without the Hyatt, there would b=
e no Trump Tower, no casinos, no golf courses, no career.

Still, there was something mischievously artful about Donald=92s Grand Hyat=
t coup, in which a 30-year-old aspiring playboy kick-started his entire car=
eer without a credit line or building to his name. When I asked Victor Palm=
ieri, the financier who sold to Trump the old commuter hotel that would bec=
ome the Grand Hyatt, which of the two men deserved the glory for the projec=
t, he laughed. =93Him or his dad?=94 he asked. It doesn=92t matter. That=92=
s the point. =93That=92s the art of the deal.=94

***

In 1971, 25-year-old Donald had moved out of Queens to a studio on 75th and=
 3rd Avenue and was growing restless in his role as a glorified rent-collec=
tor for his dad. =93I had to prove=97to the real estate community, to the p=
ress, to my father=97that I could deliver the goods,=94 he wrote of his ear=
ly ambitions, in The Art of the Deal.

That meant one thing. Doing a deal in Manhattan, the only borough high-prof=
ile enough to enable Trump to emerge from his father=92s shadow and ditch d=
ad=92s longtime Coney Island offices. And yet, to pull off a large-scale bi=
g city deal and leave the provinces behind, he=92d need to rely upon the de=
cades of carefully nurtured political influence that Fred Trump had acquire=
d in Brooklyn.

Fred Trump was a builder of middle-class, outer-borough homes, and nearly e=
very major project he developed=97from single-family houses in East Flatbus=
h to Trump Village in Coney Island=97was subsidized by tax dollars. Without=
 the Federal Housing Authority, Trump family biographer Gwenda Blair wrote,=
 =93Fred Trump would have been running a supermarket.=94

Fred Trump=92s biggest contracts came from the federal government, but his =
political clout was more pronounced at home. He lunched with a downtown Bro=
oklyn power-crowd known as the =93Knights of the Round Table=94 and was a V=
IP at the Madison Democratic Club, the nerve-center of Brooklyn politics. E=
arly on, he became close with legendary real estate lawyer and political fi=
xer Bunny Lindenbaum, along with Lindenbaum=92s best friend, a machine pol =
named Abe Beame, who in 1974 would become mayor of New York. Both would pro=
ve instrumental in his son=92s early career.

Meanwhile, Fred Trump built goodwill outside of Brooklyn=92s Borough Hall b=
y strategically spreading his cash and influence. He was a regular on the p=
hilanthropic circuit and held board seats at civic powerhouses like the Jam=
aica Hospital in Queens and the Brooklyn Borough Gas Company. By the time D=
onald had graduated from Wharton and entered the family business, Fred was =
also boosting the political fortunes of Brooklyn congressman and gubernator=
ial candidate Hugh Carey. In 1974, the year of the election, Fred Trump, hi=
s business, and his family gave a combined $35,000 to Carey; more than anyo=
ne except Carey=92s brother, a wealthy oil magnate.<http://www.villagevoice=

[New York Governor Hugh Carey points to an artists=92 conception of the new=
 New York Hyatt Hotel/Convention facility that will be build on the site of=
 the former Commordore Hotel, June 28, 1978. From left=96right: Donald Trum=
p, New York City Mayor Ed Koch, Gov. Carey, and Robert T. Dormer, executive=
 vice president of the Urban Development Corp.]Fred Trump=92s timing was go=
od. That same year, Donald set his sights on a shoddy, 2,000-room commuter =
hotel on 42nd street called the Commodore. His plan was to buy the dated 19=
19 brick colossus and refurbish it into a shiny Hyatt Hotel.

Young Donald was not an obvious business partner for the old money Pritzker=
s, who ran the Hyatt chain from their home base in Chicago. But Hyatt was o=
ne of the last major national chain without a New York City footprint. And =
the company=92s aesthetic=97in 1967 Atlanta=92s Hyatt Regency debuted the c=
oncept of the vertical atrium lobby=97jibed with Trump=92s.

There were just a few problems to resolve before groundbreaking. The neighb=
orhood was in awful shape. The iconic Chrysler was in foreclosure, Grand Ce=
ntral needed major refurbishments and the Commodore=92s entire stretch of s=
treet played seedy rival to the porn playground several blocks west in Time=
s Square. The building itself was about as unattractive a business proposit=
ion as one could imagine. Occupancy hovered around 50 percent. A wink-wink =
=93massage parlor=94 called Relaxation Plus occupied prime retail space on =
the second floor. If it weren=92t for an expensive union contract that mand=
ated the employees be paid, the hotel almost certainly would have closed. T=
he lobby was =93so dingy,=94 Trump later wrote, it looked like =93a welfare=
 hotel.=94

Which helps explain, ironically, why Trump became interested in the first p=
lace. The place had become such a roach motel, its owners were desperate fo=
r someone to take it off their hands. =93We were trying to find a way to de=
al with the Commodore, which was becoming derelict and was involved in a bi=
g labor dispute with hotel employees,=94 says Palmieri, the financier in ch=
arge of the assets of the Penn Central Railroad, which owned the hotel, and=
 which itself was in bankruptcy. =93It was a dire situation.=94 Palmieri sa=
ys Trump =93was not the most agreeable personality I had every met.=94 But =
he fit Palmieri=92s job description: =93someone who was young, who was very=
 knowledgeable about New York politics=97and particularly the politics gove=
rning zoning and tax abatements.=94

This last piece was crucial. Banks, in the =93Ford to City: Drop Dead=94 er=
a, were not forthcoming with loans. Especially not to developers with zero =
completed projects, and no serious cash to their names. In order to get any=
 kind of financing, Trump would need major help from the government. Lucky =
for him, Abe Beame=92s machine, newly installed in City Hall, seemed all to=
o happy to comply.

In late 1973, needing the city=92s assistance with another property, Trump =
scheduled a meeting at City Hall that included his father and Beame. A few =
minutes into the meeting, according to Blair=92s biography, Beame put his a=
rms around the Trumps and said, =93Whatever my friends Fred and Donald want=
 in this town, they get.=94 A similar dynamic was at work several months la=
ter, when Donald began agitating for the Commodore property.

Inspired in part by Donald=92s ambitions, Beame and Assembly Speaker Stanle=
y Steingut=97another old friend of Fred Trump=92s=97pushed a bill in Albany=
 that, conveniently, would have created 20-year tax abatements for commerci=
al properties like the one Trump was trying to develop. When that bill stal=
led and ultimately died upstate, Donald Trump worked with a well-connected =
City Hall bureaucrat named Mike Bailkin to create an even more favorable de=
al for himself. Bailkin=92s ingenious idea was for the state-run Urban Deve=
lopment Corporation (UDC)=97created in the 1960s by Governor Nelson Rockefe=
ller to develop racially integrated housing by fiat=97to buy the place from=
 Trump for a nominal fee of a dollar, then lease it back to him tax-free fo=
r 40 years, saving him hundreds of millions of dollars.

In a city where nobody was building much of anything, granting an unprecede=
nted tax abatement to a private developer=97no commercial property in New Y=
ork had ever received one=97might have seemed like smart public policy. But=
 the serious consideration New York=92s political firmament gave the deal s=
uggests that Fred Trump=92s behind-the-scenes influence was at least as imp=
ortant a factor as any good governance. The Beame administration doubled as=
 a =93palace circle of real estate people,=94 says former Manhattan City Co=
uncilman Henry Stern, one of the few who criticized the deal at the time. =
=93It was clear that [the Trumps] had enormous clout.=94 When I asked him w=
hy so few opposed the tax break, he replied that most of his City Council c=
olleagues were =93part of the Democratic machine=94 and that the rest =93ju=
st didn=92t care.=94

Trump, by inheriting several of his father=92s best people=97longtime New Y=
ork publicist Howard Rubenstein; Brooklyn lawyer Lindenbaum and his son San=
dy, Lindenbaum=92s equal as a real estate savant=97inherited his father=92s=
 credibility. And Donald certainly cultivated a handful of key contacts him=
self=97most notably Roy Cohn, the political fixer and notorious legal hit m=
an for red-baiting Senator Joe McCarthy. Cohn represented the Trump Organiz=
ation in a massive federal housing discrimination case, before helping brok=
er the Hyatt deal with Beame, with whom he was also friendly.

But nothing could match the persuasive power of Fred in the flesh. In 1975,=
 after talks about the tax deal started to get serious, another meeting was=
 called at which both Mayor Beame and Fred Trump would personally appear. A=
ccording to Wayne Barrett=92s exhaustive book Trump: The Deals and the Down=
fall, Fred promised the group he would keep watch over the construction. Mo=
re significantly, he pledged to =93provide financial credibility.=94

All Trump needed now was for the state=97through the UDC=97to greenlight th=
e deal. Once again, he leaned on his father=92s connections. Donald Trump h=
ad recently hired as his political point person a woman the Trumps would ha=
ve been familiar with=97Governor Carey=92s chief fundraiser, Louise Sunshin=
e. In the mid-1970s, the UDC was helmed by Richard Ravitch, the New York Ci=
ty real estate stalwart whose family company helped build Trump Village. In=
 theory, Ravitch should have been well-disposed to The Donald. In practice,=
 he wasn=92t. Ravitch told me that one morning he received a phone call fro=
m Sunshine, whose child attended the same preschool as his. She wanted to k=
now if she could bring in Trump for a meeting. He agreed, and Trump pitched=
 his plan. It went badly.

Ravitch was already irked that Sunshine, a Democratic fundraiser and state =
party official, was lobbying on behalf of a private client. He didn=92t tak=
e kindly to Trump=92s bluster. =93He wanted to buy the Commodore and wanted=
 a tax exemption, and couldn=92t get the tax exemption,=94 Ravitch recalls.=
 =93I finally said, =91Look, it would be great to have a Hyatt Hotel. I wou=
ld be willing to subordinate the taxes to the mortgage. And he said, =91No,=
 I want an exemption. If you don=92t give it to me, I=92ll have you fired.=
=94 Ravitch booted them both from his office.

Ravitch did not, in fact, get fired. Even with his father=92s pull, Trump d=
idn=92t have that much juice. But Ravitch was getting heavy pressure from B=
eame and his team to OK the deal. =93=91Look, here was the city on the ball=
s of its ass in the fall of 1975,=94 he remembers telling economic developm=
ent czar John Zuccotti in a tense argument. =93And here was this brash kid =
who wanted to take the Commodore hotel and turn it into a Hyatt.=94 Accordi=
ng to Barrett=92s biography, Ravitch eventually caved and voted in favor of=
 the deal. (Ravitch claims he doesn=92t remember this.) When a reporter ask=
ed Trump why the city handed him a 40-year abatement, he replied, =93Becaus=
e I didn=92t ask for 50.=94

By 1976, the $4-million-a-year abatement (it would grow progressively more =
valuable) was his. But even once he got the tax break, Trump still needed a=
ctual money to buy and renovate the thing. His financial broker went huntin=
g for lenders on Wall Street and had come up empty. Fred Trump, once again,=
 wound up doing the heavy lifting. There was of course the famous million-d=
ollar loan. But there was also Fred=92s decades-old contact at Equitable Li=
fe Insurance, whose support Barrett reports<https://www.amazon.com/Trump-Gr=
eatest-Earth-Downfall-Reinvention-ebook/dp/B01ECUXPIM> was key to the firm=
=92s decision to help finance the project. And it was Fred Trump and Hyatt =
chief Jay Pritzker, not Donald, who guaranteed the project=92s $70 million =
construction loan. (Donald and the Pritzkers would co-own the hotel.)

When the project ran over budget in the run-up to its 1980 opening, accordi=
ng to Gwenda Blair=92s biography, it was Fred who persuaded his pals at Cha=
se Bank to give Donald a $35 million line of credit and a second mortgage w=
orth $30 million. =93When it counted, which was when they went for the fina=
ncing,=94 says Palmieri, =93his father turned up to be on the loans, which =
was really the vital part of the whole deal.=94 Donald may have conceived o=
f the deal, but when it came to closing it, Ralph Steinglass told me, Donal=
d =93had very little to do with pulling it off.=94

Once ground was broken on the Hyatt, though, it was quite clearly Donald=92=
s baby. Fred Trump is still a household name in Coney Island thanks to his =
drab, sturdy, middle-class high-rises. Donald, with an arriviste=92s taste =
for silk suits and patent leather shoes, brought his mania for appearance t=
o bear on the project. He had married the former Ivana Zelnickova Winklmayr=
 in 1977, a year before construction began, and promptly installed her as a=
 sort of foreman/interior designer hybrid. =93Her taste was similar to Dona=
ld=92s (=93brassy, flashy=94) but she was actually more aggressive than he =
was,=94 Steinglass, then with Gruzen & Partners, recalls. =93She inserted h=
erself into the weekly owner=92s meeting and would be pushing back against =
the contractor. It wasn=92t fun.=94 At the time, New York magazine=92s Mari=
e Brenner observed Ivana in heels, a dress and a hard-hat, sidestepping pud=
dles of water and roaring at construction workers.

The structure that the Trumps produced was both ingenious and bizarre. The =
Hyatt was coated with a silvery, reflective glass that set it apart from th=
e classic structures surrounding it, while simultaneously reflecting them b=
ack toward the street. Its most unique feature, for better or for worse, wa=
s the cantilevered bar/restaurant that bulged over 42nd Street. For all its=
 innovations, though, the Hyatt is not a modern building but an old brick s=
tructure that Trump simply plastered with large glass panels. To make it se=
em taller, Trump redid the elevator buttons so guests' rooms begin on floor=
 =9314=94 rather than on floor 6, where they are actually situated. Trump e=
ven finagled a more chic Park Avenue address for the hotel, though, as he a=
dmitted during the speech in April, =93it really fronted on 42nd street.=94

The Grand Hyatt, named for the train station next door, opened on a Septemb=
er night in 1980. At the ceremony, which heralded Trump=92s arrival as much=
 as it did New York=92s 1980s comeback, leggy blonds bore trays of champagn=
e and escargots en brioche. Bronze-hued marble competed with bronze-mirrore=
d columns.Veau aux trois champignons was served, incongruously, on gold Myl=
ar tablecloth. Ivana, according to Brenner=92s memorable account, sat by he=
rself in a rhinestone-encrusted dress while Donald zipped around antically,=
 unable to sit still. Roy Cohn was there, of course, as was Governor Carey,=
 who had benefited from Fred Trump=92s campaign generosity and whose state =
agency had provided the key approval for the deal.

The Trumps=92 expensive taste=97 gold lion=92s head medallions hung above t=
he ballroom entrance, not far from the obligatory waterfall, babbling in th=
e atrium=97helped mask the lurking infrastructure problems that would come =
to plague the hotel. =93It was never a great building,=94 Paul Goldberger, =
the former New York Timesarchitecture critic, says about the old Commodore =
shell. And Trump seemed unwilling to make it so. =93The emphasis was on kee=
ping the cost down, to the detriment of the quality of the project,=94 says=
 Steinglass, who told me the guest rooms generally paled in comparison with=
 the glitz of the atrium. (Fred Trump, for what it=92s worth, could be seen=
 during construction patrolling the work site, pouring water into paint buc=
kets to save money<https://books.google.com/books?id=3DPmrwtRTQ3fMC&pg=3DPA=

=3Dbucket&f=3Dfalse>.)

By the early 1990s, the hotel was betraying its cruddy Commodore roots. Acc=
ording to a 1991 inspection report that later surfaced in litigation betwee=
n Trump and the Pritzkers, the hotel needed at least $24 million worth of r=
epairs and renovations. A few typical excerpts from the report:

=93On floors 14 through 30 there is a tan carpet with a runner type pattern=
 in brown and tan. There are many wrinkles, stains and open seams.=94

=93A great deal of the bedding was sagging and in need of replacement=94

=93[sidewalk tiles] are dirty and worn in appearance=85there were also 22 s=
quares that were mismatched.=94


In 1990, AAA downgraded the hotel in its industry rankings. Meanwhile, the =
Pritzker family alleged, Trump was refusing to pay for any of the upkeep. =
=93Trump was cutting corners left and right,=94 says Goldberger. =93And the=
 Pritzkers=94=97who had endowed a prestigious architecture prize in 1979=97=
=93were increasingly becoming a well-known and prominent family with a grea=
t deal more money than Donald Trump, but with a desire to be taken seriousl=
y in other kinds of circles. They were less and less interested in being in=
 partnership with Donald, who was both glitzy and down-market.=94

At the heart of the problem was Trump=92s cratering casino empire. After a =
series of financial missteps connected to the bloated $1 billion, junk-bond=
-funded construction of the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump=92s third and largest At=
lantic City property, Trump declared bankruptcy in 1991 on several casinos =
and the Plaza Hotel in New York, which he also then owned. His net worth pl=
unged into the red.

In 1993, in the midst of their ongoing dispute over Trump=92s unpaid share =
of the growing maintenance bill for the Grand Hyatt, Donald sued the Pritzk=
ers, alleging financial mismanagement. A year later, the Pritzkers sued bac=
k for $100 million. In their complaint, they alleged that Trump agreed in t=
he late 1980s that repairs were necessary, before deciding they weren=92t b=
ecause he was =93not in a financial position=94 to afford them. They were s=
uing him for being broke, and, what=92s more, for purposely refusing to spi=
ff up the hotel in order to extract financial concessions from them. Trump,=
 for his part, found the whole ordeal unjust. =93When I was in my deepest p=
roblems,=94 he said<http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-29/business/fi-3968=
7_1_grand-hyatt> at the time, =93they came to me and said, =91We want to re=
novate the hotel,=92 instead of holding off a little.=92=94

In an ironic bookend to the saga, Trump managed to avert total financial co=
llapse thanks, once again to Fred, who bought $3.5 million in chips from on=
e of his son=92s casinos to help him make a bond payment, an illegal loan f=
or which he had to pay a $30,000 fine. Eventually, Trump recovered, settled=
 with the Pritzkers, and by 1995, had been bought out of the Grand Hyatt al=
together. (The Pritzkers still own the hotel.)

On the night of Trump=92s speech in April, about 1,000 protesters lined sid=
ewalks outside the hotel. But inside, Trump, who was appearing for the last=
 time in the presence of his then-rivals Senator Ted Cruz and Governor John=
 Kasich, drew a chummy reception from an audience that seven days later wou=
ld help give him an overwhelming victory at the polls. Trump extolled his f=
ellow New Yorkers for their =93straight talk=94 and their =93values=94 as h=
e sauntered through a series of anecdotes about his subsequent triumphs as =
a developer.

=93I built, you know, many other buildings across the city. I=92m just list=
ing some of them,=94 Trump said. =93This was my first. This was my first: t=
he Grand Hyatt Hotel.=94

Left out of the history lesson was the part about the tax break and the cre=
dit line and the loan guarantee=97about how Fred Trump sealed the deal for =
his son. Straight talk, New York values or not, doesn=92t always make for a=
 good story.

 April 14, Donald Trump put on a tuxedo and delivered an unusually restrain=
ed speech at the annual fundraising gala
 of the New York state Republican Party. Though the crucial New York primar=
y was a week away, Trump decided he wouldn=92t bother using his allotted 30=
 minutes to pump his conservative credentials. =93Politics gets a little bo=
ring,=94 he told the crowd of 300 political
 dignitaries.&nbsp;</span>What he wanted to talk about was a building.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">S=
ignificantly for him, the party had booked its event at the Grand Hyatt Hot=
el, which happens to be the very first building Trump developed, about 40 y=

 of the hotel they sat in, of<b style=3D"box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;</b=

<span style=3D"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">The point of Trump=92s =
speech at the Republican gala was not to tout the present state of the Gran=

 a self-made tycoon who disproved the haters and remade the Manhattan skyli=

=92t do it, it can=92t be done, never gonna happen,'=94 Trump said. =93My f=

 against me coming into Manhattan. And then this became so successful, and =
he said, =91Wow.=92=94Of course, in New York, real estate&nbsp;<i style=3D"=
box-sizing: border-box;">is</i>&nbsp;politics. And few real estate deals in=
 New York history were as laden with back-room negotiations
 as the one that permitted the renovation of a hulking commuter hotel into =
a luxe four-star affair. Wedged between the Beaux Arts Grand Central Termin=
al and the art deco Chrysler Building, the Grand Hyatt<b style=3D"box-sizin=
g: border-box;">&nbsp;</b>stands as a curious
 and very Trumpian amalgam: a turn-of-the-century brick building blanketed =
by sheets of mirrored, =9180s-era glass. It could have been airlifted from =
Dallas.<b style=3D"box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;</b>=93When he wanted to =

ason the deal got done at all.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">F=
red Trump has surfaced periodically as a point of political contention. Don=
ald=92s erstwhile Republican opponents accused him of inheriting upward of =
$200 million. This overinflated figure
 is about as misleading as Trump=92s claim that all he ever received from d=
ad was a =93small=94 million-dollar loan. In determining Fred Trump=92s inf=
luence on his son=92s success, though, the exact numerical figure is at bes=
t a distraction. The Grand Hyatt represented
 Donald=92s entry into Manhattan, and to pull it off, Donald relied not onl=
y on his father=92s cash, but his connections=97and this is&nbsp;<i style=
=3D"box-sizing: border-box;">not</i>&nbsp;a Trumpian exaggeration=97to some=
 of the most powerful politicians, lawyers and bankers
 in New York. A decade later, when Donald=92s boardwalk empire in Atlantic =
City<b style=3D"box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;</b>was underwater and the G=

Grand Hyatt doesn=92t showcase the vaunted business sense Trump credits wit=
h leading him to the threshold of the
 GOP presidential nomination. Rather, it reveals the crucial role Fred Trum=
p played in getting his son=92s career off the ground, and keeping it airbo=
rne. Without Fred=92s help, there would be no Hyatt. And without the Hyatt,=
 there would be no Trump Tower, no casinos,
 no golf courses, no career.</span></p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">S=

 without a credit line or building to his name. When I asked Victor Palmier=

 the Grand Hyatt, which of the two men deserved the glory for the project, =

<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">F=
red Trump was a builder of middle-class, outer-borough homes, and nearly ev=

<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">F=
red Trump=92s biggest contracts came from the federal government, but his p=
olitical clout was more pronounced at home. He lunched with a downtown Broo=

 of the Round Table=94 and was a VIP at the Madison Democratic Club, the ne=
rve-center of Brooklyn politics. Early on, he became close with legendary r=

 Abe Beame, who in 1974 would become mayor of New York. Both would prove in=

<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">M=

 strategically spreading his cash and influence. He was a regular on the ph=

 at civic powerhouses like the Jamaica Hospital in Queens and the Brooklyn =
Borough Gas Company. By the time Donald had graduated from Wharton and ente=

 Trump=92s timing was good. That same year, Donald set his sights on a shod=

 the Commodore. His plan was to buy the dated 1919 brick colossus and refur=

</aside></div>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">Y=
oung Donald was not an obvious business partner for the old money Pritzkers=
, who ran the Hyatt chain from their home base in Chicago. But Hyatt was on=
e of the last major national chain
 without a New York City footprint. And the company=92s aesthetic=97in 1967=
 Atlanta=92s Hyatt Regency debuted the concept of the vertical atrium lobby=
=97jibed with Trump=92s.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">T=
here were just a few problems to resolve before groundbreaking. The neighbo=
rhood was in awful shape. The iconic Chrysler was in foreclosure, Grand Cen=
tral needed major refurbishments and
 the Commodore=92s entire stretch of street played seedy rival to the porn =
playground several blocks west in Times Square. The building itself was abo=
ut as unattractive a business proposition as one could imagine. Occupancy h=
overed around 50 percent. A wink-wink
 =93massage parlor=94 called Relaxation Plus occupied prime retail space on=
 the second floor. If it weren=92t for an expensive union contract that man=
dated the employees be paid, the hotel almost certainly would have closed. =
The lobby was =93so dingy,=94 Trump later
 wrote, it looked like =93a welfare hotel.=94</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">W=
hich helps explain, ironically, why Trump became interested in the first pl=
ace. The place had become such a roach motel, its owners were desperate for=
 someone to take it off their hands.
 =93We were trying to find a way to deal with the Commodore, which was beco=
ming derelict and was involved in a big labor dispute with hotel employees,=
=94 says Palmieri, the financier in charge of the assets of the Penn Centra=
l Railroad, which owned the hotel, and
 which itself was in bankruptcy. =93It was a dire situation.=94 Palmieri sa=
ys Trump =93was not the most agreeable personality I had every met.=94 But =
he fit Palmieri=92s job description: =93someone who was young, who was very=
 knowledgeable about New York politics=97and particularly
 the politics governing zoning and tax abatements.=94</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">T=
his last piece was crucial. Banks, in the =93Ford to City: Drop Dead=94 era=
, were not forthcoming with loans. Especially not to developers with zero c=
ompleted projects, and no serious cash
 to their names. In order to get any kind of financing, Trump would need ma=
jor help from the government. Lucky for him, Abe Beame=92s machine, newly i=
nstalled in City Hall, seemed all too happy to comply.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><=
span style=3D"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">In late 1973, needing th=
e city=92s assistance with another property, Trump scheduled a meeting at C=
ity Hall that included his father and
 Beame</span>. A few minutes into the meeting, according to Blair=92s biogr=
aphy, Beame put his arms around the Trumps and said, =93Whatever my friends=
 Fred and Donald want in this town, they get.=94 A similar dynamic was at w=
ork several months later, when Donald
 began agitating for the Commodore property.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><=
span style=3D"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Inspired in part by Dona=
ld=92s ambitions, Beame and Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut=97another old=
 friend of Fred Trump=92s=97pushed a bill in
 Albany that, conveniently, would have created 20-year tax abatements for c=
ommercial properties like the one Trump was trying to develop.
</span>When that bill stalled and ultimately died upstate, Donald Trump wor=
ked with a well-connected City Hall bureaucrat named Mike Bailkin to create=
 an even more favorable deal for himself. Bailkin=92s ingenious idea was fo=
r the state-run Urban Development
 Corporation (UDC)=97created in the 1960s by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to=
 develop racially integrated housing by fiat=97to buy the place from Trump =
for a nominal fee of a dollar, then lease it back to him tax-free for 40 ye=

 of dollars.</p>

ted tax abatement to a private developer=97no commercial property in New Yo=
rk had ever received one=97might have
 seemed like smart public policy. But the serious consideration New York=92=
s political firmament gave the deal suggests that Fred Trump=92s behind-the=
-scenes influence was at least as important a factor as any good governance=
. The Beame administration doubled as
 a =93palace circle of real estate people,=94 says former Manhattan City Co=
uncilman Henry Stern, one of the few who criticized the deal at the time. =
=93It was clear that [the Trumps] had enormous clout.=94 When I asked him w=
hy so few opposed the tax break, he replied
 that most of his City Council colleagues were =93part of the Democratic ma=
chine=94 and that the rest =93just didn=92t care.=94</p>

 McCarthy. Cohn represented the Trump Organization in a massive federal hou=

<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">B=
ut nothing could match the persuasive power of Fred in the flesh. In 1975, =
after talks about the tax deal started to get serious, another meeting was =
called at which both Mayor Beame and
 Fred Trump would personally appear. According to Wayne Barrett=92s exhaust=

 Downfall,&nbsp;</i>Fred promised the group he would keep watch over the co=
nstruction. More significantly, he pledged to
 =93provide financial credibility.=94</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">A=

;</i>point
 person a woman the Trumps would have been familiar with=97Governor Carey=
=92s chief fundraiser, Louise Sunshine. In the mid-1970s, the UDC was helme=
d by Richard Ravitch, the New York City real estate stalwart whose family c=
ompany helped build Trump Village. In
 theory, Ravitch should have been well-disposed to The Donald. In practice,=
 he wasn=92t. Ravitch told me that one morning he received a phone call fro=
m Sunshine, whose child attended the same preschool as his. She wanted to k=
now if she could bring in Trump for
 a meeting. He agreed, and Trump pitched his plan. It went badly.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">R=
avitch was already irked that Sunshine, a Democratic fundraiser and state p=
arty official, was lobbying on behalf of a private client. He didn=92t take=
 kindly to Trump=92s bluster. =93He wanted
 to buy the Commodore and wanted a tax exemption, and couldn=92t get the ta=
x exemption,=94 Ravitch recalls. =93I finally said, =91Look, it would be gr=
eat to have a Hyatt Hotel. I would be willing to subordinate the taxes to t=
he mortgage. And he said, =91No, I want an
 exemption. If you don=92t give it to me, I=92ll have you fired.=94 Ravitch=
 booted them both from his office.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">R=
avitch did not, in fact, get fired. Even with his father=92s pull, Trump di=
dn=92t have that<i style=3D"box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;</i>much juice. =
But Ravitch was getting heavy pressure from Beame
 and his team to OK the deal. =93=91Look, here was the city on the balls of=
 its ass in the fall of 1975,=94 he remembers telling economic development =
czar John Zuccotti in a tense argument. =93And here was this brash kid who =
wanted to take the Commodore hotel and turn
 it into a Hyatt.=94 According to Barrett=92s biography, Ravitch eventually=
 caved and voted in favor of the deal. (Ravitch claims he doesn=92t remembe=
r this.) When a reporter asked Trump why the city handed him a 40-year abat=
ement, he replied, =93Because I didn=92t ask
 for 50.=94</p>

<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">W=

 of water and roaring at construction workers.</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">T=
he structure that the Trumps produced was both ingenious and bizarre. The H=
yatt was coated with a silvery, reflective glass that set it apart from the=
 classic structures surrounding it,
 while simultaneously reflecting them back toward the street. Its most uniq=
ue feature, for better or for worse, was the cantilevered bar/restaurant th=
at bulged over 42<span style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 12px; li=

 For all its innovations, though, the Hyatt is not a modern building but an=
 old brick structure that Trump simply plastered with large glass panels. T=
o make it seem taller, Trump redid the elevator buttons so guests' rooms be=
gin on floor =9314=94 rather than on
 floor 6, where they are actually situated. Trump even finagled a more chic=
 Park Avenue address for the hotel, though, as he admitted during the speec=
h in April, =93it really fronted on 42<span style=3D"box-sizing: border-box=

r night in 1980. At the ceremony, which heralded Trump=92s arrival as much =
as it did New York=92s 1980s comeback,
 leggy blonds bore trays of champagne and&nbsp;<i style=3D"box-sizing: bord=

rey, who had benefited from Fred Trump=92s
 campaign generosity and whose state agency had provided the key approval f=
or the deal.</p>

y the early 1990s, the hotel was betraying its cruddy Commodore roots. Acco=
rding to a 1991 inspection report that later surfaced in litigation between=
 Trump and the Pritzkers, the hotel
 needed at least $24 million worth of repairs and renovations. A few typica=
l excerpts from the report:</p>

<span style=3D"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Meanwhile, the Pritzker=
 family alleged, Trump was refusing to pay for any of the upkeep. =93Trump =
was cutting corners left and right,=94 says Goldberger.
</span>=93And the Pritzkers=94=97who had endowed a prestigious architecture=
 prize in 1979=97=93were increasingly becoming a well-known and prominent f=
amily with a great deal more money than Donald Trump, but with a desire to =
be taken seriously in other kinds of circles.
 They were less and less interested in being in partnership with Donald, wh=
o was both glitzy and down-market.=94</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><=
span style=3D"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">At the heart of the prob=
lem was Trump=92s cratering casino empire. After a series of financial miss=
teps connected to the bloated $1 billion,
 junk-bond-funded construction of the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump=92s third and =
largest Atlantic City property, Trump declared bankruptcy in 1991 on severa=
l casinos and the Plaza Hotel in New York, which he also then owned. His ne=
t worth plunged into the red.</span></p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">I=
n 1993, in the midst of their ongoing dispute over Trump=92s unpaid share o=
f the growing maintenance bill for the Grand Hyatt, Donald sued the Pritzke=
rs, alleging financial mismanagement.
 A year later, the Pritzkers sued back for $100 million. In their complaint=
, they alleged that Trump agreed in the late 1980s that repairs were necess=
ary, before deciding they weren=92t because he was =93not in a financial po=
sition=94 to afford them. They were suing
 him for being broke, and, what=92s more, for purposely refusing to spiff u=
p the hotel in order to extract financial concessions from them. Trump, for=
 his part, found the whole ordeal unjust. =93When I was in my deepest probl=

span style=3D"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">In an ironic bookend to =
the saga, Trump managed to avert total financial collapse thanks, once agai=
n to Fred, who bought $3.5 million in
 chips from one of his son=92s casinos to help him make a bond payment, an =
illegal loan for which he had to pay a $30,000 fine.
</span>Eventually, Trump recovered, settled with the Pritzkers, and by 1995=
, had been bought out of the Grand Hyatt altogether. (The Pritzkers still o=
wn the hotel.)</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;">O=
n the night of Trump=92s speech in April, about 1,000 protesters lined side=
walks outside the hotel. But inside, Trump, who was appearing for the last =
time in the presence of his then-rivals
 Senator Ted Cruz and Governor John Kasich, drew a chummy reception from an=
 audience that seven days later would help give him an overwhelming victory=
 at the polls. Trump extolled his fellow New Yorkers for their =93straight =
