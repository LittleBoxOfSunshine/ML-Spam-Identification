Hi allenz,

Americo Lopes worked for a construction
company and often pooled m0ney for lot*tery
tickets with his co-workers.

When he scored a winning ticket in 2010,
he quit his j0b on the spot, claiming he
needed foot sur*gery.

Watch the full story here <http://lottocrushcode.com?hop=3Dallenz@dnc.org>

After coming clean to a co-worker months
later, five of Lopes' ex-colleagues
turned around and filed a lawsuit against
him.=20

On Wednesday, a jury in Union County
ordered Lopes to divvy up the
win*nings=8B17.4M USD after taxes=8Bwith the
colleagues. There's no word yet on how
they'll be split.=20

Lopes wasn't the first lot*tery winner to
 <http://lottocrushcode.com?hop=3Dallenz@dnc.org> fib about his priz3.
Recently, a Waffle=20
House waitress was ordered to pay a gift
tax on a priz3 she won ten years ago.
Colleagues sued her for a share, but
they lost.=20
