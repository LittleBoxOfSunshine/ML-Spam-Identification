> DNC to offer Sanders a convention concession By Abby Phillip and Anne Gear=
an May 19 at 8:56 PM=20
> In an attempt to head off an ugly conflict at its convention this summer, t=
he Democratic National Committee plans to offer a concession to Sen. Bernie S=
anders =E2=80=94 seats on a key convention platform committee =E2=80=94 but i=
t may not be enough to stop Sanders from picking a fight over the party=E2=80=
=99s policy positions.
> Allies of both Clinton and Sanders have urged Democratic leaders to meet s=
ome of Sanders=E2=80=99s more mundane demands for greater inclusion at the P=
hiladelphia convention. Their decision to do so is expected to be finalized b=
y the end of the week, according to two people familiar with the discussions=
. But growing mistrust between Sanders supporters and party leaders have thr=
eatened to undermine that effort.
> Even with the committee assignments, Sanders plans an aggressive effort to=
 extract platform concessions on key policies that could prompt divisive bat=
tles at a moment when front-runner Hillary Clinton will be trying to unify t=
he party. Among other issues, he plans to push for a $15 national minimum wa=
ge and argue that the party needs a more balanced position regarding Israel a=
nd Palestinians, according to a Sanders campaign aide who requested anonymit=
y to speak candidly.
>=20
> Much like their view that the economy has been =E2=80=9Crigged=E2=80=9D to=
 benefit the wealthy more than the middle and working classes, Sanders suppo=
rters have become increasingly convinced that national Democrats have stacke=
d the political deck with rules that have made it difficult for Sanders to w=
in enough delegates to threaten Clinton=E2=80=99s nomination.
>=20
> Party leaders, meanwhile, have grown more frustrated with Sanders, who the=
y say has unfairly fueled that perception.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think they=E2=80=99ve handled it very well and I t=
hink they=E2=80=99ve lost the moral high ground on this,=E2=80=9D said Ken M=
artin, chairman of Minnesota=E2=80=99s Democratic-Farmer Labor Party. =E2=80=
=9CIt=E2=80=99s very clear now that the longer they stay in this race the mo=
re damage they=E2=80=99re doing.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> The mistrust hit a boiling point in Nevada over the weekend, when a ruckus=
 caused by Sanders supporters prompted security officials to cut short the s=
tate party convention. The incident worried party leaders impatient with the=
 prolonged Democratic primary and looking to avoid drama in Philadelphia. Th=
eir impatience spread to Sanders when he issued a defiant statementaccusing N=
evada Democrats of preventing a =E2=80=9Cfair and transparent process.=E2=80=
=9D
>=20
> Separately, the composition of three convention committees =E2=80=94 platf=
orm, rules and credentials =E2=80=94 has become key. Earlier this month, in a=
 letter to DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Sanders threatened to br=
ing the fight to the floor of the convention if she did not appoint more of h=
is loyalists to the each of the three committees.
>=20
> Martin and other Democratic chairmen urged national leaders to give Sander=
s the concessions he seeks =E2=80=94 especially when it comes to the platfor=
m, which in the long run does not have a material impact on Democrats=E2=80=99=
 electoral chances in November.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CThere are other chairs who probably feel that way and feel like t=
his is my party and f--- Bernie Sanders,=E2=80=9D said Martin, a Clinton sup=
porter. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m not one of those.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CI feel very passionately that we have to open up that party and m=
ake sure that those voices are heard,=E2=80=9D he said.
>=20
> One of Sanders=E2=80=99s demands was the composition of the 15-person draf=
ting committee, whose members are appointed at Wasserman Schultz=E2=80=99s d=
iscretion and write the party=E2=80=99s platform.
>=20
> =20
> Play Video1
> One Democratic Party official requesting anonymity said Wasserman Schultz a=
sked for recommendations from both campaigns in an effort to be inclusive.
>=20
> But Sanders had sought to split the committee evenly between his and Clint=
on=E2=80=99s allies =E2=80=94 plus one =E2=80=9Cneutral=E2=80=9D appointment=
 from Wasserman Schultz.
>=20
> Weeks of negotiations followed, and the DNC eventually agreed to add more S=
anders representatives. According to two people familiar with the conversati=
ons, the DNC and the campaigns will reach a final agreement =E2=80=94 probab=
ly less than Sanders wanted but more than the DNC originally offered =E2=80=94=
 by the end of the week.
>=20
> A spokesman for the DNC declined to comment on the negotiations.
>=20
> Sanders=E2=80=99s aides have also publicly and privately complained about t=
he appointment of two Clinton loyalists =E2=80=94 former congressman Barney =
Frank of Massachusetts to head the Rules Committee and Connecticut Gov. Dan M=
alloy to lead the Platform Committee =E2=80=94 as chairmen of two of the con=
vention=E2=80=99s standing bodies.
>=20
> Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign, said this week that t=
hey may yet seek to have Frank and Malloy removed from their posts.
>=20
> In an interview with CNN Thursday, Clinton noted pointedly that she believ=
es Sanders no longer has a shot at the nomination. She also said that Sander=
s will need to encourage his supporters to unify behind her, just as she did=
 in 2008 when running against Barack Obama.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CI have every confidence that we=E2=80=99re going to be unified,=E2=
=80=9D Clinton said. =E2=80=9CI think what brings us together is Donald Trum=
p.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> That hasn=E2=80=99t happened yet. A Sanders spokesman disputed Clinton=E2=80=
=99s assertion that the nomination is hers. And Sanders has ramped up the rh=
etoric in recent days, saying after Clinton won Kentucky that he still inten=
ds to win the nomination despite an overwhelming disadvantage in delegates.
>=20
> Even if he doesn=E2=80=99t, he still intends to pick a platform fight at t=
he convention, according to a campaign aide who requested anonymity to discu=
ss strategy.
>=20
> Clinton aides have said that on a slew of issues, Sanders is not far from t=
he party. But the issue of U.S. policy toward Israel =E2=80=94 which a Sande=
rs adviser said =E2=80=9Cabsolutely, legitimately will be a point of convers=
ation=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 has made some of Clinton=E2=80=99s backers nervous.=

>=20
> Sanders is seeking a more =E2=80=9Ceven-handed=E2=80=9D U.S. approach to I=
sraeli occupation of land Palestinians claim for a future state. The current=
 platform does not address the nearly five-decade occupation directly, but i=
t endorses =E2=80=9Ca just and lasting Israeli-Palestinian accord, producing=
 two states for two peoples.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> Speaking last month during a contentious debate with Clinton, Sanders =E2=80=
=94 who declared himself =E2=80=9C100 percent pro-Israel=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 s=
aid that Israel=E2=80=99s 2014 military assault on the Gaza Strip was =E2=80=
=9Cdisproportionate=E2=80=9D to the threat posed by Hamas rockets launched f=
rom the Palestinian territory into Israel.
>=20
> Behind his words is a long debate among U.S. and international policymaker=
s =E2=80=94 one that divides the Democratic base and could pose a challenge f=
or Clinton when she must bring her party together: how to weigh Palestinian i=
nterests when dealing with Israel, and whether resolute U.S. backing for Isr=
ael diminishes leverage to promote peace and fair treatment of Palestinians.=

>=20
> =E2=80=9COn one hand there is not an enormous amount of difference between=
 them. They are both pro-Israel, they are both pro-peace,=E2=80=9D said one l=
ongtime Clinton supporter. =E2=80=9CBut in the context of the campaign terms=
 like =E2=80=98even-handed=E2=80=99 can come to mean that the United States i=

Clinton aides have said that on a slew of issues, Sanders is not far from t=
he party. But the issue of U.S. policy toward Israel =E2=80=94 which a Sand=
ers adviser said =E2=80=9Cabsolutely, legitimately will be a point of conve=
rsation=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 has made some of Clinton=E2=80=99s backers nervo=
us.</p>

Sanders is seeking a more =E2=80=9Ceven-handed=E2=80=9D U.S. approach to Is=
raeli occupation of land Palestinians claim for a future state. The current=
 platform does not address the nearly five-decade occupation directly, but =
it endorses =E2=80=9Ca just and lasting Israeli-Palestinian
 accord, producing two states for two peoples.=E2=80=9D</p>

Speaking last month during a contentious debate with Clinton, Sanders =E2=
=80=94 who declared himself =E2=80=9C100 percent pro-Israel=E2=80=9D =E2=80=
=94 said that Israel=E2=80=99s 2014 military assault on the Gaza Strip was =
=E2=80=9Cdisproportionate=E2=80=9D to the threat posed by Hamas rockets lau=
nched from the
 Palestinian territory into Israel.</p>

Behind his words is a long debate among U.S. and international policymakers=
 =E2=80=94 one that divides the Democratic base and could pose a challenge =
for Clinton when she must bring her party together: how to weigh Palestinia=
n interests when dealing with Israel, and
 whether resolute U.S. backing for Israel diminishes leverage to promote pe=
ace and fair treatment of Palestinians.</p>

=E2=80=9COn one hand there is not an enormous amount of difference between =
them. They are both pro-Israel, they are both pro-peace,=E2=80=9D said one =
longtime Clinton supporter. =E2=80=9CBut in the context of the campaign ter=
ms like =E2=80=98even-handed=E2=80=99 can come to mean that the United Stat=
es
 is signaling a shift=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 and Clinton would oppose that.</p>
