THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 24, 2016

*

=A0

*

*FACT SHEET: World Humanitarian Summit - U.S. Government Priorities

*

=A0=20

The World Humanitarian Summit is a high-level event convened to reinvigor=
ate international commitments to humanitarian principles and strengthen t=
he international community=92s response to crises caused by conflicts and=
 natural disasters.=A0 Conflict-related crises and natural disasters affe=
ct approximately 125 million people on an annual basis =96 a combined pop=
ulation equivalent to the world=92s 12th largest nation.=A0 Conflict and =
human rights abuses have forced approximately 60 million persons worldwid=
e to flee their homes.=A0 Natural disasters have displaced an average of =
26 million persons annually in recent years.=A0 These humanitarian crises=
 have caused a staggering loss of life and destructive economic and socia=
l impacts that have reversed decades of hard-earned development progress =
in some locations.

=A0

The World Humanitarian Summit occurs at an historic moment when the scale=
 of displaced populations in need of humanitarian assistance and protecti=
on has reached levels unseen since World War II.=A0 United Nations Secret=
ary General Ban Ki-moon convened the first World Humanitarian Summit to b=
ring together more than 5,000 government, private sector, and civil socie=
ty representatives in unity to draw attention to the issues of today.=A0 =
Gayle Smith, Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Developme=
nt (USAID) led the U.S. delegation to the summit in Istanbul, which inclu=
ded representatives from the White House, Department of State, including =
the United States Mission to the United Nations, the Department of Defens=
e, and USAID.

=A0

As the world=92s single largest humanitarian assistance donor with contri=
butions of nearly $26 billion in the past 5 fiscal years, the United Stat=
es views the World Humanitarian Summit as an important opportunity to pro=
mote a stronger and more accountable international system capable of addr=
essing today=92s unprecedented needs.=A0 The Summit is also an important =
opportunity to emphasize that support and financing from a broad set of t=
raditional donors as well as from new sources are essential to address em=
ergencies effectively.=A0 President Obama=92s Leaders=92 Summit on Refuge=
es in September 2016 will be a timely complement to the World Humanitaria=
n Summit and will further efforts to address the needs of refugees, host =
communities and other affected populations.

=A0

The United States=92 primary objectives for the World Humanitarian Summit=
 are to:

=B7=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Reduce the impact of conflict on civilians, w=
ith special attention to the impact on women and girls, and re-affirm our=
 country=92s longstanding commitment to international humanitarian law;

=B7=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Strengthen the international humanitarian sys=
tem, including how it is resourced, and its effectiveness in addressing n=
eeds;

=B7=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Improve coherence between humanitarian and de=
velopment assistance to better address recurring and protracted crises.

=A0

=A0

*United States=92 Response to Humanitarian Emergencies

*

The United States is committed to helping people around the world during =
this time of unprecedented need.=A0 In 2015, the U.S. government provided=
 more than $6 billion in humanitarian assistance to more than 60 new and =
protracted emergencies worldwide ranging from earthquakes, hurricanes, an=
d floods to health epidemics, conflicts, and refugee influxes, with the v=
ast majority of our assistance meeting needs in long running conflicts.=A0=
 When the scope of a disaster overwhelms the capacity of an affected coun=
try to respond, the United States is able to deploy a Disaster Assistance=
 Response Team (DART) overseas to conduct disaster assessments, determine=
 urgent needs, and coordinate response activities with affected governmen=
ts and implementing partners.=A0 The U.S. government had a record five DA=
RTs deployed simultaneously during 2015 to support large-scale relief eff=
orts in West Africa[1] [ #_ftn1 ], South Sudan, Syria, Iraq, and Nepal.=A0=
=A0 In addition, the U.S. government has more than 120 refugee coordinato=
rs and emergency humanitarian response specialists stationed around the w=
orld to advise and coordinate the U.S. government=92s humanitarian respon=
se.=A0=20

=A0

*Reducing the Effect of Conflict on Civilians

*

Upholding humanity is at the core of humanitarian action and the United N=
ations Charter reaffirms faith in the dignity and worth of the human pers=
on.=A0 Protecting the vulnerable from harm and preserving their dignity, =
in particular by upholding international law and seeking accountability f=
or violations, should be at the very top of the international community=92=
s agenda. The United States joins with 47 other countries in presenting a=
 statement [ http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2016/05/257660.htm ] to rei=
nforce commitment to the protection of civilians in conflict situations b=
y honoring the full spirit and letter of international law and to reaffir=
m and strengthen international respect for the core humanitarian principl=
es of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence that should se=
rve as the foundation for all humanitarian response.=A0 *_

_*

=A0

The international community should have more systematic approaches to add=
ress the scope and nature of constraints placed on agencies delivering hu=
manitarian relief in order to identify systematic access denials, devise =
appropriate policy measures through multilateral fora, and take other app=
ropriate action.=A0 We intend to work with other Member States, the UN, a=
nd humanitarian organizations in the coming months to identify concrete w=
ays to address more systematically challenges to humanitarian access to p=
opulations in need.=A0=20

=A0

The United States believes that gender equality and the empowerment of wo=
men and girls, which includes addressing gender-based violence (GBV), is =
a critical priority and will continue to advance the Call to Action for w=
omen and girls in emergencies, which is a global effort to fundamentally =
change humanitarian response to GBV. This includes a pledge of an additio=
nal $12.5 million in 2016 in support of Safe from the Start, a joint Depa=
rtment of State-USAID initiative to better protect women and girls in cri=
sis, bringing the U.S. total contribution to more than $50 million since =
2013.

=A0

*Strengthening International Humanitarian Assistance Operations

*

The United States is working to strengthen how the international humanita=
rian system operates, including how it is resourced.=A0 In response to hu=
man suffering caused by conflict and disasters, many emergency relief age=
ncies do outstanding work that saves countless lives.=A0 Despite increase=
d global funding for emergency programs and an impressive expansion of se=
rvices in recent years the international community has been unable to kee=
p pace with the increased emergency needs worldwide.

=A0

At the Summit, the United States emphasized the importance of ensuring th=
at emergency assistance is provided effectively and efficiently to meet t=
he needs of crisis-affected people.=A0 The U.S. government calls on human=
itarian organizations to work together better to assess needs among affec=
ted populations, identify gaps in existing relief programs, and formulate=
 collective response strategies that identify clear priorities according =
to urgency of need and inclusive of all affected populations, including r=
efugees.=A0 As a result of political commitments at the Summit, humanitar=
ian agencies should be able and willing to strengthen their operational c=
oordination to minimize service gaps and avoid duplication of programs.=A0=
 UN humanitarian agencies should take steps to ensure that leadership of =
humanitarian operations is effective and accountable.

=A0

The United States commits to providing flexible funding to enable humanit=
arian agencies to more easily adjust emergency programs to address shifti=
ng needs and longer time horizons where humanitarian agencies demonstrate=
 increased accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness.=A0 The United S=
tates is also committed to continuing its legacy of building local capaci=
ty so that humanitarian response can be as local as possible and as inter=
national as needed. The United States is joining with other donor governm=
ents and humanitarian agencies in what is being called a =93Grand Bargain=
=94 that will strengthen how humanitarian assistance efforts are designed=
, funded, implemented, and evaluated so as to maximize their impact and e=
fficiency and increase their accountability to affected populations.

=A0

*Fostering Humanitarian and Development Coherence

*

The United States is redoubling efforts to strengthen coherence between o=
ur humanitarian and development assistance efforts.=A0 The destruction ca=
used by conflicts and natural disasters has eroded and in some cases reve=
rsed the hard-earned progress many communities had made toward long-term,=
 sustainable development.=A0 The frequency of extreme weather events is i=
ncreasing as a result of climate change, and too often refugees and inter=
nally displaced persons become trapped in protracted displacement and dep=
endency for years or decades.=A0 Their needs are closely related to the d=
evelopment needs of communities that host them.=A0 The international comm=
unity responds to emergencies to save lives, but it must also do a better=
 job of ensuring that the people saved will have an opportunity to enjoy =
a productive future.

=A0

To help bridge this gap, the U.S. government is providing leadership and =
technical assistance to support global efforts to prioritize and strength=
en education in emergencies and protracted crises, and will provide a $20=
 million contribution to =93Education Cannot Wait: a Fund for Education i=
n Emergencies=94 for one year, and looks forward to learning from its pro=
gress. The UNICEF-managed Fund will help transform the global education s=
ector and bridge the humanitarian and development divide through a more c=
ollaborative, agile, and rapid response to education in emergencies. Ulti=
mately, the Fund will increase safe and quality education so that all chi=
ldren have the opportunity to learn even amid protracted emergency situat=
ions.

=A0

The U.S. government also supports greater World Bank engagement in protra=
cted and recurrent crises and its intent to establish a Global Crisis Res=
ponse Platform.=A0 Initially, the Platform should provide support to deve=
loping countries, irrespective of region or income level, that are hostin=
g large numbers of refugees on a protracted basis, to enable these countr=
ies to invest more in livelihoods and education opportunities for affecte=
d populations, and alleviate strains on national infrastructure and socia=
l services.=20

=A0

Additionally, the United States will initiate a Crisis Review Mechanism w=
ithin the U.S. government that will review a crisis to determine whether =
and how our relief programming should pivot to a combined humanitarian-de=
velopment approach.=A0 And we will continue our work of building resilien=
ce in fragile communities so they can more effectively prevent or withsta=
nd shocks that trigger large-scale emergencies.=A0 The U.S. government is=
 committed to support responsible national governments in reducing their =
risks of disaster and strengthen their capacity to lead their own respons=
e efforts when disasters strike, and will continue to build and support l=
ocal capacity for disaster risk reduction and humanitarian response.=20
