THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

April 28, 2016



*Statement on the Advance Estimate of GDP for the First Quarter of 2016*



WASHINGTON, DC  Jason Furman, Chairman of the Council of Economic Adviser=
s, issued the following statement today on the advanceestimate of GDP for=
 the first quarter of 2016. You can view the statement HERE [ https://www=
.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/04/28/advance-estimate-gross-domestic-product-f=
irst-quarter-2016 ].



Posted byJason Furman [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/author/jason-furm=
an ]on April28, 2016 at 09:30 AM EDT

*Summary:Real GDP rose 0.5 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter=
 according to the advance estimate, even as job growth remains strong.*

"The economy grew 0.5 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter of 2=
016, a slower pace than last quarter. Strong growth in residential invest=
ment boosted real GDP growth, but weakness in business investment and net=
 exportsexacerbated by weak foreign demand and low oil pricesweighed on g=
rowth. Consumer spending grew at a moderate pace in the first quarter. ""=
Overall, the most stable and persistent components of output  consumption=
 and fixed investmentrose 2.6 percent over the past four quarters. ""Neve=
rtheless, labor market data remain robust, with continuing private-sector=
 job creation, increasing labor force participation, and historically low=
 levels of Unemployment Insurance claims. Todays report underscores that =
there is more work to do, and the President will continue to call on Cong=
ress to support policies that will boost our long-run growth and living s=
tandards, including policies to support innovation and investments in inf=
rastructure and job training and to promote ""greater competition" [ http=
s://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/04/15/ending-rotary-rental-phones-thinki=
ng-outside-cable-box ]" across the economy, as well as high-standards fre=
e trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership."

*FIVE KEY POINTS IN TODAY'S REPORT FROM THE BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (=
BEA)*

*1. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased 0.5 percent at an annual =
rate in the first quarter of 2016, according to BEAs advance estimate. *C=
onsumer spending grew 1.9 percent, below its pace over the prior four qua=
rters, as spending on durable goods fell while spending on services and n=
ondurables rose at roughly their recent pace. GDP growth was supported by=
 strength in residential investment, which increased 14.8 percent in the =
first quarter and which has been a positive contributor in recent years (=
see point 4 below). However, nonresidential investment fell 5.9 percent, =
weighed down by a further sharp contraction in investment in equipment an=
d oil-related structures. Slowing global demand continues to remain anoth=
er key drag on real GDP growth [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/02/=
26/second-estimate-gross-domestic-product-fourth-quarter-2015 ], with rea=
l exports falling 2.6 percent and subtracting 0.3 percentage point from g=
rowth in the first quarter.

*2. Incomplete seasonal adjustment may have lowered the estimate of first=
-quarter GDP growth, though this factor is unlikely to explain the majori=
ty of the slowdown in growth this quarter. *First-quarter real GDP growth=
 averaged 1.0 percentage point less than growth during the four quarters =
of the year in 2012 to 2015, with the shortfall made up by higher GDP gro=
wth in subsequent quarters. Such a regular quarterly patterndespite the f=
act the GDP is seasonally adjustedis often referred to as residual season=
ality. In contrast, first-quarter growth in real Gross Domestic Income (G=
DI) has averaged only 0.2 percentage point less than its growth during th=
e year over the same period. GDP and GDI both measure output but use diff=
erent data, so more first-quarter weakness in GDP than in GDI suggests th=
at residual seasonality may be depressing estimates of first-quarter GDP =
growth. Last summer, BEA took steps [ http://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2015/08%=
20August/0815_2015_annual_nipa_revision.pdf ] to reduce residual seasonal=
ity in GDP, though these changes do not appear to have fully eliminated t=
he issue, and residual seasonality likely played some role in the latest =
estimate for GDP growth. Nevertheless, much of the slowdown in first-quar=
ter GDP growth this year was in categories like consumer spending and bus=
iness investment that do not appear [ https://www.federalreserve.gov/econ=
resdata/notes/feds-notes/2015/residual-seasonality-in-gdp-20150514.html ]=
 to exhibit substantial residual seasonality. Unusual events in years pas=
tincluding severe snowstorms and a disruption at West Coast portsmay have=
 also reduced first-quarter growth, but are not relevant to this year.

*3. Business fixed investment declined in the first quarter, driven in la=
rge part by oil-related declines, but private investment in research and =
development (R&D) as a share of GDP rose close to a new high. *Real inves=
tment in equipment and structures both fell sharply in the first quarter;=
 on the other hand, real investment in intellectual property products (IP=
P) showed positive growth, with its private R&D investment component near=
ly matching its recent all-time high as a share of output. More broadly, =
investment growth has slowed in recent years, as discussed in Chapter 2 [=
 https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Chapter_2.p=
df ] of the 2016 "Economic Report of the President" [ https://www.whiteho=
use.gov/administration/eop/cea/economic-report-of-the-President/2016 ]. D=
uring 2014, all three major categories of business fixed investmentstruct=
ures, equipment, and IPProse, adding a combined 0.7 percentage point to r=
eal GDP growth. In 2015, falling oil prices led to a decline in oil drill=
ing and mining structures investment, subtracting from overall growth; on=
 the other hand, the other components of investment remained positive dur=
ing 2015. Since then, growth in equipment investment has turned negative,=
 due in part to weaker foreign demand and reduced demand from energy prod=
ucers for equipment. Slow investment growth can weigh on future output gr=
owth, since less capital deepening implies lower future productivity grow=
th, but increases in R&D investment would offset some of this change and =
contribute positively to future productivity growth.

*4. Real residential fixed investment rose 14.8 percent at an annual rate=
 in the first quarter, a step up in growth from 2015, with continued pote=
ntial for strong growth in coming quarters. *Residential investment has g=
rown by more than 8 percent for six straight quarters, highlighting the s=
olid, steady recovery in the housing sector, which has been supported by =
strong job growth and low mortgage rates. Growth in residential investmen=
t has substantially outpaced growth in GDP and in the first quarter contr=
ibuted 0.5 percentage point to growth.

Even with the solid growth in recent years, there is room for further exp=
ansion. Household formation picked up in 2015, but had been low relative =
to historical trends for several years, indicating potential additional d=
emand for housing construction. Housing starts have risen steadily since =
2012 and stood at 1.1 million units at an annual rate in March 2016. Even=
 with this improvement, this value is well below the 1.5-to-1.7 million u=
nit range that would be consistent with long-term demographics and replac=
ement of existing housing stock. Housing construction thus has room to ex=
pand further and remains a bright spot in domestic demand.

*5. Real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)the sum of consumption an=
d fixed investmentrose 1.2 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter=
, a faster pace than GDP but a slower pace than in recent quarters. *Real=
 PDFPwhich excludes noisier components like net exports, inventories, and=
 government spendingis generally a more reliable indicator of next-quarte=
r GDP growth than current GDP [ https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/2=
7/second-estimate-gdp-fourth-quarter-2014#pdfp ]. The effects of weaker f=
oreign growth, however, have offset some of the strength in domestic dema=
nd over the past few years. Overall, PDFP rose 2.6 percent over the past =
four quarters, compared with 2.0-percent GDP growth over the same period.=
 The gap between PDFP growth and GDP growth is mostly attributable to net=
 exports, reflecting slowing growth abroad, and in part to more transitor=
y factors like inventory investment.

"As the Administration stresses every quarter, GDP figures can be volatil=
e and are subject to substantial revision. Therefore, it is important not=
 to read too much into any single report, and it is informative to consid=
er each report in the context of other data as they become available."

t-quarter GDP growth, though this factor is unlikely to explain the majorit=
y of the slowdown in growth this quarter. </span></strong><span style=3D"fo=
nt-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">First-quarter real GDP growth averaged 1.=
0 percentage point less than growth during the four quarters of the year in=
 2012 to 2015, with the shortfall made up by higher GDP growth in subsequen=
t quarters. Such a regular quarterly pattern&#8212;despite the fact the GDP=
 is seasonally adjusted&#8212;is often referred to as &#8220;residual seaso=
nality.&#8221; In contrast, first-quarter growth in real Gross Domestic Inc=
ome (GDI) has averaged only 0.2 percentage point less than its growth durin=
g the year over the same period. GDP and GDI both measure output but use di=
fferent data, so more first-quarter weakness in GDP than in GDI suggests th=
at residual seasonality may be depressing estimates of first-quarter GDP gr=
owth. Last summer, BEA took <a href=3D"http://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2015/08%2=
0August/0815_2015_annual_nipa_revision.pdf">steps</a> to reduce residual se=
asonality in GDP, though these changes do not appear to have fully eliminat=
ed the issue, and residual seasonality likely played some role in the lates=
t estimate for GDP growth. Nevertheless, much of the slowdown in first-quar=
ter GDP growth this year was in categories like consumer spending and busin=
ess investment that <a href=3D"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/n=
otes/feds-notes/2015/residual-seasonality-in-gdp-20150514.html">do not appe=
ar</a> to exhibit substantial residual seasonality. Unusual events in years=
 past&#8212;including severe snowstorms and a disruption at West Coast port=
s&#8212;may have also reduced first-quarter growth, but are not relevant to=
 this year.</span></font></p>

 large part by oil-related declines, but private investment in research and=
 development (R&amp;D) as a share of GDP rose close to a new high. </span><=

;">Real investment in equipment and structures both fell sharply in the fir=
st quarter; on the other hand, real investment in intellectual property pro=
ducts (IPP) showed positive growth, with its private R&amp;D investment com=
ponent nearly matching its recent all-time high as a share of output. More =
broadly, investment growth has slowed in recent years, as discussed in <a h=
ref=3D"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Chapter=
_2.pdf">Chapter 2</a> of the <a href=3D"https://www.whitehouse.gov/administ=

ort of the President</em></a>. During 2014, all three major categories of b=
usiness fixed investment&#8212;structures, equipment, and IPP&#8212;rose, a=
dding a combined 0.7 percentage point to real GDP growth. In 2015, falling =
oil prices led to a decline in oil drilling and mining structures investmen=
t, subtracting from overall growth; on the other hand, the other components=
 of investment remained positive during 2015. Since then, growth in equipme=
nt investment has turned negative, due in part to weaker foreign demand and=
 reduced demand from energy producers for equipment. Slow investment growth=
 can weigh on future output growth, since less capital deepening implies lo=
wer future productivity growth, but increases in R&amp;D investment would o=
ffset some of this change and contribute positively to future productivity =
growth.</span></p>

 with the solid growth in recent years, there is room for further expansion=
. Household formation picked up in 2015, but had been low relative to histo=
rical trends for several years, indicating potential additional demand for =
housing construction. Housing starts have risen steadily since 2012 and sto=

rovement, this value is well below the 1.5-to-1.7 million unit range that w=

housing stock. Housing construction thus has room to expand further and rem=

 effects of weaker foreign growth, however, have offset some of the strengt=
