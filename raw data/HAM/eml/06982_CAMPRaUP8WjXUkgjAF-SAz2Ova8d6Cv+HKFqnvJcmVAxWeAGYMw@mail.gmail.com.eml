Democrats hoping Donald Trump dooms GOP in Senate races

By Seth McLaughlin <http://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/seth-mclaughlin/> =
-
The Washington Times - Wednesday, May 4, 2016

Democrats running in competitive Senate races are giddy about the prospect
of businessman Donald Trump leading Republicans into the fall election,
confident that their GOP rivals could get swallowed up in an anti-Trump
undertow.

Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, who is running to unseat Sen. Rob Portman,
pounced on the news Wednesday that his successor, John Kasich, planned to
suspend his presidential bid, following in the footsteps of Sen. Ted Cruz
of Texas and clearing the way for Mr. Trump to become the GOP=E2=80=99s
standard-bearer.


=E2=80=9CToday, we know that Rob Portman will be running alongside Donald T=
rump,=E2=80=9D
Mr. Strickland said in a fundraising email.

=E2=80=9CFor nearly a year, as Donald Trump spewed hate, mocked people with
disabilities, attacked POWs, women and people of color, Rob Portman
continued to back him,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CThen he even took it a st=
ep further and
said he =E2=80=98intends to support=E2=80=99 Trump if he is the GOP nominee=
.=E2=80=9D

Republicans hold a 54-46 seat Senate majority.

To flip control of the chamber, Democrats would either need to net five
seats or win four and the White House because the vice president holds the
tie-breaking vote.

=E2=80=9CAlmost all of the most competitive presidential states also featur=
e
competitive Senate races, and Republicans are playing defense in most of
those states,=E2=80=9D said Kyle Kondik, of the University of Virginia=E2=
=80=99s Center for
Politics. =E2=80=9CIt seems likely that the winner of the presidential race=
 will
probably also win the Senate, given this overlap.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CSo if things go south for Trump, one could imagine the Senate majo=
rity
also slipping away, unless Republicans can quarantine Trump from having
down-ballot impact,=E2=80=9D he said.

Democrats are counting on blowback against Mr. Trump to help them in places
like New Hampshire, where Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte is being challenge
by the Maggie Hassan, the state=E2=80=99s Democratic governor.

The Hassan campaign on Wednesday tied Mrs. Ayotte to Mr. Trump and mocked
her plans to support =E2=80=94 but not =E2=80=9Cendorse=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 =
the GOP nominee.

=E2=80=9CThe people of New Hampshire will soundly reject the Trump-Ayotte t=
icket in
November,=E2=80=9D said Aaron Jacobs, spokesman for Mrs. Hassan=E2=80=99s S=
enate campaign.

It is a similar story in Nevada, where Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto=E2=
=80=99s
campaign highlighted the video footage of Rep. Joe Heck, the likely
Republican nominee, saying he =E2=80=9Cwill support whoever the nominee is =
