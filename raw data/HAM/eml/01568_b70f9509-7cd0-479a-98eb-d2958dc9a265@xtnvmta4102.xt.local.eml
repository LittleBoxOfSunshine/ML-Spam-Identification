Good Saturday morning. Enjoy the dinner, and the last day of April.

ZEITGEIST - "GOP's Stop-Trump fever breaks: But a small core of Never-Trump operatives is still plotting a contested convention," by Kyle Cheney and Ben Schreckinger: "[P]ro-Cruz and anti-Trump forces are running out of options to prevent Trump from becoming the nominee. If the real estate developer and reality television star scores a big win in Indiana on Tuesday, Cruz's only remaining strategy may be a hostile takeover of the Republican National Convention - a move GOP insiders still see as possible but certainly one that could severely damage the party." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2f24bf98547044aff6265d8dd571194674bb182686cc3a0dc25fe71c17636039

JUICY READ - "Donald Trump, Jos&eacute; Andr&eacute;s and the death of a grand Washington restaurant," by WashPost's Jonathan O'Connell: "He called it Topo Atrio, his vision for a sumptuous hotel restaurant befitting a $200 million makeover of the Old Post Office Pavilion on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. Jos&eacute; Andr&eacute;s designed a 212-seat, 9,000-square-foot dining room clad in travertine limestone and trimmed in gold. Costing nearly $7 million to build, it would feature hand-carved cured ham from the black-footed Iberico pigs of his native Spain and squid ink pasta with head-on red shrimp, cuttlefish and aioli. 

"But as Andr&eacute;s prepared to present his final plans ... [Trump] took the stage at Trump Tower in New York to announce his candidacy for president and, in the process, railed against Mexican immigrants as drug dealers and rapists. ... [Now] the two are suing each other, filling a court file with affidavits and correspondence chronicling what has become a stubborn standoff between two powerful personalities." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2f24bf98547044aff2594f3e620dd94b773649c561341816f9846d5e0d3e06c1 

TRUMP'S AMERICA -- L.A. Times 4-col. lead (under riot pic), "Trump spurs a fresh wave of Latino activism," by Cindy Carcamo, Ruben Vives and Corina Knoll: "Protest organizers in Southern California said the anti-Trump demonstration spread through word of mouth and involved mostly young people, including many high school and college students. They brought with them Mexican flags, which were once discouraged at immigrant rights rallies for fear they would be regarded as un-American. ... 

"But in reaction to Trump, the Mexican flag has re-emerged, unfurled and unapologetic and a symbol for a new generation of Latino activists. Protesters said they have no hesitation about putting their heritage on display, especially when it comes to the rise and rhetoric of Donald Trump." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2f24bf98547044af5562960844c1400500c3446b1cc9cdbef75956bc3bfdb33e

--"Protests delay but don't derail Trump in California," by Alex Isenstadt and California Playbook author Carla Marinucci in Burlingame, Calif.: "The scene, broadcast live from a news helicopter, followed massive protests Thursday at a Trump rally that drew 30,000 people in Costa Mesa. Friday's protest forced Trump to delay his speech by more than an hour. His motorcade could not approach the venue, instead pulling to the side of a highway. Seeking an alternative entrance to the hotel, the candidate climbed a grassy incline surrounded by Secret Service agents." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2f24bf98547044af6745ab900f0b8576c2f5fc7336a39db602b0ed1485458e09 

S.F. CHRONICLE p. A1, "Demonstrations: Front-runner's foes clash with backers outside gathering": 

--"Burlingame rally: Trump seeks unity as he courts state's conservative core," by Joe Garofoli and John Wildermuth: His "plea for unity [was] delivered Trump-style, salted with insults about ... 'Lyin' Ted' Cruz and '1-for-48' ... Kasich [plus] occasionally accurate braggadocio about his lead in the polls and accusations that the GOP nominating system is 'rigged.'"

"Demonstrations: Front-runner's foes clash with backers outside gathering," by Kimberly Veklerov and Kale Williams: "Trump was forced to abandon his motorcade on the side of a freeway, scramble up a hillside and slip into a side entrance of the hotel hosting the California GOP convention ... as hundreds of angry protesters surrounded the building ... 

"Trump joked about his roundabout entrance to the convention, saying it felt like he was 'crossing the border' ... [D]emonstrators outside ... scuffled with police, threw eggs and blocked roads around the Hyatt Regency." Paywall  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2f24bf98547044afa915f3f73f11fae142925b62038dfaccc6220f5937fab1b4

INSIDE THE CAMPAIGNS -- "Clinton gears up for Trump in fall race," by AP's Lisa Lerer, Julie Pace and Ken Thomas: "Clinton campaign employees are being deployed to battleground states across the country, among them Ohio, Florida and Colorado. Democrats are also eyeing the possibility of making a run at traditionally Republican-leaning states such as Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona, calculating that Trump's penchant for controversy could put minority and female voters in play. ... Aides from the primary are getting general election marching orders. 

"Simone Ward, political director of the campaign committee for Senate Democratic races, will run Clinton's Florida operation. Emmy Ruiz, who led a crucial Nevada primary win for Clinton, will handle Colorado. Mike Vlacich led New Hampshire operations in the primary and will do the same in the fall. ... 

"The search for a running mate is being overseen by campaign chairman John Podesta and Clinton confidante Cheryl Mills, both of whom will help cull the list down to a handful of names in the coming weeks. Clinton advisers are debating whether it's more important to select a strong liberal champion from the Rust Belt to woo Sanders backers and cut into Trump's advantage with working-class white men, or to acknowledge her support among minority voters with a more history-making pick." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2f24bf98547044aff73cb45c31223d16cca330c2086474165e6cd44ed363661d
