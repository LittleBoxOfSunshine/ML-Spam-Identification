Indianapolis Star - Charles Trzcinka

It has been fun to watch progressives at Indiana University cringe at Donald Trump's crass and offensive speech. He simply can't be presidential. He thinks it's boring and makes fun of it. I imagine our progressives quivering in safe zones from all Trump's micro-aggressions. But the fun comes at a very high price. Trump has consistently and repeatedly argued that Americans are being taken advantage of by international trade. He is demanding high tariffs (taxes) on imports from China and Mexico. We need to realize that this will start a trade war with both China and Mexico responding. It is a war that will devastate this state.

Indiana is ranked 8th in the nation in international trade. Transportation equipment and the life sciences (primarily pharmaceuticals and medical devices) are Indiana's leading exports with $10.5 billion and $8.7 billion in value, respectively. The rest of the top five export industries in Indiana are industrial machinery (which includes engines) at $4.2 billion, miscellaneous manufacturing at $2.1 billion, and computer and electronic products at $1.8 billion.

About half of Indiana's $35.5 billion in exports went to our nearest neighbors, Canada ($12.2 billion) and Mexico ($5.0 billion). People are angry, especially after Carrier, and demand the government do something about the harm that these companies cause. Trump promises to impose tariffs - aka taxes-on imports and taxes on companies that want to move. Our trading partners will respond to our high tariffs with their own tariffs and this will cut Indiana's exports. Indiana employers will have to slash jobs here or move production overseas. Currently Indiana has below average income and needs these exports expanded not contracted. We cannot expand income and jobs if anyone in Washington adopts "economic nationalism" which is little more than government protection for companies that get a lot of press.

Trump has become popular at exactly the wrong time.

I understand how nice it is for someone to smash at political correctness, but we cannot allow Trump to destroy Indiana's exports. This economy needs more freedom not more deals. We need freedom from regulation, from political cronies, and especially freedom from trade "deals." Let's keep the consumer in charge of the market place and keep the deal-makers on the sidelines. The last thing Indiana needs is the economic nationalism championed by Trump.
