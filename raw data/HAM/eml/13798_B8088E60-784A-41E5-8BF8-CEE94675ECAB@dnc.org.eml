Vox: Donald Trump is now accepting the kind of big-money donations he think=
s corrupts politicians<http://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11640038/donald-trump-do=
nations-big-money>


Donald Trump, who has spent months decrying politicians who take big money =
for their campaigns, now says he will accept money from big-dollar donors f=
or the general election.

Trump's team announced last week that he will create <http://www.bloomberg.=
com/politics/articles/2016-05-04/in-reversal-donald-trump-to-seek-donations=
-to-fund-campaign> a fundraising apparatus that will take big checks from t=
he wealthiest donors to fund a campaign that could cost upward of $1 billio=
n, according to Bloomberg.

"He's done a complete 180," says Josh Stewart, a spokesperson for the Sunli=
ght Foundation, which tracks money in politics. "A central part of Trump's =
campaign for the nomination was that he was not bought and paid for and wou=
ld self-fund his campaign. Now, he's going back on that."

In other words, Trump has now become the very kind of candidate he's said h=
e spent decades buying off.

Trump's theory of money in politics has always been clear: Wealthy donors p=
our cash into campaigns, and politicians cut them special deals in exchange=
 once elected.

Since declaring his candidacy, Trump has attacked<http://www.vox.com/2016/3=
/25/11304018/donald-trump-and-campaign-finance> politicians accepting campa=
ign donations as being bought off by special interests. This message has cl=
early resonated with primary voters, who have<http://www.theatlantic.com/po=
litics/archive/2016/04/donald-trump-supporters-in-their-own-words/477396/> =
repeatedly<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-supporters-explain-why-they-lov=
e-the-donald-flaws-and-all> listed<http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2016/02/04/do=
nald-trump-supporters> Trump's financial independence as central to his app=
eal.

"Their lobbyists, their special interests and their donors will start calli=
ng President Bush, President Clinton," Trump has said<http://www.politico.c=
om/story/2015/07/donald-trumps-so-rich-i-cant-be-bought-120743>. "And they=
=92ll say: =91You have to do it. They gave you a million dollars to your ca=
mpaign.'"

For the most part, Trump could claim to be an antidote to that.

Trump was certainly exaggerating claims that his campaign was independently=
 financed =97 Trump has ponied up $36 million of the $48 million raised for=
 his campaign, with the rest from small donor gifts, according to the Commi=
ttee for Responsive Politics. And then there's the issue that Trump has loa=
ned rather<https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/02/24/is-donald-trump-r=
eally-self-financing-his-presidential-campaign/> than given his campaign th=
e money, opening the door for Trump to pay himself back at a later date wit=
h outside donations.

But these are mostly nitpicks that can obscure the bigger picture. Like Ber=
nie Sanders, Trump has refused to raise money from wealthy donors in a way =
that really did meaningfully separate him from the rest of the Republican f=
ield (and Hillary Clinton).

"Throughout the primary, it seemed to bear out that he was mostly accurate =
that he was self-financing his campaign," Stewart says. "Now, there were a =
bunch of caveats =97 and you can get into the weeds of it =97 but I think h=
e's now looking at the reality of the general election and going back on a =
significant promise."

Throughout the primary, Trump said he donated to both Republican and Democr=
atic politicians because doing so gave him pull over <http://abcnews.go.com=
/Politics/donald-trumps-surprisingly-honest-lessons-big-money-politics/stor=
y?id=3D32993736> elected officials in both parties.

This was part of a broader pitch that informed Trump's campaign: Yes, Trump=
 was once a businessman who played a corrupt system, but because he was an =
insider he knows how to expose that system from within.

"When [politicians] call, I give. And you know what, when I need something =
from them two years later, three years later, I call them," Trump said. "Th=
ey are there for me. That's a broken system."

Trump's new fundraising operation puts him directly in the role of the poli=
tician he said he was once trying to buy. Asked about the conflicting messa=
ges, Trump ally Roger Stone argued that the donations wouldn't compromise T=
rump because Trump himself can't be compromised.

"Donald Trump knows Wall Street will pay both sides," Stone told<http://www=
.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html?_r=3D0> the =
New York Times. "Why shouldn=92t he take their money to beat Hillary? They =
are going to find out you can=92t co-opt Donald Trump. He=92s his own man w=
ith his own nationalist views. He can=92t be bought. Sure, he=92ll take the=
ir money, but he won=92t change his views."

This seems like a much less compelling theory of Trump's candidacy than the=
 one he advanced in a primary. It relies much more heavily on the idea that=
 Trump himself amounts to a uniquely pure generational candidate, rather th=
an relying on facts that supported his earlier rhetoric =97 and, for some v=
oters, rang true.

Of course, that doesn't mean Trump won't try to have it both ways. Trump co=
uld move to accept big donor checks while continuing to hammer Clinton for =
being bought off by special interests =97 even if there's no longer a subst=
antive difference in their campaign finance operations.

"It'll be interesting to see if Trump abandons his rhetoric on attacking ot=
her candidates around this issue," Stewart says. "I don't think he will."
