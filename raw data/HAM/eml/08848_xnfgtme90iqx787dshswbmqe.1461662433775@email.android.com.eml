Not sure if you=92ve already seen it, but flagging this article for you guy=

Committee for Democratic dollars =97 first as a parallel organization withi=
n the DNC and then as a separate entity. In the first six months of 2013, t=
he DNC raised $30.8 million, while OFA raised $13 million. And this was at =
a time when the DNC was carrying more than $18 million in debt.

Those fiscal constraints meant the DNC had to curtail the money it provided=
 to state parties, a practice that DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fl=
a.) reversed in 2015 by increasing the monthly minimum transfer to each sta=
te from $5,000 a month to $7,500.

in August 2015. Now, according to Nevada Democratic Party chair Roberta Lan=

While many OFA volunteers have focused on local referendums and other local=
 political battles, the group has earned the enmity of some party stalwarts=

By Juliet Eilperin<http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/juliet-eilperin>

Barack Obama rose to prominence as a different kind of Democrat, an outside=
r who was not part of the establishment and who would chart a separate cour=
se. Eight years later, the president finds himself working hard to restore =
a party from which he was once eager to stand apart.

Obama has presided over a greater loss of electoral power for his party tha=
n any two-term president since World War II. And 2016 represents one last o=
pportunity for him to reverse that trend.

But it is also a challenge for the president who has experimented with esta=
blishing his own political base outside the Democratic National Committee a=
nd has downsized the scale of political operations inside the White House.

The first big tests of the rebuilding efforts come Tuesday in Pennsylvania,=
 where Obama is taking the unusual step of wading into two contested Democr=
atic primaries, endorsing Senate hopeful Katie McGinty and Josh Shapiro, a =
Montgomery County official and early supporter of his who is hoping to beco=
me state attorney general.

Should Democrats claim those two offices in the fall, it would represent a =
small dent in what has become a worrisome decline of power for the party be=
low the presidential level under Obama=92s watch.

Between 2008 and 2015, Democrats lost 13 Senate seats, 69 House seats, 913 =
state legislative seats, 11 governorships and 32 state legislative chambers=
, according to data compiled by University of Virginia professor Larry J. S=
abato. The only president in the past 75 years who comes close is Dwight D.=
 Eisenhower, who saw a similar decline for the GOP during his time in offic=
e.

=93The Republican Party is arguably stronger now than they=92ve ever been i=
n 80 years, despite not having the White House,=94 said Simon Rosenberg, a =
longtime Democratic operative and president of NDN, a liberal think tank.

Democrats also are concerned about whether the coalition Obama galvanized i=
n 2008, and then reassembled in 2012, will turn out when he is no longer on=
 the ballot. The current Democratic presidential primary contest has so far=
 fractured that coalition, with young people flocking to Sen. Bernie Sander=
s of Vermont while many voters of color =97 especially older ones =97 back =
former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.

Many factors have contributed to Republicans=92 gains on the state and fede=
ral levels, including a concerted push by their donors to target state race=
s and a midterm election that allowed them to lock in favorable congression=
al district lines.

Obama=92s defenders contend that after major victories in 2006 and 2008, it=
 was predictable that Democrats would lose significant ground in the midter=
m elections of 2010 and 2014. But, they add, the president=92s two successf=
ul White House bids have vastly upgraded the party=92s voter outreach infra=
structure by expanding the national voter file the Democratic National Comm=
ittee first started in 2006. And they point to the huge increases in the nu=
mber of Democratic campaign volunteers =97 from roughly 252,000 in 2004 to =
2.2 million in 2012 =97 as evidence of that upgrade.

=93Barack Obama has single-handedly modernized the Democrats=92 ability to =
wage campaigns on the local level,=94 said Jim Messina, who managed Obama=
=92s re=ADelection campaign.

Rosenberg agrees, saying that the president built on the work of Bill Clint=
on, the only other two-term Democratic president of the last generation. =
=93Clinton established the intellectual framework for the Democratic Party =
and Obama modernized its politics,=94 Rosenberg said. =93What isn=92t there=
 yet is a large enough set of leaders from the next generation to carry it =
on.=94

Some of Obama=92s earliest decisions continue to reverberate negatively for=
 Democrats.

Organizing for Action (OFA), the nonprofit group that grew out of Obama=92s=
 campaign operation, has continued to compete with the Democratic National =
Committee for Democratic dollars =97 first as a parallel organization withi=
n the DNC and then as a separate entity. In the first six months of 2013, t=
he DNC raised $30.8 million, while OFA raised $13 million. And this was at =
a time when the DNC was carrying more than $18 million in debt.

Those fiscal constraints meant the DNC had to curtail the money it provided=
 to state parties, a practice that DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fl=
a.) reversed in 2015 by increasing the monthly minimum transfer to each sta=
te from $5,000 a month to $7,500.

Close cooperation has taken time; OFA gave the DNC limited access to its li=
st of supporters starting in 2013, but it turned over the entire list only =
in August 2015. Now, according to Nevada Democratic Party chair Roberta Lan=
ge, =93That voter file is used by everyone in our state.=94

While many OFA volunteers have focused on local referendums and other local=
 political battles, the group has earned the enmity of some party stalwarts=
 for diverting resources. During a 2010 gathering of Democratic governors i=
n Washington, according to multiple attendees, one governor asked a senior =
presidential political adviser, =93Will the OFA please join the Democratic =
Party?=94

But this White House, unlike that of Bill Clinton, has always kept its poli=
tical operation on a separate track.

Under Clinton, the political affairs office boasted roughly a dozen people =
=97 in addition to the deputy chief of staff who oversaw political affairs =
=97 and the president got a political briefing once a week.

By contrast, Obama limited election activity in the White House, a reflecti=
on of both his desire to keep any scandal at bay and the influence of White=
 House chief of staff Denis McDonough, who has little campaign experience o=
utside of working on Obama=92s first presidential bid.

Obama phased out the political affairs office after two years to move the o=
peration to his Chicago campaign headquarters. He appointed David Simas, wh=
o directs the White House Office of Political Strategy and Outreach, to his=
 current position only in January 2014, after congressional Democrats compl=
ained they did not have a direct White House contact for political matters.

Obama=92s senior political advisers from his first term =97 Messina, David =
Plouffe and David Axelrod, among others =97 have left to focus on ventures =
in the private sector and academia and scaled back their involvement in day=
-to-day Democratic politics.

Plouffe said it was natural for veteran strategists to move on but acknowle=
dged that Obama=92s relationship with his top political operatives didn=92t=
 automatically translate to other candidates. =93You don=92t do your best w=
ork being a mercenary,=94 said Plouffe, now a strategic adviser to the car =
service firm Uber.

He added that it will take the commitment of wealthy Democratic donors =97 =
not just top party officials =97 to target state contests the way Republica=
ns have. =93I think we all agree something has to be done,=94 he said. =93T=
he question is how. It=92s not going to be the DNC.=94

Obama, for his part, has set limits for what he will do in connection with =
super PACs while in office. While he did fundraising events for the one tha=
t backed his reelection campaign, Priorities USA, McDonough and Obama=92s l=
awyers curtailed what the president would do two years later for the Senate=
 Majority PAC, a similar entity supporting Senate Democrats.

In an April 2014 memo to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.)=
, the PAC=92s counsel, Marc E. Elias, stipulated that to avoid any conflict=
 of interest Obama would not actually ask potential Senate Majority PAC don=
ors for money even when appearing at one of the group=92s events. After mak=
ing this point on the memo=92s first page, he reiterated two pages later, w=
ith underlined emphasis: =93Again, to be clear: the President will not soli=
cit contributions at or in connection with any of these meetings.=94

After a protracted and bitter exchange, Reid=92s aides abandoned their effo=
rt to involve Obama in any more than a few super PAC events, and the presid=
ent agreed to transfer $5 million from the DNC to both the Democratic Senat=
orial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committe=
e in the fall of 2014. During the 2012 cycle, the DNC made no transfers to =
the two committees.

But with his popularity high among Democrats and no election ahead of him, =
Obama has been working to shore up his party, both financially and politica=
lly. And his aides say Obama has turned controversial issues, including imm=
igration, gay rights and climate change, to the Democrats=92 advantage.

=93He will be aggressive, from the presidential level down to the state and=
 local representative level,=94 Simas said. =93There=92s going to be a Demo=
cratic nominee and Democratic candidates. They are the ones who are going t=
o be driving the campaigns, and the president will be there to be as helpfu=
l as possible.=94

Recently in Dallas, before dozens of guests who had each given thousands of=
 dollars to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Obama diagnosed o=
ne of the problems: =93Democrats just aren=92t very good at focusing on dow=
n-ballot races,=94 he said, according to two participants.

The president may have been stating the obvious. But it reflected a shift i=
n thinking among Democrats, who are working furiously to shore up state-lev=
el candidates to avoid getting beaten once again on redistricting. Since 20=
13, Obama has devoted considerable time to fundraising for the DNC and both=
 congressional committees, doing more than 100 events for the DNC alone.

Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, =
said that when he asked Obama to make a series of primary endorsements this=
 cycle, including one of McGinty, =93He just did it with no muss, no fuss, =
in a very great way.=94

In December, the heads of three party committees met to develop a joint red=
istricting strategy, and Obama signed a redistricting fundraising appeal fo=
r the Democratic Governors Association in January. Even former members such=
 as Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) have been asked to attend fundraisers on be=
half of state lawmakers in states such as Ohio.

=93We have to be better and smarter about playing that long game and making=
 those investments,=94 said Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), adding that while H=
ouse Democrats will have =93a very strong wind at their backs=94 this year,=
 =93The day after this election, we have to understand that the wind=92s go=
ing to be in our faces.=94

In 2014, many Democrats in conservative states were eager to tap Obama=92s =
fundraising prowess but were reluctant to appear side-by-side with a presid=
ent with sagging popularity ratings. Already, 2016 is different.

Longtime Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said that for a long time Demo=
crats wanted Obama=92s resources =97 including money and analytics =97 =93b=
ut they didn=92t want his presence.=94 When she called the White House last=
 year to ask if the president would do robo-calls to African American voter=
s during Louisiana=92s special election for governor, White House officials=
 seemed surprised that Democrat John Bel Edwards even wanted their help. Br=
azile assured them that he did.

And Democrats increasingly believe that they will need Obama in the fall to=
 regain some of the ground they=92ve lost since 2008.

=93Part of his legacy is to rebuild the bench,=94 Brazile said.

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Luj=E1n (N.M.)=
 said in an interview that the president will help in unifying the Democrat=
ic base.

=93He=92s going to help boost turnout in November, which is critical when y=
ou=92re winning races on the margins,=94 Luj=E1n said.

r file the Democratic National Committee first started in 2006. And they po=
int to the huge increases in the number of Democratic campaign volunteers =
=97 from roughly 252,000 in 2004 to 2.2&nbsp;million
 in 2012 =97 as evidence of that upgrade.</p>
<p></p>
<p>=93Barack Obama has single-handedly modernized the Democrats=92 ability =
to wage campaigns on the local level,=94 said Jim Messina, who managed Obam=
a=92s re=ADelection campaign.</p>
<p>Rosenberg agrees, saying that the president built on the work of Bill Cl=
inton, the only other two-term Democratic president of the last generation.=
 =93Clinton established the intellectual framework for the Democratic Party=
 and Obama modernized its politics,=94
 Rosenberg said. =93What isn=92t there yet is a large enough set of leaders=
 from the next generation to carry it on.=94</p>
<p>Some of Obama=92s earliest decisions continue to reverberate negatively =
for Democrats.</p>
<p><span style=3D"background-color:rgb(255,255,0)">Organizing for Action (O=
FA), the nonprofit group that grew out of Obama=92s campaign operation, has=
 continued to compete with the Democratic National Committee for Democratic=
 dollars =97 first as a parallel organization
 within the DNC and then as a separate entity. In the first six months of 2=
013, the DNC raised $30.8&nbsp;million, while OFA raised $13&nbsp;million. =
And this was at a time when the DNC was carrying more than $18 million in d=
ebt.</span></p>
<p><span style=3D"background-color:rgb(255,255,0)">Those fiscal constraints=
 meant the DNC had to curtail the money it provided to state parties, a pra=
ctice that DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) reversed in 2015 by =
increasing the monthly minimum transfer
 to each state from $5,000 a month to $7,500.</span></p>
<p><span style=3D"background-color:rgb(255,255,0)">Close cooperation has ta=
ken time; OFA gave the DNC limited access to its list of supporters startin=
g in 2013, but it turned over the entire list only in August 2015. Now, acc=
ording to Nevada Democratic Party
 chair Roberta Lange, =93That voter file is used by everyone in our state.=
=94</span></p>
<p><span style=3D"background-color:rgb(255,255,0)">While many OFA volunteer=
s have focused on local referendums and other local political battles, the =
group has earned the enmity of some party stalwarts for diverting resources=
. During a 2010 gathering of Democratic
 governors in Washington, according to multiple attendees, one governor ask=
ed a senior presidential political adviser, =93Will the OFA please join the=
 Democratic Party?=94</span></p>
<p>But this White House, unlike that of Bill Clinton, has always kept its p=
olitical operation on a separate track.</p>
<p>Under Clinton, the political affairs office boasted roughly a dozen peop=
le =97 in addition to the deputy chief of staff who oversaw political affai=
rs =97 and the president got a political briefing once a week.</p>
<p>By contrast, Obama limited election activity in the White House, a refle=
ction of both his desire to keep any scandal at bay and the influence of Wh=
ite House chief of staff Denis McDonough, who has little campaign experienc=
e outside of working on Obama=92s
 first presidential bid.</p>
<p>Obama phased out the political affairs office after two years to move th=
e operation to his Chicago campaign headquarters. He appointed David Simas,=
 who directs the White House Office of Political Strategy and Outreach, to =
his current position only in January
 2014, after congressional Democrats complained they did not have a direct =
White House contact for political matters.</p>
<p>Obama=92s senior political advisers from his first term =97 Messina, Dav=
id Plouffe and David Axelrod, among others =97 have left to focus on ventur=
es in the private sector and academia and scaled back their involvement in =
day-to-day Democratic politics.</p>
<p>Plouffe said it was natural for veteran strategists to move on but ackno=
wledged that Obama=92s relationship with his top political operatives didn=
=92t automatically translate to other candidates. =93You don=92t do your be=
st work being a mercenary,=94 said Plouffe,
 now a strategic adviser to the car service firm Uber.</p>

<p><span style=3D"background-color:rgb(255,255,0)">He added that it will ta=
ke the commitment of wealthy Democratic donors =97 not just top party offic=
ials =97 to target state contests the way Republicans have. =93I think we a=
ll agree something has to be done,=94 he said.
 =93The question is how. It=92s not going to be the DNC.=94</span></p>
<p>Obama, for his part, has set limits for what he will do in connection wi=
th super PACs while in office. While he did fundraising events for the one =
that backed his reelection campaign, Priorities USA, McDonough and Obama=92=
s lawyers curtailed what the president
 would do two years later for the Senate Majority PAC, a similar entity sup=
porting Senate Democrats.</p>
<p>In an April 2014 memo to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Ne=
v.), the PAC=92s counsel, Marc E. Elias, stipulated that to avoid any confl=
ict of interest Obama would not actually ask potential Senate Majority PAC =
donors for money even when appearing
 at one of the group=92s events. After making this point on the memo=92s fi=
rst page, he reiterated two pages later, with underlined emphasis: =93Again=
, to be clear: the President will not solicit contributions at or in connec=
tion with any of these meetings.=94</p>
<p>After a protracted and bitter exchange, Reid=92s aides abandoned their e=
ffort to involve Obama in any more than a few super PAC events, and the pre=
sident agreed to transfer $5&nbsp;million from the DNC to both the Democrat=
ic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the
 Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the fall of 2014. During th=
e 2012 cycle, the DNC made no transfers to the two committees.</p>
<p>But with his popularity high among Democrats and no election ahead of hi=
m, Obama has been working to shore up his party, both financially and polit=
ically. And his aides say Obama has turned controversial issues, including =
immigration, gay rights and climate
 change, to the Democrats=92 advantage.</p>
<p>=93He will be aggressive, from the presidential level down to the state =
and local representative level,=94 Simas said. =93There=92s going to be a D=
emocratic nominee and Democratic candidates. They are the ones who are goin=
g to be driving the campaigns, and the president
 will be there to be as helpful as possible.=94</p>
<p>Recently in Dallas, before dozens of guests who had each given thousands=
 of dollars to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Obama diagnose=
d one of the problems: =93Democrats just aren=92t very good at focusing on =
down-ballot races,=94 he said, according
 to two participants.</p>
<p><span style=3D"background-color:rgb(255,255,0)">The president may have b=
een stating the obvious. But it reflected a shift in thinking among Democra=
ts, who are working furiously to shore up state-level candidates to avoid g=
etting beaten once again on redistricting.
 Since 2013, Obama has devoted considerable time to fundraising for the DNC=
 and both congressional committees, doing more than 100 events for the DNC =
alone.</span></p>
<p>Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the second-ranking Democrat in the Senat=
e, said that when he asked Obama to make a series of primary endorsements t=
his cycle, including one of McGinty, =93He just did it with no muss, no fus=
s, in a very great way.=94</p>
<p>In December, the heads of three party committees met to develop a joint =
redistricting strategy, and Obama signed a redistricting fundraising appeal=
 for the Democratic Governors Association in January. Even former members s=
uch as Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.)
 have been asked to attend fundraisers on behalf of state lawmakers in stat=
es such as Ohio.</p>
<p>=93We have to be better and smarter about playing that long game and mak=
ing those investments,=94 said Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), adding that whil=
e House Democrats will have =93a very strong wind at their backs=94 this ye=
ar, =93The day after this election, we have
 to understand that the wind=92s going to be in our faces.=94</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2014, many Democrats in conservative states were eager to tap Obama=
=92s fundraising prowess but were reluctant to appear side-by-side with a p=
resident with sagging popularity ratings. Already, 2016 is different.</p>
<p>Longtime Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said that for a long time D=
emocrats wanted Obama=92s resources =97 including money and analytics =97 =
=93but they didn=92t want his presence.=94 When she called the White House =
last year to ask if the president would do robo-calls
 to African American voters during Louisiana=92s special election for gover=
nor, White House officials seemed surprised that Democrat John Bel Edwards =
even wanted their help. Brazile assured them that he did.</p>
<p>And Democrats increasingly believe that they will need Obama in the fall=
 to regain some of the ground they=92ve lost since 2008.</p>
<p>=93Part of his legacy is to rebuild the bench,=94 Brazile said.</p>
<p>Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Luj=E1n (N.=
M.) said in an interview that the president will help in unifying the Democ=
ratic base.</p>
<p></p>
<p>=93He=92s going to help boost turnout in November, which is critical whe=
n you=92re winning races on the margins,=94 Luj=E1n said.</p>
