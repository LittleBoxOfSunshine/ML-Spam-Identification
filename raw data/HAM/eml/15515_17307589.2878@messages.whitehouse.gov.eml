Subject: Travel pool3/Obama Bourdain OTR

Obama did an OTR with Anthony Bourdain down a narrow ramshackle alleyway =
in a neighborhood called Me Tri. A heavy rain created pools of muddy wate=
r in the ground as crowds of onlookers were scrunched to the sides of the=
 road trying to keep under awnings to stay drive. Also the motorcade vehi=
cles blocked most of the width of the road. The president met with Bourda=
in in a small complex at a bend in the road where his limo was parked. Yo=
ur pool was led out to get a quick spray. Potus was in shirtsleeves and B=
ourdain dressed casually, they were apparently not eating per WH but doin=
g an interview. They shook hands and Potus walked across the street to sh=
ake hands. It was pandemonium as the crowds shouted and reached for him a=
nd secret service tried to maintain order in the pelting rain. Your poole=
r was jostled and pushed back into a motorcade vehicle. After a couple mi=
nutes Potus turned and enters his limo and pool returned to press vans. B=
y 1:30 pm<x-apple-data-detectors://0> we were rolling for airport.
