McCain on tape: Trump damages my reelection hopes<http://www.politico.com/s=

By BURGESS EVERETT and SEUNG MIN KIM

Publicly, John McCain insists Donald Trump will have a negligible effect on=
 his campaign for reelection. But behind closed doors at a fundraiser in Ar=
izona last month, the Republican senator and two-time presidential hopeful =
offered a far more dire assessment to his supporters.

=93If Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket, here in Arizona, with over =

and in the country, you will see that it is all anti-Trump. The Hispanic co=
mmunity is roused and angry in a way that I've never seen in 30 years.=94


The 2008 GOP presidential nominee is certainly the favorite in his race to =
win a sixth term in the Senate. But his remarks about the party=92s presump=
tive nominee expose a deep well of concern about how Trump might damage the=
 GOP=92s chances in the battle for Senate control =97 especially in states =
like Arizona, Nevada and Florida, where Latinos make up a big chunk of vote=
rs. Republicans are defending two dozen seats this year, many in blue and p=
urple states, vs. just 10 for Democrats =97 a daunting landscape even witho=
ut Trump atop the ballot.



McCain has said he=92ll support the nominee, and he is in better shape to h=
old onto his seat than many of his vulnerable Republican colleagues. But if=
 Trump=92s nomination turns out to be more than a minor drag on down-ballot=
 Republicans, McCain =97 who=92s expected to face Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, a c=
redible Democratic challenger =97 could easily become a top target. One of =
his former top aides, Mark Salter, has already said he will support Hillary=
 Clinton for president.



Trump, of course, entered the race promising to build a wall along the sout=
hern border and calling Mexican immigrants =93rapists=94 and =93murderers.=
=94 He=92s toned down his rhetoric about undocumented immigrants, if only s=
lightly, as he shifts to general election mode. But in one troubling sign f=
or the GOP, polling<http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/florida/2016/05/8=
598048/florida-poll-republican-brand-damage-bolsters-clinton> in Florida th=
is week revealed broad, lingering antipathy among Latino voters toward Trum=
p. If that persists through the fall and extends to other states, it could =
cost the GOP crucial Senate seats in a year when they have almost no room f=
or error.

Latinos make up 22 percent of eligible voters in Arizona, 18 percent in Flo=
rida, 17 percent in Nevada, 14 percent in Colorado and 10 percent in Illino=
is, according to Pew Research<http://www.pewhispanic.org/interactives/mappi=
ng-the-latino-electorate-by-state/>. All are states with competitive Senate=
 elections, where GOP candidates will have to decide whether to break with =
Trump.



=93I would argue that we are living a [Prop.] 187 moment at a national leve=
l,=94 said Maria Teresa Kumar, president and CEO of Voto Latino, referring =
to the controversial 1994 ballot measure in California widely blamed for tu=
rning the state blue. =93It=92s very, very tough for a senator to get out o=
f that.=94



Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, the only Republican senator in 2012 to win a state=
 carried by President Barack Obama, fought off Mitt Romney=92s rhetoric on =
"self-deportation" and distanced himself from the candidate's =9347 percent=
=94 remarks. He says Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nev.), running for the open seat of r=
etiring Minority Leader Harry Reid, can do the same. But a Trump nomination=
, Heller said, means =93it just takes more work.=94

Heck =93has a great relationship with the Hispanic community. And he doesn=
=92t have the same weaknesses that Trump has, mainly [with] women and other=
 groups,=94 Heller said.



The challenge for Heck, who told a Nevada TV station Tuesday he will suppor=
t the GOP nominee but is focused =93solely=94 on his own race, comes in the=
 form of Democratic candidate Catherine Cortez Masto, who is likely to link=
 Heck to Trump every day until November.



Cortez Masto, who would be the first Latina senator, called the Trump effec=
t =93personal.=94 Immigrant-rights activists say the presumptive Republican=
 nominee could hurt Heck as he battles Sharron Angle in a primary and, if h=
e prevails, faces a competitive race against Cortez Masto.



=93He=92s taken eight votes in the House=94 against Obama=92s executive act=
ions on immigration, Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigratio=
n reform group America=92s Voice, said of Heck. =93Imagine Catherine Cortez=
 Masto running ads in Spanish saying, =91Joe Heck has the same position as =
Donald Trump.=92 He supports Donald Trump. That=92s going to be tied around=
 his neck.=94



Activists such as Sharry are deep into a massive mobilization campaign of L=
atino and immigrant voters in Nevada, Florida and Colorado that=92s led by =
prominent advocacy groups including America=92s Voice, the Latino Victory P=
roject and the Center for Community Change Action.



Though much of their firepower in the $15 million campaign is trained on Tr=
ump and his rhetoric, officials from the campaign =97 called the Immigrant =
Voter Project =97 say they are just as focused on down-ballot races.



=93The bottom line is that there is a price to be paid for belonging to a p=
arty that explicitly endorses a very virulent anti-immigrant agenda,=94 sai=
d Kica Matos, director of immigrant rights and racial justice at the Center=
 for Community Change Action. =93You can=92t divorce John McCain from the p=
erson who is more likely than not the Republican presidential nominee.=94



The nonpartisan National Association for Latino Elected and Appointed Offic=
ials projected that 13.1 million Latinos will cast ballots in November. Tha=
t would be a 17 percent increase in turnout and an 8.7 percent boost in the=
 Latino share of the electorate from 2012, when Obama trounced Romney by 44=
 points among Latino voters.



In Nevada, NALEO officials predicted that more than 194,000 Latinos will vo=
te this fall, which would be a 24 percent increase in turnout from 2012. Ne=
arly 1.7 million Latinos are projected to vote in Florida, a 20 percent boo=
st in turnout from four years ago, if accurate.



In Florida, Sen. Marco Rubio would offer the GOP its best chance to keep th=
e seat with Trump as the nominee.



Democrats in Florida aren=92t quite sure what to prepare for given the crow=
ded GOP primary. Rep. Ron DeSantis and Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera told t=
he Tampa Bay Times on Wednesday that they will support Trump, though Lopez-=
Cantera has been critical of Trump=92s rhetoric and immigration proposals. =
Carlos Beruff, a wealthy GOP candidate, is calling for the party to unite b=
ehind Trump, while Rep. David Jolly called on Trump to withdraw from the ra=
ce in December, walked that statement back and now says he doesn=92t know w=
hether he will vote for the business mogul.



Regardless of who emerges, Democrats will do everything to link Trump to hi=
m.

=93One thing that I hear continually, especially in the Hispanic community,=
 is that they are not going to support Donald Trump,=94 said Rep. Patrick M=
urphy of Florida, who is competing for the Democratic nomination against Re=
p. Alan Grayson.



The numbers bear out Murphy=92s claim. Gallup found in March that 77 percen=
t of Hispanics in the United States had an unfavorable view of Trump, while=
 just 12 percent had a favorable view of him.



Latino Decisions, a Latino-specific polling firm that has done work for Dem=
ocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, reported even higher figure=
s. In an April poll, Trump earned an unfavorable rating from 87 percent of =
Latino voters.



In a late-April interview in the Capitol, McCain said his reelection bid is=
 =93not particularly=94 different than past campaigns despite Trump likely =
being at the top of the ticket. His brand in Arizona, McCain said, is stron=
g enough to withstand any fallout from Trump.



McCain has spent decades building his credentials with the Latino community=
. He's been a persistent champion of immigration reform and won the endorse=
ment this year of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the first time the=
 group has endorsed a candidate. He=92s opposed Trump=92s statements on imm=
igrants for months, and aides say he will continue to do so.



=93I believe that people will judge me on what I=92ve done and more importa=
ntly what I can do,=94 McCain said in an interview last week. =93People rea=
lly do know me and know what I=92ve done.=94



At the fundraiser on April 8, though, McCain admitted Trump is an X-factor.

=93Frankly there=92s an element of nativism in it as well, as you know. The=
 first wedge that Donald Trump had that gave him notoriety was, =91Build a =
wall,=92 =91rapist,=92 =91murderers,=92 etc.,=94 McCain said at the Phoenix=
 fundraiser in April. =93And so, this is going to be a tough campaign for m=
e.=94



It=92s the perfect year for Kirkpatrick, whose House seat is perpetually co=
mpetitive, to put her name on a statewide ballot. In an interview, she said=
 as long as McCain continues to back Trump in the presidential contest, the=
 business mogul will continue to do damage.



=93Latino voters in Arizona, and especially young Latino voters, are going =
to play a huge role in who will represent Arizona for the next six years,=
=94 Kirkpatrick said. =93They are absolutely appalled by Trump=92s hateful =
rhetoric.=94
