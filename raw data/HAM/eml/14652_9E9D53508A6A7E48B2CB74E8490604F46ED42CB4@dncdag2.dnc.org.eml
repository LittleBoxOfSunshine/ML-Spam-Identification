FACT CHECK: PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DEPORTATION RELIEF HELPS FAMILIES, BUT IS NOT=
 A FREE PASS



Donald Trump just said that Fifth Circuit Court's decision on DAPA was caus=
e for "a great day...it was a terrific thing that happened."

Every Democratic presidential candidate understands that President Obama is=
 fighting to keep families together while Republicans refuse to work toward=
 comprehensive immigration reform.

The president's protections hold undocumented immigrants accountable by req=
uiring them to register, pass criminal and national security background che=
cks, and start paying taxes. It also focuses on deporting those who pose a =
threat, while cracking down on illegal immigration at the border.

The President's Executive Action Would Hold Undocumented Immigrants Account=
able-By Requiring Them To Register, Pass Criminal And National Security Bac=
kground Checks, And Start Paying Taxes. "Accountability - Criminal Backgrou=
nd Checks and Taxes: The President is also acting to hold accountable those=
 undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US for more than five years =
and are parents of U.S. citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents.  By registe=
ring and passing criminal and national security background checks, millions=
 of undocumented immigrants will start paying their fair share of taxes and=
 temporarily stay in the U.S. without fear of deportation for three years a=
t a time." [White House, 11/20/14<https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-offi=
ce/2014/11/20/fact-sheet-immigration-accountability-executive-action>]



The President's Executive Action Focused On Deporting Those Who Threaten Na=
tional Security, Not Families. "Deporting Felons, Not Families: The Preside=
nt's actions focus on the deportation of people who threaten national secur=
ity and public safety. He has directed immigration enforcement to place any=
one suspected of terrorism, violent criminals, gang members, and recent bor=
der crossers at the top of the deportation priority list." [White House, 11=
/20/14<https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/20/fact-sheet-im=
migration-accountability-executive-action>]



President Obama's Executive Order On Immigration Would Crack Down On Illega=
l Immigration At The Border. "Cracking Down on Illegal Immigration at the B=
order:  The President's actions increase the chances that anyone attempting=
 to cross the border illegally will be caught and sent back. Continuing the=
 surge of resources that effectively reduced the number of unaccompanied ch=
ildren crossing the border illegally this summer, the President's actions w=
ill also centralize border security command-and-control to continue to crac=
k down on illegal immigration." [White House, 11/20/14<https://www.whitehou=
se.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/20/fact-sheet-immigration-accountability-ex=
ecutive-action>]

n Immigration, Responded "The DACA and DAPA? Yes I Would." "Bush also said =

f you become president, what are your top five priorities in the first 100 =
days? BUSH: Undoing... (INAUDIBLE SHOUT FROM CROWD) Yes, right. Undoing the=
 -- by executive order, undoing what the president has done, you know, usin=
g authority he doesn't have." [Jeb Bush speech, CPAC, 2/27/15]



Rubio Attacked Deportation Relief And Said He Would Make Sure It Was "Rever=

eversed. It needs to be reversed.." [Hannity, Fox News, 4/13/15]



Ted Cruz Introduced Legislation That Would Defund And End Deferred Action F=
or Childhood Arrivals (DACA). "U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today introduce=
d legislation to prevent the Obama Administration from using any taxpayer f=
unds to expand DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and from conti=
nuing to lawlessly grant amnesty and work permits to new immigrants who ent=

 should keep in mind when considering reforms." [Press Release, Office of S=

Trump Would Rescind President Obama's Executive Actions On Immigration, Tou=
ghen Deportation, And End Birthright Citizenship. "Republican presidential =
candidate Donald Trump wants more than a wall to keep out immigrants living=
 in the country illegally. He also wants to end 'birthright citizenship' fo=
r their children, he said Sunday. And he would rescind Obama administration=
 executive orders on immigration and toughen deportation, allowing in only =
'the good ones.'" [Associated Press, 8/16/15<http://wtop.com/tv/2015/08/tru=

ed Immigrants, Many Of Whom Came To The U.S. As Children Or Were The Family=
 Members Of U.S. Citizens. "U.S. Sen. Rand Paul has filed a bill that would=
 rescind President Barack Obama's executive order on immigration that effec=
tively delays the deportation of about 4 million immigrants who don't have =
the proper documentation to stay in the country. Many of those effected by =
Obama's order came to the United States as children or are the parents or f=
amily members of U.S. citizens." [Courier-Journal, 12/13/14<http://www.cour=

*         Ben Carson Said President's Obama's Executive Action On Immigrati=
on Was Part Of A "Nefarious Agenda." "Friday on Newsmax TV's 'America's For=
um,' former Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon Ben Carson said President Barack Oba=
ma's executive order amnesty is part of his 'nefarious agenda,' that will c=
ause illegal immigrants to flood the welfare roles and create a new wave of=
 government dependent Democrat voters. Carson said, 'I think he's very smar=

Illegal Cheat Around The Rules To Create A New Bloc Of Democratic Voters" A=
nd Suggested It Would Backfire Like ISIS And Iran. Huckabee wrote of Presid=
ent Obama's executive action to expand DACA, "If Obama's amnesty action rea=

a new bloc of Democratic voters - then it might backfire as badly as his pl=

Fiorina Opposed Deportation Relief Suggesting It Should Be Challenged In Co=
urt And Adding, "What He's Doing Is Terrible... It's An Overreach."  FIORIN=
A on deportation relief: "Well, I think challenging him in the courts may v=
ery well make sense. And I think what he's doing is terrible. It's cynical.=
 It's an overreach. The practical impact I'm not sure of frankly because so=
 many illegals aren't being deported now. So sometimes Obama is famous for =
gestures that sound great but they don't really mean very much. So I don't =
approve of what he's doing." [Neil Cavuto, Fox Business, 11/19/14<http://vi=
