But she stayed calm, poised, and emphasized her point when Wallace interrupted her. We should've prepped on the email issue, so she and I talked about it on the phone afterwards, which will help her have a better poker face there next time.

She was certainly more assertive in the interviews during the week, chalk today up the slower pace to the Sunday lull, but it is good that she was calm and didn't sound defensive. And she went back to the big picture, which was helpful. She dropped in good contrast message.

I don't think we need to hit the panic button. It was fine.
