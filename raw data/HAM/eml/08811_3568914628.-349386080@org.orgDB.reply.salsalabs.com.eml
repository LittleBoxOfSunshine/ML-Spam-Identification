SOA WATCH ACTIVISTS VS. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
Appeal Hearing on Infamous U.S. Military Training School

The attorneys and plaintiffs will be available for interviews following the=
 hearing

Friday, May 13, 2016
9:00 am Court Session
Before: Kleinfeld, Ikuta and Watford, Circuit Judges
Courtroom 4, 2nd Floor, Rm 260
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
James R. Browning U.S. Courthouse
95 7th Street, San Francisco, California

San Francisco - On May 13, 2016, three judges of the 9th Circuit Court of A=
ppeals will hear oral arguments in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) la=
wsuit brought by School of the Americas Watch members, Theresa Cameranesi a=
nd Judith Liteky.  As plaintiffs, they seek to compel the U.S. Department o=
f Defense to disclose the names and military units of foreign students and =
instructors attending the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Coopera=
tion (WHINSEC), a U.S. military training school located at Fort Benning, Ge=
orgia and funded by U.S. taxpayers.

In 2014, Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton, of the United States Northern District =
Court of California, ordered the Department of Defense to release the names=
 of the students and instructors at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Se=
curity Cooperation (formerly known as the School of the Americas, or SOA), =
a U.S. military training school for Latin American soldiers that for decade=
s has been connected to torturers, death squads and military dictators thro=
ughout the Americas. SOA Watch activists had taken the U.S. government to c=
ourt over its refusal to release the information, and won. Read the court r=
uling here: http://SOAW.org/judgment

The U.S. Department of Defense subsequently filed a notice to appeal the co=
urt ruling.

SOA Watch is an independent, grassroots movement that provides citizen over=
sight of U.S. military training given to Latin American military and police=
 personnel at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, fo=
rmerly known as the School of Americas. Through vigils and fasts, demonstra=
tions and nonviolent protest, as well as media, legal and legislative work,=
 the movement works in solidarity with the people of Latin America and the =
Caribbean for human rights, economic justice, and democracy.

The U.S. Department of Defense has denied Freedom of Information (FOIA) req=
uests by School of the Americas Watch for the names of WHINSEC students and=
 instructors for the years 2004-2010. For the years 1946-2003 the names had=
 always been released when requested. The names are the basis of the SOA Wa=
tch database and the means of citizen oversight of the record of SOA/WHINSE=
C graduates.

Plaintiff Theresa Cameranesi is a member of the School of the Americas Watc=
h Council. She is also a member of the SOA Watch Legislative Working Group =
and is active in advocating for Congressional investigation of the human ri=
ghts records of graduates of SOA and WHINSEC. As part of the SOA Watch San =
Francisco Research Group, she and plaintiff Judith Liteky identified studen=
ts and instructors at WHINSEC who were admitted for training even though th=
ey had been charged with human rights violations.

Plaintiff Judith Liteky has been active with School of the Americas Watch s=
ince its founding in 1990 in response to the massacre in San Salvador at th=
e University of Central America. On the night of November 16, 1989, a Salva=
doran Army patrol entered the University campus and massacred six Jesuit pr=
iests, their housekeeper and her daughter. Nineteen of the military officer=
s cited for this atrocity had received training at the US Army School of th=
e Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia. Judith was a co-founder of School of t=
he Americas Watch San Francisco.

Plaintiff's Cameranesi and Liteky received the 2014 James Madison Freedom o=
f Information Citizen Award for pressing a Freedom of Information Act lawsu=
it against the Department of Defense to win a precedent-setting ruling that=
 the government may not withhold on national security grounds the names and=
 military unit information of graduates and instructors at the former Schoo=
l of the Americas, now known as the Western Hemisphere Institute for Securi=
ty Cooperation.

The SOA Watch plaintiffs are being represented by attorneys Duffy Carolan a=
nd Kent Spriggs.

Duffy Carolan is a partner with the San Francisco firm Jassy Vick Carolan. =
Attorney Carolan has been honored by her peers as San Francisco's Lawyer of=
 the Year in Litigation - First Amendment cases. She has also received the =
James Madison Freedom of Information Award, a Bay Area honor given to indiv=
iduals and organizations who have made significant contributions to the adv=
ancement of freedom of expression, particularly freedom of information and =
open government.

Kent Spriggs is the principal in Spriggs Law Firm, Tallahassee, Florida. At=
torney Spriggs has represented individuals in civil rights actions, the maj=
ority in class actions. He also works in the field of international human r=
ights, including representing those illegally detained at Guant=C3=A1namo B=
ay, and assisted in the analysis of U.S. money used to destabilize sovereig=
n Latin American democracies. He has been a human rights observer in El Sal=
vador, Honduras, Colombia, and Chile as well as Palestine and Afghanistan.
