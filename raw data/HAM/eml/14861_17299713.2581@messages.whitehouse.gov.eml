THE WHITE HOUSE



Office of the First Lady

_________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release April 29, 2016





REMARKS BY THE FIRST LADY

AT JAZZ FESTIVAL WORKSHOP



State Dining Room





11:59 A.M. EDT





 MRS. OBAMA: Hey! (Applause.) How is everybody doing? You guys been hangi=
ng out at the White House? Have they been treating you well? You guys goo=
d? You guys comfortable?



AUDIENCE: Yes.



MRS. OBAMA: We heard you up there jamming. It was a good way to start the=
 morning. So welcome to the White House, everybody. I hope everybody is t=
reating you well.=20



I want to start by thanking the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, as wel=
l as the folks at UNESCO, and so many others who have made this day possi=
ble. This is going to be a really good day, and were starting it out with=
 you guys. You look so handsome.



I want to thank our incredible artists who are with us. Weve got Herbie H=
ancock, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Bobby Watson, and Terence Blanchard. (Applau=
se.) And were also going to have a group of amazing students who are stud=
ying jazz at UCLA. Where are the students? You look like grown people. (L=
aughter.) Doesnt look like students.=20



Well, welcome, welcome. Its great to have you all here. Thank you so much=
. You know, this is a busy day, and the fact that these guys are taking t=
his morning to be with you when theyre going to be playing all through th=
e night is a real testament to how excited they are for our young generat=
ion -- you guys. And you guys are really the star of the show today.



So we welcome students who are here from high schools from the D.C., Virg=
inia and Maryland areas. Are you guys all studying music, or are you just=
 sort of hanging out at the White House? (Laughter.) So I hope this is as=
 exciting a day for you as it is for me.=20



Today, we arent just celebrating a uniquely American art form, were also =
honoring the history and the people who shaped the art form into what it =
is today. And that history goes way back. As many of you know, if you wer=
e students of jazz, it unfolded in smoky dance halls in New Orleans and i=
n clubs in Harlem, and in simple shacks all throughout the South where Af=
rican American artists drew on our nations diverse cultural heritage to i=
nvent a new kind of sound. And its a blend of irresistible rhythms and ir=
repressible creativity, but jazz is also described as Americas greatest c=
ontribution to the arts.=20



But of course, while the music may have started here in America, in years=
 since, its truly become a globally inspired piece of work. Jazz is now p=
erformed and treasured by folks of every background in just about every p=
art of the world.=20



So to honor and help continue this proud legacy, today, we are celebratin=
g the fifth annual International Jazz Day. (Applause.) And weve been work=
ing on getting this done for a little bit, so I am thrilled that this is =
happening, that Washington, D.C. was selected as the host city this year.=
 And we are so excited to be putting on just a big, huge jazz concert her=
e at the White House tonight. You saw that -- I wont call it a tent, beca=
use its more like a structure thats on the South Lawn where the concert i=
s going to be held.=20

=20

This show is just one of thousands of performances and celebrations happe=
ning all across the globe, in 190 countries on six continents today. So i=
t turns out that just about everybody loves jazz, right? (Laughter.) And =
I am absolutely no exception.

""

I grew up in a jazz household. Everybody knows I grew up on the South Sid=
e of Chicago. I tell this story always because truly, jazz was the music =
I was raised on. My mothers father, my grandfather -- who we called South=
side -- now thats a jazz-lovers name. (Laughter.) Southside was a carpent=
er, and he built a makeshift jazz studio in his little two-bedroom house =
where all the kids -- my mother came from a big family of seven brothers =
and sisters. But this was a two-bedroom house. He had a wall of jazz. He =
had mismatched turntables, a reel-to-reel, and he connected speakers into=
 every room in the house. I mean, literally, that was surround sound befo=
re we even knew what it was. (Laughter.) They werent all the same brands;=
 some speakers were found in the alley, some speakers were given to him.



But my grandfather would wake up every single morning and he would turn o=
n jazz. And he would blast it at the highest possible volume that he coul=
d get away with. So I really grew up with jazz as kind of the backdrop to=
 my childhood. Wed all gather at his house -- and whether we were unwrapp=
ing Christmas presents, it was Miles Davis playing. If it was a birthday =
celebration, it was Charlie Parker. I just came to grow up loving jazz. M=
y father was a jazz lover, and of course, I married a man who was a jazz =
lover, too, the President of the United States, who is looking forward to=
 tonight.



So jazz has really fueled my life in ways that I can't describe. It just =
generates all these memories for me from my childhood. And all these year=
s later, to have the world's greatest jazz musicians play a concert in ou=
r backyard -- and I do mean "our," the nation's backyard -- on Duke Ellin=
gton's birthday, no less, is really kind of an amazing full-circle moment=
 for me and I know for so many people.=20



And I'm especially thrilled to share this passion with so many D.C. stude=
nts on D.C.'s College Signing Day, which is why everybody is wearing thei=
r college gear. For those of you who dont know what College Day is, this =
is the day that a lot of students declare where they're going to college.=
 You guys look awesome in your gear. It's a good thing. And I have a coll=
ege-bound student who will be declaring soon.



 But I think that it just means a lot. It's a perfect combination to be c=
elebrating College Signing Day with International Jazz Day. Because no ma=
tter what you want to do in your life -- whether it's to be a jazz musici=
an or an entrepreneur or a scientist or a teacher -- you're going to need=
 a good education. And everybody on this stage understands that. You are =
going to need to get an education beyond high school.=20



 And at the same time, we also know the power of bringing the arts into o=
ur schools. And I can't say this enough here, but the arts cannot be an o=
ption for our kids. It's got to be a necessity, just like math and scienc=
e and reading, and all that kind of stuff. Arts has to be a part of that,=
 because we know that students who get involved in things like music or d=
rama or visual arts, they just do better. The studies are clear. They hav=
e better grades, they have better graduation rates, they have better coll=
ege enrollment rates.



 Music and arts is a foundation for an outstanding education. And that's =
why, as soon as we got to the White House, we started hosting these works=
hops during the day when we would have music series in the evenings. We a=
ctually kicked things off in 2009 with a jazz workshop. That was the very=
 first workshop that we did. And since then, we have celebrated every art=
 form, music form, from ballet to country music to gospel to Broadway. An=
d every single time, we bring kids here, like you guys, to spend time wit=
h the talent, who takes their mornings on a busy day to be with you all.



 So we're grateful to have you. And at every event, weve highlighted the =
transformative power of education, because if you complete your education=
 past high school, there is really nothing that you can't do. But we emph=
asize this because a high school diploma these days is not enough, but a =
four-year [college] isnt the only thing you need to do. There are many wa=
ys to get that education, whether it's a four-year school, a two-year com=
munity college, a training program, what have you. But high school is not=
 enough. And that's the message that we send to kids as much as we can, a=
nd to families, to understand the importance that education has in young =
people's lives.



 The lives of the musicians on this stage are a testament to that truth. =
Bobby Watson started his career in the world-famous jazz program at the U=
niversity of Miami. And I hope they all talk about their experience. Dee =
Dee Bridgewater began touring internationally with the University of Illi=
nois Big Band. Terence Blanchard got his big break with Art Blakeys Jazz =
Messengers while he was a student at Rutgers. And then there's Herbie Han=
cock, this young man here. I think he's still about 25 or something. So h=
e's a prodigy. But he arrived as a freshman at Grinnell College. And when=
 he got to school, he was torn between his passions for music and for ele=
ctrical engineering. Okay, so let's just stop there. (Laughter.)=20



 And even after he decided to be a musician, he used his engineering back=
ground to experiment with electronic instruments to create whole new land=
scapes of sound. Today, as you all should know, if you are real students =
of jazz, he is one of the most influential jazz pianists and composers in=
 history, with 14 Grammys to his name. Just saying. (Laughter.)=20



 And I think that Herbies story illustrates an important point -- that wh=
ile the folks on this stage are now legends, they spent plenty of long ye=
ars really mastering the fundamentals first. And the same, hopefully, wil=
l be true for all of you.



 For those of you who want to be musicians, that means that before you ca=
n improvise and do those solos, youve got to practice those scales. Youve=
 got to understand music theory. Youve got to get down to the nuts and bo=
lts before you can do this. If you want to be something else -- if you wa=
nt to be a teacher or a doctor or a lawyer, or President of the United St=
ates -- youve got to buckle down in class. Which means when you get to co=
llege, youve got to blow it out. Youve got to take your classes seriously=
 -- which means go to class every day, which sometimes feels like an opti=
on when you're in college, if we all remember. But you need to go to clas=
s. You need to take good notes. You need to raise your hand. You need to =
be focused in school -- because you're paying for it. So you're going to =
feel the pain when you leave, so you might as well get your money's worth=
.



 And I want you all to throw yourselves into all the activities that camp=
us life brings, if you're going to campus -- which means join clubs, be i=
nvolved in extracurricular activities. Dont sit in your dorm room alone. =
That is not the college experience. You're not supposed to get through co=
llege on your own, so you got to break out.=20



And the most important thing I tell young people headed to college is ask=
 for help. Do not be afraid to ask for help. That is the thing that dooms=
 college students. They think they should do it all alone. And no one get=
s through college or anything in life without a whole lot of help. So the=
 minute you start feeling a little out of sorts, the minute you feel like=
 you're falling behind, you dont think you understand something in class,=
 there are a whole array of people who are there to help you, from counse=
lors to RAs to tutoring centers -- you name it. But youve got to find the=
m. They're not going to come looking for you. That's the difference in co=
llege. They expect you to be grown up and identify your needs and go afte=
r it, okay?=20



 But if you guys do all of that, the sky is the limit. You can be great m=
usicians, you can be legends in your own time. You can be the President o=
f the United States. You can do whatever you want. This stuff isnt rocket=
 science. Well, to be what theyre -- you have to have some talent. (Laugh=
ter.) It's like, I can't do anything these can people do. But you all can=
 do what I do, if you choose to.



 So I hope that you use this time here to really ask questions. Dont be n=
ervous. When I leave, the press will leave so you'll be okay. (Laughter.)=
 Ask questions. Get the wisdom from these folks. They are here for you. W=
e are here for you all. And have some fun along the way.=20



 And to all our students going to college, I wish you all the very, very =
best of luck. You got a President and a First Lady who are behind you all=
 every step of the way. Just remember, when you hit a barrier, that's whe=
n you grow. So dont let that shut you down -- because we've all had our t=
rials and tribulations. We've all failed big in some way, shape or form. =
The question isn't whether you fail, it's how you get up and move on. So =
keep it up, all right? Until then, just have a good time here this mornin=
g, all right?=20



And with that, I'm going to go do some more work. But I'm going to turn i=
t over to Herbie Hancock and our musicians who are going to take it away =
for you guys. All right? Thank you so much. (Applause.)=20

 So welcome to the White House, everybody.&nbsp; I hope everybody is treati=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I want to start by thanki=
ng the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, as well as the folks at UNESCO, a=
nd so many others who have made this day possible.&nbsp; This is going to b=
e a really good day, and we&#8217;re starting it
 out with you guys.&nbsp; You look so handsome.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I want to thank our incre=
dible artists who are with us.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got Herbie Hancock, Dee De=
e Bridgewater, Bobby Watson, and Terence Blanchard.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;=
 And we&#8217;re also going to have a group of amazing students
 who are studying jazz at UCLA.&nbsp; Where are the students?&nbsp; You loo=
k like grown people.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Doesn&#8217;t look like studen=
ts.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Well, welcome, welcome.&n=
bsp; It&#8217;s great to have you all here.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; =
You know, this is a busy day, and the fact that these guys are taking this =
morning to be with you when they&#8217;re going to be playing all
 through the night is a real testament to how excited they are for our youn=
g generation -- you guys.&nbsp; And you guys are really the star of the sho=
w today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we welcome students wh=
o are here from high schools from the D.C., Virginia and Maryland areas.&nb=
sp; Are you guys all studying music, or are you just sort of hanging out at=
 the White House?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; So I hope
 this is as exciting a day for you as it is for me.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Today, we aren&#8217;t ju=
st celebrating a uniquely American art form, we&#8217;re also honoring the =
history and the people who shaped the art form into what it is today.&nbsp;=
 And that history goes way back.&nbsp; As many of you know,
 if you were students of jazz, it unfolded in smoky dance halls in New Orle=
ans and in clubs in Harlem, and in simple shacks all throughout the South w=
here African American artists drew on our nation&#8217;s diverse cultural h=
eritage to invent a new kind of sound.&nbsp;
 And it&#8217;s a blend of irresistible rhythms and irrepressible creativit=
y, but jazz is also described as America&#8217;s greatest contribution to t=
he arts.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But of course, while the =
music may have started here in America, in years since, it&#8217;s truly be=
come a globally inspired piece of work.&nbsp; Jazz is now performed and tre=
asured by folks of every background in just about
 every part of the world.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So to honor and help cont=
inue this proud legacy, today, we are celebrating the fifth annual Internat=
ional Jazz Day.&nbsp; (Applause.) And we&#8217;ve been working on getting t=
his done for a little bit, so I am thrilled that
 this is happening, that Washington, D.C. was selected as the host city thi=
s year.&nbsp; And we are so excited to be putting on just a big, huge jazz =
concert here at the White House tonight.&nbsp; You saw that -- I won&#8217;=
t call it a tent, because it&#8217;s more like a structure
 that&#8217;s on the South Lawn where the concert is going to be held.&nbsp=
; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This show is just one of =
thousands of performances and celebrations happening all across the globe, =
in 190 countries on six continents today.&nbsp; So it turns out that just a=
bout everybody loves jazz, right?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
 And I am absolutely no exception.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I grew up in a jazz house=
hold.&nbsp; Everybody knows I grew up on the South Side of Chicago.&nbsp; I=
 tell this story always because truly, jazz was the music I was raised on.&=
nbsp; My mother&#8217;s father, my grandfather -- who we
 called &#8220;Southside&#8221; -- now that&#8217;s a jazz-lover&#8217;s na=
me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Southside was a carpenter, and he built a makes=
hift jazz studio in his little two-bedroom house where all the kids -- my m=
other came from a big family of seven brothers and sisters.&nbsp; But this
 was a two-bedroom house.&nbsp; He had a wall of jazz.&nbsp; He had mismatc=
hed turntables, a reel-to-reel, and he connected speakers into every room i=
n the house.&nbsp; I mean, literally, that was surround sound before we eve=
n knew what it was.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; They weren&#8217;t
 all the same brands; some speakers were found in the alley, some speakers =
were given to him.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But my grandfather would =
wake up every single morning and he would turn on jazz.&nbsp; And he would =
blast it at the highest possible volume that he could get away with.&nbsp; =
So I really grew up with jazz as kind of the backdrop
 to my childhood.&nbsp; We&#8217;d all gather at his house -- and whether w=
e were unwrapping Christmas presents, it was Miles Davis playing.&nbsp; If =
it was a birthday celebration, it was Charlie Parker.&nbsp; I just came to =
grow up loving jazz.&nbsp; My father was a jazz lover, and
 of course, I married a man who was a jazz lover, too, the President of the=
 United States, who is looking forward to tonight.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So jazz has really fueled=
 my life in ways that I can't describe.&nbsp; It just generates all these m=
emories for me from my childhood.&nbsp; And all these years later, to have =
the world's greatest jazz musicians play a concert
 in our backyard -- and I do mean &quot;our,&quot; the nation's backyard --=
 on Duke Ellington's birthday, no less, is really kind of an amazing full-c=
ircle moment for me and I know for so many people.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I'm especially thrill=
ed to share this passion with so many D.C. students on D.C.'s College Signi=
ng Day, which is why everybody is wearing their college gear.&nbsp; For tho=
se of you who don&#8217;t know what College Day
 is, this is the day that a lot of students declare where they're going to =
college.&nbsp; You guys look awesome in your gear.&nbsp; It's a good thing.=
&nbsp; And I have a college-bound student who will be declaring soon.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think that it just means a =
lot.&nbsp; It's a perfect combination to be celebrating College Signing Day=
 with International Jazz Day.&nbsp; Because no matter what you want to do i=
n your life -- whether it's to be a jazz musician or an entrepreneur
 or a scientist or a teacher -- you're going to need a good education.&nbsp=
; And everybody on this stage understands that.&nbsp; You are going to need=
 to get an education beyond high school.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at the same time, we also kno=
w the power of bringing the arts into our schools.&nbsp; And I can't say th=
is enough here, but the arts cannot be an option for our kids.&nbsp; It's g=
ot to be a necessity, just like math and science and reading,
 and all that kind of stuff.&nbsp; Arts has to be a part of that, because w=
e know that students who get involved in things like music or drama or visu=
al arts, they just do better.&nbsp; The studies are clear.&nbsp; They have =
better grades, they have better graduation rates,
 they have better college enrollment rates.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Music and arts is a foundation fo=
r an outstanding education.&nbsp; And that's why, as soon as we got to the =
White House, we started hosting these workshops during the day when we woul=
d have music series in the evenings.&nbsp; We actually kicked
 things off in 2009 with a jazz workshop.&nbsp; That was the very first wor=
kshop that we did.&nbsp; And since then, we have celebrated every art form,=
 music form, from ballet to country music to gospel to Broadway.&nbsp; And =
every single time, we bring kids here, like you
 guys, to spend time with the talent, who takes their mornings on a busy da=
y to be with you all.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we're grateful to have you.&nb=
sp; And at every event, we&#8217;ve highlighted the transformative power of=
 education, because if you complete your education past high school, there =
is really nothing that you can't do.&nbsp; But we emphasize this
 because a high school diploma these days is not enough, but a four-year [c=
ollege] isn&#8217;t the only thing you need to do.&nbsp; There are many way=
s to get that education, whether it's a four-year school, a two-year commun=
ity college, a training program, what have
 you.&nbsp; But high school is not enough.&nbsp; And that's the message tha=
t we send to kids as much as we can, and to families, to understand the imp=
ortance that education has in young people's lives.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lives of the musicians on thi=
s stage are a testament to that truth.&nbsp; Bobby Watson started his caree=
r in the world-famous jazz program at the University of Miami.&nbsp; And I =
hope they all talk about their experience.&nbsp; Dee Dee Bridgewater
 began touring internationally with the University of Illinois Big Band.&nb=
sp; Terence Blanchard got his big break with Art Blakey&#8217;s Jazz Messen=
gers while he was a student at Rutgers.&nbsp; And then there's Herbie Hanco=
ck, this young man here.&nbsp; I think he's still about
 25 or something.&nbsp; So he's a prodigy.&nbsp; But he arrived as a freshm=
an at Grinnell College.&nbsp; And when he got to school, he was torn betwee=
n his passions for music and for electrical engineering.&nbsp; Okay, so let=
's just stop there.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And even after he decided to be a=
 musician, he used his engineering background to experiment with electronic=
 instruments to create whole new landscapes of sound.&nbsp; Today, as you a=
ll should know, if you are real students of jazz, he is
 one of the most influential jazz pianists and composers in history, with 1=
4 Grammys to his name.&nbsp; Just saying.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think that Herbie&#8217;s s=
tory illustrates an important point -- that while the folks on this stage a=
re now legends, they spent plenty of long years really mastering the fundam=
entals first.&nbsp; And the same, hopefully, will be true for
 all of you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those of you who want to be m=
usicians, that means that before you can improvise and do those solos, you&=
#8217;ve got to practice those scales.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got to understand=
 music theory.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got to get down to the nuts and bolts bef=
ore
 you can do this.&nbsp; If you want to be something else -- if you want to =
be a teacher or a doctor or a lawyer, or President of the United States -- =
you&#8217;ve got to buckle down in class.&nbsp; Which means when you get to=
 college, you&#8217;ve got to blow it out.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got
 to take your classes seriously -- which means go to class every day, which=
 sometimes feels like an option when you're in college, if we all remember.=
&nbsp; But you need to go to class.&nbsp; You need to take good notes.&nbsp=
; You need to raise your hand.&nbsp; You need to be
 focused in school -- because you're paying for it.&nbsp; So you're going t=
o feel the pain when you leave, so you might as well get your money's worth=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want you all to throw yours=
elves into all the activities that campus life brings, if you're going to c=
ampus -- which means join clubs, be involved in extracurricular activities.=
&nbsp; Don&#8217;t sit in your dorm room alone.&nbsp; That is not
 the college experience.&nbsp; You're not supposed to get through college o=
n your own, so you got to break out.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the most important th=
ing I tell young people headed to college is ask for help.&nbsp; Do not be =
afraid to ask for help.&nbsp; That is the thing that dooms college students=
.&nbsp; They think they should do it all alone.&nbsp; And
 no one gets through college or anything in life without a whole lot of hel=
p.&nbsp; So the minute you start feeling a little out of sorts, the minute =
you feel like you're falling behind, you don&#8217;t think you understand s=
omething in class, there are a whole array
 of people who are there to help you, from counselors to RAs to tutoring ce=
nters -- you name it.&nbsp; But you&#8217;ve got to find them.&nbsp; They'r=
e not going to come looking for you.&nbsp; That's the difference in college=
.&nbsp; They expect you to be grown up and identify your needs
 and go after it, okay?&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you guys do all of that, t=
he sky is the limit.&nbsp; You can be great musicians, you can be legends i=
n your own time.&nbsp; You can be the President of the United States.&nbsp;=
 You can do whatever you want.&nbsp; This stuff isn&#8217;t rocket science.=
&nbsp;
 Well, to be what they&#8217;re -- you have to have some talent.&nbsp; (Lau=
ghter.)&nbsp; It's like, I can't do anything these can people do.&nbsp; But=
 you all can do what I do, if you choose to.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I hope that you use this time =
here to really ask questions.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t be nervous.&nbsp; When I le=
ave, the press will leave so you'll be okay.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Ask qu=
estions.&nbsp; Get the wisdom from these folks.&nbsp; They are here for you=
.&nbsp; We are
 here for you all.&nbsp; And have some fun along the way. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to all our students going to =
college, I wish you all the very, very best of luck.&nbsp; You got a Presid=
ent and a First Lady who are behind you all every step of the way.&nbsp; Ju=
st remember, when you hit a barrier, that's when you grow.&nbsp;
 So don&#8217;t let that shut you down -- because we've all had our trials =
and tribulations.&nbsp; We've all failed big in some way, shape or form.&nb=
sp; The question isn't whether you fail, it's how you get up and move on.&n=
bsp; So keep it up, all right?&nbsp; Until then, just have
 a good time here this morning, all right?&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And with that, I'm going =
to go do some more work.&nbsp; But I'm going to turn it over to Herbie Hanc=
ock and our musicians who are going to take it away for you guys.&nbsp; All=
 right?&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
