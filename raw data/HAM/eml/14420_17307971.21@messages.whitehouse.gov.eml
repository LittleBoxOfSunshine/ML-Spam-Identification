*Remarks of Dr. Jill Biden at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer C=
enter=92s 2016 One Hundred Gala as Prepared for Delivery

*

=A0

Boston, Massachusetts

=A0

Good evening!=20

=A0

Thank you, Jack, for welcoming all of us here this evening.=A0 You=92ve b=
een a good friend to the people of this city for so many years. Your comp=
assion and your continued actions have made all the difference in the wor=
ld to so many in Boston and all across our country.=A0 Truly, thank you.

=A0

I=92d also like to thank my dear friend, Tim Quinn.=A0 Tim, a cancer surv=
ivor himself, has been involved with the one hundred as a committee membe=
r for many years.=A0 Tim has told me countless times that his work with M=
ass General is so important to him.=A0 And, Tim=92s partner Isaac is with=
 us tonight as well.=A0 Honestly, you can=92t find two people that are mo=
re fun to spend time with than Tim and Isaac.=A0 Thank you, Tim, for thin=
king of me and for always being there for me =97 it=92s truly an honor to=
 be here with you this evening.=20

=A0

Finally, I=92d like to recognize all the fighters and survivors of cancer=
 who are here today.=A0 I am so humbled to be with all of you.=A0 I am in=
spired by your bravery.=A0 Each of you has a powerful story to tell about=
 your own personal battle =97 one that will raise awareness and help educ=
ate so many others.=A0 Thank you.

=A0

In October, when Joe announced that he would not seek the nomination for =
the Presidency, we had already decided to focus on another campaign. =A0T=
his campaign. =A0This fight against this disease.=A0 Joe called it our mo=
onshot.=A0 He knew it would take all of us =97 a nation-wide commitment b=
ringing together our best and brightest =97 to make our dream of ending c=
ancer as we know it, a reality.=A0 Joe never picks the easy jobs.=20

=A0

As announced just a few hours ago, on Wednesday, June 29th we=92re hostin=
g a Cancer Moonshot Summit in Washington, DC.=A0 The Summit will bring to=
gether leaders like you =97 doctors, researchers, advocates, patients and=
 survivors =97 men and women from every sector who have a role to play in=
 making progress on the Cancer Moonshot goal, which is to double the rate=
 of progress toward a cure.=20

=A0

We can do this by accelerating investment in some of the most promising a=
nd cutting-edge technologies and cancer treatments.=A0 By increasing enga=
gement in prevention efforts and working to expand access to care.=A0 By =
improving the way data is shared across the board.=A0 And Boston is leadi=
ng the way.=A0 Earlier today, I had the opportunity to visit PatientsLike=
Me, an online network which is empowering patients, improving their outco=
mes, and contributing data for research.

=A0

For Joe and me, this fight is personal. =A0My sister recently had a stem =
cell transplant.=A0 Our son Beau.=A0 My mother.=A0 My father.=A0 So, we k=
now how important this fight is.=A0 But we also know it=92s bigger than u=
s.=A0 It affects millions of people around the world every day.=A0=20

=A0

Since President Obama announced Joe would be at the helm of mission contr=
ol of the Cancer Moonshot initiative, we=92ve been traveling across the c=
ountry and around the world =97 hearing directly from top researchers, do=
ctors, patient advocates and cancer fighters and survivors.

=A0

That brings me to one of tonight=92s honorees: Terri Fuller.=A0 Terri was=
 the 10th woman on her mother=92s side to be diagnosed with breast cancer=
.=A0 Her own mother died of breast cancer at the age of 31 =97 the exact =
same age Terri received her diagnosis.

=A0

Like all of tonight=92s honorees: Terri is a fighter.=A0 She=92s a surviv=
or.=A0 And a tireless advocate.=A0 Terri dedicates her time to educating =
and uplifting young women with breast cancer, and provides one-on-one sup=
port for breast cancer patients.=A0 She also happens to be an English pro=
fessor at a community college in Illinois.=A0 You=92re a woman after my o=
wn heart!=A0 Your dedication is both courageous and inspiring.

=A0

All of you here tonight know this fight isn=92t easy.=A0 You know the imp=
ortance of the caregivers who walk alongside their patients.=A0 Their sup=
port is so critical.=20

=A0

So, thank you to Mass General, especially Dr. Daniel Haber, the director =
of the Mass General Cancer Center for your tremendous work and commitment=
.=A0 Mass General=92s customized, innovative treatments and compassionate=
, patient-centered care are fundamentally saving the lives of so many peo=
ple =97 adults and children =97 battling this disease.=A0=20

=A0

Closing the gap between scientific discovery and clinical medicine is cri=
tical to our Moonshot mission of accelerating cancer treatment toward a c=
ure.=A0 And, as you all know, Mass General really is the gold standard in=
 promoting patients=92 quality of life through an array of patient and ca=
regiver support and educational programs.=20

=A0

That=92s what tonight is all about =97 it=92s about all of you =97 it=92s=
 about the everyday amazing hero =97 who knows we all have a role to play=
 and we can all make a difference.=A0 Because only together can we seize =
this moment to truly change the face of cancer as we know it.

=A0

So to all of you =97 the scientists in the labs making discoveries that w=
ill lead us to better outcomes; the caregivers along the way who make the=
 day-to-day battle with cancer even a little easier; and the survivors wh=
o are on the front lines who have dedicated your time, your heart, yourse=
lves to this cause, thank you.=20

=A0

Keep going, and God bless.=20

=A0

n Wednesday, June 29th we=92re hosting a Cancer Moonshot Summit in Washingt=
on, DC.&nbsp; The Summit will bring together leaders like you =97

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Book Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">We can do this by accelerating inves=
tment in some of the most promising and cutting-edge technologies and cance=
r treatments.&nbsp; By increasing engagement in prevention efforts
 and working to expand access to care.&nbsp; By improving the way data is s=
hared across the board.&nbsp; And Boston is leading the way.&nbsp; Earlier =
today, I had the opportunity to visit PatientsLikeMe, an online network whi=
ch is empowering patients, improving their outcomes,
 and contributing data for research.<p></p></span></p>

;Book Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">For Joe and me, this fight is person=
al. &nbsp;My sister recently had a stem cell transplant.&nbsp; Our son Beau=
.&nbsp; My mother.&nbsp; My father.&nbsp; So, we know how important this fi=
ght is.&nbsp;
 But we also know it=92s bigger than us.&nbsp; It affects millions of peopl=
e around the world every day.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Book Antiqua&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Since President Obama announced Joe =
would be at the helm of mission control of the Cancer Moonshot initiative, =
we=92ve been traveling across the country and around the world
 =97 hearing directly from top researchers, doctors, patient advocates and =
cancer fighters and survivors.<p></p></span></p>

rri is a fighter.&nbsp; She=92s a survivor.&nbsp; And a tireless advocate.&=
nbsp; Terri dedicates her time to educating and uplifting young women with
 breast cancer, and provides one-on-one support for breast cancer patients.=
