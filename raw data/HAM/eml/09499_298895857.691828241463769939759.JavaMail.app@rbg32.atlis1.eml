I AM J-CHAI
 They were lined up in seats. One at a time they stood up, took a microphon=
e, introduced themselves &mdash; their name, their job&mdash;and then ended=
 with &ldquo;I am JCHAI.&rdquo; It was a deeply moving series of moments, a=
nd during parts of it tears of joy were coming out of my eyes. So what was =
it, and why did I find it so powerful?=20
 =20
Fully one-in-five Americans have a disability. Disabilities come in all sha=
pes and sizes. There are mental health differences and physical differences=
. There are differences in the ability to process social information, and t=
o deal with sound and sensory issues. But for the people of JCHAI, what bin=
ds most of them is that they have an intellectual disability. Because of th=
at, they frequently have been viewed by others through the eyes of pity or =
low expectations for their entire lives. But each of them is equal to all o=
f us. They are different, but not less. So I was deeply moved when at a JCH=
AI gala, a group of them took to the stage to proudly introduce themselves,=
 the terrific jobs they have, and to show solidarity with each other. Many =
of them have decades of proven job experience.

JCHAI is a play on words, as it has a double meaning. It actually stands fo=
r the Judith Creed Homes for Adult Independence (&ldquo;JCHAI&rdquo;), foun=
ded in 1987. Judith Creed is the proud mother of three amazing (now grown) =
children, one of whom happens to have disabilities. She and other parents o=
f then young adult children with disabilities created JCHAI as a place for =
their adult children to live. But &ldquo;Chai&rdquo; is Hebrew for &ldquo;l=
ife&rdquo; and J is often an abbreviation for Jewish. And JCHAI, which star=
ted by offering supportive housing for Jews with disabilities, is indeed fu=
ll of life.

Today JCHAI is a non-sectarian agency that provides independent living supp=
orts and job matching for individuals with intellectual disabilities and au=
tism. JCHAI has a thriving supportive apartment program as well as a progra=
m providing independent living services to individuals living in their own =
residences throughout the greater Philadelphia area.

JCHAI now serves more than 100 people with disabilities. It is a winning ex=
ample of how an existing organization that started 25 years ago providing s=
ervices to adults with disabilities under the &ldquo;old&rdquo; model of gr=
oup homes can transition to a new model of community inclusion to give its =
&ldquo;clients&rdquo; the supports they need to become more independent, ha=
ppy and successful. JCHAI clients now mostly live in their own homes and ap=
artments and still feel really like a family, and everyone involved in JCHA=
I treats each other as such.

&ldquo;Employment First&rdquo; thinking and actions are a key part of that =
dramatic positive transformation. JCHAI members take travel training for pu=
blic transportation, computer as well as cooking, financial and time manage=
ment classes; they go to swim events, share Shabbat dinners, travel to grea=
t destinations, and support each other fully. JCHAI staff maintains contact=
 with employers so that if there are any situations that arise where the em=
ployer may need some help with the JCHAI member/employee, JCHAI staff will =
offer job coaching or other assistance. 70% of JCHAI clients who want emplo=
yment have at least part time competitive, integrated employment. Given tha=
t the national average of employment for people with disabilities is 34%, J=
CHAI is maintaining a rate of employment that is double the national averag=
e.

JCHAI also has developed a number of training opportunities for its members=
 to help them build employable skills and resumes while they seek employmen=
t. For example, they have a volunteer program with a local school where JCH=
AI members make and serve lunch to the elementary students; JCHAI members a=
lso go to other nonprofit organizations to help with office tasks These pro=
grams have helped to train JCHAI members in how to succeed in various works=
paces.

JCHAI members are proud of their ability to get and maintain paid employmen=
t. Receiving a paycheck is a great day for all the members, and their famil=
ies are thrilled by their accomplishments as well. One JCHAI member who wor=
ks at Jefferson University, Jonah Selber, has been there successfully for t=
wo decades. His mother is actually Judith Creed, the dynamo who started JCH=
AI and chairs it today.

The more that JCHAI members are working in the community, the more that the=
 community is aware of the success of people with disabilities in the workp=
lace. JCHAI&rsquo;s CEO, Stacy Levitan, is constantly bringing new ideas an=
d innovations to JCHAI. Now they are even working on robotics with Lockheed=
 Martin!

JCHAI is presently fundraising to build an educational/social facility tail=
ored to the needs of people with disabilities. This state of the art buildi=
ng will provide opportunities for JCHAI clients to receive more vocational =
training and social opportunities.

JCHAI well deserves national recognition, as do its leaders. Many residenti=
al providers in the nation are trapped in the models of group homes and she=
ltered workshops. JCHAI has developed a model with a diversity of residenti=
al settings and job skill training so that people with disabilities can hav=
e choices, jobs, dignity, and independence.=20

e an intellectual disability. Because of that, they frequently have been vi=
ewed by others through the eyes of pity or low expectations for their entir=
e lives.&nbsp;But each of them is equal to all of us. They are different, b=
ut not less.&nbsp;So I was deeply moved when at a JCHAI gala, a group of th=
em took to the stage to proudly introduce themselves, the terrific jobs the=
y have, and to show solidarity with each other. Many of them have decades o=
f proven job experience.<br>
<br>
JCHAI is a play on words, as it has a double meaning. It actually stands fo=
r the Judith Creed Homes for Adult Independence (=E2=80=9CJCHAI=E2=80=9D), =
founded in 1987. Judith Creed is the proud mother of three amazing (now gro=
wn) children, one of whom happens to have disabilities. She and other paren=
ts of then young adult children with disabilities created JCHAI as a place =
for their adult children to live. But =E2=80=9CChai=E2=80=9D is Hebrew for =
=E2=80=9Clife=E2=80=9D and J is often an abbreviation for Jewish. And JCHAI=
, which started by offering supportive housing for Jews with disabilities, =
is indeed full of life.<br>
<br>
Today JCHAI is a non-sectarian agency that provides independent living supp=
orts and job matching for individuals with intellectual disabilities and au=
tism. JCHAI has a thriving supportive apartment program as well as a progra=
m providing independent living services to individuals living in their own =
residences throughout the greater Philadelphia area.<br>
<br>
JCHAI now serves more than 100 people with disabilities. It is a winning&nb=
sp;example of how an existing organization that started 25 years ago provid=
ing services to adults with disabilities under the =E2=80=9Cold=E2=80=9D mo=
del of group homes can transition to a new model of community inclusion&nbs=
p;to give its =E2=80=9Cclients=E2=80=9D the supports they need to become mo=
re independent, happy and successful. JCHAI clients now mostly live in thei=
r own homes and apartments and still feel really like a family, and everyon=
e involved in JCHAI treats each other as such.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CEmployment First=E2=80=9D thinking and actions are a key part of t=
hat dramatic positive transformation.&nbsp;JCHAI members take travel traini=
ng for public transportation, computer as well as cooking, financial and ti=
me management classes; they go to swim events, share Shabbat dinners, trave=
l to great destinations, and support each other fully. JCHAI staff maintain=
s contact with employers so that if there are any situations that arise whe=
re the employer may need some help with the JCHAI member/employee, JCHAI st=
aff will offer job coaching or other assistance. 70% of JCHAI clients who w=
ant employment have at least part time competitive, integrated employment. =
Given that the national average of employment for people with disabilities =
is 34%, JCHAI is maintaining a rate of employment that is double the nation=
al average.<br>
<br>
JCHAI also has developed a number of training opportunities for its members=
 to help them build employable skills and resumes while they seek employmen=
t. For example, they have a volunteer program with a local school where JCH=
AI members make and serve lunch to the elementary students; JCHAI members a=
lso go to other nonprofit organizations to help with office tasks These pro=
grams have helped to train JCHAI members in how to succeed in various works=
paces.<br>
<br>
JCHAI members are proud of their ability to get and maintain paid employmen=
t. Receiving a paycheck is a great day for all the members, and their famil=
ies are thrilled by their accomplishments as well. One JCHAI member who wor=
ks at Jefferson University, Jonah Selber, has been there successfully for t=
wo decades. His mother is actually Judith Creed, the dynamo who started JCH=
AI and chairs it today.<br>
<br>
The more that JCHAI members are working in the community, the more that the=
 community is aware of the success of people with disabilities in the workp=
lace. JCHAI=E2=80=99s CEO, Stacy Levitan, is constantly bringing new ideas =
and innovations to JCHAI. Now they are even working on robotics with Lockhe=
ed Martin!<br>
<br>
JCHAI is presently fundraising to build an educational/social facility tail=
ored to the needs of people with disabilities. This state of the art buildi=
ng will provide opportunities for JCHAI clients to receive more vocational =
training and social opportunities.<br>
<br>
JCHAI well deserves national recognition, as do its leaders. Many residenti=
al providers in the nation are trapped in the models of group homes and she=
ltered workshops. JCHAI has developed a model with a diversity of residenti=
al settings and job skill training so that people with disabilities can hav=
e choices, jobs, dignity, and independence.</span></center>
