Luis --

We're less than 100 days from our convention, a little over six months=20
from Election Day, and we've had 40 state primaries and caucuses so=20
far, so I wanted to take a minute to let you know where things stand.

Here's how you've been a part of our efforts so far this election:

    Email subscriber: Yes (We're glad to have you here!)
    2016 Election donor: Not yet

No matter how you choose to get engaged with the Democratic Party=20
and our amazing candidates, both at the presidential level and down=20
the ticket in all 50 states, we're so glad that you're on the team.=20
Because at the end of the day, we all know that we simply can't allow=20
a President Trump to replace Barack Obama in the White House.=20

And to stop that from happening, we've all got to work together,=20
harder than we ever have before. I know we can do it, but we need to=20
dig deep. That's why today I'm asking you to step up and pitch=20
in $3 or whatever you can before tomorrow's end-of-month deadline:

https://my.democrats.org/April-Deadline

With another Democrat in the White House -- and a Democratic=20
Congress to back him or her up -- we're not just going to protect=20
President Obama's progress, we're going to build on it so that=20
generations of Americans to come have a fair shot to succeed.=20

Thank you for everything you do.

All the best,
