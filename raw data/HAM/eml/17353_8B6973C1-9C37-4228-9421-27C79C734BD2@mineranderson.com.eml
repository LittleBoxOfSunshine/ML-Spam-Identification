Erik,=09
	I=E2=80=99ve been going to all the games (and tacos after at my =
favorite truck in Oakland on High and 14th) but can=E2=80=99t go to =
upcoming Game 5. A long ago wife-scheduled dinner with friends=E2=80=A6
	But regarding the Warriors, you have to run the offense, screen =
and cut, and share the ball! And then play D for the full fuckin=E2=80=99 =
game. Bigs have to get back when Westbrook goes into overdrive (he is =
blowing by Curry and everyone=E2=80=A6) and protect the rim (and that =
isn=E2=80=99t happening), and they have to close out on all the jump =
shooters all the time. And if they continue to play small with 2=E2=80=99s=
 and 3=E2=80=99s, EVERYONE has to box out and crash the glass. But that =
novelty (reality?) has worn off some as teams have now seen it and have =
video to breakdown. Not to mention OKC has the personel to do something =
about it like pick up Curry at half court=E2=80=A6 OKC is doing a better =
version of what I feared the Cavs would do last year but didn=E2=80=99t, =
trade easy 2=E2=80=99s for contested 3=E2=80=99s, and then use their =
power in the paint to open up looks (inside out) from 3 for their =
=E2=80=9Cother=E2=80=9D players 9and we aren=E2=80=99t rotating or are =
fuckin=E2=80=99 lost=E2=80=A6), meaning anyone but Westbrook and Durant. =
Those two pose difficult and very different double team problems. We =
don=E2=80=99t match up well against either of them. But who does? And =
they can play at our frenetic pace. Their Bigs are pretty fast, and big!
	So it goes.
	The Warriors are good though, and with a good coach, so they =
just need to adjust. I=E2=80=99d say even injured, Bogut has to log more =
than 20 min and shoot more than 6 times a game (0 once this series=E2=80=A6=
). Festus isn=E2=80=99t experienced enough, nor as good on D, so it is =
Bogut who needs to step up. Plus Barnes has to knock down open shots. =
And maybe cover Westbrook when Thompson can=E2=80=99t smother him or is =
losing offense becuse he is constantly chasing him. Speights needs to =
drop his shots when he gets his time off the pine too. And clearly Green =
can=E2=80=99t play like crap.
	Curry and Thompson will be fine. They just need to trust the =
offense and the flow, NOT get ahead and just launch. There is a =
difference. And Curry is a liability on D, especially against someone =
like Westbrook. It=E2=80=99s glaring now. And, at least when a screen =
calls for a guard to step out on Durant, Livingston or Thompson (Barnes =
and Draymond and Iggy) have some length. So who is Curry supposed to =
pick up? Foye during his limited minutes? One problem is that if Curry =
(or someone) doesn=E2=80=99t stop Westbrook on the break, then the =
Warriors can=E2=80=99t set up on D, and when they do, they go to the =
Durant constant mismatch. And own the glass=E2=80=A6
	This will be tough, but we can do it.
	Warriors!!!!
	I hope all is well and we catch another game.
	yours from the cheap seats,
	rma
