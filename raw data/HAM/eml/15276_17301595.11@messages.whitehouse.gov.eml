THE WHITE HOUSE



Office of the Press Secretary

________________________________________________________________

 For Immediate Release May 4, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

AT THE ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR CONGRESSIONAL STUDIES AWARDS =
GALA



Washington Hilton Hotel

Washington, D.C.

**



8:18 P.M. EDT



THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody! (Applause.) Its good to see all of you. =
You all look so nice. Can everybody please give a big round of applause t=
o Judy Chu for her outstanding service. (Applause.) A couple other people=
 I want to acknowledge. I want to thank Floyd Mori. (Applause.) Norm Mine=
ta. (Applause.) All the outstanding members of Congress who are joining u=
s. So, how's it? (Applause.)=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)=20



THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) Right on.=20



Being with the Asian American Pacific Islander community is like being wi=
th family. (Applause.)=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you, Obama!



THE PRESIDENT: I love you back.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!



THE PRESIDENT: All right, settle down, you guys. (Laughter.)=20



As many of you know, I grew up in Hawaii. (Applause.) I spent time in Ind=
onesia as a young boy. The food, the culture, the spirit of the Asia Paci=
fic region -- that's who I am. And that's why it gives me so much pleasur=
e to see all of you and to thank all of you for everything you're doing t=
o make sure that the AAPI community is participating in the political pro=
cess. And together, as Judy noted, we've accomplished a lot of things.=20=




And one thing that's clear -- and you can see it in this room -- is the a=
mazing diversity of the AAPI community. Im so proud of all that weve acco=
mplished together. From Southeast Asia to the Indian subcontinent -- (app=
lause) -- from the Pacific Islands to the Native Hawaiians of my home sta=
te, you represent the heritage that spans the globe. And your families ma=
y come from different countries. They may speak different languages, prac=
tice different faiths. Some of you live on the land of your ancestors. An=
d for others, the journey began when somebody in your family -- or maybe =
you -- decided to leave behind what you knew to seek a better life in a n=
ew world.=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER: In America! (Applause.)=20



THE PRESIDENT: No matter what your background, no matter what your story,=
 whether youre a first generation or fifth generation American, you're bo=
und by something more powerful than your differences, and that is this un=
shakeable faith in America -- that notion that here, in this country, we =
can make of our lives what we will.=20



And the AAPI community, you're part of the lifeblood of this nation. You =
are our teachers and our faith leaders, our doctors, our caretakers, our =
artists, our shopkeepers, our police officers and firefighters.=20



AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)



THE PRESIDENT: This is true. (Laughter.)=20



You are our soldiers and our sailors, airmen, marines, coast guardsmen, d=
efending our freedom every day. (Applause.) And, increasingly, you are a =
powerful, visible force in American political life.=20



Now, given that success, sometimes it's easy for people to buy into the m=
yth of model minority, and gloss over the real challenges and discriminat=
ion that still exist. We know that certain AAPI groups still face higher =
dropout rates, obstacles to employment, even higher rates of some disease=
s.=20



So this is part of the reason why under my administration we're trying to=
 improve the federal government's data collection, so we get a better pic=
ture of which communities might still need additional resources and atten=
tion to overcome some of these barriers. (Applause.)=20



We reestablished the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacifi=
c Islanders -- (applause) -- to take a closer look at specific issues fac=
ing different AAPI communities. And I want to thank Doua Thor for her ama=
zing leadership. (Applause.) Those efforts have made a difference. And I'=
ll give you a good example. After the BP spill in the Gulf, all recovery =
information was translated into multiple languages so that we could addre=
ss the concerns of Vietnamese and Khmer fishermen getting back on their f=
eet after the disaster.=20



When we passed the Affordable Care Act, 20 million uninsured adults have =
coverage. Among Asian Americans who arent yet old enough to qualify for M=
edicare, the uninsured rate has dropped by more than 60 percent because o=
f what we did, because of Obamacare. (Applause.) And were going to keep w=
orking to make sure everybody gets the coverage they need.=20



Weve worked hard to make sure that the AAPI community is represented at e=
very level of the federal government. Thats why Ive made appointments of =
AAPI judges to the federal bench. (Applause.) As Judy noted, we've made m=
ore AAPI judicial appointments than every other President combined -- bec=
ause we believe that the judiciary has to look like America.=20



We set up a Task Force on New Americans to help immigrants and refugees b=
etter integrate into our American communities. (Applause.) And whats been=
 exciting is how many local communities are taking it upon themselves to =
welcome our newest Americans into the fold and introduce them to both the=
 rights and responsibilities, as well as benefits of citizenship. (Applau=
se.)=20



Just this week, we finalized a policy to help reunite Filipino World War =
II vets with their family members who are stuck in our immigration backlo=
g. (Applause.)=20



Most Americans understand a fundamental truth about our country -- that w=
hile almost every nation in the world, to some extent, admits immigrants,=
 theres something unique about America. We dont simply welcome new immigr=
ants -- we are born of immigrants. It is our oldest tradition; part of wh=
at makes us not only exceptional, but what makes us secure and prosperous=
 and free. Which is why its so difficult to understand why some folks are=
 still standing in the way of comprehensive immigration reform. (Applause=
.) We need congressional action. But because we couldnt wait any longer, =
I took action, within my legal authority, to make our immigration system =
more fair and more just. And these actions have made this country stronge=
r by welcoming people like Regina Ledesma. Wheres Regina? There she is. (=
Applause.)=20



So I want to tell Regina's story, because it's an example of what's at st=
ake here. Regina came to the United States from the Philippines when she =
was five years old. But when her father, who was an engineer, fell ill, h=
e had to give up his job -- which meant he could no longer secure documen=
tation for his family. So Reginas mom supported the family by working at =
a hair salon. Regina grew up as American as anybody else -- she didnt eve=
n know until she was in middle school that she was undocumented. And she =
didnt understand until then that shed be perpetually in danger of being d=
eported from the only country she had ever called home. As a junior in hi=
gh school, Regina requested relief under the Deferred Action for Childhoo=
d Arrivals -- or DACA -- policy that we put in place. And today, shes a s=
ophomore studying economics at the University of Maryland. Her future is =
bright, and America is better off because she is here. (Applause.) That's=
 the story of immigrants in this country.=20



So were proud of what weve been able to achieve. But in addition to all o=
f you looking very nice, part of the reason we're here is because we unde=
rstand we can't be complacent. The actions Ive taken on my own can't take=
 the place of what we really need, which is Congress to pass a comprehens=
ive immigration reform bill. (Applause.) Its the right thing to do, the s=
mart thing to do. And you have the power to push Congress to do it. And y=
ou can't give up that power.=20



The AAPI community is the fastest-growing minority in America, but its st=
ill -- (applause) -- well, that's good to cheer about, but it's still sig=
nificantly underrepresented at the ballot box. In 2012, just 56 percent o=
f eligible AAPI voters were registered to vote. And fewer than half of th=
ose registered actually voted. So if youre upset with Americas immigratio=
n policy, but youre not voting -- that has to change.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'll vote for you!



THE PRESIDENT: Not for me. (Laughter.) We got some outstanding candidates=
. If you are upset with Congress, but you're not showing up to vote in mi=
dterm elections -- not just presidential elections -- that has to change.=
 (Applause.) And if you doubt what's at stake, I think you obviously have=
nt been reading the papers. (Laughter.)=20



Weve got to push back against anti-immigrant sentiment in all of its form=
s -- (applause) -- especially by those who are trying to stoke it just to=
 seek political gain and just to try to get headlines. And just as we mov=
ed beyond No Irish Need Apply signs; just as we moved beyond questioning =
the loyalty of Catholics; just as we moved beyond the active persecution =
of Chinese immigrants; just as we learned the stain on our history from o=
ur treatment of Japanese immigrants and even Japanese Americans in World =
War II -- we are going to move beyond todays anti-immigrant sentiment as =
well. We will live up to our ideals. We just have to keep speaking out ag=
ainst hatred and bigotry in all of its forms. (Applause.)=20



So I'm proud of all of you for rallying around the Muslim and Sikh and Ar=
ab and South Asian communities who face a rising tide of bigotry and hara=
ssment. (Applause.) To support your work, we recently launched the AAPI B=
ullying Prevention Task Force to look at ways that the federal government=
 can help your communities prevent and respond to bullying. TheJustice De=
partmentsuccessfully recommended the addition of Anti-Sikh, Anti-Hindu, a=
nd Anti-Arab/Anti-Middle Eastern categories to the FBIs hate crime report=
ing form. That's going to strengthen our efforts to end these despicable =
crimes. (Applause.) And we will continue to stand in solidarity with all =
of our LGBT brothers and sisters against hateful rhetoric and discriminat=
ory state laws targeting them. (Applause.)=20



Because these things are connected. Americans are different. We look diff=
erent. We sound different. We come from different regions. We have differ=
ent interests, different politics, different economic situations. But in =
the eyes of the law, we're supposed to be treated equally. And if one per=
son is being oppressed, if one group feels that justice is being denied, =
thats an affront to all of us -- its an affront to the values on which th=
is nation was founded.=20



And thats why its so important that the AAPI community has spoken out in =
favor of criminal justice reform and sentencing reform. (Applause.) That'=
s a powerful manifestation of this creed that is as old as our founding -=
- e pluribus unum. Out of many, one. Thats when this country works. We ca=
n be proud of our individual heritage and we can be fighting every single=
 day for the democratic values and pluralism that allows us to all live t=
ogether. We can work through the democratic process rather than turn to v=
iolence or sectarianism to resolve disputes, as sadly happens in so many =
places around the world. We can strive to see ourselves in each other. We=
 were all strangers once, until America welcomed us home.

=20

And in the end, this is the work of self-government. It is hard, it is sl=
ow. It can be frustrating. Sometimes it's scary to speak out against wron=
gs, and to help our fellow citizens when they need a hand. That's not alw=
ays convenient. But ultimately, our job is not just to fight for our own =
rights, but to fight for the rights of all people, everywhere. (Applause.=
) That's our job: To exercise our most precious inheritance -- citizenshi=
p. And that means we have to be well-informed, we have to engage with our=
 government, and we have to vote -- not just when its time to elect a pre=
sident, every single election. School boards matter. County offices matte=
r. State attorneys races matter. State legislative races matter.=20



Thats how we honor the trailblazers who sacrificed so that we could be he=
re today and how we fulfill our promise as a nation. That's how were goin=
g to ensure that the freedoms secured by those who came before us will al=
ways be the birthright of our children. Thats your goal. That's my goal. =
Now let's make sure we get to work. Thanks, everybody. God bless you. (Ap=
plause.)=20

Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Most A=
mericans understand a fundamental truth about our country -- that while alm=
ost every nation in the world, to some extent, admits immigrants, there&#82=
17;s something unique about America.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t simply
 welcome new immigrants -- we are born of immigrants.&nbsp; It is our oldes=
t tradition; part of what makes us not only exceptional, but what makes us =
secure and prosperous and free.&nbsp; Which is why it&#8217;s so difficult =
to understand why some folks are still standing
 in the way of comprehensive immigration reform.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We=
 need congressional action.&nbsp; But because we couldn&#8217;t wait any lo=
nger, I took action, within my legal authority, to make our immigration sys=
tem more fair and more just.&nbsp; And these actions have
 made this country stronger by welcoming people like Regina Ledesma.&nbsp; =
Where&#8217;s Regina?&nbsp; There she is.&nbsp; (Applause.)
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style=3D"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.=

<span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So I w=
ant to tell Regina's story, because it's an example of what's at stake here=
.&nbsp; Regina came to the United States from the Philippines when she was =
five years old.&nbsp; But when her father, who was an
 engineer, fell ill, he had to give up his job -- which meant he could no l=
onger secure documentation for his family.&nbsp; So Regina&#8217;s mom supp=
orted the family by working at a hair salon.&nbsp; Regina grew up as Americ=
an as anybody else -- she didn&#8217;t even know until
 she was in middle school that she was undocumented.&nbsp; And she didn&#82=
17;t understand until then that she&#8217;d be perpetually in danger of bei=
ng deported from the only country she had ever called home.&nbsp; As a juni=
or in high school, Regina requested relief under the Deferred
 Action for Childhood Arrivals -- or DACA -- policy that we put in place.&n=
bsp;&nbsp; And today, she&#8217;s a sophomore studying economics at the Uni=
versity of Maryland.&nbsp; Her future is bright, and America is better off =
because she is here.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That's the story of
 immigrants in this country.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

ion to all of you looking very nice, part of the reason we're here is becau=

 on my own can't take the place of what we really need, which is Congress t=
