 -- This week marks the anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, the case that formally denounced racial discrimination in education. This pivotal ruling was a watershed moment for our nation.   

Few remember that the ruling was in serious jeopardy because of the death of a Supreme Court justice, which led to a 4-4 deadlock -- a similar situation to the one we have today. But because the Senate did its job, held a prompt hearing, and confirmed Justice Earl Warren, the Court was able to move forward and rule on Brown v. Board and many other critical cases.

On this important anniversary, I'm renewing my call to the Senate: Let the Supreme Court get back to work at full strength. Will you sign my petition today?

Never in modern history has the Senate simply refused to consider a president's nominee for the Supreme Court. When President Obama's Supreme Court nominee is treated differently than other president's nominees, and no one can cite any credible argument against the nominee himself, my constituents wonder why this President is receiving second class treatment from the Senate. That this treatment is reserved for the nation's first African-American President causes significant distress, especially in connection with a nominee for the Supreme Court, the guardian of liberty whose very building proclaims in stone its cardinal principle "Equal Justice Under Law."

That would be a troubling legacy for our nation.

Add your name: Tell the Senate to hold a confirmation hearing.
