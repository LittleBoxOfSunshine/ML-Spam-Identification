Independent Investigation Confirms Sanders Campaign Told the Truth


April 29, 2016
Contact: Michael Briggs (802) 233-8653

BURLINGTON, Vt. =96 Four months ago, in an impulsive overreaction and at a =
critical point in the campaign just weeks before the closest Iowa caucus re=
sults in history, the DNC shut down the Sanders campaign=92s access to its =
own voter file data, only restoring access after the campaign filed a lawsu=
it in Federal court.

Now, four months later, an independent investigation of the firewall failur=
es in the DNC=92s shared voter file database has definitively confirmed tha=
t the original claims by the DNC and the Clinton campaign were wholly inacc=
urate =96 the Sanders campaign never =93stole=94 any voter file data; the S=
anders campaign never =93exported=94 any unauthorized voter file data; and =
the Sanders campaign certainly never had access to the Clinton campaign=92s=
 =93strategic road map.=94

In fact, the independent investigation has confirmed what the Sanders campa=
ign said from the start:

  *   The DNC=92s security failures allowed four Sanders campaign staffers =
=96 three junior-level staffers led by a manager who had been hired at the =
recommendation of the DNC and who was immediately terminated after the inci=
dent =96 to have extremely short-lived access for one hour to Hillary for A=
merica=92s scoring models, but not to any of Hillary for America=92s propri=
etary voter data.

  *   No one else in the Sanders campaign, outside these four staffers, acc=
essed the Hillary for America=92s scoring models or had knowledge that the =
activity was taking place until well after the incident was over.

  *   With one exception, all unauthorized access took place within the DNC=
=92s own system. While there is evidence that the terminated staffer may ha=
ve exported a summary data table, the independent investigation of Sanders =
campaign computers could not locate that file and no one in the Sanders cam=
paign has ever seen that file.

With the investigation behind us, the campaign has withdrawn its lawsuit ag=
ainst the DNC today but continues to implore the DNC to address the systemi=
c instability that remains in its voter file system. It is imperative that =
the DNC make it a top priority to prevent future data security failures in =
the voter file system, failures that only serve as unnecessary distractions=
 to the democratic process.

Bernie Sanders' Campaign Manager Jeff Weaver said =93We are gratified by th=
e results of this independent investigation.=94
