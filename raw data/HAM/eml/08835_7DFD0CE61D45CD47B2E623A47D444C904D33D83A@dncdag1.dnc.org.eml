As rosy exit polls began coming in from Indiana on Tuesday night, Donald Tr=
ump turned his attention to the next phase of his run for the White House =
=97 and his next opponent, Hillary Clinton.

The general election, he suggested in an interview, will not see him dialin=
g back on his scorched-earth approach to winning.

=93Her past is really the thing, rather than what she plans to do in the fu=
ture,=94 Trump said. =93Her past has a lot of problems, to put it bluntly.=
=94

Through this wild GOP presidential primary season, Trump has dispatched his=
 opponents with insults, slurs and scornful nicknames.

=93I haven=92t devoted any time, effort, energy to Hillary yet. I haven=92t=
 started on that process because I=92ve been focused on the nomination, whi=
ch is probably wise,=94 he said in an interview. =93With Hillary, I will be=
 starting the process as soon as this is over.=94

He will be up against a different kind of challenge: a battle-tested advers=
ary =97 and a general-election electorate that is broader and more diverse =
than the voters who have dominated Republican primaries and caucuses.

=93What happened on the other side is instructive, but what you=92ve seen t=
here is a lot of folks on that side let his attacks go unanswered,=94 said =
Joel Benenson, Clinton=92s pollster and chief strategist. =93What happens g=
oing forward, I think you=92ll see, is that when he does this, we=92ll be a=
ggressive.=94

Republican contenders were constrained from attacking the front-runner by t=
heir fears of alienating Trump=92s passionate supporters, while Democrats s=
ay they will have no such qualms in taking him on.

Clinton, moreover, is a known figure to voters =97 for better or worse =97 =
by virtue of having been on the national stage for nearly a quarter-century=
 as first lady, senator, presidential contender and secretary of state.

=93She=92s been the target of sexist vitriol and hate for the better part o=
f three decades. She=92s not only survived that, but thrived. She certainly=
 can withstand Trump=92s name-calling,=94 said David Brock, who once was pa=
rt of the anti-Clinton scandal machine, and who has since helped found seve=
ral major outside groups that do battle on her behalf.

Yet those battles have also taken a toll. Polls consistently show voters ha=
ve misgivings about her character.

In a Washington Post-ABC News survey<http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/=
politics/washington-post-abc-news-national-poll-march-3-6-2016/1982/> in ea=
rly March, only 37 percent of respondents said they found Clinton honest an=
d trustworthy, while 59 percent said they did not.

Meanwhile, there is an ongoing Justice Department investigation over whethe=
r her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state compro=
mised national security.

Clinton will have the benefit of a massive, well-financed net of protectors=
 and defenders.

=93The best defense against someone like Trump is a good offense, as long a=
s it is the right offense,=94 said Geoff Garin, who was a top official in C=
linton=92s 2008 presidential campaign, and who now works with a pro-Clinton=
 super PAC. =93We at Priorities USA are ready to have Hillary=92s back and =
keep a spotlight focused on the things that lead voters to conclude he woul=
d be a bad choice and a risky choice as president.=94

In the primary, Trump delighted in coming up with lethal labels for his opp=
onents: =93Low-energy Jeb=94 Bush, =93Little Marco=94 Rubio, =93Lyin=92 Ted=
=94 Cruz.

He has already started road-testing labels for Clinton.

=93She doesn=92t have strength or stamina,=94 he has said of a woman who ha=
s boasted of logging nearly a million miles in her four years as the nation=
=92s chief diplomat. In recent weeks, Trump has also referred to her as =93=
Incompetent Hillary.=94 His latest favorite is =93Crooked Hillary.=94

On Monday, the day before the primary, Trump had lunch in an Indianapolis d=
eli <https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/02/trump-=
looking-to-general-election-lunches-with-author-of-anti-clinton-books/> wit=
h Edward Klein, the author of a series of sensational anti-Clinton books th=
at have been largely discredited.

Clinton=92s defenders are sure to dismiss Trump=92s efforts to dredge up bo=
th the facts and the innuendo about her past as old news.

But her longtime critics say that Trump can find a fresh audience for them.

=93She=92s never been the nominee. Even though in the =9290s, =91Crooked Hi=
llary=92 a known commodity as first lady, there=92s a difference between th=
at and being the nominee for president of the United States,=94 said David =
Bossie, a longtime Clinton foe and occasional Trump adviser who heads the c=
onservative group Citizens United. =93Donald Trump, I believe, thinks that =
his path to victory is to make every voter in American think of =91Crooked =
Hillary=92 as they go to the ballot box.=94

Then again, Trump=92s own negatives are even higher =97 and in fact would m=
ake him the least popular major-party nominee in modern history.

=93There are not enough white men to elect Trump president, and he has seri=
ously alienated voters of color, college-educated white women, and younger =
voters,=94 Garin said. =93The same shoot-from-the-lip outspokenness that ma=
ny Republican primary voters found appealing about Trump make general-elect=
ion swing voters think he would be a huge risk in the Oval Office.=94

And that is before Clinton and the organizations that support her begin spe=
nding in earnest against Trump.

=93He=92s about to walk into a $1-billion buzzsaw,=94 said Stuart Stevens, =
a top strategist for 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney and a persistent Trump cr=
itic.

And some of the fodder will be coming from Trump=92s own party. At a news c=
onference Tuesday, his opponent Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) unloaded on the fron=
trunner, calling him a =93pathological liar,=94 =93utterly amoral,=94 and =
=93a narcissist at a level I don=92t think this country=92s ever seen.=94

That footage is all but certain to show up again in Democratic ads.

Clinton strategist Benenson said that Trump should be more concerned with r=
aising his own image, rather than scuffing up the presumptive Democratic no=
minee=92s.

Moving toward a general election, =93you=92re now not talking to a subset o=
f one party in America. You=92re talking to Democrats, independents, Republ=
icans,=94 Benenson said.
