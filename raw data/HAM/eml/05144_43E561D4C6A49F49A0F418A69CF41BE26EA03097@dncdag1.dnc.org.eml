My Family's Democratic Party


K.J. Bagchi - Director of AAPI and Small Business Engagement



My family played a big role in why I became a proud member of the Democrati=
c Party. My parents came to this country because, like many immigrants, the=
y sought better opportunities for themselves and their children. They taugh=
t me that it was important to know what was going on in the world by having=
 us watch the evening news each night. As I began to take a specific intere=
st in politics, my father drove me to county Democratic Party meetings in o=
ur hometown of Reno, Nevada. I still remember him wearing his oversized gra=
y wool jacket and wearing slippers you could only find sold in Kolkata, Ind=
ia. Going to these meetings, and discussing the issues later around the fam=
ily dinner table started off as a hobby and passion that eventually led me =
the job that I have today.


As the Director of AAPI Engagement for the Democratic National Committee (D=
NC), I spend a lot of time in similar discussions, and in subsequent action=
s, about how our big-tent party can keep improving on its mission of inclus=
ion and progress. I consistently see our issues framed through my parent's =
eyes.


As a first-generation American, I am grateful that my parents chose to made=
 the choice settle in this country. Their story is the basis for my belief =
in treating everyone with respect and dignity. This is why I get so upset w=
hen I hear Republican presidential candidates target undocumented families =
and when they promote banning birthright citizenship<http://www.cbsnews.com=
/news/ted-cruz-birthright-citizenship-doesnt-make-sense/> or banning and tr=
acking<http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immig=
ration/> all Muslims in entering the United States. Democrats are fighting =
for comprehensive immigration reform and keeping immigrant families togethe=
r under President Obama's Deferred Action programs for undocumented childre=
n and parents.


My family has always respected the fact that Democrats have campaigned on i=
ncreasing education access and lowering the costs of higher education. As p=
rofessionals who have worked in the STEM field, they get frustrated wheneve=
r they see or hear Republican candidates deny climate change and refuse to =
do anything about it. Democrats are the ones pushing for investments in cle=
an energy, calling for action to combat climate change, and leading the shi=
ft to clean energy, and proposing solutions based on scientific facts.


But being right on the issues isn't enough - you need to have the campaign =
infrastructure to win elections and enact positive change. The DNC has inve=
sted and built up a voter file over several election cycles that allows us =
to continually engage the AAPI community through similar conversations on t=
he ground. The online tool also allows us to identify if voters speak other=
 languages, so we can accommodate them. As a result, staffers refine and ad=
d to the information within the system year after year, so it stays current=
 and robust.


For elections, our campaigns and state parties work with community groups t=
o get out the vote. Our voter protection operation makes every effort to en=
sure access at the ballot box, because no one should have to deal with burd=
ensome restrictions when exercising a fundamental right.


This year, the DNC launched ProgressAAPI, a series of programs, trainings a=
nd conversations that build on the work that past-AAPI Democrats have done,=
 such as social media actions, webinars on the convention, connecting youth=
 to campaign opportunities, and events to get our message out. We want to m=
ake sure our policies that benefit working AAPI families are heard far and =
wide, and we will continue the Democratic tradition of meeting voters where=
 they are, in person or otherwise.


The policies and inclusion efforts of the Democratic Party are nothing new,=
 but part of a long endeavor, the results of which are widely evident now. =
More than 50%<http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/03/news/la-pn-dnc-asian-=
americans-20120903> of AAPI registered voters identify as are Democrats, an=
d President Obama won 73% of the AAPI vote<http://elections.nytimes.com/201=
2/results/president/exit-polls> in 2012. Twenty years ago, the trend was ju=
st the opposite, with 74% of AAPIs<http://observer.com/2016/02/why-asian-am=
ericans-dont-vote-republican/> voting Republican. And we understand the nee=
d to be continually engaged, even at the highest levels. President Obama ha=
s made a record number<https://www.whitehouse.gov/share/judicial-nomination=
s> of AAPI judicial appointments, tripling the number who sit on the federa=
l bench from eight to 25. All but one of the 14 AAPI Members of Congress ar=
e Democrats, and we are working to add to their ranks this election year. <=
--I'm seeing that there are 12 and all of them are Dems, let me know if I'm=
 looking at the wrong thing

The core principle that drives the DNC today is the same one that drew me a=
nd my parents in when I was a kid, that as Americans, we are greater togeth=
er than we are on our own. Everyone deserves a fair shot to succeed, not ju=
st those already at the top. While we reflect on the advances AAPIs have ma=
de in our nation's history, we continue to push forward and demand greater =
progress with a Democratic Party that is part of the cause.
