We'd like replace the second bullet under the CBS poll with this bullet. Th=
e "note" in the new bullet indicates the problem that we don't have the rig=
ht data. It's a long bullet but it's factually correct. Thoughts?



=B7         The poll showed that more than 80 percent of Democrats would vo=
te for either Secretary Clinton or Senator Sanders in the general election.=
 According to an accompanying story in the New York Times, =93Democratic re=
sistance is less widespread than it was in the 2008 primary. While 72 perce=
nt of Mr. Sanders=92s supporters say they would vote for Mrs. Clinton this =
fall, a Times/CBS News survey taken in early May 2008 found that only 60 pe=
rcent of Mrs. Clinton=92s supporters said they would vote for Barack Obama =
in the general election.=94 [Note: neither the New York Times story nor the=
 poll itself provided what percentage of Secretary Clinton=92s supporters w=
ould vote for Senator Sanders if he became the nominee]


DNC Talking Points: Democrats Overwhelmingly United

Polls continue to show that Democrats are overwhelmingly united and excited=
 about both of our candidates.
By and large we=92ve had a great primary, with substantive candidates whose=
 vision to move America forward lines up with the values of the American pe=
ople.

And we=92re going to come out of our convention more unified and stronger t=
han ever, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with their da=
ngerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their party.

Just look at the new poll today from CBS/New York Times:



=B7         A new CBS/NYT poll<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/1=
9/us/politics/poll-presidential-race.html?version=3Dmeter+at+0&contentId=3D=
&mediaId=3D&referrer=3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&priority=3Dtrue&acti=
on=3Dclick&contentCollection=3DPolitics&module=3DRelatedCoverage&region=3DE=
ndOfArticle&pgtype=3Darticle> shows that Democrats are more united today th=
an in May of 2008, disproving the myth of Democratic disunity heading into =
the 2016 election.


=B7         The poll showed that more than 80 percent of Democrats would vo=
te for either Secretary Clinton or Senator Sanders. 72 percent of Senator S=
anders=92 supporters said they would vote for Secretary Clinton, and 78 per=
cent of Secretary Clinton=92s supporters said they would vote for Senator S=
anders. In May of 2008, polling found only 60 percent of Clinton supporters=
 said they would vote for then-Senator Obama, who was eventually elected to=
 a landslide victory.


=B7         Furthermore, the poll shows that 80 percent of Democrats are =
=93mostly hopeful=94 about the future of the Democratic Party, as opposed t=
o Republicans, who are split 55%-43% between =93mostly hopeful=94 and =93mo=
stly discouraged=94 about the future of the Republican Party.

This echoes what we=92ve seen in exit poll after exit poll after exit poll:

Indiana<http://fortune.com/2016/05/03/exit-polls-from-indiana-democrats-are=
-excited-republicans-are-divided/>:



=B7         Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they=92ve been ene=
rgized by the nomination contest between former Secretary of State Hillary =
Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But nearly 6 in 10 Republicans say=
 they think their party has been divided by the battle being fought by bill=
ionaire Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut<http://www.wsj.com/articles/voters-have=
-strong-views-on-gop-convention-1461716342>:



=B7         Democratic voters, unlike Republicans, said the primary season =
had energized their party. Two-thirds or more of Democrats who cast ballots=
 in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut said their party was more energi=
zed, while less than one-third said it was divided, exit polls showed.

New York<http://elections.ap.org/content/ny-exit-poll-heated-primaries-ener=
gize-dems-divide-gop>:



=B7         Almost 6 in 10 New York Republican voters say their party has b=
een divided by the nomination process, while only 3 in 10 Democratic voters=
 say the same about their party's primaries. Less than 4 in 10 GOP voters s=
ay they've been energized, exit polls show, compared with two-thirds of Dem=
ocratic voters who say that about their side.

It=92s clear that heading into the 2016 elections, Democrats are united and=
 energized, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with their =
dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their party=
.
