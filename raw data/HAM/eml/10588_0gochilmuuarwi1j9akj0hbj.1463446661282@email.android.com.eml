Nevada Democrats: Sanders Campaign Has Violent Streak

Nevada's Democratic party<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/democratic-p=
arty.htm> on Monday warned the Democratic National Committee<http://abcnews=
.go.com/topics/news/us/democratic-national-committee.htm> that Sen. Bernie =
Sanders' supporters have a penchant for violence and may seek to disrupt th=
e party's national convention in July, as they did during the Nevada conven=
tion Saturday.

The allegation is the latest fallout from a divisive Nevada Democratic conv=
ention that had to be shut down because security at the Paris Las Vegas hot=
el could no longer ensure order on Saturday night. The gathering closed wit=
h some Sanders supporters throwing chairs; later, some made death threats a=
gainst state party chairwoman Roberta Lange.

Sanders' backers had been protesting convention rules that ultimately led t=
o Hillary Clinton<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/hillary-clin=
ton.htm> winning more pledged delegates. Clinton won the state's caucuses i=
n February, 53-47, but Sanders backers hoped to pick up extra delegates by =
packing county and state party gatherings.

Sanders had released a statement Friday night asking supporters to work "to=
gether respectfully and constructively" at the convention. But the state pa=
rty alleged in its letter to the co-chairs of the DNC Rules and By-laws com=
mittee, "The explosive situation arose in large part because a portion of t=
he community of Sanders delegates arrived at the Nevada Democratic State Co=
nvention believing itself to be a vanguard intent upon sparking a street-fi=
ght rather than attending an orderly political party process."

Michael Briggs, a Sanders campaign spokesman, said, "We do not condone viol=
ence or encourage violence or even threats of violence." He added that the =
campaign "had no role in encouraging the activity that the party is complai=
ning about. We have a First Amendment and respect the rights of the people =
to make their voices heard."

On Saturday, Sanders backers shouted down the keynote speaker, Sen. Barbara=
 Boxer, and others they thought were tilting the rules in Clinton's favor. =
Protesters shouted obscenities and rushed the dais to protest rulings. The =
letter by the state party's general counsel, Bradley S. Schrager, warns tha=
t similarly chaotic scenes could unfold in Philadelphia, site of the Democr=
atic National Committee's July convention.

"We believe, unfortunately, that the tactics and behavior on display here i=
n Nevada are harbingers of things to come as Democrats gather in Philadelph=
ia in July for our National Convention," Schrager wrote. "We write to alert=
 you to what we perceive as the Sanders campaign's penchant for extra-parli=
amentary behavior =97 indeed, actual violence =97 in place of democratic co=
nduct in a convention setting, and furthermore what we can only describe as=
 their encouragement of, and complicity in, a very dangerous atmosphere tha=
t ended in chaos and physical threats to fellow Democrats."

Several Sanders backers have condemned some of the threats against Lange an=
d other actions Saturday. Former state assemblywoman Lucy Flores, a current=
 congressional candidate, said in a statement: "There were actions over the=
 weekend and at the Democratic convention that very clearly crossed the lin=
e. Progressives need to speak out against those: Making threats against som=
eone's life, defacing private property, and hurling vulgar language at our =
female leaders."

State party offices remained closed Monday for security reasons after Sande=
rs supporters posted Lange's home and business addresses, email and cell ph=
one number online. Copies of angry and threatening texts to Lange were incl=
uded with the letter.

Lange said she'd been receiving hundreds of profanity-laced calls and texts=
 from inside and outside of the U.S., threatening her life and her family. =
Lange said the restaurant where she works has received so many calls it had=
 to unplug the phone.

"It is endless, and the longer it goes the worse it gets," Lange said in an=
 interview. "I feel threatened everywhere I go."
