5.10.16 West Virginia, Nebraska Primary TP's


Topline Message:


=B7         With his lock on the Republican nomination, Donald Trump has en=
sured that his Party=92s problems won=92t be limited to convention chaos --=
 he=92s going to drag the GOP down in races big and small across the countr=
y all the way to the general election.



=B7         That=92s why the party faithful -- from senior leaders to the v=
oters of Nebraska and West Virginia today -- have started to fret publicly =
about their party=92s deepening divides, and stumble with no real strategy =
for embracing their divisive and dangerous standard bearer. Democrats, on t=
he other hand, have shown in state after state that our voters are excited =
about our primary, and optimistic about both of our candidates.





=B7         But we=92re not taking anything for granted, we=92re going to h=
old Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot accountable for their repe=
ated promises to drag our country right back to the reckless policies that =
were in place where we were in 2009 when the last Republican president left=
 office; when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month; and when countless Ameri=
cans lost their homes and savings. The American people can=92t afford to le=
t a Republican into the White House.


Key Points

=B7         Today Ted Cruz refused to throw his support behind Trump, addin=
g his name to the growing list of GOP leaders distancing themselves from th=
e party=92s nominee =96 a list that includes former presidential candidates=
 Mitt Romney and John McCain, and the entire Bush family, who all said they=
 won=92t attend their own convention this year.



=B7         And as we look toward Trump=92s upcoming meeting with Republica=
n Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan this Thursday a=
t the RNC, it=92s clear that any signs they=92ll show of camaraderie on the=
 way out will be purely cosmetic.





=B7         That division isn=92t just happening at the top --- it=92s visi=
ble all the way down to the grassroots of the Republican Party. In exit pol=
ls today, just ten percent of Republican voters in West Virginia and three =
percent in Nebraska said they think their party is united.



=B7         While Republican candidates across the country up and down the =
ballot are tearing out their hair trying to decide between standing beside =
Trump -- the dangerous and reckless candidate they created -- or avoiding t=
heir own convention to distance themselves, Democrats are poised to ride en=
thusiasm and support for our candidates into November.





=B7         In contest after contest, Democratic voters are reporting their=
 enthusiasm for both of our candidates, while Republicans report that their=
 primary has divided their party.



=B7         The national trend favors Democrats, who have seen in exit poll=
s week after week that our voters are excited about our primary.





o    In Indiana last week, three-quarters of Democrats said they=92ve been =
energized by the nomination contest, while nearly six in ten Republicans sa=
id they think their party has been divided.

o    In Pennsylvania the week before, the story was the same, as it was in =
New York the week before that, and Wisconsin before that.



=B7         Democrats are building the infrastructure for the general elect=
ion, and we=92re doing it with voters enthusiastic because they see our can=
didates have the right ideas to build on the progress of the last seven yea=
rs.



=B7         We=92ve seen a record 74 straight months of private-sector job =
growth creating over 14 million new jobs, and 20 million people have health=
 care who didn=92t before. We must elect a Democrat as our next president t=
o keep America on the right track and moving forward.


Divisive, Reckless and Dangerous:

Donald Trump Lacks the Judgment or Temperament to be President


Donald Trump=92s recklessness would hurt our economy, diminish our standing=
 in the world, and make our communities less safe. Trump is divisive and da=
ngerous, and he lacks the judgment and temperament to be president.


=B7         Trump=92s impending nomination is a reminder that for years the=
 Republican Party has elevated extreme voices, using divisive campaigns tha=
t sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain.


=B7         Just like Republicans in Washington have done for years, Trump =
is only looking out for himself. His plans would benefit those at the very =
top and economists have predicted that his policies could cause a global re=
cession. He would drag our country back to where we were when the last Repu=
blican president left office, when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. The=
 American people can=92t afford to let Trump bully his way into the Oval Of=
fice.

=B7         Trump has already damaged America=92s relationships across the =
globe. His record of denigrating women has only gotten worse throughout thi=
s campaign. His divisive rhetoric has made our communities less safe. And h=
is business record is riddled with embarrassing failures that make it clear=
 the American people can=92t afford to let him get anywhere near the White =
House.



National Security: Even as a candidate, Donald Trump has damaged America=92=
s relationships across the globe. In the White House, he would undeniably m=
ake America less safe.



=B7         Donald Trump has no foreign policy experience and rather than s=
eeking the advice of well-respected experts, Trump relies on his own misinf=
ormed ideas and in his own words, on his =93good brain.=94

=B7         Trump has falsely claimed that he knows =93more about ISIS than=
 the generals=94 and recommended that the U.S. military commit internationa=
l war crimes.

=B7         Trump=92s threat to pull back from our most important military =
alliances<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-and-the-end-=
of-nato/2016/03/04/e8c4b9ca-e146-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html> like NA=
TO, pull aid from our allies like Israel, and his gushing praise for dictat=
ors would put our country on a dangerous path.

=B7         Trump has refused to rule out using nuclear weapons on European=
 territory, and wants to allow countries that don=92t currently have nuclea=
r weapons to get them, reversing long-held goals of international nuclear d=
isarmament.

Wrong on Women: Donald Trump has a decades-long record of denigrating women=
 and promoting misogyny. His policies would make it harder for women to mak=
e their own choices when it comes to their health care or their career.



=B7         Trump once said you had to  treat women =93like s**t=94 and has=
 spent decades doing so himself by calling women names =96 =93fat pig,=94 =
=93slob,=94 or =93bimbo=94 =96 and saying a man needs a woman to support hi=
m at home rather than always be =93griping and bitching.=94

=B7         Trump would take away a woman=92s right to make her own healthc=
are choices and has said women who had abortions should be punished =96 but=
 not the doctors that performed them =96 and opposed exceptions for health =
of the mother because he thought women would use a cold as an excuse to hav=
e an abortion.

=B7         Trump thinks ensuring equal pay for women should just be left u=
p to =93the marketplace=94 and once suggested family leave policies should =
actually be scaled back and noted pregnancy was =93an inconvenience for a b=
usiness.=94 Trump complained that when he employed mothers, they were not g=
iving him =93100 percent.=94



Divisive and Dangerous: Donald Trump exploited racial anxieties and cultura=
l fears in the pursuit of getting elected =96 to the point where his rallie=
s have sparked violence against people of color, protestors, and the media.



=B7         Trump spouts hateful and dangerous lies about Muslims and calle=
d to surveil mosques, to ban Muslims from entering the country and to creat=
e a database of all Muslims in America =96 including U.S. citizens =96 and =
could not answer when pressed on how this would be any different from Nazi =
Germany.

=B7         Trump called Mexican immigrants =93rapists=94 and criminals and=
 said they brought disease into the country, said you needed to check if Na=
tive Americans were =93real Indians,=94 and claimed that a =93well-educated=
 black has a tremendous advantage=94 =96 but apparently not an advantage in=
 finding housing in Trump properties, because in the 1970s, the Trump Organ=
ization was sued for discriminating against Blacks and Puerto Ricans.

=B7         Trump has been endorsed by former  KKK leader David Duke, and h=
is candidacy has been used as a recruiting tool for the white supremacist m=
ovement, which is no surprise since Trump refused to disavow David Duke and=
 the KKK four times in one interview.

=B7         Trump has fostered violence against protestors at his rallies, =
suggesting that a Black Lives Matter protester maybe =93should have been ro=
ughed up,=94 promising to pay the legal fees if someone would =93knock the =
hell=94 out of a protester and reminiscing about the old days when a protes=
ter would be =93carried off on a stretcher.=94

=B7         Trump repeatedly threatened the First Amendment by calling to =
=93open up=94 libel laws so he could sue reporters whenever they printed a =
story he did not like, made it a practice of banning media outlets he did n=
ot like from covering his rallies, and thought =93closing=94 parts of the I=
nternet was a rational strategy to combat ISIS.



Reckless on the Economy, Making Millions at the Expense of Hardworking Amer=
icans: Though he plays the part of a wealthy and successful businessman, Do=
nald Trump=92s real life record is a reminder that he would endanger the en=
tire global financial system and promote policies that hurt everyday Americ=
ans.



=B7         Despite his tough talk on trade deals and the loss of American =
jobs, Donald Trump manufactured his clothing line in countries he rails aga=
inst, like China and Mexico =96 a reminder that he made millions at the exp=
ense of American workers and on the backs of foreign labor.

=B7         His Trump =93University=94 fleeced thousands of Americans simpl=
y looking to get ahead.

=B7         Trump=92s businesses have repeatedly gone bankrupt, leaving inv=
estors, contractors and small businesses holding the bag for his bad busine=
ss decisions.

=B7         Trump=92s unfounded predictions<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/03/=
trump-predicts-very-massive-recession-in-us.html> of recession under Presid=
ent Obama and warnings against investing in the stock market are reckless.

=B7         Economists have actually predicted Trump=92s policies could sta=
rt an international trade war and even destabilize the global economy<http:=
//www.cbsnews.com/media/is-donald-trump-a-menace-to-the-global-economy/>.

=B7         Trump=92s tax plan would overwhelmingly benefit the rich while =
costing the country $9.5 trillion to implement -- more than any other Repub=
lican plan proposed. It also violates his pledge to eliminate the national =
debt.

=B7         Trump actually said at one of the Republican Party=92s debates =
that wages were =93too high=94 and opposed raising the federal minimum wage

=B7         Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would jeop=
ardize health care for 20 million Americans who=92ve been able to get cover=
age under Obamacare.


How Democrats Will Win


Republicans couldn=92t unite against Trump and failed to stand up to him du=
ring their primary because they were playing to the same extreme base of th=
eir party. Democrats will be united and hold Donald Trump accountable every=
 day until November 8th.



=B7         Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been clear they=92=
ll work hard in November to ensure we don=92t let a Republican like Trump d=
rag our country backward.

=B7         While we recognize that any campaign will see the intensity lev=
el rise down the stretch, we expect our candidates to maintain a tone that =
helps us build toward the general election.

=B7         Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have drawn sharp differences=
 with one another, but overwhelmingly they=92ve been focused on substance a=
nd how to best move America forward.

=B7         Because the Party=92s platform is a statement of our values, th=
e DNC is committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both o=
f our campaigns will be represented on the Platform Drafting Committee, and=
 just as we did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to par=
ticipate.

=B7         Democrats know that we=92re stronger when more voices are heard=
, and when we stand together to move our country forward, we=92ll see that =
in Philadelphia at our convention.
