*         No criminal charges for Grande after doughnut licking video: "It =
brought on two long YouTube apologies, but Ariana Grande's doughnut licking=
 video won't lead to criminal charges.

Police in Lake Elsinore, California said in a statement Monday that the own=
er of Wolfee Donuts, where the licking took place, declined to press charge=
s against Grande. They say their investigation was primarily to help the De=
partment of Health, which lowered the restaurant's grade from an "A" to a "=
B" for leaving the tray of doughnuts exposed.

In the second of her two YouTube apologies posted last week, the 22-year-ol=
d singer said she was "disgusted" with herself and wanted to "disappear" af=
ter TMZ posted the video.

In another online apology earlier in the week she expressed regret at sayin=
g "I hate America" in the same video." (The San Mateo Daily Journal-July 15=
, 2015)

*         Police investigating Ariana Grande's video doughnut licking: "Pol=
ice said Wednesday they were investigating video that appears to show Arian=
a Grande licking doughnuts at a shop in Southern California. Earlier, Grand=
e apologized for saying "I hate America" in the same video.

Police in Lake Elsinore, where the doughnut shop is located, said they and =
Riverside County public health officials were investigating the leaked vide=
o, which appeared to show the 22-year-old singer and a man with her "malici=
ously lick" the doughnuts.

Mayra Solis, 22, a cashier on duty at Wolfee Donuts when Grande went into t=
he store, said the singer didn't purchase any of the doughnuts she licked.

"She was really rude," Solis told The Associated Press.

Earlier Wednesday, Grande said in a statement to the AP that she's a proud =
American.

"I am EXTREMELY proud to be an American and I've always made it clear that =
I love my country. What I said in a private moment with my friend, who was =
buying the doughnuts, was taken out of context and I am sorry for not using=
 more discretion with my choice of words," the statement read.

In the video posted Tuesday by TMZ, Grande says "What ... is that? I hate A=
mericans. I hate America" when a tray of doughnuts appears in front of her.

Grande said she chose to express herself as she did because she leads a hea=
lthy lifestyle and is upset with "how freely we as Americans eat and consum=
e things without giving any thought to the consequences."

"The fact that the United States has one of the highest child obesity rates=
 in the world frustrates me. We need to do more to educate ourselves and ou=
r children about the dangers of overeating and the poison that we put into =
our bodies," she said. "However I should have known better in how I express=
ed myself; and with my new responsibility to others as a public figure I wi=
ll strive to be better."

Asked about the police investigation, Grande's representatives said she wou=
ld not have further comment.

Dottie Ellis-Merki, a spokeswoman for the Riverside County Department of En=
vironmental Health, said the agency was investigating why the doughnuts wer=
e left out unprotected and exposed to the public, in violation of state foo=
d laws. She said investigators found no further issues at the shop on Wedne=
sday.

"During the investigation, the manager did state they normally don't leave =
donuts out like was shown in the video," Ellis-Merki said in an email to th=
e AP. "The employee went to the back to retrieve freshly made donuts by req=
uest of the customer and left the trays out while getting other trays." (As=
sociated Press Online-July 9, 2015)

*         Ariana Grande blasts fan for homophobic remark about brother: "Po=
p star ARIANA GRANDE has lashed out at a fan for posting a homophobic remar=
k about her gay half-brother on her Instagram.com page.=20

Frankie Grande initially hid the fact he is related to the singer/actress b=
y adopting his father's last name of Marchione when he signed on for the cu=
rrent season of U.S. reality show Big Brother, but he has since come clean =
about his connection to Grande.

His tactics drew a number of negative comments from social media users, and=
 one in particular caught the Problem hitmaker's eye after the fan referred=
 to Frankie as "that homo" in the comments section of her Instagram profile=
 page.

Blasting the follower, the 21 year old reportedly wrote, "That 'homo' is th=
e fiercest, most incredible, funniest, most intelligent, kind hearted and m=
ost LOVED person on the face of the planet!

"he also cleaned up his game and told the truth to everybody in the house W=
HICH by the way, nobody else on the show has done. so i don't give a flying=
 f**k if or when he comes home!!! he is incredible and i am SO proud!!!! oh=
 and also 'that homo' gets more a** than you'll ever get in your life. k mi=

*         Ariana Grande Getting Off Easier Than Donald Trump, GOP Congressm=
an Says: "A Republican congressman from South Carolina is calling out Ameri=
ca's "double standards" for not bashing Ariana Grande the way it has Donald=
 Trump.=20

Jeff Duncan said in a Facebook post Saturday he was curious why companies T=
V networks such as NBC, Univision and ESPN, and other businesses such as re=
cord labels and concert venues have not had any response to the recent leak=
 of a video showing the 22-year-old Grande licking donuts and saying, "I ha=
te America."

Meanwhile, those companies were "mighty quick to jump on the 'bash Donald T=
rump' bandwagon when he spoke about illegal aliens and 'sanctuary city' pol=
icies," Duncan wrote.=20

When announcing his presidential candidacy, Trump said that Mexican migrant=
s to the U.S. are drug traffickers and rapists, as well as "some ... good p=
eople." And, since, he has gone on to defend these statements, while losing=
 millions of dollars in sponsorships and other business opportunities.=20

"This misguided young pop singer said that she hated America and hated Amer=
icans, while she proceeded to contaminate food for resale with the very ton=
gue with which she uttered the hatred rant," Duncan's post continued. "The =
double-standards in this country are disgusting."

Grande has apologized several times for the incident." (billboard.com-7/13/=
