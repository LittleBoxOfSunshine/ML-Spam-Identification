Hi Jon,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope the timing works out, it would be great to have you there! As for th=
e ticket levels, we've found this election season that some folks have want=
ed to max out in light of our opposition. The difference is mostly in name =
only, but it also allows your name to be listed on the invitation as part o=
f the host committee. In your case, attending at the co-host level would al=
so qualify you for the Main Line convention package. I've attached our conv=
ention package descriptions for your reference, but please feel free to rea=
ch out if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope that helps!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Dan<br>

between cohost and guest levels?<br>

I hope you are well. I want to personally invite you to our upcoming event =
with President Obama&nbsp; on the evening of June 8th. We will be advertisi=
ng this event more publicly in the coming days, but I wanted to make sure y=
ou were among the first to know. Ken Lerer and Katherine Sailer are hosting=
 what promises to be an intimate evening with remarks from the President an=
d the chance to ask any questions you may have. We are expecting no more th=
an 60 guests and each person will have the opportunity for a photo with the=
 President.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We'd love to see you there if you are available. I've included the invitati=
on for your reference and you can RSVP here&lt;<a href=3D"https://finance.d=
emocrats.org/page/contribute/NYDinnerJun8" target=3D"_blank">https://financ=
e.democrats.org/page/contribute/NYDinnerJun8</a>&gt;. Please let me know if=
 you have any questions about the event. I hope we'll see you in June!<br>
<br>
<br>

Best,<br>
