WHO: DWS & Henry with Bryan Llenas
WHAT: Two on one, in-studio interview in NYC to discuss how Democrats are poised to make huge strides with Latino electeds this year (true story).
WHEN: Monday or Tuesday
WHERE: Fox News NYC Bureau

My take is that this is a very good idea. Alternatively, happy to turn this one into a cooking segment.
