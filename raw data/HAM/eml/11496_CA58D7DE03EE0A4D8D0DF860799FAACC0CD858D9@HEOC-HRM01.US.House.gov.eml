For 78 days and counting, House Republicans have refused to act on Presiden=

cluding more than 100 pregnant women =96 with confirmed cases of Zika, but =
House Republicans continue to dawdle in the face of this frightening threat=
.

Editorial boards across the country are echoing House Democrats=92 message =
to the Republican Congress: do your job to keep the American people safe.

Bloomberg Editorial: Congress Has No Good Reason to Delay Zika Funding<http=

More than two months after the White House asked Congress for more than $1.=
8 billion to fight the Zika virus, Congress has yet to provide it. Presiden=
t Barack Obama, Republicans claim, has failed to explain in sufficient deta=
il how his administration would spend the money.

Perhaps his 25-page proposal<https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files=
/omb/assets/budget_amendments/emergency_supplemental_2-22-16_zika.pdf>, sen=
t to House Speaker Paul Ryan in February, got lost in interoffice mail. If =
so, no worries: There=92s also a summary on the Web. Most of the money -- a=
bout $1.5 billion -- will go to the Department of Health and Human Services=
 to help states control the mosquito that carries the virus, expand program=
s to test for it, and work on developing a vaccine=85

The case for action now is overwhelming=85 Whatever the explanation for Rep=
ublicans=92 truculence -- and opposition among some factions of the party t=
o any new spending undoubtedly factors into it -- it=92s a delay that could=
 endanger lives. There have already been 891 cases of Zika in the U.S., inc=
luding 81 pregnant women. Republicans need to move, and quick.

New York Times Editorial: On Zika, Congress Is Failing to Do Its Job<http:/=
/www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/opinion/on-zika-congress-is-failing-to-do-its-j=
ob.html>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that the Zika =
virus causes brain damage in babies born to infected women, which adds to t=
he growing evidence that the virus is a major public health emergency. Yet =
Republicans in Congress are refusing to appropriate the money needed to res=
pond to this crisis=85

President Obama asked Congress in February for more than $1.8 billion to fi=
ght Zika, but Republican lawmakers refused to act and said the government s=
hould use money that had been appropriated for other diseases, like Ebola. =
They have also made vague promises to provide more funds before the next fi=
scal year begins in October=85After weeks of fruitless talks with Congress,=
 the administration said last week that it would shift nearly $600 million =
to anti-Zika efforts from Ebola and other programs. That is not sufficient =
and could increase the risk of another outbreak of Ebola, which remains a p=
ersistent threat.

Having learned from its slow response to Ebola, the Obama administration is=
 trying to move faster against Zika. But if Congress doesn=92t do its job, =
the public will be put at needless risk.

Chicago Tribune Editorial: The long, hot summer of Zika<http://www.chicagot=
ribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-zika-congress-obama-funding-ebola-edi=
t-0507-jm-20160505-story.html>
President Barack Obama asked Congress to set aside $1.9 billion to better r=
espond to the virus abroad and prepare for it here. He said the money was n=
ecessary to halt the spread of the disease and "protect the health and safe=
ty of Americans."  That was in February.  The response?  So far, nothing.  =
Full, screeching halt.

Congress has refused to approve the request=85 Senate negotiators recently =
said they were close to a deal to provide at least $1.1 billion in emergenc=
y financing to battle the rapidly spreading virus. But House Republicans we=
re still stalling. Maybe they'll be convinced when the mosquitoes start bit=
ing on the Potomac, when mothers and babies start suffering.

Los Angeles Times Editorial: Zika will only get 'scarier' if lawmakers are =
stingy with emergency funds<http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ol=
-0415-zika-funding-20160414-story.html>
The more scientists learn about Zika, the worse the news gets for the next =
generation=85

The new information about Zika should weigh heavily on Congress when it dec=
ides whether to allocate $1.9 billion in emergency funding, as requested by=
 the CDC and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Law=
makers balked when President Obama first asked for the money in February. B=
ut that was before we understood just how insidious this seemingly mild-man=
nered flavivirus can be.

Miami Herald Editorial: Where=92s Congress on Zika? Nowhere!<http://www.mia=
miherald.com/opinion/editorials/article76189922.html>
More than 100 days after the first cases of Zika were reported in Florida, =
leaders of Congress stubbornly continue to turn a deaf ear to pleas for add=
itional federal funding. The indifference shown by lawmakers in the face of=
 an identifiable health threat is both impossible to ignore and hard to fat=
hom.

President Obama wants $1.9 billion in emergency funding to fight Zika=85 Ye=
t Congress has resisted this plea for help since February, when President O=
bama first sought emergency aid.

By last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 472 c=
ases in the continental United States. That=92s in addition to 629 cases in=
 Puerto Rico, where the first known death from Zika recently was documented=
.

And still Republican leaders in Congress, such as Texas Sen. John Cornyn, s=
coff at the concerns about Zika as =93overblown.=94 He said Zika-aid suppor=
ters are asking for a blank check. Not so, senator. Money is needed to pay =
for mosquito-control efforts, scientific research into the disease and the =
development of a vaccine, medical care for those infected and educational m=
aterials for the public=85

Congressional leaders should pay attention. The Zika virus represents a gen=
uine health emergency. Florida and other targeted states need help. This is=
 a time to act, not a time for partisan politics.

=85U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, and several bay area health experts gat=
hered in a Tampa back yard last week to address public health concerns abou=
t Zika. The group focused on pregnant women or those who might be thinking =
about getting pregnant during the summer. Health officials have found that =
Zika is linked to microcephaly, a birth defect that results in a small head=
 size that could interfere with brain development=85

=85a silly fight over funding for prevention efforts has broken out in Cong=
ress over President Barack Obama's $1.9 billion request to combat Zika in t=
he United States. A request to respond to a public health emergency should =
not be mired in partisan politics. Lawmakers should re-examine their priori=
ties and put the health of Americans above partisan budget battles.

 months removed from Gov. Rick Scott taking the appropriate action of decla=

urfaced in Florida.

That was about the same time that President Barack Obama rightly asked Cong=
ress for $1.9 billion to battle the outbreak here, and in Central and Latin=
 America.

We=92re still waiting for Congress to take action.

This is not a time for partisan politics=85 House conservatives are resisti=

 the virus.  People have died. Pregnant women are infected. Time for Congre=

It's been nearly two months since Obama formally requested that Congress ap=
propriate $1.9 billion to fight the Zika virus. At the time, there were abo=
ut 50 confirmed cases in the United States of the illness, which has been l=
inked in Latin America to severe birth defects in infants whose mothers wer=
e infected during pregnancy.

Congress' GOP leaders have refused to approve that request. Meanwhile, the =
number of U.S. cases has climbed=85

The headline word from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last =
week was =93scary.=94  =93Everything we look at with this virus seems to be=
 a bit scarier than we initially thought,=94 Anne Schuchat, the agency=92s =
deputy director, told the media.  That=92s the Zika virus, which is inflict=
ing terrible harm across Latin America and the Caribbean and possibly headi=
ng north.

Yet, the nation isn=92t prepared. For starters, if there are few labs that =
can test for the virus, more are needed soon. The White House called for $1=
.9 billion in funding, but congressional leaders signaled that additional m=
oney will have to wait until September =97 after the peak mosquito season.

This alarms the American Public Health Association. =93There is no time for=
 delay. Congress must act to approve adequate resources to address this pub=
lic health threat without taking money from other important public health p=
rograms,=94 its executive director, Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, M.D., said in =
a news release.

f Zika<http://www.amny.com/opinion/editorial/federal-government-must-do-mor=
e-to-curb-the-spread-of-zika-1.11738348>
News about the Zika virus has been spreading quickly. So has fear=85

Now the federal government must step up. The White House transferred $510 m=
illion allocated for Ebola to fight Zika, as demanded by Republican lawmake=
rs, but the amount is insufficient. Congress should act on President Barack=
 Obama=92s request for $1.9 billion for important research on a vaccine, am=
ong other needed initiatives.

Zika can be devastating for pregnant women and their babies. The urgency of=
 our government response must match the urgency of the threat to our famili=
es.

Everett Herald Editorial: Fund fight against Zika, more<http://www.heraldne=
t.com/article/20160427/OPINION01/160429254>
It takes little imagination to see the threat posed not only to public heal=
th but in the increased costs for prevention, care and treatment that could=
 result from a significant outbreak of Zika in the United States.

Which is why the Obama administration earlier in the year requested up to $=
1.9 billion in emergency spending from Congress for programs that control t=
he mosquitoes and fund research into potential vaccines and public educatio=
n programs to limit transmission=85That initial request was met with doubts=
 and opposition among Republicans in Congress.

Moving funding through the House could be more difficult. Earlier this mont=
h, the Post wrote that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, told reporters=
 that the government had =93plenty of money,=94 available to fight Zika and=
 that an additional appropriation wasn't necessary=85 And as long as we're =
advocating for ounces of prevention against Zika and Ebola, let's recognize=
 the value provided to public health and pocketbook by amply funding the wo=
rk of state and local health departments.

Youngstown Vindicator Editorial: Zika virus is becoming a public-health cri=
sis in US<http://www.vindy.com/news/2016/may/03/zika-virus-is-becoming-a-pu=
blic-health-c/>
Last week, the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate refused to deal with =
the growing public-health emergency triggered by the Zika virus. Let there =
be no mistake: The virus is spreading through the United States and the ter=
ritories.

Last February, the Obama administration asked Congress for $1.9 billion in =
emergency funds to develop a vaccine, top-flight diagnostic tests and rapid=
- response teams for any Zika clusters that are detected=85

But Republicans in control of the Senate and House obviously don=92t share =
the administration=92s sense of urgency.

Republicans in Congress are putting the nation at risk by playing political=
 games with the Obama administration=92s request for funding to fight the Z=
ika virus.

The American people recognize that Congress is dysfunctional, but they will=
 not sit idly by while the health of the nation is sacrificed at the altar =
of partisan politics.
