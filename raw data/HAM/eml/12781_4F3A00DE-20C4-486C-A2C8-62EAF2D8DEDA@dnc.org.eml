Bernie Sanders=92s Defiance Strains Ties With Top Democrats
=B7
By JEREMY W. PETERS and ALAN RAPPEPORT
MAY 18, 2016
WASHINGTON =97 Senator Bernie Sanders<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/20=
16/us/elections/bernie-sanders-on-the-issues.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>=92s rel=
ationship with the leadership of the Democratic Party and his colleagues on=
 Capitol Hill was strained further on Wednesday as he and his campaign rema=
ined defiant over the way they say his success is being belittled and under=
mined by people in the party who are loyal toHillary Clinton<http://www.nyt=
imes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/hillary-clinton-on-the-issues.html?i=
nline=3Dnyt-per>.
Whatever tolerance Democrats have for Mr. Sanders=92s continuing his increa=
singly long-shot presidential bid was quickly evaporating, with some of his=
 closest allies in the party suggesting his efforts to rein in his most unr=
uly supporters was half-hearted.
=93Bernie and I have known each other for a long time,=94 said Senator Harr=
y Reid of Nevada, the minority leader and one of Mr. Sanders=92 best friend=
s in the Senate. =93And I believe he is better than this.=94
Vice President Joe Biden also weighed in, saying that while Mr. Sanders is =
=93a good guy,=94 he needed =93to be more aggressive in speaking out.=94
The dispute centered around the Democratic state convention in Nevada over =
the weekend in which Mr. Sanders was denied the delegates he thought he had=
 earned, a development that infuriated his supporters there and led some to=
 throw chairs and later threaten the state party chairwoman.
The Democratic Party of Nevada pushed back against the Sanders campaign=92s=
 criticism that the process wrongly deprived him of delegates, saying that =
=93simple math=94 dictated the outcome and that Mr. Sanders was simply outn=
umbered. =93Bernie Sanders=92s campaign was not organized,=94 the party sai=
d in a statement, noting that nearly 500 of his seats at the convention wer=
e vacant because his supporters had failed to show up.
National party leaders, such as the Democratic National Committee<http://to=
pics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/democratic_natio=
nal_committee/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-org> chairwoman,Debbie Wasserman Schu=
ltz<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/debbie_was=
serman_schultz/index.html>, have also criticized how Mr. Sanders has handle=
d the unrest in Nevada, adding to the frustration within his campaign.
Mr. Sanders=92s campaign manager took to cable news on Wednesday to assail =
the party and Ms. Schultz.
=93The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, it is clear almost =
from the get-go she has been working against Bernie Sanders =97 there=92s n=
o doubt about it, for personal reasons,=94 Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders=92s cam=
paign manager, said of Ms. Wasserman Schultz on MSNBC. =93She has been the =
divider and not really provided leadership that the Democratic Party needs,=
=94 Mr. Weaver added.
Nowhere has the strain in the Democratic Party been more evident lately tha=
n in Mr. Sanders=92s relationship with Mr. Reid. Few members of the Senate =
are closer to Mr. Sanders than Mr. Reid, who had tried to head off any conf=
rontation by speaking personally with Mr. Sanders on Friday to stress the i=
mportance of not letting the state convention devolve into a messy fight ov=
er a handful of delegates.
=93If you want the two damn delegates, you can have them,=94 Mr. Reid told =
Mr. Sanders, according to someone with firsthand knowledge of the discussio=
ns between the two senators. Though Mr. Reid has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, he =
has said that he believes Mr. Sanders has earned a right to remain in the r=
ace.
After the convention went awry, Mr. Reid and Mr. Sanders spoke again on Tue=
sday afternoon. Mr. Reid expressed dismay that Mr. Sanders=92s supporters h=
ad acted so belligerently. A member of his own staff was at the convention =
and feared for her own safety, Mr. Reid said. He also said that the way San=
ders supporters had been harassing Roberta Lange, the state party chairwoma=
n =97 filling her voice mail with threatening, obscene messages and showing=
 up at her Las Vegas restaurant in protest =97 was over the line.
Mr. Sanders said he agreed and believed that the violence should be condemn=
ed. But when he released his statement on Tuesday night, which made only a =
passing reference to the violence at the convention, a perplexed Mr. Reid t=
old his staff that he thought the gesture was =93silly=94 and beneath Mr. S=
anders, according to the person who spoke with Mr. Reid.
The two senators have not spoken since.
Mr. Sanders appeared to be taken somewhat by surprise at the way the Nevada=
 melee was being portrayed, and how negatively it was reflecting on his cam=
paign.
Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, Mr. Sanders=92s lone endorser in =
the Senate, said in an interview that he had spoken with Mr. Sanders on Wed=
nesday and that Mr. Sanders was forceful in his condemnation of the violenc=
e.
=93He wants to make sure that everyone who asks the question knows the answ=
er: that he 100 percent rejects that type of conduct,=94 Mr. Merkley said. =
=93We have to step forward and say, totally unacceptable,=94 he added. =93T=
hat is the exact opposite of what Trump did. Trump basically embraced viole=
nce, encouraged violence. That is a different story. That is the Republican=
 story.=94
Mr. Merkley said Mr. Sanders remained committed to staying in the race. Tur=
ning the pleas of party unity that some Democrats are making around, Mr. Me=
rkley said that the rift in the party would only deepen if Mr. Sanders was =
driven from the race now.
=93One of the reasons it is so important for him to stay in this race is th=
at when we go to the convention and we=92re building the bridge that brings=
 everyone together, people have to feel like they were heard, that they wer=
e respected,=94 Mr. Merkley said.
=93You can=92t say to them, =91Hey, we don=92t want to hear your views,=92 =
and shut the door on them, and then a month later open the door and say, =
=91Hey, can you come in and help us out?=92=94 he added. =93He fully intend=
s to go forward.=94
