THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release May 3, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

AT THE 2016 NATIONAL TEACHER OF THE YEAR CELEBRATION



East Room





4:35 P.M. EDT



 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Well, welcome to the White House. (Applause.) =
And thank you, Jahana, for that wonderful introduction. Everybody please =
give the National Teacher of the Year a big round of applause. (Applause.=
) Its a little surprising that she got this award because you can tell sh=
es a little shy -- (laughter) -- and lacks enthusiasm. (Laughter.) And ye=
t somehow she seems to be performing pretty well in the classroom. (Laugh=
ter.) Look at that smile.



So for seven years, Ive stood in the White House with Americas finest pub=
lic servants and private-sector innovators and our best advocates and our=
 best athletes and our best artists, and I have to tell you there are few=
 moments that make me prouder than this event when I stand alongside our =
nations best educators. (Applause.)=20



Every year on this day, we say publicly as a country what we should be ea=
ger to say every day of the year, and that is: Thank you. Thats what this=
 event is about. That's why its one of my favorites. Its a good day with =
all of you guys here in Washington to say thank you for the extraordinary=
 work that teachers do all across the country. Its also, I guess, a prett=
y good day for substitute teachers because we got a lot of folks -- (laug=
hter) -- we got a lot of folks playing hooky today. (Laughter.) This is a=
 school day. (Laughter.)=20



MS. HAYES: Its a learning opportunity. (Laughter.)=20



THE PRESIDENT: Its a field trip.=20



Now, among our countrys best educators happens to be our Secretary of Edu=
cation, Dr. John King, Jr. (Applause.) John is someone who, like Jahana, =
found refuge in school as a youngster. And he found role models in the cl=
assroom at a time when he needed them most. And that experience instilled=
 in him the empathy that makes him such a powerful voice for students and=
 for teachers and for principals and superintendents and educators all ac=
ross the country.=20



I also want to acknowledge Jahanas senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy=
. Hes around here somewhere. There he is. (Applause.) Hes proud of you, t=
oo.=20



I want to welcome her fellow Teachers of the Year from all 50 states, D.C=
., and our territories. (Applause.) And we want to welcome the hundreds o=
f distinguished educators from all across the country that joined us this=
 afternoon. So thank you. (Applause.)=20



I figured this is the last time I was going to do this, so I wanted to in=
vite as many of you as possible -- (applause) -- because you are people w=
ho are inspiring at every grade level, who are opening minds to math and =
music; to basic literacy but classic literature; to social studies and sc=
ience, Spanish, and special education. (Applause.)=20



In their daily lives, the men and women who teach our children fulfill th=
e promise of a nation that's always looking forward, that believes each g=
eneration has a responsibility to help the next in building this great co=
untry of ours and making the world a better place.



President Kennedy said, Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than o=
ur progress in education. Now, the school where Jahana teaches happens to=
 bear President Kennedys name. And its fitting then that the perspective,=
 that approach that she brings to the classroom suits the philosophy that=
 he articulated.



This is what Jahana said about how she approaches her responsibility: It =
doesnt matter how bright a student is or where they rank in a class, or w=
hat colleges they have been accepted to if they do nothing with their gif=
t to improve the human condition. And Jahana cares about the example she =
sets as much as the exams that she scores. (Applause.)=20



All right, you just need to settle down. (Laughter.) This is what makes h=
er a great teacher. You can't be great if you're not enthusiastic. (Laugh=
ter.) You got to love what you do -- and she loves what she does.=20



And whats remarkable about Jahanas natural talent in the classroom is tha=
t when she was growing up in Waterbury, Connecticut, being a teacher was =
the furthest thing from her mind. In fact, there were times where she did=
nt even want to be a student.



No one in Jahanas family had gone to college. No one at home particularly=
 encouraged education. She lived in a community full of poverty and viole=
nce, high crime and low expectations. And drugs were more accessible than=
 degrees. As a teenager, Jahana became pregnant and wanted to drop out of=
 school. But her teachers saw something. They saw something in her. And t=
hey gave her an even greater challenge, and that was to dream bigger and =
to imagine a better life. And they made her believe she was college mater=
ial and that she had the special gift to improve not only her own conditi=
on, but those around her.



And today, Jahanas principal at Kennedy High says she gets through to her=
 students precisely because she remembers what its like to be one of them=
. And she doesn't forget that everyone in her class brings their own diff=
erent and sometimes difficult circumstances. And she meets them where the=
y are. And she sees a grace in them, and she sees a possibility in them. =
And because she sees it, they start seeing it.



And thats what makes Jahana more than a teacher; shes a counselor and a c=
onfidant. Thats how a woman who became a teenage mom is now a mentor to h=
igh schoolers in the same city where she grew up.



And meanwhile, outside of the classroom, Jahana has been a leader in the =
afterschool theater program. She put together a Teen Idol singing show. (=
Laughter.) She won the schools Dancing with the Stars competition. (Laugh=
ter.) I wish I had met you before I started tangoing in Argentina. (Laugh=
ter.) Could have given me some tips.=20



And this is something that I think is particularly remarkable: Jahana ins=
pires her students to give back. I think she understands that actually so=
metimes the less you have, the more valuable it is to see yourself giving=
, because that shows you the power and the influence that you can bring t=
o bear on the world around you.



One year, she had been assigned to a group that seemed unmotivated, so sh=
e found out what was distracting them. Seven students in one class had re=
cently lost a parent to cancer. So she organized a Relay for Life team th=
rough the American Cancer Society, and it became an annual event.



Last year, when Jahana went online to register her team, she noticed not =
one, not two, but fourteen teams led by former students had already signe=
d up. She organized her students to walk for autism, to feed the homeless=
, to donate clothes, to clean neighborhoods, and even to register voters.=
 And so it takes a unique leader to get students who dont have a lot to g=
ive of themselves. But because Jahana understood those kids, she knew not=
 to set low expectations, but to set high ones and to say to them, you ca=
n make a difference.



And that's the kind of leader our Teacher of the Year is. She knows that =
if students learn their worth, then the class rank and the college accept=
ances and the exam scores will follow.



Now, if theres one thing Jahana wishes she had in school, it was more tea=
chers who looked like her, as she already mentioned. And so she wrote and=
 won a state grant to inspire more students to become teachers - but espe=
cially to recruit more black and Latino teachers in her district. (Applau=
se.) And that's important.=20



Not one of the teachers standing behind me or in front of our childrens c=
lassrooms chose this profession because they were promised a big payday o=
r a short workday. (Laughter.) Although, you all do need to be paid bette=
r. (Applause.) That I believe. But the main reason teachers do what they =
do is because they love kids. They love our kids. And yes, we should pay =
teachers more because what they do is invaluable and essential. And the t=
eachers here, though, will tell you that what would be most helpful, in a=
ddition to a little financial relief, would be people understanding how i=
mportant the work you do is -- (applause) -- and to appreciate it, and no=
t take it for granted.



And so part of the reason this event is so important is for us to be able=
 to send a message to future generations of teachers, to talented young p=
eople all across the country to understand this is a dream job; that this=
 is an area where you will have more influence potentially than any other=
 profession that you go into.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: Say it again! (Laughter.)=20



THE PRESIDENT: This is a profession where you have the potential to make =
more of a difference than just about anything you can go into. (Applause.=
)=20



So over the past seven years, weve looked at every element of our educati=
on system with an eye towards boosting the teaching profession. And thank=
s to our educators and the opinions youve voiced and the leadership that =
youve shown, weve come a long way since we came into office.



One of the first things we did, in the middle of the worst economic crisi=
s in generations, when states and cities were slashing budgets, was to ke=
ep more than 300,000 educators in our kids classrooms. That was part of t=
he Recovery Act.



Weve taken the first steps towards making sure every young person in Amer=
ica gets the best start possible. And keep in mind that in 2009, when I s=
tarted here, only 38 states had their own preschool programs. Today, all =
but four have. We've expanded Head Start programs for tens of thousands o=
f kids who need it. (Applause.)

=20

We made turning around Americas low-performing schools a national priorit=
y. The year before I took office, a quarter of our high school students d=
idnt graduate on time. More than a million didnt finish high school at al=
l. And today, high school graduations rates have never been higher, dropo=
ut rates have gone down. Were transforming hundreds of Americas lowest-pe=
rforming schools.=20



Were also bringing new technology and digital tools to our classrooms to =
modernize and personalize learning. Three years ago, less than a third of=
 all school districts could access high-speed Internet, and a lot of low-=
income communities were left behind. Today, 20 million more students and =
most of our school districts have fast broadband and wireless in the clas=
sroom. And by 2018, were going got make sure that we reach the goal I set=
: 99 percent of our students will have high-speed Internet. (Applause.)=20=




We're making remarkable progress towards my pledge to train 100,000 STEM =
teachers by 2021 thanks to the great work of 100K in 10 - which, with new=
 commitments to prepare 70,000 more teachers, I want to just announce tod=
ay this is a goal that we are going to achieve on time. We're on our way.=
=20



And we unleashed a race to the top, convincing every state to raise its s=
tandards so students are prepared for success in college and for future c=
areers. And we listened to parents who wanted subjects like computer scie=
nce taught in our schools. And we listened to teachers who have shown why=
 cookie-cutter solutions dont always work. Were empowering states and com=
munities to set their own standards for progress with accountability. And=
 because nobody thinks our students need to spend more time filling in bu=
bbles on standardized tests, were starting to give educators like those b=
ehind me the flexibility to spend more time teaching creatively than they=
're spending teaching to a test. (Applause.)=20



Now, that doesnt mean that all our problems are solved. You know it bette=
r than I do. In too many states, we are underfunding public education. An=
d it is the job of state legislators and of governors to recognize that t=
he wellbeing of their state and their communities and their families and =
their kids requires them to step up. (Applause.) In too many school distr=
icts, we still have schools that, despite great efforts by a lot of great=
 teachers, are still not getting our kids prepared the way they need to b=
e prepared. And we've got to be willing to be honest when something is no=
t working and say, all right, lets try something different. And sometimes=
, we won't necessarily get it right the first time.=20



But the reason I think -- I want to bring this up. This wasnt in my prepa=
red remarks -- (laughter) -- but I think it's important. So often now, th=
e debate swings back and forth. You got some folks who say resources and =
money dont make a difference, and the problem is all the teachers' unions=
 and they want to break up the schools, and they think vouchers are all t=
he answer, or some other approach. And then on the other side you got fol=
ks who just know that argument is wrong, but too often it sounds like it'=
s just a defense of the status quo.



And the fact of the matter is, is that we do have to do better in too man=
y of our schools. We need more teachers like this in all of you. We've go=
t to make the profession more attractive. We do have to have accountabili=
ty in the classroom. That doesnt mean forcing you to teach to the test, b=
ut we've got to come up with measures that are meaningful, so that if som=
ebody doesnt have the skills that Jahana or these other teachers have, th=
at they can start developing it and we know what to look for. We've got t=
o make sure that we're setting our sights high.=20



And although I am very proud of the work that we've done, I know we're no=
t there yet. And we may have replaced No Child Left Behind, which was a r=
elief for a lot of folks, but the absence of something that wasnt working=
 as well as it should is not the presence of the kind of work that remain=
s to be done.=20



So, in our country, it's a little harder than in some other countries, be=
cause we've got diverse populations, and we got folks coming from differe=
nt backgrounds and starting off in tougher circumstances. But our Teacher=
 of the Year here stands as proof that you can't set expectations high en=
ough for our kids. There's magic in those kids. We just have to find it. =
We have to unleash it. We have to nurture it. We have to support it. We h=
ave to love them. And then we have to tell them precisely because we love=
 you, you're going to work harder, and you're going to do better. And we'=
re going to stay on you.



That's what we have to do. And we can't just leave it to the teachers -- =
because if our notion is we drop off our kids and then the teacher is doi=
ng everything, and then our job is done, it's not going to work.=20



So this is why my administration launched Teach to Lead -- (applause) -- =
to give teachers a greater voice in the policies that affect them every d=
ay.=20



And I'm going to close by just talking about a letter I received at the b=
eginning of this school year from a teacher in central Virginia named Dan=
ny Abell. There's Danny. (Applause.) There's a reason why he got a good s=
pot -- (laughter) -- because he knew I was going to talk about him. So Da=
nny asked his students if any of them wanted to be a teacher when they gr=
ew up. And no one raised their hands. And that worried him. So he wrote m=
e to ask what Id say if one of my daughters told me she wanted to become =
a teacher. And I mean this -- this is the God's honest truth -- if Sasha =
or Malia wanted to be teachers, I will tell them I could not be prouder o=
f what you've done. (Applause.) And I'd tell them to be the kind of teach=
ers who don't just show her students how to get the correct answer, but h=
ow to be curious about the world and how to care for the people around he=
r, and how to analyze facts and evidence, and how to tell stories, and ho=
w to believe in their ability to shape their own destiny.



In other words, Id tell her to be like Jahana and to be like each of the =
educators behind us here today, and the kinds of teachers that you see in=
 classrooms in every state and every territory, and the District of Colum=
bia. I'm so proud of all of you for the high standards you set for your s=
tudents, for your fellow teachers. Thank you for making our nation strong=
er.=20



And now, Jahana, please join me to accept this award from Americas educat=
ors - the crystal apple - as the National Teacher of the Year. (Applause.=
)=20

<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank =
you.&nbsp; Well, welcome to the White House.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And th=
ank you, Jahana, for that wonderful introduction.&nbsp; Everybody please gi=
ve the National Teacher of the Year a big round of applause.&nbsp; (Applaus=
e.)&nbsp; It&#8217;s
 a little surprising that she got this award because you can tell she&#8217=
;s a little shy -- (laughter) -- and lacks enthusiasm.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nb=
sp; And yet somehow she seems to be performing pretty well in the classroom=
.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Look at that smile.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So for seven years, I&#8217;=
ve stood in the White House with America&#8217;s finest public servants and=
 private-sector innovators and our best advocates and our best
 athletes and our best artists, and I have to tell you there are few moment=
s that make me prouder than this event when I stand alongside our nation&#8=
217;s best educators.&nbsp; (Applause.)
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Every year on this day, we s=
ay publicly as a country what we should be eager to say every day of the ye=
ar, and that is:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what this event
 is about.&nbsp; That's why it&#8217;s one of my favorites.&nbsp; It&#8217;=
s a good day with all of you guys here in Washington to say thank you for t=
he extraordinary work that teachers do all across the country.&nbsp; It&#82=
17;s also, I guess, a pretty good day for substitute teachers because
 we got a lot of folks -- (laughter) -- we got a lot of folks playing hooky=
 today.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; This is a school day.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbs=

a learning opportunity.&nbsp; (Laughter.)

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; It&#821=
7;s a field trip.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Now, among our country&#8217=
;s best educators happens to be our Secretary of Education, Dr. John King, =
Jr.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; John is someone who, like Jahana, found
 refuge in school as a youngster.&nbsp; And he found role models in the cla=
ssroom at a time when he needed them most.&nbsp; And that experience instil=
led in him the empathy that makes him such a powerful voice for students an=
d for teachers and for principals and superintendents
 and educators all across the country.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">I also want to acknowledge J=
ahana&#8217;s senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy.&nbsp; He&#8217;s arou=
nd here somewhere.&nbsp; There he is.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; He&#8217;s pr=
oud of you,
 too.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">I want to welcome her fellow=
 Teachers of the Year from all 50 states, D.C., and our territories.&nbsp; =
(Applause.)&nbsp; And we want to welcome the hundreds of distinguished
 educators from all across the country that joined us this afternoon.&nbsp;=
 So thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">I figured this is the last t=
ime I was going to do this, so I wanted to invite as many of you as possibl=
e -- (applause) -- because you are people who are
 inspiring at every grade level, who are opening minds to math and music; t=
o basic literacy but classic literature; to social studies and science, Spa=
nish, and special education.&nbsp; (Applause.)
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">In their daily lives, the me=
n and women who teach our children fulfill the promise of a nation that's a=
lways looking forward, that believes each generation
 has a responsibility to help the next in building this great country of ou=
rs and making the world a better place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">President Kennedy said, &#82=
20;Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in educatio=
n.&#8221;&nbsp; Now, the school where Jahana teaches happens to bear
 President Kennedy&#8217;s name.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s fitting then that the=
 perspective, that approach that she brings to the classroom suits the phil=
osophy that he articulated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">This is what Jahana said abo=
ut how she approaches her responsibility: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter ho=
w bright a student is or where they rank in a class, or what
 colleges they have been accepted to if they do nothing with their gift to =
improve the human condition.&#8221;&nbsp; And Jahana cares about the exampl=
e she sets as much as the exams that she scores.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nb=
sp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">All right, you just need to =
settle down.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; This is what makes her a great teacher=
.&nbsp; You can't be great if you're not enthusiastic.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nb=
sp;
 You got to love what you do -- and she loves what she does.&nbsp; <o:p></o=
:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And what&#8217;s remarkable =
about Jahana&#8217;s natural talent in the classroom is that when she was g=
rowing up in Waterbury, Connecticut, being a teacher was the
 furthest thing from her mind.&nbsp; In fact, there were times where she di=
dn&#8217;t even want to be a student.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">No one in Jahana&#8217;s fam=
ily had gone to college.&nbsp; No one at home particularly encouraged educa=
tion.&nbsp; She lived in a community full of poverty and violence,
 high crime and low expectations.&nbsp; And drugs were more accessible than=
 degrees.&nbsp; As a teenager, Jahana became pregnant and wanted to drop ou=
t of school.&nbsp; But her teachers saw something.&nbsp; They saw something=
 in her.&nbsp; And they gave her an even greater challenge,
 and that was to dream bigger and to imagine a better life.&nbsp; And they =
made her believe she was college material and that she had the special gift=
 to improve not only her own condition, but those around her.<o:p></o:p></s=
pan></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And today, Jahana&#8217;s pr=
incipal at Kennedy High says she gets through to her students precisely bec=
ause she remembers what it&#8217;s like to be one of them.&nbsp;
 And she doesn't forget that everyone in her class brings their own differe=
nt and sometimes difficult circumstances.&nbsp; And she meets them where th=
ey are.&nbsp; And she sees a grace in them, and she sees a possibility in t=
hem.&nbsp; And because she sees it, they start
 seeing it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And that&#8217;s what makes =
Jahana more than a teacher; she&#8217;s a counselor and a confidant.&nbsp; =
That&#8217;s how a woman who became a teenage mom is now a mentor to high
 schoolers in the same city where she grew up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And meanwhile, outside of th=
e classroom, Jahana has been a leader in the afterschool theater program.&n=
bsp; She put together a &#8220;Teen Idol&#8221; singing show.&nbsp; (Laught=
er.)&nbsp;
 She won the school&#8217;s &#8220;Dancing with the Stars&#8221; competitio=
n.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I wish I had met you before I started tangoing i=
n Argentina.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Could have given me some tips.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And this is something that I=
 think is particularly remarkable:&nbsp; Jahana inspires her students to gi=
ve back.&nbsp; I think she understands that actually sometimes
 the less you have, the more valuable it is to see yourself giving, because=
 that shows you the power and the influence that you can bring to bear on t=
he world around you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">One year, she had been assig=
ned to a group that seemed unmotivated, so she found out what was distracti=
ng them.&nbsp; Seven students in one class had recently
 lost a parent to cancer.&nbsp; So she organized a Relay for Life team thro=
ugh the American Cancer Society, and it became an annual event.<o:p></o:p><=
/span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Last year, when Jahana went =
online to register her team, she noticed not one, not two, but fourteen tea=
ms led by former students had already signed up.&nbsp;
 She organized her students to walk for autism, to feed the homeless, to do=
nate clothes, to clean neighborhoods, and even to register voters.&nbsp; An=
d so it takes a unique leader to get students who don&#8217;t have a lot to=
 give of themselves.&nbsp; But because Jahana understood
 those kids, she knew not to set low expectations, but to set high ones and=
 to say to them, you can make a difference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And that's the kind of leade=
r our Teacher of the Year is.&nbsp; She knows that if students learn their =
worth, then the class rank and the college acceptances
 and the exam scores will follow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Now, if there&#8217;s one th=
ing Jahana wishes she had in school, it was more teachers who looked like h=
er, as she already mentioned.&nbsp; And so she wrote and won
 a state grant to inspire more students to become teachers &#8211;- but esp=
ecially to recruit more black and Latino teachers in her district.&nbsp; (A=
pplause.)&nbsp; And that's important.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Not one of the teachers stan=
ding behind me or in front of our children&#8217;s classrooms chose this pr=
ofession because they were promised a big payday or a
 short workday.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Although, you all do need to be pai=
d better.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That I believe.&nbsp; But the main reason=
 teachers do what they do is because they love kids.&nbsp; They love our ki=
ds.&nbsp; And yes, we should pay teachers more because what they do
 is invaluable and essential.&nbsp; And the teachers here, though, will tel=
l you that what would be most helpful, in addition to a little financial re=
lief, would be people understanding how important the work you do is -- (ap=
plause) -- and to appreciate it, and
 not take it for granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And so part of the reason th=
is event is so important is for us to be able to send a message to future g=
enerations of teachers, to talented young people
 all across the country to understand this is a dream job; that this is an =
area where you will have more influence potentially than any other professi=
on that you go into.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So over the past seven years=
, we&#8217;ve looked at every element of our education system with an eye t=
owards boosting the teaching profession.&nbsp; And thanks to
 our educators and the opinions you&#8217;ve voiced and the leadership that=
 you&#8217;ve shown, we&#8217;ve come a long way since we came into office.=
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">One of the first things we d=
id, in the middle of the worst economic crisis in generations, when states =
and cities were slashing budgets, was to keep more
 than 300,000 educators in our kids&#8217; classrooms.&nbsp; That was part =
of the Recovery Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">We&#8217;ve taken the first =
steps towards making sure every young person in America gets the best start=
 possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep in mind that in 2009, when I started
 here, only 38 states had their own preschool programs.&nbsp; Today, all bu=
t four have.&nbsp; We've expanded Head Start programs for tens of thousands=
 of kids who need it.&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">We made turning around Ameri=
ca&#8217;s low-performing schools a national priority.&nbsp; The year befor=
e I took office, a quarter of our high school students didn&#8217;t
 graduate on time.&nbsp; More than a million didn&#8217;t finish high schoo=
l at all.&nbsp; And today, high school graduations rates have never been hi=
gher, dropout rates have gone down.&nbsp; We&#8217;re transforming hundreds=
 of America&#8217;s lowest-performing schools.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">We&#8217;re also bringing ne=
w technology and digital tools to our classrooms to modernize and personali=
ze learning.&nbsp; Three years ago, less than a third of all
 school districts could access high-speed Internet, and a lot of low-income=
 communities were left behind.&nbsp; Today, 20 million more students and mo=
st of our school districts have fast broadband and wireless in the classroo=
m.&nbsp; And by 2018, we&#8217;re going got make
 sure that we reach the goal I set:&nbsp; 99 percent of our students will h=
ave high-speed Internet.&nbsp; (Applause.)
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">We're making remarkable prog=
ress towards my pledge to train 100,000 STEM teachers by 2021 thanks to the=
 great work of &#8220;100K in 10&#8221; &#8211;- which, with new commitment=
s
 to prepare 70,000 more teachers, I want to just announce today this is a g=
oal that we are going to achieve on time.&nbsp; We're on our way.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And we unleashed a race to t=
he top, convincing every state to raise its standards so students are prepa=
red for success in college and for future careers.&nbsp;
 And we listened to parents who wanted subjects like computer science taugh=
t in our schools.&nbsp; And we listened to teachers who have shown why cook=
ie-cutter solutions don&#8217;t always work.&nbsp; We&#8217;re empowering s=
tates and communities to set their own standards for progress
 with accountability.&nbsp; And because nobody thinks our students need to =
spend more time filling in bubbles on standardized tests, we&#8217;re start=
ing to give educators like those behind me the flexibility to spend more ti=
me teaching creatively than they're spending
 teaching to a test.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean=
 that all our problems are solved.&nbsp; You know it better than I do.&nbsp=
; In too many states, we are underfunding public education.&nbsp; And
 it is the job of state legislators and of governors to recognize that the =
wellbeing of their state and their communities and their families and their=
 kids requires them to step up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; In too many school =
districts, we still have schools that, despite
 great efforts by a lot of great teachers, are still not getting our kids p=
repared the way they need to be prepared.&nbsp; And we've got to be willing=
 to be honest when something is not working and say, all right, let&#8217;s=
 try something different.&nbsp; And sometimes, we
 won't necessarily get it right the first time.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">But the reason I think -- I =
want to bring this up.&nbsp; This wasn&#8217;t in my prepared remarks -- (l=
aughter) -- but I think it's important.&nbsp; So often now, the
 debate swings back and forth.&nbsp; You got some folks who say resources a=
nd money don&#8217;t make a difference, and the problem is all the teachers=
' unions and they want to break up the schools, and they think vouchers are=
 all the answer, or some other approach.&nbsp; And
 then on the other side you got folks who just know that argument is wrong,=
 but too often it sounds like it's just a defense of the status quo.<o:p></=
o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And the fact of the matter i=
s, is that we do have to do better in too many of our schools.&nbsp; We nee=
d more teachers like this in all of you.&nbsp; We've got to
 make the profession more attractive.&nbsp; We do have to have accountabili=
ty in the classroom.&nbsp; That doesn&#8217;t mean forcing you to teach to =
the test, but we've got to come up with measures that are meaningful, so th=
at if somebody doesn&#8217;t have the skills that Jahana
 or these other teachers have, that they can start developing it and we kno=
w what to look for.&nbsp; We've got to make sure that we're setting our sig=
hts high.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And although I am very proud=
 of the work that we've done, I know we're not there yet.&nbsp; And we may =
have replaced No Child Left Behind, which was a relief
 for a lot of folks, but the absence of something that wasn&#8217;t working=
 as well as it should is not the presence of the kind of work that remains =
to be done.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So, in our country, it's a l=
ittle harder than in some other countries, because we've got diverse popula=
tions, and we got folks coming from different backgrounds
 and starting off in tougher circumstances. &nbsp;But our Teacher of the Ye=
ar here stands as proof that you can't set expectations high enough for our=
 kids.&nbsp; There's magic in those kids.&nbsp; We just have to find it.&nb=
sp; We have to unleash it.&nbsp; We have to nurture it.&nbsp;
 We have to support it.&nbsp; We have to love them.&nbsp; And then we have =
to tell them precisely because we love you, you're going to work harder, an=
d you're going to do better.&nbsp; And we're going to stay on you.<o:p></o:=
p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">That's what we have to do.&n=
bsp; And we can't just leave it to the teachers -- because if our notion is=
 we drop off our kids and then the teacher is doing everything,
 and then our job is done, it's not going to work.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So this is why my administra=
tion launched Teach to Lead -- (applause) -- to give teachers a greater voi=
ce in the policies that affect them every day.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">And I'm going to close by ju=
st talking about a letter I received at the beginning of this school year f=
rom a teacher in central Virginia named Danny Abell.&nbsp;
 There's Danny.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; There's a reason why he got a good =
spot -- (laughter) -- because he knew I was going to talk about him.&nbsp; =
So Danny asked his students if any of them wanted to be a teacher when they=
 grew up.&nbsp; And no one raised their hands.&nbsp; And
 that worried him.&nbsp; So he wrote me to ask what I&#8217;d say if one of=
 my daughters told me she wanted to become a teacher.&nbsp; And I mean this=
 -- this is the God's honest truth -- if Sasha or Malia wanted to be teache=
rs, I will tell them I could not be prouder of what
 you've done.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I'd tell them to be the kind of t=
eachers who don't just show her students how to get the correct answer, but=
 how to be curious about the world and how to care for the people around he=
r, and how to analyze facts and evidence,
 and how to tell stories, and how to believe in their ability to shape thei=
r own destiny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">In other words, I&#8217;d te=
ll her to be like Jahana and to be like each of the educators behind us her=
e today, and the kinds of teachers that you see in classrooms
 in every state and every territory, and the District of Columbia.&nbsp; I'=
m so proud of all of you for the high standards you set for your students, =
for your fellow teachers.&nbsp; Thank you for making our nation stronger.&n=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span style=3D"font-si=
