The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friend -
=20
Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee for President of the =
United States in 2016. As a lifelong advocate for women's rights, this =
statement is frightening to me. Donald Trump has pledged to reverse the =
vast amounts of great progress we have made over the years. His demeaning =
treatment of women and his stance on the Supreme Court and issues such as =
abortion would reverse this progress.  This negatively impacts millions of =
Americans across the country - and that is unacceptable.  Please help us =
support Democrats up and down the ticket to stop the Republicans' =
advance.=20
=20
The time to act is now. That is why I hope you will join me, Robbie =
Kaplan, and special guest Tina Tchen for a Democratic National Committee =
dinner at 7 pm on May 31st at the home of Laetitia and Richard Garriott in =
New York. We will come together and discuss the upcoming race, and why we =
as Democrats must do everything we can to ensure a Democrat remains in the =
White House for the next four years.
