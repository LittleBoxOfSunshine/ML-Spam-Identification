The Democratic Party
-----------------------
I'm going to be very straightforward with you, Luis: We haven't raised=20
as much money as our counterparts on the Republican side. We're coming=20
up short.

According to their most recent FEC reports, the RNC has raised $135=20
million during this election. That's a hell of a lot of money. And while =
we=20
might not catch up to their mega-donors, we have another resource that=20
matters even more: you.

With grassroots donors like you pitching in online in amounts like 10 =
or=20
15 bucks, we're slowly but surely building up the kind of infrastructure =
that=20
Democrats all across the country are going to benefit from come =
November.=20
We're laying the foundation for serious wins -- and we need to keep =
going.=20
Every time someone like you decides to click that donate link and give=20
whatever you can, it's another voice telling the RNC and the =
millionaires=20
and billionaires who are backing them that they can't buy this =
election.=20
We've got the right candidates, and we're fighting on the right side of=20
history -- now, we've just got to see it through 'til November 8th.

So Luis, I'm asking you to be one of those voices right now. Click=20
this link and pitch in $3 or whatever you can to support Democrats=20
up and down the ticket, all across the country:

https://my.democrats.org/April-Deadline
