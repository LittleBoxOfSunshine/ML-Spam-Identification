Subject: Video Request: Trump Interview with Daily Mail

Talking about Ted Cruz, and about how to make GOP convention more exciting

Please Save from yesterday: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3569849/Time-quit-Ted-Trump-tells-Cruz-ready-leave-race-won-t-offer-constitutional-lawyer-spot-Supreme-Court-consolation-prize-tough-temperament.html



Donald Trump called on Ted Cruz on Monday to quit the presidential race and go back to the U.S. Senate if Tuesday's Indiana primary ends with the billlionaire beating the senator.

'Yes, he should. He should leave the race if I win,' Trump told DailyMail.com in a wide-ranging interview at an Indianapolis hotel during his last day of campaigning in the Hoosier State.

'Now, let's see what happens. Indiana's a great state and I have the support of Bobby Knight and so many other people. We'll have to see what happens, but yes, I think he should get out of the race,' Trump said.

The Republican front-runner also said Cruz's 'tough temperament' might make him unsuitable for a spot on his short-list of potential Supreme Court nominees - a consolation prize he could offer the Texas as a party-unifying gesture.

Instead, Trump insisted Ted prepare to pack his bags - and doubled down on his demand later during a lunchtime stop at Shapiro's Delicatessen a few blocks from Lucas Oil Stadium.

Asked during an impromptu press gaggle whether an Indiana defeat should spell the end of a Cruz candidacy, he told reporters: 'I think it should.'



A Cruz spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Monday morning's interview touched on Trump's foreign policy goals, his attitude toward the media, his criticism of past Republican National Conventions, and whether a President Trump would deliver a comedy routine at the White House Correspondents Association's annual gala.

Indiana's 57 delegates to the Republican National Convention, should Trump claim them in Tuesday's winner-take-all primary election, would put the businessman within striking distance of the magic number - 1,237 - that he needs in order to become the party's White House nominee.

Cruz has insisted that he will stay in the contest all the way to the July convention in Cleveland, Ohio.

he launched an ad Monday in Indiana in which he tries to turn Trump's nickname for him - 'Lyin' Ted' - back on the real estate tycoon.

The ad, titled 'Lying,' features an announcer claiming that 'Donald Trump is lying about Ted Cruz' with respect to the senator's positions on trade, illegal immigration and work visas.

'Trump also had a one-million-dollar judgment against him for hiring illegals,' the ad claims.

'What a phony.'



But Indianans seem to be siding with Trump, giving him a 15-point edge in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released yesterday.

Trump lashed out at Cruz Monday morning, telling DailyMail.com that he disagrees with the Texan's characterization of him earlier in the day as a hateful bully and his base as 'bitter, angry, petty, bigoted people.'

'That is not America. I reject that vision of America,' Cruz told reporters in Indiana after a campaign stop.

'They're not angry,' Trump said of his loyal following. 'They're very disappointed in politicians like him that get a lot of money from special interest groups, and they protect their special interest groups very much to the detriment of the country.'



Trump has faced calls for specifics about how he will 'unify' the Republican Party if he performs well enough in the remaining ten primary elections to claim the GOP's nomination outright.

But the billionaire said he isn't ready to put Cruz on the Supreme Court as a consolation prize - because his 'temperament' might not be suited to the job.

Cruz, once the solicitor general for the Lone Star State, argued nine cases before America's highest court, winning five of them.

'I don't know. I'd have to think about it. That's a big decision,' he told DailyMail.com, saying that he's aware of Cruz's record as a constitutional lawyer.

'But there's a whole question of uniting, and there's a whole question as to temperament. And I'd have to think about it.'

Trump raised Cruz's 'temperament' four separate times while explaining why putting the lawmaker on his Supreme Court short-list wasn't an easy call.

He has said in the past that in order to quell conservatives' concerns about how he would approach Supreme Court appointments, he would release a list of names during the campaign and pledge to to only choose nominees from it.

'He's got a tough temperament for what we're talking about,' Trump said of Cruz. 'You have to be a very, very smart, rational person in my opinion, to be a justice of any kind at a high level or low.'

'You need a proper temperament. And that would be a question that I would have.'



At Shapiro's, Trump projected confidence as the lunch crowd milled around him and asked for autographs and selfies. He signed one man's $50 bill before dining at a table that included campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and nonfiction author Ed Klein.

Asked whether the general election season begins for him on Wednesday, he said: 'Yes, I mean it's sort of already started.'

Citing a new national poll, he added: 'Rasmussen just came out and I'm three points up on Hillary ... and I haven't even started yet.'
