Totally! 

I honestly don't think this is going to be a leg heavy conversation. The whole reason the ANA wanted this breakfast is because they're working to raise money towards their convention package. Everyone coming is going to be wearing their Dem hats and will expect to get DNC talking points on the presidential election and how crazy Trump is. 

They're not expecting 16 rounds on the minutia of a bill about opioid reform. Our ANA contact (Monisha Smith) mentioned Zika and opioids because they've been in the news lately and POTUS has given some high level speeches about it lately. If the issues come up at all, it will be the 9,000 foot view of the issues but I think the majority of the conversation is going to be political gossip and presidential election strategy.

If she's comfortable doing it, I think it's appropriate for her to discuss her fight with cancer. Alternatively, she could mention Obamacare and general healthcare reform and focus on the convention and our upcoming election fights. 

Let me know if you'd like to chat on the phone, too (858) 361-2468.

It's okay. I know all this PAC and leg stuff is new and weirdly intertwined but we have to think about all this crazy ha!
