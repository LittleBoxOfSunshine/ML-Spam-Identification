Ted Cruz to sign up for government health care<http://www.desmoinesregister=
.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/24/ted-cruz-health-insurance-obamacare/703=
84334/>

Des Moines Register // Jennifer Jacobs

Ted Cruz<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential=
/candidates/2015/01/13/ted-cruz-iowa-caucus-candidate-profile/20169965/>, o=
ne of the loudest critics of Obamacare, will soon be using it for health in=
surance coverage.

"We will presumably go on the exchange and sign up for health care and we'r=
e in the process of transitioning over to do that," Cruz, a Republican cand=
idate for president, told The Des Moines Register Tuesday.

Cruz's wife, Heidi, is going on an unpaid leave of up absence from her job =
at Goldman Sachs to join Cruz full time on the campaign trail, Cruz told th=
e Register.

Bloomberg was first to report that Heidi Cruz has taken the leave<http://ww=
w.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-23/cruz-s-wife-heidi-said-to-take-unp=
aid-leave-from-goldman>. CNN noted that Cruz, who has boasted about not nee=
ding to receive government health care benefits,would no longer be covered<=
http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/23/politics/ted-cruz-goldman-sachs-health-care> =
under his wife's health insurance plan.

Cruz confirmed that to the Register.

The exchanges became law under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obama=
care. They're an online marketplace where small businesses, people who carr=
y their own coverage, and the uninsured can buy health insurance.

The public marketplace is the only place where moderate-income Americans ca=
n obtain policies that qualify for Obamacare subsidies. (Poor people can ge=
t Medicaid, which is separate.)

Cruz, as an employee of the government, will use the exchange to choose his=
 employer-provided insurance. Iowa U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley pushed through =
an amendment on the Affordable Care Act that requires members of Congress t=
o obtain their coverage via the exchanges. Congress pays most of the premiu=
m. But Cruz won't be getting any extra benefit under the Affordable Care Ac=
t that a member of Congress wouldn't have gotten before the ACA became law.

Asked if it chafes at all to have to rely on Obamacare, Cruz told the Regis=
ter: "Well, it is written in the law that members will be on the exchanges =
without subsidies just like millions of Americans so that's - I think the s=
ame rules should apply to all of us. Members of Congress should not be exem=
pt."

But, Cruz added, he'd still like to see Obamacare repealed in its entirety.

"And I believe it will be. I believe in 2017 a new president, a Republican =
president will sign legislation repealing every word of it. There are a fai=
r number of Republicans in Washington and elsewhere who have quietly and pr=
ivatively given up on that fight and I have not," he said.
