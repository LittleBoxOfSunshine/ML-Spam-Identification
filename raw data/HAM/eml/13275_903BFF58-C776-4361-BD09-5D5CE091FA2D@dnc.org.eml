Hi Mark,
    I'm emailing you because Luis isn't responding to my query.
    I'm a correspondent for PolitiFact and we're taking another look at our George Clooney ruling<http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/apr/17/george-clooney/george-clooney-decries-big-money-politics-says-mos/> in the wake of today's Politico story<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670> reporting that the money from the Hillary Victory Fund that was supposed to go state Democratic committee is, instead, being sent directly to the DNC.
    We we wrote the Clooney piece, I didn't take the complaints about that seriously because it seemed ridiculous that states would get money to help their local candidates and then turn around and give ALL of it to the DNC. So now there's evidence that they are.
    Can you or someone in the DNC explain what is going on here? Why would a state committee even do that. Please don't tell me this is Clinton money and you have nothing to do with it. You're accepting the funds. You could easily refuse to accept it or turn it back to the states for their House / Senate races?
    At the very least, this gives the appearance that the DNC is benefiting from money raised under false pretenses. Is the party comfortable with that?
    I'm at 401-529-5313 if you would prefer to chat in person.
    Thanks,
    -- Gene Emery
