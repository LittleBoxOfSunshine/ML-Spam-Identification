SL: Trump vs. Trump on Releasing his Tax Returns

Every major presidential candidate since 1976 has made their returns public and, until recently, Donald Trump agreed with that forty-year precedent.  When he first considered running for President in 1999, he said, "I probably wouldn't have a problem releasing my tax returns if I ran." In 2012 he said if you're running for President, "at a minimum, you probably had to show your tax returns" and they should be released by April 1st of the election year.

But, now Trump won't hold himself to those standards. His refusal to release his own tax returns raises questions about what he's hiding. Below is an abridged timeline of Trump's shifting positions over the years.
