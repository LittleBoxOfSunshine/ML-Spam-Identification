Governor Jay Inslee and other Washington Democratic leaders took aim at Don=
ald Trump on the eve of his Washington visit.

=93Your hate is not welcome in our state,=94 said the Governor at a news co=
nference Friday afternoon held at El Centro de la Raza.

=93Donald Trump is running a dangerous campaign. He=92s putting forward dan=
gerous policy proposals, and his dangerous rhetoric is actively harming fam=
ilies today in the state of Washington,=94 he continued.

Governor Inslee was joined by Congressman Adam Smith (D-9th District), alon=
g with Hispanic and Muslim community leaders across Seattle.

=93If he=92s coming to Washington State, we need to stand up and say we don=
=92t want him here, we don=92t want his hate speech anywhere in the United =
States of America,=94 said Rep. Smith.

=93Your hate speech is a crime against our children,=94 said Estela Ortega,=
 Executive Director of El Centro de la Raza.

=93I think what you have to understand is the source. These are people who =
don't want a Republican for President,=94 said State Senator Don Benton of =
Vancouver, Donald Trump=92s State Chair.

Washington State Republican Party Chairman Susan Hutchison accused Governor=
 Inslee of =93pandering to his base.=94

=93He never has and never will support the citizens of this state who want =
to destroy ISIS and fix our economy,=94 says Hutchison.

Chairman Hutchison plans to attend Trump=92s Spokane rally Saturday afterno=
on, and possibly the Lynden event as well.

So does Fernando Mejia, but to protest outside.

Mejia estimates dozens, if not hundreds, of people from King County plan to=
 make the trip north for what they hope will be a peaceful demonstration.

=93In some ways we want to engage with people who are planning on going to =
see Donald Trump and have a dialogue, why do they want to support Donald Tr=
ump when he=92s dividing the country,=94 says Mejia.

=93We want to keep it super peaceful. At the end of the day, we=92re a coun=
try of immigrants and refugees and that=92s the message I want to send,=94 =
he said.

Demonstrators scheduled a =93peacekeeping=94 training Friday evening to lea=
rn how to de-escalate tense situations.

Meanwhile, the campaign is working with secret service, local police and sh=
eriff=92s agencies to keep the area around the fairgrounds safe.

=93We=92re going to work with our local law enforcement to create a secure =
environment that will allow people who want to protest peacefully to have t=
heir say, but also make sure that we=92re taking care of the security of pe=
ople who want to hear Donald Trump speak,=94 said State Senator Doug Ericks=
en (R-Ferndale), working on behalf of the Trump campaign.

Gov. Inslee on Trump: 'Your hate is not welcome in our state=92<http://www.=

/265921543>
by: KIRO 7 Webstaff and The Associated Press

A day before presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump's =
scheduled campaign stops in Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee joined U.S. Rep Ada=
m Smith and community leaders to denounce the candidate's rhetoric as dange=
rous for women and minorities.

During the news conference streamed live on kiro7.com, Inslee said, =93So i=
f you=92re watching this show right now, hear this: Your hate is not welcom=
e in our state.=94

At the news conference, Inslee also said Trump does not share the values of=
 Washington state, such as "compassion, empathy, inclusion and diversity," =
and his visit to Washington prompted him to speak out against the businessm=
an.

"We are going to reject a candidate whose fundamental message is fear and h=
atred," he said.

Trump is scheduled to appear in Lynden Saturday at the Northwest Washington=
 Fair. Click here to learn more and what to expect<http://www.kiro7.com/new=
s/local/trump-in-washington-event-details-still-unclear/263535337>.

He is also scheduled to make a stop in Spokane.

Leaders from the Hispanic, Muslim and other communities stood alongside Ins=
lee at the press conference in North Beacon Hill at El Centro de la Raza in=
 the 2500 block of 16th Avenue South. Speakers highlighted how they believe=
 Trump=92s rhetoric dangerously affects Washington state families.

=93Throughout his campaign, [Trump] has made sexist, Islamophobic, and xeno=
phobic statement that have caused undue hardship to those affected communit=
ies and has put forward discriminatory policies that are deeply inconsisten=
t with Washington state=92s values,=94 a Friday press release reads.

U.S Senator Patty Murray released a statement about Trump=92s visit to Wash=
ington on Thursday.

=93With him, Trump will bring hatred,=94 Murray writes. =93He=92ll bring a =
violent rhetoric that stokes the fears of American families and seeks to di=
vide us at every turn.=94

Voters in Eugene, Oregon are also staging a protest against Trump, The Oreg=
onian says<http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/05/drumpf_in_e=
ugene_counter-prote.html>.

The event, called =93Drumpf in Eugene: Non-Violent Counter-Protest #DumpTru=
mp=94, is scheduled for 5 p.m. Friday, according to a Facebook notice<https=
://www.facebook.com/events/256534374698291/257039801314415/>.


Governor, community groups denounce Trump ahead of his visit to state<http:=
//q13fox.com/2016/05/06/governor-community-groups-denounce-donald-trump/>
by Andrew Padula<http://q13fox.com/author/apadula76/>, Q13 FOX

Gov. Jay Inslee, joined community leaders on Friday to denounce Donald Trum=
p, saying he=92s a dangerous for women, minorities and families.

Inslee and several groups gathered at El Centro de la Raza, a community cen=
ter that advocates for social justice. They voiced their concern about Trum=
p=92s policies and what they call hateful rhetoric.

=93Donald Trump, you will not be allowed to fan the flames of hatred and fe=
ar in our state,=94 Inslee said at the media event Friday.

The governor joined members of the Hispanic and Muslim community, as well a=
s other Democratic Party leaders, to denounce the presumptive Republican pr=
esidential nominee.

=93We are a loving country. We can be and have been a united country but Do=
nald Trump is a divider and he is someone who is running his entire campaig=
n on division and hatred,=94 said David Rolf, president of the Service Empl=
oyees Interantional Union Local 775.

They said they believe Trump=92s views fuel fear in Americans and create mo=
re hate between people. If Trump becomes president, they say, he=92ll set A=
merica back decades.

=93Washington moms are disgusted, dismayed and we know that Washingtonians =
would never, ever elect a president who divides us instead of bringing us t=
ogether,=94 said Kristin Rowe Finkbeiner with the group Mom=92s Rising.

=93We know that unity is what will get us through. We know we=92ll vote for=
 our families. We will vote for American values and we won=92t stand to see=
 our communities torn apart. We are stronger when we stand together and we =
are standing against Donald Trump,=94 said Yasmin Christopher with the orga=
nization One America Votes.

Many of the groups plan to protest Trump's visit to Lynden on Saturday. The=
y said there are already about 50 to 100 people planning to make the 95-mil=
e drive north to Lynden to protest Trump.

While thousands of supporters of Republican presidential hopeful Donald Tru=
mp snatched up tickets<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/schedule/register/lynde=
n-washington/> to a pair of planned rallies Saturday, Washington Gov. Jay I=
nslee and other critics rolled out the unwelcome mat.

In his first campaign trip to Washington, Trump is scheduled to speak at no=
on in Spokane and at 3 p.m. in Lynden, Whatcom County =97 a town of about 1=
3,000 near the Canadian border.

The arrival of the New York billionaire ahead of the May 24 presidential pr=
imary<http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/a-primer-on-the-pri=
mary-ballot/> had law enforcement scrambling to plan security. Protests at =
a Trump rally in California last week turned violent after some demonstrato=
rs reportedly threw rocks<http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-gays-=
for-trump-crowd-gathers-at-costa-mesa-rally-20160428-story.html> and stompe=
d on cars outside the arena.

State Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, a state leader for the Trump campaign=
, said he hopes that won=92t be repeated here.

=93I=92m optimistic that the people of Washington state can show we=92re di=
fferent. Trump supporters should have a right to hear Trump,=94 he said.

But Inslee, a Democrat, joined other critics Friday at Seattle=92s El Centr=
o de la Raza, a Beacon Hill community center, to denounce Trump=92s rhetori=
c as offensive and out of step with the values of Washington state.

During a news conference with groups representing women, immigrants, Muslim=
s and others, Inslee called Trump dangerous and likened him to a schoolyard=
 bully compensating for his own insecurities.

=93I know that Mr. Trump is a millionaire with a million insecurities,=94 I=
nslee said. =93If you are watching this show right now, hear this: Your hat=
e is not welcome in our state.=94

Attendees at the news conference accused Trump of emboldening racists with =
his rhetoric and proposals such as a temporary ban<http://www.cnn.com/2015/=
12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/> on Muslims entering th=
e country.

Varisha Kahn, a student at the University of Washington, said she is a prou=
d Muslim American who has experienced threats herself, including a brick th=
rown through the window of a local mosque.

=93Hate speech leads to hate crimes,=94 she said.

Trump=92s Lynden rally is scheduled to be held outdoors at the Northwest Wa=
shington Fair and Event Center<http://nwwafair.com/>, with a capacity of ab=
out 5,000 people. While Lynden is relatively small, it is not far from the =
college town of Bellingham =97 and protesters from Seattle and elsewhere we=
re making plans to head up Interstate 5.

Authorities in Whatcom County were advising anyone going to the event to he=
ed security requirements.

No firearms, knives of any size, umbrellas, signs, banners or tripods will =
be allowed at the rally, the Whatcom County Sheriff=92s Office said in a ne=
ws release.

The Sheriff=92s Office said attendees will be required to walk through a sc=
reening device similar to those for airport security. Large bags are prohib=
ited and small bags could be searched.

=93A good rule of thumb to follow: Do not bring any items to the event that=
 would not be allowed through screening at an airport checkpoint,=94 the Sh=
eriff=92s Office said.

The Sheriff=92s Office said it is =93not allowed=94 to release specific inf=
ormation about planned security, but said the Secret Service is assisting, =
as is Homeland Security, Lynden police and the Washington State Patrol.

=93We hope those who attend or are in the area during rallies will do their=
 part to ensure civility defines our actions,=94 the Sheriff=92s Office sai=
d.

It also urged people to arrive early and to expect heavy traffic and troubl=
e with parking.

Seattleites bound for the rally may have an especially difficult time getti=
ng through Marysville, where the Washington Department of Transportation sa=
ys Interstate 5 will be limited to two lanes on Saturday for construction a=
t the Ebey Slough Bridge<http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/projects/i5/unionsteamboat=
ebeybridgerpr/>.

The fact that Trump skipped the Seattle area in favor of a more remote loca=
le was greeted as a win by Nicole Grant, executive secretary-treasurer of t=
he M.L. King County Labor Council, one of the groups that vowed major prote=
sts if Trump tried to speak in the area.

=93We feel good. There is not going to be a Donald Trump rally in King Coun=
ty. He saw that the well was poisoned,=94 Grant said.

Trump campaign officials say they were not intimidated at all and did try t=
o organize an event in a hangar at Seattle=92s Boeing Field =97 but that th=
e plan fell through.

Ericksen said =93we had it all lined up=94 but could not get the required p=
ermit from King County, leaving him scrambling to nail down the alternate l=
ocation.

County officials said there was no unfair treatment.

Frank Abe, a spokesman for the King County transportation department, said =
Ericksen had been talking with a private tenant at the airport about holdin=
g his rally in a hangar.

Abe said the tenant was reminded that a detailed security and parking plan =
was required for nonaviation uses of the airport. Such a plan was never sub=
mitted to airport officials, he said.

Airport Director Randall Berg said the county=92s actions were =93absolutel=
y not=94 politically motivated.

Berg said a planned rally of that size is unprecedented on the east side of=
 the airfield and would have been a big logistical problem =97 even before =
considering possible protests outside. He said the tenant, whom he said did=
 not want to be identified, ultimately agreed and did not formally seek a p=
ermit.

Ericksen said he also explored Paine Field in Everett but was unable to agr=
ee on terms there.

A contract to use the fairgrounds in Lynden was finalized Thursday night.

Ericksen shrugged off the challenges. =93Lynden is nicer than Seattle,=94 h=
e said.

Washington state Governor Jay Inslee joined a press conference Friday after=
noon =96 along with minority groups =96 in opposition of Donald Trump=92s v=
isit to the state in order to =93denounce=94 the presumptive Republican nom=
inee for president.

=93My plan to build a wall around Washington to keep Trump out didn=92t wor=
k. And I couldn=92t get Oregon to pay for it,=94 Inslee said at the opening=
 of the press conference.

Inslee was also joined by Congressman Adam Smith.

Trump will make two stops in Washington on Saturday, May 7 =97 one in Spoka=
ne and another in Lynden. Organizations representing Hispanic, Muslims and =
other communities will take part in the press conference to highlight =93ho=
w dangerous Donald Trump=92s hateful rhetoric has been to families across W=
ashington state,=94 according to a press release.

Inslee joins Yasmin Christopher, a board member of One America Votes; Krist=
in Rowe-Finkbeiner, executive director of Moms Rising; Esela Ortega, execut=
ive director of El Centro de la Raza; David Rolf, president of SEIU 775; an=
d Varisha Khan, a student at the University of Washington.

The press release for the press conference states:

Earlier this week, Donald Trump locked up the Republican Presidential nomin=
ation. Throughout his campaign, he has made sexist, Islamophobic, and xenop=
hobic statements that have caused undue hardship to those affected communit=
ies and has put forward discriminatory policies that are deeply inconsisten=
t with Washington state=92s values.

The press release was promoted through the Washington State Democrats commu=
nications department.

1&searchindex=3Dgsa&query=3D%22Adam+Smith%22> and community leaders to deno=
unce the candidate's rhetoric as dangerous for women and minorities.

At a Friday news conference in Seattle, Inslee said Trump does not share th=
e values of Washington state, such as "compassion, empathy, inclusion and d=
iversity," and his visit to Washington prompted him to speak out against th=
e businessman.

"We are going to reject a candidate whose fundamental message is fear and h=
atred," he said.

Trump has two rallies planned in the state on Saturday, but neither will be=
 near liberal Seattle. His first stop is in Spokane at 12 p.m., followed by=
 a 3 p.m. event in Lynden, Whatcom County, just miles from Canadian border.

Inslee is a Democrat, but some Republicans in the state have also criticize=
d Trump, including U.S. Senate<safari-reader://m.seattlepi.com/search/?acti=

d Trump's rhetoric is making Hispanic and Muslim children afraid to attend =
school for fear of backlash. The center advocates for Latinos and social ju=
stice.

"Donald Trump's shameful bigotry, stereotyping and scapegoating, his attack=
 on the character of millions of people is not welcome in Washington State,=
" she said, backed by supporters and signs that read "love trumps hate in W=
ashington."

Trump has proposed a ban on all Muslims from entering the U.S. and says he =
hopes to build a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico if elected.

Republican state Sen. Doug Ericksen<safari-reader://m.seattlepi.com/search/=
?action=3Dsearch&channel=3Dnews&inlineLink=3D1&searchindex=3Dgsa&query=3D%2=

ric harmful for women and minorities is "a ridiculous statement," adding In=
slee's economic policies are hurting people in Washington, not Trump's lang=
uage on the campaign trail.

Ericksen is managing Trump's rally in Lynden and is from nearby Ferndale. H=
e said Trump "respects all people," and is working to support blue collar W=
ashingtonians in the manufacturing business, enforce the country's borders =
and more.

<p>A day before presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump=
's scheduled campaign stops in&nbsp;Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee joined U.S.=
 Rep Adam Smith and community leaders to denounce the candidate's rhetoric =
as dangerous for women and minorities.</p>
<p>During the news conference&nbsp;streamed live on kiro7.com, Inslee said,=
 =93So if you=92re watching this show right now, hear this: Your hate is no=
t welcome in our state.=94&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the news conference, Inslee also said Trump does not share the values=
 of&nbsp;Washington&nbsp;state, such as &quot;compassion, empathy, inclusio=
n and diversity,&quot; and his visit to&nbsp;Washington&nbsp;prompted him t=
o speak out against the businessman.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to reject a candidate whose fundamental message is fe=
ar and hatred,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Trump is scheduled to appear in&nbsp;Lynden&nbsp;Saturday at the Northwe=

de la&nbsp;Raza&nbsp;in the 2500 block of&nbsp;16<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Avenue =
South.&nbsp;Speakers highlighted how they believe Trump=92s rhetoric
 dangerously affects Washington state families.</p>
<p>=93Throughout his campaign, [Trump] has made sexist,&nbsp;Islamophobic, =
and xenophobic statement that have caused undue hardship to those affected =
communities and has put forward discriminatory policies that are deeply inc=

 a Friday press release reads.</p>
<p>U.S Senator Patty Murray released a statement about Trump=92s visit to W=

<p>=93With him, Trump will bring hatred,=94 Murray writes. =93He=92ll bring=

<p>Gov. Jay Inslee, joined community leaders on Friday to denounce Donald T=

<p>Inslee and several groups gathered at El Centro de la Raza, a community =
center that advocates for social justice. They voiced their concern about T=

<p>=93Donald Trump, you will not be allowed to fan the flames of hatred and=
 fear in our state,=94 Inslee said at the media event Friday.</p>
<p>The governor joined members of the Hispanic and Muslim community, as wel=

<p>=93We are a loving country. We can be and have been a united country but=
 Donald Trump is a divider and he is someone who is running his entire camp=

<p>They said they believe Trump=92s views fuel fear in Americans and create=
 more hate between people. If Trump becomes president, they say, he=92ll se=
t America back decades.</p>
<p>=93Washington moms are disgusted, dismayed and we know that Washingtonia=

<p>=93We know that unity is what will get us through. We know we=92ll vote =

we are standing against Donald Trump,=94
 said Yasmin Christopher with the organization One America Votes.</p>
<p>Many of the groups plan to protest Trump's visit to Lynden on Saturday. =
They said there are already about 50 to 100 people planning to make the 95-=

<p>Trump=92s Lynden rally is scheduled to be held outdoors at the <a href=
=3D"http://nwwafair.com/" target=3D"_blank" class=3D"content-link external"=
>
Northwest Washington Fair and Event Center</a>, with a capacity of about 5,=
000 people. While Lynden is relatively small, it is not far from the colleg=
e town of Bellingham =97 and protesters from Seattle and elsewhere were mak=
ing plans to head up Interstate 5.</p>
<p>Authorities in Whatcom County were advising anyone going to the event to=
 heed security requirements.</p>
<p>No firearms, knives of any size, umbrellas, signs, banners or tripods wi=
ll be allowed at the rally, the Whatcom County Sheriff=92s Office said in a=
 news release.</p>
<p>The Sheriff=92s Office said attendees will be required to walk through a=
 screening device similar to those for airport security. Large bags are pro=
hibited and small bags could be searched.</p>
<p>=93A good rule of thumb to follow: Do not bring any items to the event t=

<p>The fact that Trump skipped the Seattle area in favor of a more remote l=
ocale was greeted as a win by Nicole Grant, executive secretary-treasurer o=
f the M.L. King County Labor Council, one of the groups that vowed major pr=
otests if Trump tried to speak in
 the area.</p>
<p>=93We feel good. There is not going to be a Donald Trump rally in King C=

 the plan fell through.</p>
<p>Ericksen said =93we had it all lined up=94 but could not get the require=

<p>County officials said there was no unfair treatment.</p>
<p>Frank Abe, a spokesman for the King County transportation department, sa=
id Ericksen had been talking with a private tenant at the airport about hol=
ding his rally in a hangar.</p>
<p>Abe said the tenant was reminded that a detailed security and parking pl=
an was required for nonaviation uses of the airport. Such a plan was never =
submitted to airport officials, he said.</p>
<p>Airport Director Randall Berg said the county=92s actions were =93absolu=
tely not=94 politically motivated.</p>
<p>Berg said a planned rally of that size is unprecedented on the east side=
 of the airfield and would have been a big logistical problem =97 even befo=
re considering possible protests outside. He said the tenant, whom he said =
did not want to be identified, ultimately
 agreed and did not formally seek a permit.</p>
<p>Ericksen said he also explored Paine Field in Everett but was unable to =
agree on terms there.</p>
<p>A contract to use the fairgrounds in Lynden was finalized Thursday night=

<p>Inslee was also joined by Congressman Adam Smith.</p>
<p>Trump will make two stops in Washington on Saturday, May 7 =97 one in Sp=

 the University of Washington.</p>
<p>The press release for the press conference states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, Donald Trump locked up the Republican Presidential no=
