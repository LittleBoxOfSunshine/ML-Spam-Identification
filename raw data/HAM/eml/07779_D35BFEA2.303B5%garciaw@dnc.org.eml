Also blasty!
Though Hillary Clinton continues to keep the contents of her Wall Street sp=
eeches under wraps, she has, to her credit, released years of tax returns. =
And Mr. Trump, in the past, has been a stalwart advocate of disclosure. On =
Friday the Democratic National Committee released a video<https://www.youtu=
be.com/watch?v=3DjCcO2hQ-g10> of his televised promises, dating back years,=
 to release his returns. The video includes an interview in which he notes =

Donald Trump=92s Evasions on Taxes<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/14/opinio=
n/donald-trumps-evasions-on-taxes.html?ref=3Dtopics>

By THE EDITORIAL BOARD<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorial=
board.html>

American politics has some silly and outdated traditions, but the disclosur=
e of income tax returns by contenders for the presidency isn=92t one of the=
m. Beginning in 1952, candidates have been releasing their returns to assur=
e voters that they have no conflicts of interests, that they are generous t=
o those in need, and that they take their duties as citizens seriously by m=
eeting their tax obligations to the government.

Donald Trump, the de facto Republican presidential nominee, so far has refu=
sed to follow suit. On Friday, he disagreed that Americans have a right to =
see his returns. Asked what his tax rate is during an interview<http://www.=
nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/13/donald-trump-on-his-tax-rate-it=
s-none-of-your-business/> on ABC=92s =93Good Morning America,=94 he snapped=
, =93None of your business.=94

Mitt Romney =97 the 2012 presidential nominee who released his returns afte=
r Mr. Trump and others demanded it =97 points out how little data exists wi=
th which to gauge Mr. Trump=92s fitness for office.

Mr. Trump has no record of military service. He has never held elected offi=
ce. Born wealthy, he took over his father=92s business and built a spotty t=
rack record. Disclosing his returns might enable Mr. Trump to support one o=
f his main claims on the presidency: that he=92s a negotiator so skilled it=
 has made him a billionaire.

Yet Mr. Trump has a history of becoming irate when the subject of his incom=
e taxes comes up and belligerent when journalists have caught him misrepres=
enting his income and charitable contributions. A decade ago Mr. Trump sued=
 one of them, Timothy O=92Brien, an editor at Bloomberg View, for libel.

Mr. Trump lost, but in the course of the suit, he was ordered to provide hi=
s tax returns. He delayed for months, then produced documents so redacted w=
ith black marker that they looked =93like crossword puzzles,=94 Mr. O=92Bri=
en wrote this week<https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-05-12/time-=
for-donald-trump-to-release-his-tax-returns>. Mr. Trump finally produced mo=
re readable returns, but Mr. O=92Brien said he was forbidden by court order=
 to discuss specifics.

Mr. Trump now says he won=92t release his returns because he=92s being audi=
ted. Such concern didn=92t stop President Nixon from releasing several year=
s of returns in 1973 =97 even though the Internal Revenue Service subsequen=
tly determined that the president owed nearly $500,000 in back taxes. (Mr. =
Nixon=92s famous comment, =93I=92m not a crook,=94 didn=92t refer to Waterg=
ate, but to rumors about tax avoidance, which turned out to be accurate.)

Mr. Trump also insists there=92s nothing to learn from his taxes. If that=
=92s the case, why doesn=92t he trust the voters to come to that conclusion=
 themselves?
