Dear A.J.,

President Obama is headlining a roundtable fundraiser in the DC area on Wednesday, May 18th benefitting the DNC.

The Goldbergs attended a roundtable over a year ago.  The format is exactly the same.  Up to 25 guests seated "roundtable style" with briefing from a top Democratic official preceded or followed by one hour discussion with the President.  A candid photo is taken with the President and each guest as he enters the room and greets guests walking around the "table" as he proceeds to his seat.

The money goes to our crucial build for the election this year, with focus on the presidential and down ballot opportunities.  This involves constantly updating and providing our voter file to state parties and Democratic candidates, running an aggressive press/media program, preparing for legal challenges and voting irregularities and funding our convention obligations.

The presidential election year is by far our biggest budget obligation out of the four year cycle since the last presidential election.

Would the Goldbergs be interested in hosting the event at their Maryland home on May 18th?  We are asking any hosts to commit to put together/raise half of the event goal.  This would involve about $350,000 in host commitment.

As you know, individual donors can contribute up to $334,000 to the DNC in a single calendar year.

After their previous gifts this year via HVF, they can each give up to $300,600 directly to the DNC. This benefits the eventual presidential nominee in a major way.

We don't have exact timing yet that day.  We hope to hear from the White House very shortly on exact start time for the event.

Let me know if you need further information. Very sorry for the short notice.  If it is possible to have an answer by earlier tomorrow, that is very helpful.  Thanks to them for any consideration!

All the best,

Andrew
