Yes, these events are indicted by the state parties. This sounds like inter=

See below. Didn't we hear yesterday that the Sanders campaign had accepted =
the result? This headline needs to be changed. This convention was not run =
by the DNC or DNC leaders. It was run by the Nevada Democratic Party.

Chaos At Nevada Democratic Convention; DNC Leaders Flee Building As Sanders=
 Supporters Demand Recount


Adryenn Ashley<https://www.facebook.com/AdryennAshley/videos?fref=3Dphoto> =
posted several live videos (below) from inside the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas=
, where arcane secondary rounds of the delegate selection process of Nevada=
's Democratic caucus erupted into chaos Saturday night. Bernie Sanders supp=
orters demanded 64 rejected pro-Sanders delegates listed in a "minority rep=
ort<https://lasvegassun.com/news/2016/may/14/at-democratic-convention-in-la=
s-vegas-rules-divide/>" prepared by their campaign be allowed to participat=
e in selecting delegates for the national convention.

DNC leaders refused to reconsider their decision not to allow this, adjourn=
ed, and fled the building amid a chorus of boos; leaving hotel security and=
 local police officers to handle the angry Sanders supporters.

Earlier in the day, the Sanders camp objected to several of their delegates=
 being disqualified from voting for administrative reasons<http://www.realc=
learpolitics.com/video/2016/05/15/nevada_democratic_credentials_committee_c=
o-chair_actions_to_exclude_sanders_supporters_violate_the_spirit_of_the_val=
ues_of_our_nation.html>, and booed Sen. Barbara Boxer<http://www.realclearp=
olitics.com/video/2016/05/15/barbara_boxer_to_nevada_democrats_if_you_boo_m=
e_youre_booing_bernie_sanders.html> when she called for unity. "If you're b=
ooing me, you're booing Bernie Sanders," she told them. "Go ahead, boo your=
selves out of this election."

A member of the rules committee called the act of disallowing votes for pur=
ely administrative reasons a violation of the spirit of the values of our n=
ation<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/05/15/nevada_democratic_c=
redentials_committee_co-chair_actions_to_exclude_sanders_supporters_violate=
_the_spirit_of_the_values_of_our_nation.html>.

The longest of Ashley's videos is the most consequential, others posted fur=
ther below:



Sanders supporters are observed considering a sit-in in Ashley's video, but=
 hotel security forced them out, saying "it is now in the hands of the atto=
rneys."

"Please leave peacefully," the security officers said. "Please leave, it is=
 not safe here."

"If we do not leave, it becomes a big issue," said one Sanders supporter. "=
I'm not leaving."

At one point, Ashley loses the video connection, but audio remains. "I don'=
t know if you can see this," she says. "I don't know if you can hear this, =
but there are twenty armed sheriffs here to help them steal the election...=
 They're saying leave now or else."

After minute nine of the above video, Ashley asks someone what is going on:=
 "We've got 620 viewers here, you have nothing to say?"

"The guy that is speaking is not a member of the DNC, he is head of securit=
y for Paris [hotel]. He says he is a dedicated --I don't know if he is a De=
mocrat," someone responds. "But the election process, and please leave. It =
is not safe here. And by it is not safe here, I expect he means all those s=
heriffs at the front of the room... They are asking us to 'leave the privat=
e property at this time.' This should be national news. This needs to be na=
tional news."

Eventually they shut the lights off to get the Sanders supporters out.


The ignored the vote, turned lights off, turn sound WAY up. Truly bullshit.=
 Ignoring our voices. #TeamBernieNV<https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamBernieN=

She garnered more than 1,000 viewers by the end of her twenty-minute livest=

So far this video of a "fight" is the only sign of violence.

Update: "Roberta Lange stole this," said someone named Matt in the comments=
 section of this article, about Chairwoman of the Nevada State Democratic P=
arty & member of the DNC Executive Committee<http://www.realclearpolitics.c=
om/video/2016/05/15/please_smile_nevada_democratic_party_denies_recount_req=
uest_adjourns.html> Roberta Lange: "It was not democracy. We had a motion f=
or Recount on the Floor, Roberta ignored it, and called a motion to adjurn =
the meeting and then Ran out, even though the Nays won it. She did that on =
purpose, she is a crook, and needs to be kicked out of her position as Neva=
da Democratic Chair Woman. I am officially registering as an Independent, I=
 was considering voting Hillary if I had to over Trump, she just changed my=
 mind. She just proved Democrats are Crooks."

Chairwoman of the Nevada State Democratic Party &amp; member of the DNC Exe=
cutive Committee</a> Roberta Lange: &quot;It was not democracy. We had a mo=
tion for Recount on the Floor, Roberta ignored it, and called a motion to a=
djurn the meeting and then Ran out, even
 though the Nays won it. She did that on purpose, she is a crook, and needs=
 to be kicked out of her position as Nevada Democratic Chair Woman. I am of=
ficially registering as an Independent, I was considering voting Hillary if=
 I had to over Trump, she just changed
 my mind. She just proved Democrats are Crooks.&quot;</blockquote>
