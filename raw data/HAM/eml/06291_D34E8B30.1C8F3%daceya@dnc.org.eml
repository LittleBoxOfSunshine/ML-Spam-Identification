My suggestion is that the DNC put out a statement saying that the accusatio=
ns the Sanders campaign are not true.  The fact that CNN notes that you are=
n=92t getting between the two campaigns is the problem.  Here, Sanders is a=
ttacking the DNC and its current practice, its past practice with the POTUS=
 and with Sec Kerry.  Just as the RNC pushes back directly on Trump over =

Jake Tapper: Jeff, is there anything to the Sanders charge of money launder=
ing by the Clinton campaign?
Jeff Zeleny: Well Jake, the term money laundering is definitely strong. The=
re is nothing to that exact phrase. The Clinton campaign believes that the =
Sanders campaign is trying to fire up their own donors here. One official c=
alled it shameful. But there are some concerns from state party officials w=
here their money is. This comes from a joint fundraising account, the Hilla=
ry Victory Fund, it's a joint account that she raises money for her campaig=
n, the national party, the state party. Some of the state parties have not =
seen as much money as they thought they would. Bernie Sanders could be rais=
ing money like this as well. He's decided not to do this. This is just the =
beginning of this here. Some state parties want their money so they can use=
 it for their own local races.

Jeff Zeleny: The rhetoric is not softening much in the campaign at all. Tod=

 money laundering scheme because of the joint fundraising committee they ha=
ve. The Clinton campaign pushed back, saying they're trying to raise money =
off this in closing days of the race. Wolf, you see the crowd in downtown I=

CNN // DAN MERICA
Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaign spent part of Monday fighting o=
ver how much money the front-runner's operation has actually raised for sta=
te parties, with Sanders' campaign charging Clinton with "laundering" donat=
ions. Both Democratic campaigns have signed joint fundraising efforts with =
the Democratic National Committee, allowing the presidential campaigns to r=
aise money for the Democratic committee and a host of state Democratic part=
ies. Because of federal election rules, campaigns are allowed to raise upwa=
rds of $350,000 from individuals for joint fundraising efforts. But Clinton=
 has been the only candidate to use it, raising, according to her campaign,=
 $46 million for the DNC and state parties through the Hillary Victory Fund=
, the Clinton campaign's joint fundraising effort.
=85

The Democratic National Committee has so far declined to get in between the=
 two campaigns. Instead aides have taken to noting that both Sanders and Cl=
inton were offered and signed the same agreement. Under fire from Sanders s=
upporters, Clinton surrogates have cited the joint fundraising effort and t=
he need to help down ballot Democrats as a reason Clinton headlines top-dol=
lar fundraisers. By hitting Clinton for not providing much money to state p=
arties, Sanders' campaign is looking to cut into her ability to explain her=
 appeal. Clinton's campaign, for the first time in 2016, out-raised rival S=
ander's campaign last month, according to their self-reported fundraising n=
umbers. Sanders raised $25.8 million in April -- short of his campaign's ha=
uls of $44 million in March and $43.5 million in February, his campaign sai=
d Sunday.

FOX NEWS //
The Bernie Sanders campaign is accusing Democratic presidential front-runne=
r Hillary Clinton of =93looting=94 money from a joint account meant in part=
 for state parties, the latest brawl between the camps over precious fundra=
ising dollars in the closing weeks of their primary race. The dispute is ov=
er the Hillary Victory Fund, established by Clinton last summer and compris=
ing her presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee and 32 sta=
te party committees. The joint effort so far has raised $61 million, but on=
ly 1 percent ultimately stayed in state party accounts, according to an ana=
lysis by Politico of federal election records. The analysis, which was chal=
lenged by the Clinton campaign, said the fund had transferred $3.8 million =
to the state parties, then quickly transferred $3.3 million of the money to=
 the DNC.
=85

Schwerin also said the operations are being run jointly by the DNC and stat=
e parties =93to elect progressives across the country in November." To be s=
ure, raising money may become more challenging as the campaigns drag on -- =
and when the prevailing candidate shifts to a general election battle. The =
Sanders campaign, for example, reportedly raised $25.8 million in April, do=
wn from $44 million in March and $43.5 million in February. Clinton reporte=
dly raised $26.4 million last month. The Sanders campaign signed a similar =
joint-fundraising agreement with the DNC that appears largely inactive. How=
ever, he has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars through his donor list=
 for several progressive House candidates, according to Politico. This is n=
ot the first time the Sanders campaign has accused the Clinton camp of fund=
raising shenanigans. Last month, the campaign sent an open letter to the DN=
C accusing the Clinton campaign of "apparent violations" in fundraising.

POLITICO // KENNETH P. VOGEL AND ISAAC ARNSDORF
The victory fund has transferred $3.8 million to the state parties, but alm=
ost all of that cash ($3.3 million, or 88 percent) was quickly transferred =
to the DNC, usually within a day or two, by the Clinton staffer who control=
s the committee, POLITICO=92s analysis of the FEC records found. By contras=
t, the victory fund has transferred $15.4 million to Clinton=92s campaign a=
nd $5.7 million to the DNC, which will work closely with Clinton=92s campai=
gn if and when she becomes the party=92s nominee. And most of the $23.3 mil=
lion spent directly by the victory fund has gone toward expenses that appea=
r to have directly benefited Clinton=92s campaign, including $2.8 million f=
or =93salary and overhead=94 and $8.6 million for web advertising that most=
ly looks indistinguishable from Clinton campaign ads and that has helped Cl=
inton build a network of small donors who will be critical in a general ele=
ction expected to cost each side well in excess of $1 billion.
=85

=93It=92s a one-sided benefit,=94 said an official with one participating s=
tate party. The official, like those with several other state parties, decl=
ined to talk about the arrangement on the record for fear of drawing the ir=
e of the DNC and the Clinton campaign. In fact, the DNC, which has pushed b=
ack aggressively on charges that it is boosting Clinton at the expense of o=
ther Democrats, has advised state party officials on how to answer media in=
quiries about the arrangement, multiple sources familiar with the interacti=
ons told POLITICO. =93The DNC has given us some guidance on what they=92re =
saying, but it=92s not clear what we should be saying,=94 said the official=
. =93I don=92t think anyone wants to get crosswise with the national party =
because we do need their resources. But everyone who entered into these agr=
eements was doing it because they were asked to, not because there are imme=
diately clear benefits.=94 Some fundraisers who work for state parties pred=
ict that the arrangement could actually hurt participating state parties. T=
hey worry that participating states that aren=92t presidential battleground=
s and lack competitive Senate races could see very little return investment=
 from the DNC or Clinton=92s campaign, and are essentially acting as money =
laundering conduits for them. And for party committees in contested states,=
 there=92s another risk: They might find themselves unable to accept cash f=
rom rich donors whose checks to the victory fund counted toward their $10,0=
00 donation limit to the state party in question =97 even if that party nev=
er got to spend the cash because it was transferred to the DNC.
=85

But Schwerin did not respond to follow-up questions about how much of the $=
700,000 in victory fund transfers to the state parties was subsequently tra=
nsferred to the DNC. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach pointed out that the na=
tional party committee =93offered to engage in the same joint fundraising e=
fforts with all the major presidential candidates early in the cycle, and w=
e welcome the efforts of the candidates to help raise money for the DNC and=
 state parties now to ensure we can build out the infrastructure to win in =
November.=94 Sanders' campaign late last year signed a joint fundraising ag=
reement with the DNC, but the committee has been largely inactive. Instead,=
 after Sanders was chided by Clinton allies for not helping down-ballot Dem=
ocrats, he sent out appeals to his vaunted email list that helped raise hun=
dreds of thousands of dollars for a trio of progressive House candidates, w=
ho got to keep all the cash.

THE ATLANTIC // CLARE FORAN
Just when it looked like Bernie Sanders might be poised to tone down his cr=
iticism of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate signaled =
he won=92t shy away from a fight. The Sanders campaign escalated its condem=
nation of the Clinton campaign=92s fundraising methods on Monday, seizing o=
n a Politico report to accuse Clinton of =93looting funds meant for the sta=
te parties to skirt fundraising limits on her presidential campaign.=94 The=
 charge highlights a broader divide between the rival candidates. Clinton h=
as worked to strengthen the institutional machinery of the Democratic Party=
. Her efforts have funneled money into national and state party committees =
in ways that are likely to build up permanent party infrastructure. Sanders=
, on the other hand, has run a campaign that privileges purity tests above =
party loyalty, and individuals above institutions. He has elevated the prof=
ile of a select pool of progressive Democratic candidates fighting for elec=
tion to Congress, and cultivated a grassroots network of intensely-devoted =
small-dollar donors. The trigger for the Sanders campaign=92s most recent c=
riticism was a deep dive from Politico into the inner-workings of the Hilla=
ry Victory Fund, a fundraising venture for the Clinton campaign, the Democr=
atic National Committee, and 32 state Democratic parties. It found that sta=
te parties have retained less than 1 percent of $61 million raised by the a=
rrangement. The article also cited allegations from state fundraisers that =
some of the state parties are effectively =93acting as money laundering con=
duits=94 for the DNC and the Clinton campaign.
=85

The DNC refuted the possibility of any wrongdoing. =93The suggestion there=
=92s anything unusual about our joint victory funds has no basis in the law=
 or reality, as recognized by numerous independent experts that have looked=
 at this,=94 Luis Miranda, a DNC spokesperson said in a statement. The Clin=
ton campaign, meanwhile, emphasized its work in support of Democrats nation=
wide. =93Helping Democrats win up and down the ballot is a top priority for=
 Hillary Clinton,=94 Josh Schwerin, a campaign spokesperson, said in a stat=
ement, =93which is why she=92s raised more than $46 million for the DNC and=
 state parties across the country.=94 He added that =93funds raised through=
 the Hillary Victory Fund are now being used to fund and staff organizing p=
rograms in Ohio, Virginia, Florida and states across the country.=94 Settin=
g spin aside, there are advantages and risks to both strategies. Clinton ho=
pes to strengthen the Democratic Party, and her fundraising strategy stands=
 to bolster party infrastructure. The DNC acts as a gatekeeper for a host o=
f resources that state parties can tap into, ranging from its voter databas=
e to research and press operations. There=92s a strategic case to be made f=
or the DNC determining how to allocate dollars nationwide given that not ev=
ery state will be a general election battleground, among other consideratio=
ns. For Clinton, the approach appears to reflect faith in the ability of th=
e current political system to achieve results, as long as resources are ava=
ilable. But the fundraising has opened up the campaign to charges that it e=
xploited campaign-finance law. To critics, the effort is sure to register a=
s yet another indication of the candidate=92s coziness with the political e=
stablishment.

BUSINESS INSIDER // MAXWELL TANI
Sen. Bernie Sanders is planning on taking his presidential bid all the way =
to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this summer. And it l=
ooks like his rhetorical shots at Democratic presidential rival Hillary Cli=
nton will go with him. Leading up to Indiana's primary on Tuesday, Sanders =
has proved more than willing to continue drawing contrasts with Clinton on =
major issues. During a Monday campaign rally in Indiana, Sanders reiterated=
 his usual attacks on Clinton's campaign-finance structure, pausing for boo=
s and cracking jokes about Clinton's private speeches to Goldman Sachs. "We=
 said, 'Hell no' to super PACs. We don't represent Wall Street or the billi=
onaire class," Sanders said.
=85

On Monday, the Sanders campaign and the Republican National Committee blast=
ed out to reporters a Politico story within four minutes of each other. The=
 story said that the Clinton campaign has benefited massively from the mone=
y it has raised for Democratic state parties, which have received comparati=
vely little in return. "Secretary Clinton has exploited the rules in ways t=
hat let her high-dollar donors like Alice Walton of Walmart fame and the ac=
tor George Clooney and his super-rich Hollywood friends skirt legal limits =
on campaign contributions," Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said. He a=
dded an apparent reference to a line from the Politico story that quoted st=
ate-party fundraisers as worrying that they were "essentially acting as mon=
ey laundering conduits" for Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. =
"If Secretary Clinton can't raise the funds needed to run in a competitive =
primary without resorting to laundering, how will she compete against Donal=
d Trump in a general election?" he said.

Hillary Clinton is looking to seal the deal and clinch the democratic presi=

without a fight. Bernie sanders: =93Let us tomorrow have the biggest turnou=
t in Indiana history!=94 Bernie sanders is firing up voters today across In=
diana. He=92s asking democrats to put the brakes on Hillary Clinton=92s mar=
ch to the nomination. But she=92s already moving on. Hillary Clinton: =93we=
 cannot let Barack Obama=92s legacy fall into Donald Trump=92s hands.=94 On=
 the eve of the Indiana primary, Clinton is looking ahead, to a fall match-=
up with trump and to primary contests down the line.
=85

That fight is getting harder =96 and his battle to win the nomination more =
uphill. Clinton is about 200 delegates shy of the magic number of 2,383. Sa=
nders needs nearly 5 times that many pledged and super delegates. The Sande=
rs campaign is digging in today accusing Clinton of running a money-launder=
ing scheme. Citing a politico report that only one percent of the 61 millio=
n dollars raised through the Hillary victory fund to help other democrats i=
s actually going to state parties. The Clinton campaign dismissing the atta=
ck as desperation. Trump is following sanders=92 words carefully =96 and pl=
ans to use them against Clinton. Donald Trump: =93Bernie sanders said she s=
houldn=92t be allowed to run, that she=92s not capable.  And, you know, wha=
t he said is incredible.  It=92s a sound bite.=94 We asked sanders whether =
that bothered him.

 Some of the state parties have not seen as much money as they thought they=

 donations. Both Democratic campaigns have signed joint fundraising efforts=
 with the Democratic National Committee, allowing the presidential campaign=
s to raise money for the Democratic committee and a host of state Democrati=
c parties. Because of federal election
 rules, campaigns are allowed to raise upwards of $350,000 from individuals=
 for joint fundraising efforts. But Clinton has been the only candidate to =

aides have taken to noting that both Sanders and Clinton were offered and s=
igned the same agreement. Under fire
 from Sanders supporters, Clinton surrogates have cited the joint fundraisi=
ng effort and the need to help down ballot Democrats as a reason Clinton he=
adlines top-dollar fundraisers. By hitting Clinton for not providing much m=
oney to state parties, Sanders'
 campaign is looking to cut into her ability to explain her appeal. Clinton=
's campaign, for the first time in 2016, out-raised rival Sander's campaign=
 last month, according to their self-reported fundraising numbers. Sanders =
raised $25.8 million in April --

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black">The Bernie Sanders campa=
ign is accusing Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton of =93=
looting=94 money from a joint account meant in part for state parties, the =
latest brawl between the camps over precious
 fundraising dollars in the closing weeks of their primary race. The disput=
e is over the Hillary Victory Fund, established by Clinton last summer and =
comprising her presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee and=
 32 state party committees. The
 joint effort so far has raised $61 million, but only 1 percent ultimately =
stayed in state party accounts, according to an analysis by Politico of fed=
eral election records. The analysis, which was challenged by the Clinton ca=
mpaign, said the fund had transferred
 $3.8 million to the state parties, then quickly transferred $3.3 million o=
f the money to the DNC.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black">Schwerin also said the o=

ogressives across the country in November.&quot; To be sure, raising money =
may become more challenging as the campaigns
 drag on -- and when the prevailing candidate shifts to a general election =
battle. The Sanders campaign, for example, reportedly raised $25.8 million =
in April, down from $44 million in March and $43.5 million in February. Cli=
nton reportedly raised $26.4 million
 last month. The Sanders campaign signed a similar joint-fundraising agreem=
ent with the DNC that appears largely inactive. However, he has raised hund=
reds of thousands of dollars through his donor list for several progressive=
 House candidates, according to
 Politico. This is not the first time the Sanders campaign has accused the =
Clinton camp of fundraising shenanigans. Last month, the campaign sent an o=
pen letter to the DNC accusing the Clinton campaign of &quot;apparent viola=
tions&quot; in fundraising.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

n=92s campaign if and when she becomes
 the party=92s nominee. And most of the $23.3 million spent directly by the=
 victory fund has gone toward expenses that appear to have directly benefit=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black">=93It=92s a one-sided be=

, like those with several other state parties, declined to talk about the a=
rrangement on the record for fear of drawing
 the ire of the DNC and the Clinton campaign. In fact, the DNC, which has p=
ushed back aggressively on charges that it is boosting Clinton at the expen=
se of other Democrats, has advised state party officials on how to answer m=
edia inquiries about the arrangement,
 multiple sources familiar with the interactions told POLITICO. =93The DNC =
has given us some guidance on what they=92re saying, but it=92s not clear w=

reements was doing it because they were asked to, not because there are imm=

dict that the arrangement could actually
 hurt participating state parties. They worry that participating states tha=
t aren=92t presidential battlegrounds and lack competitive Senate races cou=
ld see very little return investment from the DNC or Clinton=92s campaign, =
and are essentially acting as money
 laundering conduits for them. And for party committees in contested states=
, there=92s another risk: They might find themselves unable to accept cash =
from rich donors whose checks to the victory fund counted toward their $10,=

transfers to the state parties was subsequently transferred to the DNC. DNC=
 spokesman Mark Paustenbach pointed
 out that the national party committee =93offered to engage in the same joi=
nt fundraising efforts with all the major presidential candidates early in =
the cycle, and we welcome the efforts of the candidates to help raise money=
 for the DNC and state parties now
 to ensure we can build out the infrastructure to win in November.=94 Sande=

NC, but the committee has been largely inactive. Instead, after Sanders was=
 chided by Clinton allies for not
 helping down-ballot Democrats, he sent out appeals to his vaunted email li=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black">Just when it looked like=
 Bernie Sanders might be poised to tone down his criticism of Hillary Clint=
on, the Democratic presidential candidate signaled he won=92t shy away from=
 a fight. The Sanders campaign escalated
 its condemnation of the Clinton campaign=92s fundraising methods on Monday=
, seizing on a Politico report to accuse Clinton of =93looting funds meant =
for the state parties to skirt fundraising limits on her presidential campa=
ign.=94 The charge highlights a broader
 divide between the rival candidates. Clinton has worked to strengthen the =
institutional machinery of the Democratic Party. Her efforts have funneled =
money into national and state party committees in ways that are likely to b=
uild up permanent party infrastructure.
 Sanders, on the other hand, has run a campaign that privileges purity test=
s above party loyalty, and individuals above institutions. He has elevated =
the profile of a select pool of progressive Democratic candidates fighting =
for election to Congress, and cultivated
 a grassroots network of intensely-devoted small-dollar donors. The trigger=
 for the Sanders campaign=92s most recent criticism was a deep dive from Po=
litico into the inner-workings of the Hillary Victory Fund, a fundraising v=
enture for the Clinton campaign, the
 Democratic National Committee, and 32 state Democratic parties. It found t=
hat state parties have retained less than 1 percent of $61 million raised b=
y the arrangement. The article also cited allegations from state fundraiser=
s that some of the state parties
 are effectively =93acting as money laundering conduits=94 for the DNC and =
the Clinton campaign.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"color:black">The DNC refuted the poss=
ibility of any wrongdoing. =93The suggestion there=92s anything unusual abo=
ut our joint victory funds has no basis in the law or reality, as recognize=
d by numerous independent experts that have
 looked at this,=94 Luis Miranda, a DNC spokesperson said in a statement. T=
he Clinton campaign, meanwhile, emphasized its work in support of Democrats=
 nationwide. =93Helping Democrats win up and down the ballot is a top prior=
ity for Hillary Clinton,=94 Josh Schwerin,
 a campaign spokesperson, said in a statement, =93which is why she=92s rais=
ed more than $46 million for the DNC and state parties across the country.=
=94 He added that =93funds raised through the Hillary Victory Fund are now =
being used to fund and staff organizing programs
 in Ohio, Virginia, Florida and states across the country.=94 Setting spin =
aside, there are advantages and risks to both strategies. Clinton hopes to =
strengthen the Democratic Party, and her fundraising strategy stands to bol=
ster party infrastructure. The DNC
 acts as a gatekeeper for a host of resources that state parties can tap in=
to, ranging from its voter database to research and press operations. There=
=92s a strategic case to be made for the DNC determining how to allocate do=
llars nationwide given that not every
 state will be a general election battleground, among other considerations.=
 For Clinton, the approach appears to reflect faith in the ability of the c=
urrent political system to achieve results, as long as resources are availa=
ble. But the fundraising has opened
 up the campaign to charges that it exploited campaign-finance law. To crit=
ics, the effort is sure to register as yet another indication of the candid=
ate=92s coziness with the political establishment.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
