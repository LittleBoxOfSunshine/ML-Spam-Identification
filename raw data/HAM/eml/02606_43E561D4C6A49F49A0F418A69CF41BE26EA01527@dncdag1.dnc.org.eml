Hi all - A few of these to send from the First Lady next week. Let me know if you have any flags, and thanks!

-v1(EJB)-
Sender: Michelle Obama
Subject:

Friend-

No matter how full Barack's plate gets, he always makes time for reading letters from folks like you. And when he can, he writes back, because he knows who he serves.

And thanks to supporters like you, we've been able to accomplish so much on behalf of so many. When I look around and see just how far we've come in the past seven and a half years, I'm truly amazed by the steps forward we've made on everything from health care to higher education to making sure we're leaving the planet a little better off than we found it for our children and grandchildren.

All of that is because folks like you stood up for what you believed in and dug deep to help us cross this finish line. I know if he had the time, Barack would write a personal thank you note to each and every one of you. Because that is how we got to where we are today. So this is my way of offering our thanks from the bottom of our hearts.

Our work isn't done yet, and so much will hang in the balance of this upcoming election, but I know that with supporters like you fighting the good fight, we're going to continue to build on this progress and see even more amazing things to come.

If you're ready to stand up again and help us get there this November, add your name with mine:

LINK

Thank you again, NAME.

Michelle


-v2(CH)--
Sender: Michelle Obama
Subject:

Thank you so much, NAME. Really.

I know I say that often, but it's because I mean it. When I think about what folks like you have come together to accomplish over the past seven and a half years, my heart feels so full. We've come so far and done so much, and it's absolutely because you've been on the front lines fighting for the change we believe in, change that truly makes a difference in people's lives.

Our kids and grandkids are more likely to grow up in a world where their only limits are how big they're willing to dream and how hard they're willing to work. They'll inherit a country with a growing economy, with opportunity to explore affordable higher educations options, with the chance to get a start in life without the overwhelming burden of health insurance costs because mom and dad can cover them for a few more years.

And it's worth pointing out, NAME: There are some folks who thought we'd never see this day. But your tenacity and your unwavering commitment to forming a more perfect union are what carried us through the most difficult parts of this journey. And I'm so proud be able to say I was there working with you.

Right now, the next chapter of our country is entirely in your hands, NAME. And I have total faith that you'll do great things because I've seen what you can do.

But this moment is all about celebrating you, because you are the reason we've made it this far, and the reason we'll keep doing the work that matters to make a difference.

So, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so, so much.

Michelle

P. S. - The first step in continuing this fight long after Barack and the girls and I have left the White House is by electing leaders who want to fight with us. Add your name if you're ready to do whatever it takes between now and November 8th to make sure we do it:

LINK


-v3(JGR)-
Sender: Michelle Obama
Subject:

I write to you a lot, NAME, for so many different reasons. Sometimes I'm asking you to make a contribution to help get more Democrats elected across the country. Sometimes I'm asking you to take a stand against the Republicans who want to take Barack's place in the Oval Office and undo all our hard work. But today, I want to say something else:

Thank you.

It goes unsaid too often by too many people, and I want to make sure I never ever forget to thank you for your commitment to Barack, and to this movement and the change we're creating together. Because at the end of the day, that's what this has all been about -- change we truly believe in, and change that we fight for. I'm so grateful that you're on this team, fighting for our values, and fighting to improve the lives of millions of Americans. And I can't tell you enough how much it means that you've stood by us for all these years, and that you're going to continue to stand up for what we believe in long after Barack has left office.

I know our work doesn't end when the next president steps into the White House, and I know you'll keep pushing this country forward with your passion and your commitment to our Democratic values of equality and opportunity for all. So today, add your name next to mine to say you're ready for what's next:

LINK

Once again: Thank you, NAME.

Michelle
