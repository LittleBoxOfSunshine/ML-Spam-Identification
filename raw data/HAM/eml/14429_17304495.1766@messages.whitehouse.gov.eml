 Around 30 guests entered the room including Secretary John Kerry , Natio=
nal Security Advisor Susan Rice and assistant Secretary for Europran Affa=
irs Victoria Nuland . Other guests were part of the Nordic delegations an=
d ambassadors .=20

the right side of the foyer . The order of the seating next to FlOTUS fro=
m her left were Finland , Norway , Sweden , Denmark , and Iceland.=20

lateral organizations to bring peace and stability in conflict zones .
POTUS emphasis was on common values , like democracy and human rights , f=
ree market and trade .

He said that Nordic counties have the least income inequality gap in  the=
 world .

Since there are 5 head of states , POTUS illustrated the good nature of t=
he Nordic leaders to demonstrate cooperation by allowing few of them to s=
peak during the day .

President of Finland spoke first , also making jokes about the weather . =
He said that the flags lining up Pennsylvania Avenue "warmed  up his hear=

 not military as he said but in terms of what they collectively contribut=
e to the world in the field of technology , environmental protection , ed=
ucation , culture , multilateral organizations . "We are champions of mod=
esty ". He said .

He added that the Baltic region is tense and he relies on the United Stat=
es and willing to work with the US to bring about stability . He mentione=
d Russia in terms of cooperation and risk .

The Norwegian PM also spoke , she joked that  POTUS are in his final mont=
hs and therefore the state dinner reserved ( the last for the best ).

She too talked about security cooperation after 9/11 and in the fight aga=
inst ISIS .she said that the Atlantic united us and doesn't separate us i=
n terms of trade .=20
