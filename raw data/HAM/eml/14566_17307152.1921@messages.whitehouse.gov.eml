Subject: Travel pool #6

Pool moved to site of the state luncheon immediately after the press conf=
erence, at 1:50pm.

We entered the room where the luncheon is being held at 1:59pm. The round=
 tables and chairs were draped with cream-colored linens. There were yell=
ow, green and white flower arrangements in the center of the tables, cand=
les and gold trimmed place settings. Also red wine.

POTUS and President Quang were seated next to each other at a long rectan=
gular table in the front of the room their backs were to us. Susan Rice, =
Secretary Kerry and Mike Froman were also seated there.

The American national anthem played.

Mr. Quang spoke first from a podium in front of the rectangular table it =
faced the rest of the room. It was elaborately decorated with sunflowers =
and a whole lot of other flowers. Behind the podium were 9 very large flo=
wer arrangements of red and yellow roses, as well as American and Vietnam=
ese flags.

Mr. Quang said POTUS's visit marks "another crucial milestone in our bila=
teral relationship," while noting "differences remain" in the relationshi=
p. He said he's grateful for America's effort to put behind them the Viet=
nam War.

He toasted to POTUS's good health, US-Vietnam relations.

POTUS appeared to have rose in his wine glass for the toasts.

Mr. Obama spoke next. He thanked American and Vietnamese veterans of the =
Vietnam War, including Secretary Kerry. He also thanked them for helping =
the two countries reconcile. He said they had the courage to fight but "m=
ore importantly to make peace."

"Today Vietnam and America show the world that hearts can change and peac=
e is possible," Mr. Obama said.

He toasted to the perseverance and hopes of the Vietnamese people, and th=
e strength and endurance of the partnership between the US and Vietnam.

Then he clinked glasses with those at the head table.

Pool was ushered out and is holding.
