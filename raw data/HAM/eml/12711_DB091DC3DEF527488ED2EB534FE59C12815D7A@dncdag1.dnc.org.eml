SL: Holding Trump Accountable on Tax Returns

"Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell probably won't hold Trump accountable today for all his empty promises, including his pledge to release his tax returns, but voters certainly will. The American people ought to know whether Trump has been paying his fair share and how much he would benefit from his own reckless tax plan." - DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach

Every major presidential candidate since 1976 has made their returns public and, until recently, Donald Trump agreed to continue that forty-year practice.  When he first considered running for President in 1999, he said he, "probably wouldn't have a problem with" releasing his tax returns if he ran. In 2012 he said if you're running for President, "at a minimum, probably, you're going to have to show your tax returns" and they should be released by April 1st of the election year.

But, now Trump won't hold himself to his own standards. His refusal to release his tax returns raises questions about what he's hiding. Below is an abridged timeline of Trump's shifting positions over the years.

"Donald Trump saw what happened to Mitt Romney when the American people learned he paid<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/mitt-romney-made-42-million-paid-14-percent/story?id=15423615> just 14 percent in taxes on over $40 million in earnings over two years, it proved he just didn't understand hardworking Americans.  This isn't primary season anymore, Donald Trump has to be held accountable and the American people should know whether the reality TV mogul pays less in taxes than middle-class families. If Donald Trump can't be trusted now, he can't be trusted to have the judgment and temperament the American people expect of a pPresident." - Luis Miranda, DNC Communications Director
