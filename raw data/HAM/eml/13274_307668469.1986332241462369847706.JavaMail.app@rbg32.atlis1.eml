Hello!
=20
I got bumped from The Diane Rehm show this morning due to breaking news. Th=
e producer sent me this note: &ldquo;Hi Jennifer, We are switching shows fo=
r tomorrow because of Cruz dropping out of the race and Sen. Sanders winnin=
g Indiana. So you are off the hook for tomorrow. Hopefully we will reschedu=
le soon. Thanks for understanding.&quot;

I really hope they will reschedule soon because thousands of people with di=
sabilities are being held against their will in nursing homes http://links.=
grassrootstargeting.mkt7273.com/ctt?kn=3D36&ms=3DMjU0MDQxNjcS1&r=3DMjI2MzE1=
OTQzOTEyS0&b=3D2&j=3DODAwNzE2MTcxS0&mt=3D1&rt=3D0 and other institutions. I=
t&rsquo;s not just happening in South Dakota, where the Department of Justi=
ce is rightfully asking serious questions. It&rsquo;s happening all over. T=
hese people with disabilities did not do anything wrong -- so why are they =
essentially imprisoned?
=20
It's partially because of ABLEISM. That's when people think that people who=
 have disabilities are somehow less human/less valuable than people without=
 disabilities. That is why some people think it's alright to take away an i=
ndividual with a disabilities' right to choose where they live and who they=
 live with. But it&rsquo;s not alright and it needs to stop. Not only is it=
 right to enable people to be able to stay in their own homes and communiti=
es as long as possible the right thing to do, it is usually much LESS EXPEN=
SIVE than putting people in 24 hour a day staffed nursing facilities. So wh=
at has been going on &ndash; putting thousands of people with disabilities =
(including young people with disabilities) in nursing homes - is a triple c=
rime against decency. It robs people with disabilities of their basic right=
s and dignity, it robs their loved ones of their presence, and it costs tax=
payers way more money.

gration Act http://links.grassrootstargeting.mkt7273.com/ctt?kn=3D16&ms=3DM=

much of last week at the White House working with Valerie Jarrett, Attorney=
 General Lynch and many others on criminal justice reform. We are working t=
o bring in the disability lens to that moving public policy issue. Did you =
know that 32% of people in federal prison and 40% of people in jail have di=
sabilities? In terms of mental health, the majority of inmates have those i=
ssues when they leave incarceration. We sent a memo to the White House on t=
hese issues, and are currently working on a white paper on this subject whi=
ch I will send you when it is completed.

We are doing events at the political conventions and I will send you inform=
