DNC Chair Statement on Tonight=92s Primaries in Nebraska and West Virginia

WASHINGTON-  DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following s=
tatement:

 =93Donald Trump is the Republican Party, and tonight=92s primaries didn=92=
t do anything to change that fact. That=92s why Republican leaders across t=
he country are tearing out their hair trying to decide between standing wit=
h the dangerous and reckless candidate at the top of their ticket, or ditch=
ing him and their own upcoming convention in a desperate move to save face.

=93Today, Ted Cruz refused to throw his support behind Trump, adding his na=
me to the growing list of GOP leaders distancing themselves from the party=
=92s nominee =96 a list that includes former presidential candidates Mitt R=
omney and John McCain, and the entire Bush family, who all said they won=92=
t attend their own convention this year. That division at the top is tearin=
g apart the Republican Party all the way down to the grass roots. In exit p=
olls today, just ten percent of Republican voters in West Virginia and thre=
e percent in Nebraska said they think their party is united.

=93By contrast, Democrats are proud of our candidates, who continue to run =
substantive campaigns worthy of the American people, and who understand tha=
t there=92s more that unites us than divides us. As we gear up for the gene=
ral election, we=92re doing it with the confidence that our candidates and =
our party have the right ideas to build on the progress of the last seven y=
ears under President Obama. We=92ve seen a record 74 straight months of pri=
vate sector job growth, more than 14 million new jobs, and 20 million peopl=
e have health care who didn=92t before. We must elect a Democrat as our nex=
t president to keep America on track.=94
