DNC Talking Points: Democrats Overwhelmingly United

Polls continue to show that Democrats are overwhelmingly united and excited=
 about both of our candidates.
By and large we=E2=80=99ve had a great primary, with substantive candidates=
 whose vision to move America forward lines up with the values of the Ameri=
can people.

And we=E2=80=99re going to come out of our convention more unified and stro=
nger than ever, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with th=
eir dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their p=
arty.

Just look at the new poll today from CBS/New York Times:



=C2=B7         A new CBS/NYT poll<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/0=
5/19/us/politics/poll-presidential-race.html?version=3Dmeter+at+0&contentId=
=3D&mediaId=3D&referrer=3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&priority=3Dtrue&a=
ction=3Dclick&contentCollection=3DPolitics&module=3DRelatedCoverage&region=
=3DEndOfArticle&pgtype=3Darticle> shows that Democrats are more united toda=
y than in May of 2008, disproving the myth of Democratic disunity heading i=
nto the 2016 election.


*  =C2=B7         The poll showed that more than 80 percent of Democrats wo=
uld vote for either Secretary Clinton or Senator Sanders in the general ele=
ction. According to an accompanying story in the New York Times, =E2=80=9CD=
emocratic resistance is less widespread than it was in the 2008 primary. Wh=
ile 72 percent of Mr. Sanders=E2=80=99s supporters say they would vote for =
Mrs. Clinton this fall, a Times/CBS News survey taken in early May 2008 fou=
nd that only 60 percent of Mrs. Clinton=E2=80=99s supporters said they woul=
d vote for Barack Obama in the general election.=E2=80=9D [Note: neither th=
e New York Times story nor the poll itself provided what percentage of Secr=
etary Clinton=E2=80=99s supporters would vote for Senator Sanders if he bec=
ame the nominee]


=C2=B7         Furthermore, the poll shows that 80 percent of Democrats are=
 =E2=80=9Cmostly hopeful=E2=80=9D about the future of the Democratic Party,=
 as opposed to Republicans, who are split 55%-43% between =E2=80=9Cmostly h=
opeful=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cmostly discouraged=E2=80=9D about the future o=
f the Republican Party.

This echoes what we=E2=80=99ve seen in exit poll after exit poll after exit=
 poll:

Indiana<http://fortune.com/2016/05/03/exit-polls-from-indiana-democrats-are=
-excited-republicans-are-divided/>:



=C2=B7         Three-quarters of Democrats in the state say they=E2=80=99ve=
 been energized by the nomination contest between former Secretary of State=
 Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But nearly 6 in 10 Republ=
icans say they think their party has been divided by the battle being fough=
t by billionaire Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasic=
h.
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut<http://www.wsj.com/articles/voters-have=
-strong-views-on-gop-convention-1461716342>:



=C2=B7         Democratic voters, unlike Republicans, said the primary seas=
on had energized their party. Two-thirds or more of Democrats who cast ball=
ots in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut said their party was more ene=
rgized, while less than one-third said it was divided, exit polls showed.

New York<http://elections.ap.org/content/ny-exit-poll-heated-primaries-ener=
gize-dems-divide-gop>:



=C2=B7         Almost 6 in 10 New York Republican voters say their party ha=
s been divided by the nomination process, while only 3 in 10 Democratic vot=
ers say the same about their party's primaries. Less than 4 in 10 GOP voter=
s say they've been energized, exit polls show, compared with two-thirds of =
Democratic voters who say that about their side.

It=E2=80=99s clear that heading into the 2016 elections, Democrats are unit=
ed and energized, while Republicans are disillusioned and discouraged with =
their dangerous and divisive candidate, Donald Trump, and the rest of their=
 party.
