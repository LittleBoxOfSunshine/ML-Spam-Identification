Is it me or didn't she make her point clear 90 emails ago?

Dejuana,

I am not sure what you mean by "dedicated spaces." I hope you do not mean to suggest that I somehow stepped outside of my lane by reaching out to Virgie directly.

I should have let you know that I spoke to her and, as I mentioned in my previous email, I will make sure that I loop you in going forward.

Also, I just checked my phone and I haven't saved your number. Would you please send it to me again. Much appreciated!

Cheers,
Deshundra

Deshundra,

I appreciate the urgency and special nature of your department.

I also appreciate the effort to ensure we are all on one accord and able to respond professionally within our dedicated spaces. A simple CC or text in urgent matters is more than efficient in my book.

I am available for immediate contact as well as I hoped to have demonstrated when responding to your urgent request regarding the NY times when I was out sick. I got your back.

Looking forward to continued partnership.

Dejuana,

The Factivist post was a press release that we had sent out last night. I was going to use my boss, Luis Miranda, for the quote but he suggested that Virgie may be a better choice given she is the Chair of the Black Caucus. He also felt she would appreciate the gesture as I am sure that she did.

The Communications Department often works under tight deadline constraints so some decisions must be made quickly. My decision to call Virgie directly should not be perceived as a slight or something done in poor taste. It was done out of the urgency of the request.

Going forward, I will keep you informed as to any of my discussions with Virgie and I will loop other CE Directors in conversations that are relevant to their issue area.

Also, if you need to reach me immediately feel free to text me on my cell which is (703) 625-7700. As you see, I am rather accessible.

Best,
Deshundra

Deshundra,

The factivist piece is what she is referring to which was sent yesterday I believe? She states you worked with her to get that piece done and sent.

I do believe it would be in good taste to inform me if a request or outreach is made to the Chair of the caucus for which I or any other CE member liaisons with. If for nothing else but professional continuity.

Tonight when asked about both the factivist piece and the request for radio in the AM; I was completely unaware of both items and any communication had happened from your desk to Chair Rollins.

I do not think this is beneficial for either of us. Particularly because I could not cover nor speak to your request. She specifically asked me had I heard from you on the matter and asked if I had sent her factivist piece out to the DNC Black Caucus membership.

She also asked what my thoughts were to which I could not speak intelligently on because I had no idea what she was speaking of.

I'm sure you can understand my concern with this. And I'm sure your team can understand the value of ensuring the appropriate CE Directors are included in the process of requests of their Chairs.

Please advise.

I have not received a request for an op-ed, however, the Joe Madison show on Sirius XM asked if she would be available for an interview tomorrow morning. I reached out to her to see if she was interested and available.

Please excuse me as I am caught off guard by this email. Am I supposed to speak with you before going to Virgie Rollins?

Can we please meet tomorrow to discuss recent requests made of Chair Rollins for an op-Ed and to go on radio (Joe Madison) in the AM?

She is asking questions of me about your requests which I was not privy to, within my understanding. Did I miss correspondence from your desk regarding this?
