Today in the fight for a full and functioning Supreme Court: Democratic mem=
bers of the Senate Judiciary Committee host a public meeting with former co=
lleagues of Chief Judge Garland, the Alliance for Justice Action Campaign r=
eleases a preliminary report on Trump's "radical-right" picks for the Supre=
me Court, House members introduce the SCOTUS Act, and media and editorial b=
oards continue to remark on the impact of a vacancy on the Supreme Court's =
ability to do its job.

Chief Judge Garland is a "judge's judge" who is "honorable, impartial and f=
air."
Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee today hosted a public =
meeting where former colleagues of Chief Judge Garland described his life-l=
ong commitment to public service and pursuit of justice. Watch the meeting =
HERE<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DxEbUsw1rM6s>.

Donna Bucella, prosecutor on the Oklahoma City bombing case: "His sense of =
collegiality and fairness earned the respect of even those who may not have=
 agreed with his decisions. He was objective. I can attest to this because =
I was there with him the entire time."

Judge Timothy K. Lewis, former federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals f=
or the Third Circuit: "I know Judge Garland...I was already aware of his bi=
partisan support among Senators I respect and admire; Senators whose consci=
entious appeal might stem the tide and help restore the orderly administrat=
ion of an historic process; Senators who, at an earlier time, had privately=
 shared with me their appreciation for bipartisanship in a difficult Suprem=
e Court nomination."

Rodney Slater, former Secretary of Transportation: "I have known Chief Judg=
e Garland as a friend, a fierce and exacting prosecutor in the U.S. Departm=
ent of Justice and as an honorable, impartial and fair adjudicator...In add=
ition to his devotion as a husband, father, son, brother and friend, distin=
guished jurist...he has found time to regularly and passionately mentor inn=
er city youth in the schools of our nation's capital."

Justin Driver, former clerk for Chief Judge Garland: "[Chief Judge Garland]=
 honored existing precedents and avoided grand proclamations that redefined=
 large bodies of law...Each case that arrived on Judge Garland's desk recei=
ved the same meticulous care, regardless of whether the decision appeared d=
estined to be forgotten by everyone but the parties or to be splashed acros=
s front-page headlines."

The Trump List: Donald Trump's List of Potential Supreme Court Nominees and=
 What that Means for America.
Today, Donald Trump released a list of 11 potential Supreme Court nominees =
- a who's who of right-wing jurists who have curtailed voting rights, block=
ed access to abortion, and criticized Trump themselves. The Alliance for Ju=
stice Action Campaign created a preliminary report analyzing the records of=
 the six federal judges on Trump's list, and what those records mean for a =
variety of important issues including reproductive rights, discrimination a=
nd inequality, worker's rights, guns, and the death penalty.

The report can be viewed HERE<http://afjactioncampaign.org/wp-content/uploa=
ds/2016/05/AFJAC-Report-Potential-TRUMP-SCOTUS-nominees.pdf>, with an excer=
pt below:

"Taken together, the records of potential Trump nominees reveal the profoun=
d damage they would inflict on an array of critical issues. These people re=
flect a radical-right ideology that threatens fundamental rights, and that =
favors the powerful over everyone else, especially people from historically=
 marginalized communities. Their written work is suffused with open hostili=
ty toward reproductive rights, criminal defendants, LGBTQ equality, afforda=
ble healthcare, consumer protections, workplace safety, and voting rights.

Judge Pryor, for example, cited Miranda v. Arizona and Roe v. Wade as "the =
worst examples of judicial activism," and Judge Sykes voted to reinstate Wi=
sconsin's discriminatory voter ID law. Judge Colloton signed onto the only =
circuit court decision to rule that the Affordable Care Act's birth control=
 accommodation for religious organizations is insufficient to accommodate t=
heir religious objections, and Judge Raymond Kethledge upheld a retaliatory=
, anti-union Michigan law targeted at public school employees who opposed a=
nti-union legislation."

SCOTUS Act: Senate's Court Obligations Trump Unconstitutional Stalling.
Today, Representatives Elizabeth Esty (D-CT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tamm=
y Duckworth (D-IL), Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ), Patrick Murphy (D-FL) and Jared=
 Polis (D-CO) introduced the SCOTUS Act to require the House and Senate to =
stay in session through the summer and the rest of the year-until the Senat=
e holds hearings and a vote on Chief Judge Garland's nomination. In introdu=
cing the legislation, the representatives stated:

Reps. Elizabeth Esty (D-CT) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD): "If the Senate doe=
s not take action on Garland's nomination within 125 days of the date he wa=
s nominated, neither chamber will be permitted to adjourn. Instead of leavi=
ng town to participate in the July party conventions and campaign this fall=
, the Senate must remain in Washington to fulfill its constitutional respon=
sibility. Never in history has it taken longer than 125 days for any Suprem=
e Court nominee (who has not withdrawn from consideration) to receive a Sen=
ate hearing, so we believe this timetable is more than reasonable... When c=
ongressional leaders decide they don't have to do their job during an elect=
ion year, there should be consequences." [Los Angeles Times, 5/18/16<http:/=
/www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-esty-van-hollen-garland-nomination-del=
ay-20160518-snap-story.html>]

Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL): "A fully-functioning Supreme Court isn't just =
nice to have; it's crucial to our democracy and should be above petty parti=
san politics... The Senate needs to fulfil its constitutional responsibilit=
ies, do its job and hold hearings and a vote on Judge Garland's nomination.=
 We shouldn't let them go home until they do." [Rep. Duckworth press releas=
e, 5/18/16]

Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ): "Politicians can spin it any way they want, bu=
t the American people see right through it - they know this blockade in the=
 Senate is a partisan ploy. Let's pass the SCOTUS Resolution and send a str=
ong message that elected leaders don't just get to skip town for a prolonge=
d recess - they must carry out their constitutional duties." [Rep. Kirkpatr=
ick press release, 5/18/16]

Chief Judge Merrick Garland: The most qualified Supreme Court nominee. Ever=
.
In a new video, #WeNeedNine highlights Chief Judge Garland's impeccable leg=
al credentials and the Republican Senators who, despite blocking his nomina=
tion, have lauded his credentials in the past. Watch the video HERE<https:/=
/www.facebook.com/weneednine/videos/1784998201721704/?>.

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), 1997: "I believe Mr. Garland is a fine nominee. I =
know him personally, I know of his integrity. I know of his legal ability. =
I know of his honesty. I know of his acumen."

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), 1997: "We have nothing against this nominee, Mr=
. Garland. He seems to be well-qualified."

Brown v. Board of Education anniversary is a reminder of why we need nine j=
ustices.
Yesterday, on the 62nd anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decis=
ion, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) and educational leaders spoke on the need for a=
 full and functioning Supreme Court.

Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD): "It was because they had nine on the Supreme Court =
that were willing to...resolve the issue in a way to bring consensus...and =
to bring about an incredibly important protection of our Constitution... If=
 that vacancy is not filled...your rights will vary [depending] on what cir=
cuit you happen to live in." [Baltimore Sun, 5/17/16<http://www.baltimoresu=
n.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bal-ben-cardin-points-to-brown-v-board-to=
-make-case-for-merrick-garland-20160517-story.html>]

The Supreme Court simply cannot do its job without nine members.
Adam Liptak of the New York Times<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/us/poli=
tics/consensus-supreme-court-roberts.html?_r=3D0> looks at the diminished c=
apacity of an eight-member Supreme Court.

"The Supreme Court has gone into hibernation, withdrawing from the central =
role it has played in American life...The justices will continue to issue d=
ecisions in most cases, but many will be modest and ephemeral...Until the n=
ext justice arrives, the Supreme Court will remain on the sideline of Ameri=
can life."

Editorials: SCOTUS is "paralyzed" as vacancy "seriously affect[s] the court=
's ability to conduct its business."
The editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle<http://www.sfchronicle.c=
om/opinion/editorials/article/Birth-control-must-wait-for-a-ninth-justice-7=
546668.php> writes:

"On Monday, the court said it was effectively punting on Zubik vs. Burwell,=
 a challenge to the Affordable Care Act's mandate on birth control coverage=
....The entire disappointing process demonstrates, yet again, how the lack =
of a ninth justice is seriously affecting the court's ability to conduct it=
s business... Neither the court's calendar nor the importance of its ruling=
s is based on the national election schedule. The Senate's holdouts are dep=
riving all Americans of their third branch of government.

From the editorial board of the Tampa Bay Times<http://www.tampabay.com/opi=
nion/editorials/editorial-another-case-for-filling-us-supreme-court-vacancy=
/2277759>:

"Once again, the stubborn refusal by Senate Republicans to act on the presi=
dent's nominee to fill the court's vacancy is undermining the court's rule =
and delaying justice... the larger problem is a high court so paralyzed it =
cannot function as a final word on constitutional rights. Bumping these cas=
es to the lower courts fosters a patchwork legal system, where rights are d=
efined by the geography of individual judicial circuits... One branch of th=
e government is being held hostage by another, and it's time to return the =
balance of power to the democratic system."

tic Senators:
