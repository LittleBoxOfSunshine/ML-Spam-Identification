Subject: Travel Pool report #3 -- Gaggle aboard AF1

Josh Earnest gaggled on the flight, mostly about Flint and a little bit a=
bout Trump & Cruz. No news, so check transcript for fuller quotes.

Earnest said the message from POTUS is that "he cares deeply about the ch=
allenges facing the community of Flint."  He said POTUS will press Republ=
icans to do more to make sure that other communities don't face similar s=
ituations.

Asked about the frustration from some Flint residents about the federal g=
overnment's responsibility, Earnest said that  "Considering that many of =
the people in this community were serving poison water to their children =
for a year and a half or two years, their frustration is entirely justifi=
ed."

Earnest said the situation in Flint reflects "the dangers of government a=
t all levels losing touch with the people they are elected to serve." But=
 said that POTUS is "quite serious about making sure that the federal gov=
ernment is living up to its obligations to its citizens."

Earnest said POTUS will be meeting with local and state leaders to get an=
 update on the situation and said those leaders will include Gov. Snyder =
and the mayor of Flint. He said it was unclear whether POTUS will drink f=
iltered water in Flint.

Earnest took a dig at the president's political rivals: "The president do=
es not believe that eliminating the EPA, for example, I going to prevent =
this from happening in other places. We need an EPA that is properly fund=
ed and operating effectively. ... Eliminating that agency,  as many Repub=
licans advocate, is not going to contribute to that goal."

(on Trump)  "There are six months until election day and I'm confident pr=
esident will spend many of those days making a strong case about the prog=
ress the country has made in the past seven years. ... It is undeniable o=
ur country is stronger, our economy is stronger than it was eight year ag=
o. The question voters will have to ask themselves is do we want to scrap=
 the strategy that has worked so effectively or do we want to build on th=
e progress that we made?"
Earnest called a contested Dem primary unlikely. He said Obama did not ha=
ve a reaction to Cruz dropping out of the GOP race and said he was confid=
ent Obama did not watch the election results come in last night.

On Obama addressing the APIACS gala tonight honoring Asian Americans and =
Pacific Islanders, Earnest noted that Asian Americans are the fastest gro=
wing voting bloc and said Obama certainly will make case that his policie=
s have helped APAs.

Thanks to co-pooler David Nakamura for help with the gaggle.
