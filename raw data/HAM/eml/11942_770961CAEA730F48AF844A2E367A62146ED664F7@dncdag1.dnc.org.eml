Paul Manafort: Trump Hasn=92t Ruled Out Taking Money From Big Donors In The=
 General<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/paul-manafort-trump-hasnt=

Paul Manafort, a senior adviser to Donald Trump=92s presidential campaign, =
said in a radio interview on Thursday that Trump hasn=92t made any decision=
s as to whether or not he will accept large contributions from outside dono=
rs in the general election.

Trump has financed his campaign largely with his own money and small donati=
ons, swearing off large donors and super PACs. In an interview with Laura I=
ngraham on Thursday, Manafort said Trump was willing to help the Republican=
 National Committee raise money if he becomes the nominee.

=93Well the point is that Donald Trump has been making on the campaign trai=
l is that he=92s financing his own campaign,=94 Manafort said. =93That=92s =
very important for him to say now in his mind because he wants people to kn=
ow that he owes nobody anything other than the American people, or the vote=
rs who are picking, choosing his candidacy.=94

=93When it comes to the general election, we are no longer running as an in=
dividual, we are running as the head of a ticket,=94 he continued. =93And s=
o the party itself will be doing some things to raise money, and Mr. Trump =
has indicated that he=92d be willing to help the party. But as far as he hi=
mself is concerned=97but his point is he wants to make sure that he=92s not=
 beholden to anyone but the American people.=94

Asked if this meant Trump was ruling out accepting money from big donors in=
 the future, Manafort said Trump hadn=92t made any decisions yet.

=93No, what I=92m talking about now is the ramp up to the convention itself=
, and after he is the presumptive nominee, some of the things that they do,=
=94 he continued. =93He hasn=92t made any decisions yet. He has basically s=
aid, =91I am only running my campaign right now, I=92m not taking money fro=
m anybody, and I=92m not going to take any money from anybody.=92 Whether, =
how he will participate, in a broader context is yet to be determined.=94
