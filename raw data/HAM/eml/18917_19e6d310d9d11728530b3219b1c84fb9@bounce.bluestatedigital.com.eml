The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friend --

As of today, Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee.  The contr=
ast between his values and the values our Democratic candidates defend ever=
y day could not be starker.  As women, we have a lot on the line.  It is cr=
ucial that we come together to push back on the backwards GOP rhetoric and =
make our voices heard this election cycle.

Please join me for a women's roundtable discussion this Friday, May 6th in =
Wilmington, Delaware.  This is your chance to ask me questions about what t=
he DNC is doing to fight back and to strategize together about engaging wom=
en in the election this November. =20
