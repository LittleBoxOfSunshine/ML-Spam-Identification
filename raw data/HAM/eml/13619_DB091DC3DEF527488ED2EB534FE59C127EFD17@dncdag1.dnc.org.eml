Trump bizarrely links Cruz=92s father to JFK assassin; Cruz goes ballistic

The feud between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz hit epic proportions Tuesday as =
Republican primary voters headed to the polls in Indiana.

Trump was asked on Fox News to respond to remarks by the Texas senator's fa=
ther on the campaign trail. Rafael Cruz had said electing =93the alternativ=
e=94 to his son =93could be the destruction of America.=94

=93I think it=92s a disgrace that he=92s allowed to do it, I think it=92s a=
 disgrace that he=92s allowed to say it,=94 Trump responded.

Then he insinuated that Cruz=92s father may have played some role in the as=
sassination of John F. Kennedy. No, really. He brought up a questionable Na=
tional Enquirer story claiming Rafael Cruz appeared in a photo with Oswald =
shortly before the murder. (The Miami Heraldtook a critical look<http://www=
.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article73449297.html> at the clai=
ms)

=93I mean what was he doing =97 what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald sh=
ortly before the death, before the shooting?=94 Trump said. =93It=92s horri=
ble.=94

That led Cruz to unload on Trump in a press conference, saying he is =93amo=
ral=94 and a =93pathological liar.=94

=93I=92m going to do something I haven=92t done for the entire campaign: I=
=92m going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump,=94 he said. =93=
This man is a pathological liar. He doesn=92t know the difference between t=
ruth and lies. He lies, practically every word that comes out of his mouth.=
=94

=93The man is utterly amoral; morality does not exist for him,=94 Cruz said

Cruz called Trump's suggestions about his father =93nuts=94 and =93kooky=94=
 and pointed out that theEnquirer has endorsed Trump.

=93Now let=92s be clear: This is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. T=
his is just kooky," Cruz said. "And while I=92m at it, I guess I should go =
ahead and admit yes my dad killed JFK, he is secretly Elvis and Jimmy Hoffa=
 is buried in his backyard.=94

Trump then issued a statement saying Cruz=92s =93outburst=94 shows he is a =
=93desperate candidate trying to save his failing campaign.=94

=93Over the last week, I have watched Lyin=92 Ted become more and more unhi=
nged as he is unable to react under the pressure and stress of losing, in a=
ll cases by landslides, the last six primary elections =97 in fact, coming =
in last place in all but one of them,=94 he said. =93Today=92s ridiculous o=
utburst only proves what I have been saying for a long time, that Ted Cruz =
does not have the temperament to be President of the United States.=94

Trump=92s son also jumped in the ring, saying Cruz reminded him of his todd=
ler

"That was an impressive meltdown... Desperate but impressive. Reminded me o=
f my 3 year old coming off a sugar high," Donald Trump Jr. tweeted<https://=
twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/727530864310161408>.

It=92s interesting to think that only a few months ago, Cruz had this to sa=
y about The Donald:

"The Establishment's only hope: Trump & me in a cage match," he tweeted<htt=
ps://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/675360299747184640> in December. "Sorry to =
disappoint =97 @realDonaldTrump is terrific. #DealWithIt"
