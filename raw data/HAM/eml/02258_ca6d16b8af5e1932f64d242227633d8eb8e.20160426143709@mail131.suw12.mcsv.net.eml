Utah Democratic Chair Peter Corroon on the 2016 Election
Utah Democratic Party Chair Peter Corroon discusses the 2016 election and=
 how Utah's Democrats may fare with Hillary Clinton at the top of the tick=
et. Corroon says they know Clinton isn't the most popular political figure=
 in Utah=2C but he feels Utah's minority party will be able to make gains=
 because the likely GOP nominee=2C Donald Trump=2C is also extremely unpop=
ular in the state. "The Republican Party has been creating Donald Trump fo=

ession of marijuana until he made the announcement from the podium at Satu=

Utah Democratic Chair Peter Corroon on the 2016 Election </strong><br>
Utah Democratic Party Chair Peter Corroon discusses the 2016 election and h=
ow Utah's Democrats may fare with Hillary Clinton at the top of the ticket.=
 Corroon says they know Clinton isn't the most popular political figure in =
Utah, but he feels Utah's minority party will be able to make gains because=
 the likely GOP nominee, Donald Trump, is also extremely unpopular in the s=
tate. &quot;The Republican Party has been creating Donald Trump for two dec=
ades and, finally, he's here,&quot; says Corroon. &quot;He's your candidate=
, so deal with it as you need to deal with it.&quot; Corroon says he also w=
as unaware that Mike Weinholtz's wife was under investigation for possessio=
n of marijuana until he made the announcement from the podium at Saturday's=
 convention.<br>
