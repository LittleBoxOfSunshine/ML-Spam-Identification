The Trump Plan To Reform The Department Of Veterans Affairs Modernize The V=
A With Investments In State-Of-The-Art Technology. =93The VA health care pr=
ogram is a disaster. =85 That=92s why the Trump plan will: =85 Modernize th=
e VA. A VA with 20th century technology cannot serve 21st century service m=
embers and their needs. The VA has been promising to modernize for years wi=
thout real results. The Trump plan will make it happen by accelerating and =
expanding investments in state of the art technology to deliver best-in-cla=
ss care quickly and effectively. All veterans should be able to convenientl=
y schedule appointments, communicate with their doctors, and view accurate =
wait times with the push of a button.=94 [DonaldJTrump.com<http://DonaldJTr=

CEPTED MEDICARE

Trump=92s Veterans Plan Called To Allow Veterans To Go To Any Doctor Or Car=
e Facility That Accepted Medicare. =93Under a Trump Administration, all vet=
erans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran=92s ID card to an=
y doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need i=
mmediately. Our veterans have earned the freedom to choose better or more c=
onvenient care from the doctor and facility of their choice.=94 [Veterans P=

Trump Called To Make It So Veterans Could Go To Private Hospitals Or Hospit=
als And =93We=92ll Pay The Bill,=94 Claiming That He Would Work Out A Syste=
m That Would Make It A Lot Cheaper. TRUMP: =93Two weeks ago on Wednesday, t=
he veterans had the longest wait in the history, in waiting rooms in the hi=
story of the VA.  They are being treated worse than illegal immigrants in m=
any cases.  It's a disaster for the veterans.  And what I would do is to br=
eak up that back jam.  They cannot wait seven days to see the doctor and th=
e doctor tells them I'm going on vacation, we can't see you now, sorry.   W=
e are going to open it up so they can go -- they don't have to wait, they c=
an go to private doctors, they can go to private hospitals, they can go to =
public hospitals, and we'll pay the bill.  And that will end up being a lot=
 cheaper than having them waiting forever.  And by the way, waiting and dyi=
ng, because you have thousands that are dying waiting to be cured of things=
 that can easily be fixed.  So I will open it up so they can go to private =
hospitals and private doctors, and, by the way, public hospitals and we'll =
pay the bill.  And frankly, that's going to be, and we'll work out a system=
, that will be a lot better and they love it, they love the concept, and I =
believe it's going to be a lot cheaper.  It's not a question of the money. =
 We're being run -- the whole country is incompetently run.  But the VA may=
 be the top of the list.  They will be so happy if I get elected president.=

DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT PUT A PRICE TAG ON HIS VETERANS REFORM PLAN, BUT CLAI=

p braggadocio, he claimed simply spending money more efficiently would pay =

 VA. The Trump plan will ensure the VA is spending its dollars wisely to pr=
ovide the greatest impact for veterans and hold administrators accountable =
for irresponsible spending and abuse. The days of $6.3 million for statues =
and fountains at VA facilities and $300,000 for a manager to move 140 miles=
 are over. The Trump plan will clean up the VA=92s finances so the current =
VA budget provides more and better care than it does now.=94 [DonaldJTrump.=
