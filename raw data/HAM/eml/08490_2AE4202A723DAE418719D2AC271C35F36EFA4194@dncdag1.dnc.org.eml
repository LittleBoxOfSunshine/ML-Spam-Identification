SL: WATCH: President Obama Delivers Rebuke of Anti-Muslim Fearmongering while Commemorating Raid that Killed Osama Bin Laden

Body: Last night, while commemorating the 5th anniversary of the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, President Obama delivered a rebuke of the dangerous anti-Muslim fearmongering that has defined the GOP presidential race.

"I do think it is important for us to understand the nature of the threat; what works and what doesn't. Painting the Muslim community with a broad brush does not work. They are the greatest allies in fighting against the organizations...Most importantly, we have to stay true to our values during the process. We have to make sure that we are not engaging in the kind of the knee-jerk anti-Muslim sentiment that we have heard from some politicians. We have to make sure that the legal structures around our intelligence gathering and our use of predators are subject to oversight. It is not always going to be easy. It is not always going to be perfectly smooth. There are going to be times where as president you make a decision knowing that there are going to be critics, and knowing that there's some gray areas, and ambiguities that you have to deal with given the realities of the situation, but overall, I think that we can draw a lesson from the Bin Laden raid that we have got really effective people and a government that knows how to do this. As long as we operate from the position of confidence and strength and are true to who we are, groups like this or the individuals like this cannot defeat us."

President Obama is correct. Success in combating terror requires strong relationships with our Muslim allies in the Middle East and Muslims in the United States who are often the first line of defense against terror attacks. In fact, taking out Osama Bin Laden depended on those relationships with Muslims in Afghanistan and Pakistan who provided intelligence to U.S. officials.

Trump's absurd proposal to ban Muslims from the United States, along with his other dangerous, half-baked proposals and foreign policy cluelessness, has alarmed our allies throughout the world - including leaders in the Middle East who are our partners in fighting terror.

Not to be outdone, Ted Cruz has called for "carpet bombing" the Middle East with no regard to civilian lives, and would authorize law enforcement to "patrol and secure" neighborhoods where Muslim-Americans live, a dangerous and discriminatory policy that resembles the political witch hunts of the McCarthy era.

Being true to our values is not only the right thing to do, it keeps Americans safer. Period.
