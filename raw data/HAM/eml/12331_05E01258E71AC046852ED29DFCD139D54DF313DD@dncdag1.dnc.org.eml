I think this is good if it holds.

Greg gets to post at like 9pm Sunday for the next day's front page, she does New Day in the AM and then Andrea in the afternoon?

If the campaigns told these people they would definitely be on, then it will be pieced together more quickly. For a Monday roll out we would want a call with Cummings and a reporter tomorrow or early Sunday, with your calls to the members to confirm their appointment on Sunday afternoon."
