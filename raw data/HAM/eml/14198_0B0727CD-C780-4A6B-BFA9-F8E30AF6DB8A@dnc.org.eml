I just took a look through next week's calendar for media hit opportunities. 

Here are times either set aside for comms or apparently open holes in the current schedule. The open holes could change depending on other requests.

Note: 
There are a Zika-related media hit in the district from the Congressional office on Monday morning and a Tele-town hall scheduled on Thursday evening from 5 to 6:30.  

The weekend is filled with travel and events related to the Florida Democratic Party dinner in Orlando on Saturday and district events on Sunday. 

Here are pitchable time blocks that are set aside as comms buffer or currently open/unscheduled on calendar: 

* Tuesday, May 17 -- 8 pm to 10 pm (currently open on calendar)

* Wednesday, May 18 -- 4:30 pm to 5:15 pm (set aside as comms buffer)

* Thursday, May 19 -- 10 am -- 11 am (set aside as comms buffer)

* Thursday, May 19 -- 7 pm -- 10 pm (currently open time on calendar after tele-town hall. 

* Friday, May 20 -- before 10 am (currently open on calendar. Acela scheduled to Philly after 10)
