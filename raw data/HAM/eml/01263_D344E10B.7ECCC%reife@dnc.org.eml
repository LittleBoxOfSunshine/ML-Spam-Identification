Friend --

Throughout this primary, there has been a relentless focus on fighting the =
effects of income inequality and combatting the corrosiveness in our campai=
gn finance system in a way I=92ve never seen in any election before. These =
issues are so important in our ultimate goal as Democrats of giving every A=
merican a fair shot to succeed.

<LINK>So I want to thank Bernie Sanders for bringing them to the forefront =
of his campaign and putting these Democratic values we share into the spotl=
ight.</LINK>

I want to thank him for his unwavering commitment to equality for all and h=
is dedication to improving the lives of Americans everywhere. For his insis=
tence that we can do better. Because I agree -- we can do better, and we mu=
st do better, for the sake of every parent who wants their kids' lives to b=
e a little brighter, for every student who wants to reach higher and go fur=
ther, and for every person who sees this country as a place with opportunit=
y for all.

NAME, as a presidential candidate and as a member of Congress for more than=
 two decades, Bernie Sanders has excited the people of this country, and I =
know he'll continue to, no matter what he does next.

So as he ends his campaign today, add your name to mine to thank him for ev=
erything:

Over the past year, we=92ve seen two very different presidential primaries.

On the Republican side, we had a true race to the bottom that has resulted =
in not only a rush to adopted the kinds of bigoted and xenophobic policies =
we=92ve come to expect from the Republican Party, but in the mudslinging an=
d even physical violence we=92ve seen from the Republican candidates and th=
eir supporters.

And then, from our candidates, we he had a serious, substantive debate that=
 has been centered on the core values of our party: lifting up the most vul=
nerable among us, securing an economy where everyone has a fair shot, ensur=
ing equality for all. Our party is stronger because of Bernie Sanders=92 vo=
ice on these important issues, the contributions he=92s made to this primar=
y, and the millions of Americans he has engaged in this election.

Today, as he suspends his presidential campaign, I want to thank Bernie San=

Our next president will be a Democrat, NAME.

Over the past few months, we=92ve seen a group of amazing Democrats with st=

to stand behind each and every one of them, because I know they would each =
make us proud in the Oval Office. Now, I=92m proud that our party has chose=

<LINK>And that togetherness is key, NAME. Because it=92s so clear that whoe=
ver comes out on top at the end of the Republican primary will be a disaste=
r for America -- and it=92ll take all of us working together to stop him fr=
om enacting the kind of policies that would have catastrophic consequences =
for people in every corner of this country.</LINK>

Plain and simple: We=92ve got to spend the next XX months fighting every si=
ngle day to make sure that the Republican nominee doesn=92t stand a chance,=
 and to make sure that Secretary Clinton has the resources she needs to win=
 the White House in November. She has proven time and time again that she w=
ill protect the progress we=92ve made together over the past seven years, a=
nd that she=92ll do whatever it takes to keep moving this country forward a=

But she can=92t do it without us. So right now, if you=92re ready to win th=

ight now to help elect her our next president and put Democrats in office a=

In a few months, I=92m going to be returning back to life as a regular citi=

to make the kinds of decisions that are going keep us on the right track an=

y friend, Hillary Clinton.

<LINK>So today, I=92m asking you to add your name with mine and say that yo=
u're ready to make Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States.=
</LINK>

After spending eight years behind this desk, you get a pretty good sense of=
 what it takes to handle the pressures and challenges that come with it, an=
d you simply won=92t find anyone more prepared than Hillary. What she under=
stands better than almost anyone is how to translate the values we share in=
to a plan to deliver the goods and make a real difference in people=92s day=
-to-day lives.

We=92ve come a long way together, NAME, and there=92s so much more I know w=
e can accomplish with a leader who has the vision, strength, and persistenc=
e to keep moving us forward. Hillary is that leader. I=92ve admired those q=
ualities both as a colleague in the Senate and later as a key player in my =
Cabinet. Whether it=92s at home, strengthening and broadening our middle cl=
ass and making affordable health care a right for every single American, or=
 abroad, ensuring that diplomacy is the greatest weapon in our arsenal, I=
=92m with her because I know she=92s with us, plain and simple.

This is going to be a truly historic election. NAME, I can=92t wait to see =
Sasha and Malia=92s faces on January 20th, 2017 when that highest, hardest =
glass ceiling has finally been broken, knowing there is truly nothing they =
can=92t achieve. I=92m going to work as hard as I can to make sure we get t=
o that day, and I hope you will, too:

LINK

The stakes couldn=92t be higher, and the Republican opposition is going to =
be fierce, but I know that with supporters like you working together, we=92=
re going to win this. Thanks for your support =97 now let=92s get to work.

August 28th, 2008 is a night I=92ll never forget, NAME. I stood in Denver a=
nd accepted the Democratic Party=92s nomination for President of the United=
 States and promised that, with you by my side, I would do whatever it took=
 to keep the American promise alive.

And take a look at how far we=92ve come since then: Our unemployment rate=
=92s been cut in half, more people are insured than ever before, more of ou=
r kids are graduating from high school and can afford to look into higher e=
ducation opportunities, we=92re combating climate change so our kids and gr=

But we=92re not finished. We=92ve got so much more to do and we=92ve got to=
 make sure we put the future of our country in the hands of a leader who wi=
ll work with us to finish what we started together all those years ago. <LI=
NK>And I think you and I both know who that person is: our nominee for Pres=
ident of the United States, Hillary Clinton. </LINK>

A champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and you=
ng girls all across the country, Hillary Clinton embodies the spirit of ser=
vice. She is the fighter we need to keep making progress and moving forward=
, and I couldn=92t be more proud to be handing off the baton off to such a =
strong, capable successor.

So, the time is now for us to come together as one party and American famil=
y to make sure that the next generation, and all the generations to come, c=
an pursue their individual dreams through hard work and sacrifice. That=92s=
 what sets this country apart. And if there is one thing I=92m sure about, =
it=92s that Hillary Clinton will protect that ideal and work tirelessly eve=
ry single day as our president to expand opportunity and grow our middle cl=
ass and do the work that really makes our country exceptional.

I wholeheartedly believe that Hillary will lead us where we need to go, and=
 if you agree, then add your name next to mine and say you=92re ready to do=
 whatever it takes to make sure she is our next president:

LINK

In just a few months we=92ll elect the person who=92ll take my place here i=

 doing the work to ensure that person is Hillary Clinton. Thank you so much=
