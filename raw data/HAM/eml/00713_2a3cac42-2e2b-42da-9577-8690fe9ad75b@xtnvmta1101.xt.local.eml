PAPER CHASE: The first white papers out of House Speaker Paul Ryan's working groups, formed after the Republican retreat in January, are expected in the next few weeks, CGCN Group partner Sam Geduldig said in a note to clients today. The "Reducing Regulatory Burdens" task force will address changes to the regulatory process, such as how agencies use scientific data, Geduldig said. Also, the House Financial Services Committee will produce a white paper on Dodd-Frank reforms in late June.

The white papers give House Republicans a chance to plot out an agenda without needing 218 votes. "But this channeling tactic has its limits: Many members, feeling the heat of the Trump era, are searching for more than just white papers," wrote Geduldig, who used to work for Speaker John Boehner. "With few opportunities left to satisfy voter discontent, member agitation is growing steadily." One sign of the strain is how traditionally low-key conference meetings "now resemble the raucous town hall meetings in congressional districts that play out on YouTube."

One achievement Republicans probably will be able to point to on the campaign trail is the Toxic Substances Control Act, according to Geduldig. The House and Senate seem to have a deal, which includes industry's top priority: preempting a patchwork of state regulation. CGCN lobbies for the American Chemistry Council.

MORAN FOR NORTHROP: Former Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.), now at McDermott Will & Emery, registered to lobby for Northrop Grumman on the space telescope and defense authorization and appropriations. Moran's first clients earlier this year were General Dynamics and Boeing.

UPLOAD: The filing is up for Dropbox's new head of U.S. government affairs, Becky Tallent. The company's first in-house registration names the issues of privacy protection, intellectual property, patent protection, patent reform, copyright protection, copyright compliance, law enforcement surveillance of digital data, workforce and education in tech. The data storage company is also represented by the Franklin Square Group, Glover Park Group and Joseph Group.

HAPPY MONDAY! Please send tips to iarnsdorf@politico.com.

RUN THE WORLD: When congressional fundraising demands give you lemons, make LEMONADE - Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) is having a fundraiser at Beyonc&eacute;'s concert in Baltimore next month. A pair of tickets go for $3,500 for PACs.

- FTI Consulting is hosting lunch tomorrow for Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.), featuring DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj&aacute;n.

CAN'T STOP WON'T STOP: Former House Speaker John Boehner is NOT riding quietly into the sunset, and we don't just mean his headline-making asides. POLITICO's Jake Sherman reports Boehner will hit the road for all of August raising money for incumbent House Republicans. Sources say his cross-country bus, dubbed "Freedom One," will kick off after the RNC in Cleveland and end Labor Day weekend. While in office, Boehner spent nearly every weekend on the road and raked in $300 million from 2009 to last year.

TREMORS IN KOCH WORLD: Charles and David Koch are pulling back from federal politics to focus more on their business and public-relations interests, Tim Alberta and Eliana Johnson report for the National Review. The billionaire brothers resisted pressure to attack Donald Trump and have reduced budgets, overhauled departments, cut grants and let executives go. Conservative groups including the Chamber of Commerce, NRA and Club for Growth are feeling the pinch from the stepbacks and looking to possible big-money successors: TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts and hedge-fund billionaire Paul Singer.

MOVERS:

- Victoria Luxardo Jeffries joined Univision's Washington office as associate general counsel & vice president of public policy, reporting to Jessica Herrera-Flanigan.

She most recently worked at the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and previously was part of Netflix's global public policy team.

- Steven W. Hawkins, most recently serving as executive director of Amnesty International USA, is the new president of bipartisan criminal justice reform organization the Coalition for Public Safety.

- Lauren Sinclair is leaving CRAFT for Feinstein Kean Healthcare, Ogilvy's health care PR agency.

GUN CHECK: The NRA Institute for Legislative Action is pushing back on a Nevada ballot question that would establish a universal background check for gun purchases in the state, The Associated Press reports. The new regulation would include private sales online and at gun shows. Michael Bloomberg donated $2.9 million to Nevadans for Background Checks.
