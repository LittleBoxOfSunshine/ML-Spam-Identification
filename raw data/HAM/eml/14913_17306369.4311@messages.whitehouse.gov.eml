The East Room ceremony was open press, so reporters should double-check t=
ranscript for exact quotes.



POTUS entered the East Room at 2:44p.m.for the National Medals of Science=
 and the National Medals of Technology and Innovation ceremony honoring 1=
7 scientists and innovators.



[Please find a list of the award recipients, plus a brief bio (from the W=
H), at the end of this report].=20



The room was packed with Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Reps. Steny Ho=
yer (R-Md.), Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) and David Price (D-N.C.) in attendan=
ce. White House Science and Technology advisor John Holdren was also in a=
ttendance as was the Director of the National Science Foundation France C=
ordova.



POTUS opened the award ceremony by saying "the amount of brainpower in th=
is room right now is astonishing, but when you talk to these brilliant me=
n and women it's clear the honor has not yet gone to their heads. They st=
ill put their lab coats on one arm at a time."



Obama also joked that the White House was engaging in a lot of science "a=
nd tinkering" itself these days with astronomy night, science fairs and h=
ack-a-thons. In an era when sports athletes are idolized, POTUS said it w=
as good to see young people could look up to the individuals in the room.=




POTUS announced a kid science advisors campaign, a kid-driven initiative =
to help further develop STEM education.



POTUS also spoke about the individual contributions of several of the med=
al recipients as well as called on Congress to keep funding science resea=
rch "to keep America on the cutting edge" before proceeding to the actual=
 medal ceremony.



POTUS exited room at 3:09 p.m.



Heres a little background on the National Medal of Science and the Nation=
al Medal of Technology and Innovation from the White House.=20



The National Medal of Science was created by statute in 1959 and is admin=
istered for the White House by the National Science Foundation. Awarded a=
nnually, the Medal recognizes individuals who have made outstanding contr=
ibutions to science and engineering. The President receives nominations f=
rom a committee of Presidential appointees based on their extraordinary k=
nowledge in and contributions to chemistry, engineering, computing, mathe=
matics, and the biological, behavioral/social, and physical sciences.

The National Medal of Technology and Innovation was created by statute in=
 1980 and is administered for the White House by the U.S. Department of C=
ommerces Patent and Trademark Office. The award recognizes those who have=
 made lasting contributions to Americas competitiveness, quality of life,=
 and helped strengthen the Nations technological workforce. A distinguish=
ed independent committee representing the private and public sectors subm=
its recommendations for the award to the President.
