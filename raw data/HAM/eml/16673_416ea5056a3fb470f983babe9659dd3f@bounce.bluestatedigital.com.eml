I want to make something very, very clear: Our voices in
this election are more important than ever.

We know that the more folks hear what Democrats believe in,
the better our candidates do. And thanks to the past seven
years under President Obama, we've seen how much change=20
we can inspire and make happen when we work together in=20
support of those common values.

So I know that, together, we are going to win in November.
If you're ready to put a Democratic president in the White
House and take back Congress this November, add your name
right now:

This is important work we're doing. So thank you, Ernest.
