Taylor Wofford is a reporter with Newsweek. He is working on a piece about =
Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz. He has been asking questions prompted by m=
any of the "off-the-record" critics of the Congresswoman. He says he's look=
ing to get a sense of who she is by speaking with people who know her best.=
 He has spoken to ex-staffers but he's looking for someone who DWS turns to=
 for advice. Someone who's opinion she trusts.

In speaking with the Congresswoman, she praised you and said she values you=
r opinion.

We would like to help this reporter get as many positive comments on the re=
cord about the Congresswoman as possible to counter any negatives being dru=
mmed up by her opponents and critics. Are you available to speak with him? =
If so, would you like to phone him or would you like me to have him phone y=
ou?

Thanks for all your help,

Ryan
