Donald Trump=92s Campaign Trail May Take Detour to Scotland

Maggie Haberman

Donald J. Trump is going to spend his time in the coming weeks before the R=
epublican Party=92s nominating convention in July considering a running mat=
e, musing potential Supreme Court picks =97 and, possibly, heading to Scotl=
and for a ribbon-cutting.

Mr. Trump is considering whether to travel to Scotland in June for the unve=
iling of the renovated Trump Turnberry, a famous golf course that he acquir=
ed in 2014 and which has hosted championships.

=93We just did a massive renovation of the whole place,=94 Mr. Trump said i=
n an interview this week. =93We=92re having an opening in June, and the que=
stion is, will I fly over, cut the ribbon and fly right back, or not.=94

Such a trip could have advantages, particularly if Mr. Trump was able to sc=
hedule meetings with European officials to add a presidential patina.

But it would also take him off the campaign trail in a heated battle over t=
he economy and jobs.

Such foreign trips taken by presidential nominees, if they include ceremoni=
al stops and meetings, can be fraught with peril. Mitt Romney=92s trip to E=
urope in 2012 was pockmarked with troublesome encounters and negative headl=
ines. So was a trip taken by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey in late 2014=
.
