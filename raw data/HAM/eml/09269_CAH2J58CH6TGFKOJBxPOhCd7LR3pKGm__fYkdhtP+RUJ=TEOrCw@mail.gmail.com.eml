Hi Luis,
    We're thinking of taking another look at our George Clooney ruling
<http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/apr/17/george-clooney=
/george-clooney-decries-big-money-politics-says-mos/>
in
the wake of today's Politico story. I didn't take the complaints seriously
earlier because it seemed ridiculous that states would get money to help
their local candidates and then turn around and give ALL of it to the DNC.
But apparently they are.
    Please don't tell me this is Clinton money and you have nothing to do
with it. In the end, the states are giving it to the DNC, so I need
reaction from the DNC.
    Now that this arrangement is out, is the DNC going to turn around and
give the money back to the state parties? Otherwise it appears that the DNC
is benefiting from money raised under false pretenses. Is the party
comforable with that?
    -- Gene
