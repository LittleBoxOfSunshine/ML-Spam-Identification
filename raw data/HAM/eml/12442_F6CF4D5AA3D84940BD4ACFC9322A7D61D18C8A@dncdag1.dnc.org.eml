Trump: "You Don't Have To Vote Anymore, Save Your Vote For The General Election. Forget This One, The Primary's Done." "Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, refueled of bravado after his decisive win in Tuesday's Indiana primary, told a crowd in West Virginia Thursday to not bother voting in their own primary next week. 'I actually wish the primaries were not over. It's no fun this way,' Trump told a crowd of 13,000 at Charleston Civic Center in his first appearance as the last Republican candidate in the race. 'You don't have to vote anymore, save your vote for the general election. Forget this one, the primary's done.'"

Washington Post: Trump Can Speak In A Calmer Tone "But He Cannot Change Who He Is Or How He Seized This Moment." "No such reboot is conceivable, of course. It is possible that Mr. Trump henceforth will appear more 'presidential,' if by that is meant speaking in a calmer tone and spewing fewer insults - though his National Enquirer scandal-mongering on the day of his great victory is not an encouraging portent. But he cannot change who he is or how he seized this moment. His nomination is a calamity for the Republican Party, and Republicans will have to sort out how it happened and how they might recover. But the more urgent task is to ensure that Mr. Trump does not become a calamity visited on the United States and the world. For all his unpredicted success, the number of Americans who have voted for him so far amounts to only 4.7 percent of eligible voters, according to a calculation by the organization FairVote. As conservatives of principle recognize, he can be stopped, and he must be."

2006: Jared Kushner Bought The New York Observer For $10 Million. "Once he became CEO of the family business, the younger Kushner shifted its focus from New Jersey to New York. 'He knew early in his career that the way to become important was to get out of Jersey and become a Manhattan developer,' says NYU's Moss. Kushner had no profile in the city, but that changed in 2006 when he bought the Observer for what was widely reported to be $10 million. 'Jared saw it as a way to have a voice in New York,' says Bob Sommer, who was president of Observer Media from 2007 to 2009. 'It helped set him up as a serious player.' In 2007, Kushner paid $1.8 billion for 666 Fifth Ave., an aluminum-jacketed office tower that takes up an entire block front between 52nd and 53rd streets in Manhattan, near Rockefeller Center. At the time it was the highest price ever paid for a single building in New York. Kushner didn't put down much of his own money. He financed the deal with a $1.2 billion loan from Barclays Capital and an additional $535 million of short-term debt. It was a lot of leverage, but many real estate investors were borrowing heavily at the time. This deal, along with the purchase of the Observer, established Kushner as a force in Manhattan."

Trump On His Support Among Working-Class White Voters: "I Worked Summers When I Was Going To School With Carpenters And Electricians. You Know My Father Was A Builder In Brooklyn And Queens, Predominantly...I Worked With All Of These Guys, I Know These Guys." "His unusual talents are part of the answer. Charismatic, tactically astute, charming at times and ruthless, Mr Trump is a far more formidable politician than almost anyone had suspected. His outrages have kept print- and broadcast-media attention focused on him; with nearly 8m followers on Twitter and a flair for pithy invective, he rules on social media, too. At the time of his entry into the race, his slander against Mexicans seemed naive as well as boorish; it now seems remarkable how well-formed his pitch to resentful, working-class whites was. He says this was because he understands and shares their concerns. 'I worked summers when I was going to school with carpenters and electricians. You know my father was a builder in Brooklyn and Queens, predominantly...I worked with all of these guys, I know these guys.' That has a rare ring of truth. Expedience explains his positions on many issues, including guns, which he once disliked and now advocates, abortion, which he once accepted and now opposes, God, in Whom he previously showed little interest but now praises. His xenophobia and protectionism, however, have form."

Trump Said He Would Release His List Of 10-15 Potential Supreme Court Appointees Before The Convention. TRUMP: "So let's say you get somebody to run. That means a Republican can't win. Now you have four to five Supreme Court justices that will be picked by Hillary Clinton or whoever it is. But probably Hillary. Bernie even worse. But because of a guy like Ben Sasse, because if you do that, that would mean the Republicans can't win if you put in -- you know, if you do what he's suggesting. The worst thing that can happen -- because I'm going to win. I'm going to win. And I'm going to put wonderful, conservative, good, solid brilliant judges." BAIER: "And you're going to lay those out?" TRUMP: "In the form of Scalia. I'm going to actually lay them out. I'm going to discuss people. I'm going to actually--" BAIER: "Before the convention." TRUMP: "Actually I've met with a couple of Heritage and a couple of groups. I think before the convention yes, I want to put up 10, 12, 15 names of the type of people that we'd like. I would like to do that." BAIER: And that would be -- from that list that you will choose?" TRUMP: "Yes. And I've suggested that. I don't know if it's been accepted. But from that list, I would choose, he's a conservative judge, these would be great judges." [Special Report With Bret Baier, Fox News, 5/5/16]


Music At Rallies
Trump Pushed Back Against The Rolling Stones' Request That He Not Use Their Music At His Rallies Saying,  "We Have The Rights To Use Them. I Always Buy The Rights." "Donald Trump is pushing back on the Rolling Stones' request that he refrain from using their songs on the campaign trail, saying that he and his campaign 'have the rights to use them.' 'You know, we use so many songs,' Trump said in an interview with CNBC early Thursday. 'We have the rights to use them. I always buy the rights.' Trump, who regularly walks on stage at campaign events to hit Stones singles, was responding to the rock band's statement Wednesday that they had never given his campaign permission to use their songs. In the letter to the campaign, the Stones 'have requested they they cease all use immediately.' When asked about the issue by CNBC, Trump made sure to note that he and his campaign 'have no problem' with the band."

5/5/16: The Trump Campaign Played Rolling Stones' Music At Trump's West Virginia Rally In Defiance Of The Band's Request.

'Certainly I have no problem. I like Mick Jagger. I like their songs.' At a Trump rally Thursday night, the Stones' song, 'You Can't Always Get What You Want,' was played."

Several Musical Artists Have Asked The Trump Campaign Not To Use Their Music At His Rallies, Including The Rolling Stones, Adele, Steven Tyler, And Neil Young. "When asked about the issue by CNBC, Trump made sure to note that he and his campaign 'have no problem' with the band. 'I didn't see that,' he said of the Stones' request. 'Certainly I have no problem. I like Mick Jagger. I like their songs.' At a Trump rally Thursday night, the Stones' song, 'You Can't Always Get What You Want,' was played. Political campaigns don't need musicians' express permission to use their songs on the trail, just as long as they obtain a blanket license under performing rights organizations like ASCAP or BMI. Some licensing associations, like BMI, can also make special exceptions for their artists and include provisions in artists' contracts that would allow them to exclude certain songs from the license. The Stones aren't the only musicians prohibiting the Trump campaign from using their songs: pop singer Adele, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, and Neil Young have all objected to the campaign's use of their music during political rallies. In those cases, Trump's campaign have honored the artists' requests." [CBS News, 5/5/16<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-we-have-the-rights-to-use-rolling-stones-songs/>]


Campaign Staff
Trump Agreed He Would Have To Consider Giving A Raise To Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski. QUESTION: "It was this week that you suddenly on Tuesday night Ted Cruz decided to drop out. Is your campaign pretty much going to continue to operate the way it has with Corey and Paul Manafort. Since Corey has been there since the get go, have you given him a raise yet?" TRUMP: "That's something I have to think about. I never gave that too much thought. I'm going to have to think about that... We have a campaign that's unified. We have two people that do like each other despite reports in the press. Now they're starting to understand it. But we have people who get along. You know, we won Indiana in a landslide. We won New York and Pennsylvania and Maryland and Connecticut. Delaware. Rhode Island. All these landslides and that's why people really decided they better get out. That's the thing. I mean, when you're looking for unity, unity is winning too. We have to win." [Fox & Friends, Fox News, 5/6/16]

Trump Suggested He Would Reduce The National Debt By Persuading Bondholders To Accept Only Partial Repayment. "One day after assuring Americans he is not running for president 'to make things unstable for the country,' the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, said in a television interview Thursday that he might seek to reduce the national debt by persuading creditors to accept something less than full payment. Asked whether the United States needed to pay its debts in full, or whether he could negotiate a partial repayment, Mr. Trump told the cable network CNBC, 'I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.' He added, 'And if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you can't lose.'" [New York Times, 5/6/16<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/us/politics/donald-trumps-idea-to-cut-national-debt-get-creditors-to-accept-less.html?smid=tw-share>]

Trump's Suggestion That The Federal Government Would Negotiate Only Partial Repayment To Its Creditors Was Unprecedented, And Could Cause Interest Rates To Rise. "One day after assuring Americans he is not running for president 'to make things unstable for the country,' the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, said in a television interview Thursday that he might seek to reduce the national debt by persuading creditors to accept something less than full payment. Asked whether the United States needed to pay its debts in full, or whether he could negotiate a partial repayment, Mr. Trump told the cable network CNBC, 'I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.' He added, 'And if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you can't lose.' Such remarks by a major presidential candidate have no modern precedent. The United States government is able to borrow money at very low interest rates because Treasury securities are regarded as a safe investment, and any cracks in investor confidence have a long history of costing American taxpayers a lot of money. Experts also described Mr. Trump's vaguely sketched proposal as fanciful, saying there was no reason to think America's creditors would accept anything less than 100 cents on the dollar, regardless of Mr. Trump's deal-making prowess." [New York Times, 5/6/16<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/us/politics/donald-trumps-idea-to-cut-national-debt-get-creditors-to-accept-less.html?smid=tw-share>]

Trump's Suggestion About Repurchasing Debt Was A Common Practice In The Corporate World, But Was Not Feasible In Government. "Pressed to elaborate on his remarks, Mr. Trump did appear to step back. He said that he was not suggesting a default, but instead that the government could seek to repurchase debt for less than the face value of the securities. The government, in other words, would seek to repay less money than it borrowed... Repurchasing debt is a fairly common tactic in the corporate world, but it only works if the debt is trading at a discount. If creditors think they are going to get 80 cents for every dollar they are owed, they may be overjoyed to get 90 cents. Mr. Trump's companies had sometimes been able to retire debt at a discount because creditors feared they might default. But Mr. Trump's statement might show the limits of translating his business acumen into the world of government finance. The United States simply cannot pursue a similar strategy. The government runs an annual deficit, so it must borrow to retire existing debt. Any measures that would reduce the value of the existing debt, making it cheaper to repurchase, would increase the cost of issuing new debt. Such a threat also could undermine the stability of global financial markets."

Trade
Trump's Message To Consumers Whose Costs Would Rise Under His Trade Policies: Instead Of "Buying Five Dolls For Their Daughters; Maybe Buy Two Dolls." "Newspaper clippings suggest he vigorously opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993: 'The Mexicans want it and that doesn't sound good to me,' he was reported as saying. On trade, revealingly, and unusually for a man who admits to no weakness, he is even prepared to acknowledge the negative consequences of his populism. Asked whether his supporters would not object, under a Trumpian trade regime, to being forced to pay more for an American-made product, he says: 'Maybe they buy less of it. I see people buying five dolls for their daughters; maybe buy two dolls.'"

"A tweet showing Donald Trump eating a taco bowl on Cinco de Mayo while declaring 'I love Hispanics!' signals that the GOP front-runner is 'trying.' That's according to Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus, who told reporters on Friday that the GOP's presumptive nominee understands the importance of attracting Hispanic voters to the party, despite his past comments on undocumented immigrants. 'He's trying. Honestly, he's trying,' Priebus told Politico's Mike Allen at a breakfast event on Friday. 'I honestly think he understands that building and unifying and growing the party is the only way we're going to win. I think he gets that.'"

Trump On His Vice Presidential Pick: "I Will Announce It At The Convention. A Lot Of People Are Interested." "Donald Trump is suggesting that he will name his vice presidential pick at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this July. Speaking in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Trump said that it was still early in the process to select a running mate. 'It is early - we just won yesterday,' Trump said. 'I will announce it at the convention. A lot of people are interested.' Trump has not yet won the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination but now has a clear path to becoming the Republican standardbearer after his last two rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, dropped out in recent days. Trump also said that he would 'do whatever the maximum standard is' in terms of separating his business interests from his role as president if he wins in November."

House Speaker Paul Ryan On Supporting Trump: "I'm Just Not Ready To Do That At This Point." "U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that he cannot currently support Donald Trump, complicating the presumptive nominee's efforts to unite the Republican Party around him. 'Well, to be perfectly candid with you, I'm just not ready to do that at this point,' Ryan told CNN's Jake Tapper. 'I'm not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to.' Ryan, who has previously said he would support the nominee, said Trump needs to do more work to show that he is a true conservative who can unify the different wings of the Republican Party. 'I think what a lot of Republicans want to see is that we have a standard bearer that bears our standards,' he said, adding, 'I think conservatives want to know does he share our values and our principles on limited government, the proper role of the executive, adherence to the Constitution. There are lots of questions that conservatives, I think, are gonna want answers to, myself included. I want to be a part of this unifying process. I want to help to unify this party.'"

Trump Rejected Paul Ryan's Criticisms: "With Millions Of People Coming Into The Party, Obviously I'm Saying The Right Thing." QUESTION: "With Paul Ryan it could be sour grapes. How many times have you taken a shot at Mitt Romney on how he ran his campaign last time and who was his number two, Paul Ryan." TRUMP: "Well, they lost a race that should have been won. I was open about it, that was a race that should have been run. That was an easier race this year, but I'll win. You have seen the polls going up rapidly. But I was very, very surprised. He talks about unity, but what is this about unity? With millions of people coming into the party obviously I'm saying the right thing. The party was staid, it was having a lot of problems, whether it was the right thing or the wrong thing, they weren't doing now and now the Republican party is the talk of the world because there's no place and no party that's, you know, increasing in scope like we have.

I've also had many people say that I'm better off, but I don't believe that. We should have unity. It would be better to have him.  It's just too bad.  Many people think I'm better off.  Who knows?"

With Trump Set To Receive Classified Security Briefings, His Top Adviser Paul Manafort's Close Business Ties To Putin Allies Came Under Scrutiny. "With Donald Trump on the brink of receiving classified security briefings from the Central Intelligence Agency, U.S. foreign policy figures of both parties are raising concerns about a close Trump aide's ties to allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump's top adviser, Paul Manafort, has spent much of his recent career working for pro-Russian forces in Ukraine, and doing complex deals for an oligarch with close ties to Putin. And while a Democratic senator has already charged Trump is not responsible enough to receive secret information, Manafort's deep relationships with top pro-Russian figures raise special concerns. Manafort may be best known for managing the 2010 campaign of Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian politician whose ouster as president prompted a Russian invasion of the country. He has, according to court documents, managed tens of millions of dollars for Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch denied entry to the U.S. reportedly for ties to organized crime, but so close to Vladimir Putin that top Russian officials fought (unsuccessfully) to get him a visa."

Muslim Ban
Trump Said He Stood By His Proposed Ban On Foreign Muslims Coming To The United States Because "We Have To Be Vigilant. We Have To Be Strong." LESTER HOLT: "You're-you're speaking to the whole country now. You`ve said a lot of things we've talked about.

They resonated, they worked, they got you to where you are today. But as you try to appeal to the entire country, do you stand by them? Do you stand, for example, by the idea of a-- of a ban against foreign Muslims coming here?" DONALD TRUMP: "I do. We have to be vigilant. We have to be strong. We have to see what`s going on.

RNC Chairman Priebus Said Trump's Proposed Muslim Ban Was "Not Something That I Believe In Or Our Party Believes In. I Believe Our Party Is The Party Of The Open Door." "Hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan refused to embrace Trump, Priebus, who has appealed for GOP unity, acknowledged that significant gaps remain between Trump and the Republican Party on policy and style. Priebus said the GOP does not endorse Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration and said Trump must adjust the way he presents himself to the Latino community. 'It's not something that I believe in or our party believes in,' Priebus said of the Muslim ban. 'I believe our party is the party of the open door. Our party is the party of opportunity and freedom and equality and it always will remain such.' A longtime Ryan ally, Priebus said he thought the Speaker was 'being honest about how he feels' about Trump, while expressing confidence that Ryan will ultimately back the party's nominee. He added that he is helping to broker a meeting between Ryan and Trump next week to start bridging the divide.

Hillary Clinton
Trump: "Bernie Sanders Said [Hillary Clinton] Is Not Qualified To Run For President Because She Suffers From Bad Judgment. And I Think That's True." TRUMP: "Well, you know, bad judgment is a couple of words that we can use. And they were used by Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders said she is not qualified to run for president because she suffers from bad judgment. And I think that`s true. All you have to do is look at the e-mail scandal. She's under FBI investigation now. And maybe she will survive because the Democrats are protecting her. But that`s the only reason she`ll survive." [NBC Nightly News, NBC, 5/4/16]

Trump On Whether He Would Make Personal Attacks Against The Clinton: "I'd Like To See A Very High-Level Policy Oriented Campaign.

Otherwise, he becomes part of it." HOLT: "So I mean you-- you would bring it up, though?" TRUMP: "I would bring it up depending on what they bring up. It depends. I'd like to see a very high-level policy oriented campaign. If they're-- if they treat me properly, I'm going to treat them properly. It would be a beautiful thing to see. You don`t see it often, but I would like to see it." [NBC Nightly News, NBC, 5/4/16]

Trump Put His Deputy Campaign Manager, Michael Glassner, In Charge Of Convention Planning.

Trump: "I Hear Hillary Has Nothing But Problems. She Wants All The Miners To Be Fired. And She Wants Wages For People To Go Down. If You Look At What She's Going To Do, She's Going To Be So Bad On Jobs That Wages Are Going To Go Down For Workers." TRUMP: "Hillary is not a unifier. Talk about a unifier, I was not surprised to see all the protesters and last night, I was in West Virginia. I got the award from the coal miners -- West Virginia coal miners association and the endorsement most importantly. It was amazing. We had probably 20,000, maybe 25,000 people there last night in West Virginia." QUESTION: "Usually only endorse only Democrats." TRUMP: "Well, I heard that. I have heard that. This was one of the first times they ever endorsed a Republican and it was unanimous. It was a love fest. I hear Hillary has nothing but problems. She wants all the miners to be fired. And she wants wages for people to go down. If you look at what she's going to do, she's going to be so bad on jobs that wages are going to go down for workers. Hillary is going to be a disaster for the party. But I hope she wins, but she -- I must say this. If she does win, she shouldn't, because the e-mail scandal should take her down. But I don't think it's going to because I think she's being protected by the Democrats." [Fox & Friends, Fox News, 5/6/16]

Trump: "As Far As Briefings And All, I Will Do Much Better Than Hillary Clinton Ever Did With Her E-Mails, Which She Exposed The Entire Country To Whatever She's Learning As Secretary Of State. You Don't Get Any Worse Than That." BAIER: "Who throws things against the wall and sees what sticks. Citing reports, maybe they're not backed up. Sometimes they're truth-challenged. And as we've seen, you really don't pay any political price for that because you have a loyal following. But there's a concern that now as GOP nominee, in just a matter of weeks you're going to be getting classified briefings by the CIA and FBI. And will your style be the same on the campaign trail? Kind of throwing things against the wall?" TRUMP: "First of all, when I cite reports, or when I cite, you know, major magazine articles or something, it's up to people to believe it or not to believe it. I'm not writing it myself. I'm not going out and doing the research so I think that's, you know, a very acceptable thing to do. As far as briefings and all, I will do much better than Hillary Clinton ever did with her e-mails, which she exposed the entire country to whatever she's learning as secretary of state. You don't get any worse than that. So I think that, frankly, yes, I can keep a secret probably better than almost I know. Maybe better than anybody I know."

Trump On Hillary Clinton: "She Made A Mistake When She Voted For The [Iraq] War. She Made A Big Mistake With Syria. And She Made A Tremendous Mistake. Look At Benghazi." TRUMP: "Of course it does. I criticized his decision to go into Iraq." BAIER: "Now on that, as I just want to clear that up. You've come up with articles. But there's audio of you before the war--" TRUMP: "No, there isn't. No, there isn't." BAIER: "There's a BuzzFeed piece that has--" TRUMP: "Let me just say -- yes, I'm talking to Howard Stern. Weeks before. First time anybody ever -- you know, I was a civilian. First time anyone ever asked me about the war, about should we go in because there was the question, are we going in? And I said very weakly, well, blah, blah, blah. Yes, I guess." BAIER: "And then on the first day of the war--" TRUMP: "Then by the time--" BAIER: "You said that it's a tremendous military success." TRUMP: "No, what I said, what I said is, it was a success, because they thought it was a success. But before that, I said they shouldn't go in. And then all during, for many years, I said this war is a huge mistake. In fact in 2003, 2004, they did an article, a big article in one of the magazines and Reuters did an article where I'm very critical of the war, get out, it's a mistake." BAIER: "The point is to you it's crystal clear in your mind. Are you going to hit Hillary Clinton on this issue?" TRUMP: "She made a mistake when she voted for the war. She made a big mistake with Syria. And she made a tremendous mistake. Look at Benghazi. You know, she did the whole ad, where who do you trust at 3:00 in the morning? Well, you don't trust her because she was sleeping, all right? And there were plenty of calls coming in, she was sleeping. She took them from Blumenthal, but she didn't take them from the ambassador." [Special Report With Bret Baier, Fox News, 5/5/16]

"Trump against Clinton: the general election is shaping up to be hot and ugly. There appears to be little prospect of Mr Trump moderating his positions, by lurching to the more ameliorative centre that Republican leaders-fearing electoral annihilation-recommend. Whether he believes in his positions or not, they are mostly too extreme to be credibly revised. Apparently vindicated by his success in the primaries, Mr Trump seems to have little interest in changing tack. That also goes for his aggressive, often offensive methods. Turning to Mrs Clinton, his one-time wedding guest, the presumptive Republican nominee is disdainful. 'She's playing the woman card. That's all she's got going. She's got nothing else going. The only thing she's got is the woman card. And she plays it to the hilt,' fumes Mr Trump, whom 70% of American women dislike."

Trump Campaign National Finance Chair, Steve Mnuchin, Said He Didn't See Raising Money For The General Election As "Being Inconsistent" With Trump's Rhetoric Railing Against Special Interests And Donors. "For 10 months as he ran an insurgent presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump excoriated the Republican Party's donor class as a group of special interests whose support he did not want or need. That was then. Now Mr. Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee, with a newly-minted national finance chairman, Steve Mnuchin, who worked for Soros Fund Management and Goldman Sachs. And since Mr. Trump seems to have little interest in pouring hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money into a general election battle that will cost at least $1 billion, Mr. Mnuchin will lead efforts to raise that money from others. Mr. Trump is already facing a reluctant donor community, which he often demonized in his speeches, saying he will not be beholden to special interests or their money. 'I don't really see this as a change,' Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview. 'We're not looking to raise money from special interest groups and things like that. The majority of the money that's coming in is going to be in small and medium-sized donations.'

Trump's National Finance Chairman Was A Wall Street Veteran And Had Made Significant Campaign Contributions To Democrats. "After promising that he would no longer be self-funding (a term applied loosely here because Trump has been accepting contributions for the entirety of his campaign), the presumptive Republican nominee hired private investor and Wall Street veteran Steven Mnuchin as his national finance chairman. Conventional wisdom suggests this would complicate any attempts from Trump to paint Clinton as a Wall Street shill, but this is not a candidate governed by conventional wisdom. Like many people in Trump's inner circle-for example, Trump-Mnuchin has contributed a significant amount of money to Democratic candidates in the past, including Hillary Clinton. According to filings from the Federal Election Commission, Mnuchin has contributed over $8,000 to Clinton since 2000. He has also given to Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP candidate who went on a public crusade against Trump, and President Barack Obama, who has lacerated Trump at every possible opportunity."

Trump's National Finance Director Said He Had Received Calls From Hedge-Fund Managers And Others On Wall Street Expressing Their Support For Trump. "He cashed in on Goldman Sachs's 1999 initial public offering and left in 2002 to join Lampert's hedge fund. A year later he started a fund with George Soros's money, and in 2004, he formed Dune with two other ex-Goldman partners. Mnuchin led a group that raised $1.55 billion to buy IndyMac Bank, the California mortgage lender that collapsed in 2008, from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Notoriously press-shy, Mnuchin endured 2011 protests on the lawn of his Bel Air mansion by foreclosed homeowners angered at his lender's handling of soured mortgages. In 2014, he agreed to sell the bank, rebranded as OneWest Bank, to CIT Group Inc., the commercial lender run by John Thain, another Goldman alum. Mnuchin said Thursday he's already gotten calls from fellow hedge-fund managers and others on Wall Street expressing their support. To those who worry about what a Trump presidency would look like, Mnuchin said he's convinced the candidate would place smart people in positions of power."

The Trump Campaign Did Not Answer Whether Any Of The Money Raised By Finance Chairman Mnuchin Would Go Into Trump's Campaign War Chest. "On Thursday, Trump tapped hedge fund manager and film investor Steven Mnuchin to assemble a national fundraising operation, tasked with raising at least $1 billion for the general election. That will probably require the creation of a traditional bundling operation, in which rich supporters are offered perks for collecting checks from their friends and family. Although the campaign said that Trump still plans to put 'substantial money' into his campaign, the first-time candidate will be seeking support from the very donor class he has vilified. If Trump 'makes it clear he wants to change the rules, but he's stuck playing under them, I don't think there will be a big turn-off,' said conservative political consultant John Pudner, whose group Take Back Our Republic seeks to reduce the influence of the wealthy on politics. 'But if it looks like he's just abandoning the one thing that got him here, I think there'll be trouble'...

Pro-Trump Great America PAC's Chief Strategist, Jesse Benton, Was Convicted Of Felony Charges Including Conspiracy And Causing False Records From Ron Paul's 2012 Presidential Campaign. "The chief strategist of a pro-Donald Trump super PAC was found guilty on felony charges in federal court on Thursday as part of a group that concealed the expenditure of campaign money to buy the endorsement of an Iowa politician for the 2012 presidential campaign of Ron Paul. Along with Jesse Benton, who was hired to lead the pro-Trump Great America PAC in March, former Paul aides Dimitri Kesari and John Tate were also found guilty by a jury in Iowa. Both Benton and Tate were longtime advisers to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), while Kesari served as deputy campaign manager for Ron Paul's 2012 bid. As recently as Tuesday, Benton was issuing statements to the media about the super PAC, after POLITICO reported that former Ronald Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins was joining the team. 'You know it's a serious operation when Ed Rollins is involved,' Benton told CNN in response to the report. It is unclear what impact Benton's conviction will have on his role with the pro-Trump super PAC. A Justice Department official confirmed the convictions to POLITICO, which include conspiracy, causing false records, causing false campaign expenditure reports and false statements scheme. The convictions are related to an alleged coverup of the attempted bribing of Iowa state Sen. Kent Sorensen. While Sorensen initially supported Michele Bachmann, he switched his support to Ron Paul, prompting allegations of bribery from the Bachmann campaign."

 if by that is meant speaking in a calmer tone and spewing fewer insults &#8212; though his National Enquirer scandal-mongering on the day of his great victory is not an encouraging portent. But he cannot change who he is or how he seized this moment. His nomination
 is a calamity for the Republican Party, and Republicans will have to sort out how it happened and how they might recover. But the more urgent task is to ensure that Mr. Trump does not become a calamity visited on the United States and the world. For all his
 unpredicted success, the number of Americans who have voted for him so far amounts to only 4.7 percent of eligible voters, according to a calculation by the organization FairVote. As conservatives of principle recognize, he can be stopped, and he must be.&#8221;

 important was to get out of Jersey and become a Manhattan developer,&#8217; says NYU&#8217;s Moss. Kushner had no profile in the city, but that changed in 2006 when he bought the Observer for what was widely reported to be $10 million. &#8216;Jared saw it as a way to have a
 voice in New York,&#8217; says Bob Sommer, who was president of Observer Media from 2007 to 2009. &#8216;It helped set him up as a serious player.&#8217; In 2007, Kushner paid $1.8 billion for 666 Fifth Ave., an aluminum-jacketed office tower that takes up an entire block front
 between 52nd and 53rd streets in Manhattan, near Rockefeller Center. At the time it was the highest price ever paid for a single building in New York. Kushner didn&#8217;t put down much of his own money. He financed the deal with a $1.2 billion loan from Barclays
 Capital and an additional $535 million of short-term debt. It was a lot of leverage, but many real estate investors were borrowing heavily at the time. This deal, along with the purchase of the Observer, established Kushner as a force in Manhattan.&#8221; [Bloomberg,

 I Know These Guys.&#8221;</b> &#8220;His unusual talents are part of the answer. Charismatic, tactically astute, charming at times and ruthless, Mr Trump is a far more formidable politician than almost anyone had suspected. His outrages have kept print- and broadcast-media
 attention focused on him; with nearly 8m followers on Twitter and a flair for pithy invective, he rules on social media, too. At the time of his entry into the race, his slander against Mexicans seemed naive as well as boorish; it now seems remarkable how
 well-formed his pitch to resentful, working-class whites was. He says this was because he understands and shares their concerns. &#8216;I worked summers when I was going to school with carpenters and electricians. You know my father was a builder in Brooklyn and
 Queens, predominantly&#8230;I worked with all of these guys, I know these guys.&#8217; That has a rare ring of truth. Expedience explains his positions on many issues, including guns, which he once disliked and now advocates, abortion, which he once accepted and now opposes,
 God, in Whom he previously showed little interest but now praises. His xenophobia and protectionism, however, have form.&#8221; [The Economist,

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Several Musical Artists Have Asked The Trump Campaign Not To Use Their Music At His Rallies, Including The Rolling Stones, Adele, Steven Tyler, And Neil Young.</b> &#8220;When asked about the issue by CNBC, Trump made sure to note that he
 and his campaign &#8216;have no problem&#8217; with the band. &#8216;I didn't see that,&#8217; he said of the Stones' request. &#8216;Certainly I have no problem. I like Mick Jagger. I like their songs.&#8217; At a Trump rally Thursday night, the Stones' song, &#8216;You Can't Always Get What You
 Want,&#8217; was played. Political campaigns don't need musicians' express permission to use their songs on the trail, just as long as they obtain a blanket license under performing rights organizations like ASCAP or BMI. Some licensing associations, like BMI, can
 also make special exceptions for their artists and include provisions in artists' contracts that would allow them to exclude certain songs from the license. The Stones aren't the only musicians prohibiting the Trump campaign from using their songs: pop singer
 Adele, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, and Neil Young have all objected to the campaign's use of their music during political rallies. In those cases, Trump's campaign have honored the artists' requests.&#8221; [CBS News,

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Trump&#8217;s Suggestion That The Federal Government Would Negotiate Only Partial Repayment To Its Creditors Was Unprecedented, And Could Cause Interest Rates To Rise.</b> &#8220;One day after assuring Americans he is not running for president &#8216;to

 it was good. So, therefore, you can&#8217;t lose.&#8217; Such remarks by a major presidential candidate have no modern precedent. The United States government is able to borrow money at very low interest rates because Treasury securities are regarded as a safe investment,
 and any cracks in investor confidence have a long history of costing American taxpayers a lot of money. Experts also described Mr. Trump&#8217;s vaguely sketched proposal as fanciful, saying there was no reason to think America&#8217;s creditors would accept anything
 less than 100 cents on the dollar, regardless of Mr. Trump&#8217;s deal-making prowess.&#8221; [New York Times,

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Trump&#8217;s Suggestion About Repurchasing Debt Was A Common Practice In The Corporate World, But Was Not Feasible In Government.</b> &#8220;Pressed to elaborate on his remarks, Mr. Trump did appear to step back. He said that he was not suggesting
 a default, but instead that the government could seek to repurchase debt for less than the face value of the securities. The government, in other words, would seek to repay less money than it borrowed&#8230; Repurchasing debt is a fairly common tactic in the corporate
 world, but it only works if the debt is trading at a discount. If creditors think they are going to get 80 cents for every dollar they are owed, they may be overjoyed to get 90 cents. Mr. Trump&#8217;s companies had sometimes been able to retire debt at a discount
 because creditors feared they might default. But Mr. Trump&#8217;s statement might show the limits of translating his business acumen into the world of government finance. The United States simply cannot pursue a similar strategy. The government runs an annual deficit,
 so it must borrow to retire existing debt. Any measures that would reduce the value of the existing debt, making it cheaper to repurchase, would increase the cost of issuing new debt. Such a threat also could undermine the stability of global financial markets.&#8221;

 Ryan, who has previously said he would support the nominee, said Trump needs to do more work to show that he is a true conservative who can unify the different wings of the Republican Party. &#8216;I think what a lot of Republicans want to see is that we have a
 standard bearer that bears our standards,&#8217; he said, adding, &#8216;I think conservatives want to know does he share our values and our principles on limited government, the proper role of the executive, adherence to the Constitution. There are lots of questions
 that conservatives, I think, are gonna want answers to, myself included. I want to be a part of this unifying process. I want to help to unify this party.&#8217;&#8221; [Politico,

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>With Trump Set To Receive Classified Security Briefings, His Top Adviser Paul Manafort&#8217;s Close Business Ties To Putin Allies Came Under Scrutiny.</b> &#8220;With Donald Trump on the brink of receiving classified security briefings from the
 Central Intelligence Agency, U.S. foreign policy figures of both parties are raising concerns about a close Trump aide&#8217;s ties to allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump&#8217;s top adviser, Paul Manafort, has spent much of his recent career working for
 pro-Russian forces in Ukraine, and doing complex deals for an oligarch with close ties to Putin. And while a Democratic senator has already charged Trump is not responsible enough to receive secret information, Manafort&#8217;s deep relationships with top pro-Russian
 figures raise special concerns. Manafort may be best known for managing the 2010 campaign of Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian politician whose ouster as president prompted a Russian invasion of the country. He has, according to court documents, managed tens
 of millions of dollars for Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch denied entry to the U.S. reportedly for ties to organized crime, but so close to Vladimir Putin that top Russian officials fought (unsuccessfully) to get him a visa.&#8221; [BuzzFeed,

<b>&#8220;I Don&#8217;t Really See This As A Change. We&#8217;re Not Looking To Raise Money From Special Interest Groups And Things Like That. The Majority Of The Money That&#8217;s Coming In Is Going To Be In Small And Medium-Sized Donations.&#8221;</b> &#8220;For 10 months as he ran an insurgent
 presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump excoriated the Republican Party&#8217;s donor class as a group of special interests whose support he did not want or need. That was then. Now Mr. Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee, with a newly-minted national finance
 chairman, Steve Mnuchin, who worked for Soros Fund Management and Goldman Sachs. And since Mr. Trump seems to have little interest in pouring hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money into a general election battle that will cost at least $1 billion,
 Mr. Mnuchin will lead efforts to raise that money from others. Mr. Trump is already facing a reluctant donor community, which he often demonized in his speeches, saying he will not be beholden to special interests or their money. &#8216;I don&#8217;t really see this as
 a change,&#8217; Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview. &#8216;We&#8217;re not looking to raise money from special interest groups and things like that. The majority of the money that&#8217;s coming in is going to be in small and medium-sized donations.&#8217; &#8216;I don&#8217;t see that being inconsistent&#8217;
 with Mr. Trump&#8217;s railing against Wall Street fat cats, Mr. Mnuchin said.&#8221; [New York Times,

 donor. Mr. Mnuchin anticipated that roughly 30 staffers would end up devoted to fund-raising for the campaign and party.&#8221; [New York Times,

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Trump&#8217;s National Finance Chairman Was A Wall Street Veteran And Had Made Significant Campaign Contributions To Democrats.</b> &#8220;After promising that he would no longer be self-funding (a term applied loosely here because Trump has been
 accepting contributions for the entirety of his campaign), the presumptive Republican nominee hired private investor and Wall Street veteran Steven Mnuchin as his national finance chairman. Conventional wisdom suggests this would complicate any attempts from
 Trump to paint Clinton as a Wall Street shill, but this is not a candidate governed by conventional wisdom. Like many people in Trump&#8217;s inner circle&#8212;for example, Trump&#8212;Mnuchin has contributed a significant amount of money to Democratic candidates in the past,
 including Hillary Clinton. According to filings from the Federal Election Commission, Mnuchin has contributed over $8,000 to Clinton since 2000. He has also given to Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP candidate who went on a public crusade against Trump, and President
 Barack Obama, who has lacerated Trump at every possible opportunity.&#8221; [Daily Beast,

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Trump&#8217;s National Finance Director Said He Had Received Calls From Hedge-Fund Managers And Others On Wall Street Expressing Their Support For Trump.</b> &#8220;He cashed in on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 1999 initial public offering and left in 2002 to
 join Lampert&#8217;s hedge fund. A year later he started a fund with George Soros&#8217;s money, and in 2004, he formed Dune with two other ex-Goldman partners. Mnuchin led a group that raised $1.55 billion to buy IndyMac Bank, the California mortgage lender that collapsed
 in 2008, from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Notoriously press-shy, Mnuchin endured 2011 protests on the lawn of his Bel Air mansion by foreclosed homeowners angered at his lender&#8217;s handling of soured mortgages. In 2014, he agreed to sell the bank, rebranded
 as OneWest Bank, to CIT Group Inc., the commercial lender run by John Thain, another Goldman alum. Mnuchin said Thursday he&#8217;s already gotten calls from fellow hedge-fund managers and others on Wall Street expressing their support. To those who worry about
 what a Trump presidency would look like, Mnuchin said he&#8217;s convinced the candidate would place smart people in positions of power.&#8221; [Bloomberg,

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Trump Campaign Did Not Answer Whether Any Of The Money Raised By Finance Chairman Mnuchin Would Go Into Trump&#8217;s Campaign War Chest.</b> &#8220;On Thursday, Trump tapped hedge fund manager and film investor Steven Mnuchin to assemble a
 national fundraising operation, tasked with raising at least $1 billion for the general election. That will probably require the creation of a traditional bundling operation, in which rich supporters are offered perks for collecting checks from their friends
 and family. Although the campaign said that Trump still plans to put &#8216;substantial money&#8217; into his campaign, the first-time candidate will be seeking support from the very donor class he has vilified. If Trump &#8216;makes it clear he wants to change the rules, but
 he&#8217;s stuck playing under them, I don&#8217;t think there will be a big turn-off,&#8217; said conservative political consultant John Pudner, whose group Take Back Our Republic seeks to reduce the influence of the wealthy on politics. &#8216;But if it looks like he&#8217;s just abandoning
 the one thing that got him here, I think there&#8217;ll be trouble&#8217;&#8230; When asked if Trump was undercutting his pledge to be independent of big donors, spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded in an email, &#8216;Mr. Trump is not raising money for his own campaign. He is raising

 super PAC was found guilty on felony charges in federal court on Thursday as part of a group that concealed the expenditure of campaign money to buy the endorsement of an Iowa politician for the 2012 presidential campaign of Ron Paul. Along with Jesse Benton,
 who was hired to lead the pro-Trump Great America PAC in March, former Paul aides Dimitri Kesari and John Tate were also found guilty by a jury in Iowa. Both Benton and Tate were longtime advisers to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), while Kesari served as deputy campaign
 manager for Ron Paul's 2012 bid. As recently as Tuesday, Benton was issuing statements to the media about the super PAC, after POLITICO reported that former Ronald Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins was joining the team. &#8216;You know it's a serious operation
 when Ed Rollins is involved,&#8217; Benton told CNN in response to the report. It is unclear what impact Benton's conviction will have on his role with the pro-Trump super PAC. A Justice Department official confirmed the convictions to POLITICO, which include conspiracy,
 causing false records, causing false campaign expenditure reports and false statements scheme. The convictions are related to an alleged coverup of the attempted bribing of Iowa state Sen. Kent Sorensen. While Sorensen initially supported Michele Bachmann,
 he switched his support to Ron Paul, prompting allegations of bribery from the Bachmann campaign.&#8221; [Politico,
