I'm running home to grab my laptop charger. Will be back at 6pm to media monitor. I can take the morning monitoring shift too, if that will make Team Regional smile. Will work with Akshai or someone to make sure my monitoring is up to snuff. 

Lastly, for those of us w/o cable packages at home, we should get a comms account for IQ Media &/or Snapstream, not to clip or download video (we have quota on how much data we can process through those services), but to monitor shows. 

Have fun at the ballpark.
