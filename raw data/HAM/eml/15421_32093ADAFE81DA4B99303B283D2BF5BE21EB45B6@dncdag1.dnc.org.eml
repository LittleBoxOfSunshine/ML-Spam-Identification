 taxes at the bottom of the earning scale. Dubya reduced the estate tax; Je=
b would eliminate it entirely. Dubya cut the top tax rate to 35 percent, wh=
ile Jeb would lower it all the way to 28 percent. Unlike his brother, he wo=

NEW YORK MAGAZINE // JONATHAN CHAIT

George W. Bush passed a sweeping across-the-board tax cut in 2001, promisin=
g his plan would promote faster economic growth while still allowing budget=
 surpluses. Instead, Bush's plan brought back the structural deficits that =
had disappeared during the 1990s, along with a mediocre recovery that was i=
tself inflated by a housing bubble, the popping of which culminated in the =
deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression. You might think that th=
e brother of that guy would go out of his way to prove that he has differen=
t ideas for fiscal policy. Instead, Jeb Bush has unveiled his tax-cut plan,=
 and it's the same thing his brother did, only more extreme.

Bush's plan, unveiled in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, would replicate his b=
rother's program in extremis. Like Dubya, Jeb would reduce income taxes at =
the bottom of the earning scale. Dubya reduced the estate tax; Jeb would el=
iminate it entirely. Dubya cut the top tax rate to 35 percent, while Jeb wo=
uld lower it all the way to 28 percent. Unlike his brother, he would also s=
lash corporate tax rates, from 28 percent to 20 percent.

George W. put a number on the size of his tax cut. He proposed a tax cut of=
 $1.6 trillion over a decade, which Congress ultimately reduced to $1.35 tr=
illion, though subsequent tax cuts pushed the size higher. It is impossible=
 to precisely measure the impact of the Bush tax cuts on either the budget =
or the economy, since nobody can know what would have happened under identi=
cal conditions if the tax cuts had never been enacted.

But the results certainly were not good. Economist William Gale, using main=
stream forecasting assumptions, estimated that the Bush tax cuts slightly r=
educed economic growth, as the (small) negative effects of higher long-term=
 deficits outweighed the (even smaller) positive incentive effects of lower=
 rates. The biggest impact of the Bush tax cuts was not its meager, indirec=
t effects on growth, but its large, direct effects on income and the federa=
l budget: Revenue cratered, and taxpayers - disproportionately those with h=
igher incomes - had way more money.

Jeb Bush, unlike his brother, has not put a number on the size of his propo=
sed tax cut. Indeed, he has not even described his plan as a "tax cut" - Bu=
sh's op-ed calls his proposals "reforms," a "complete overhaul of the tax c=
ode," "policies," or at one point "relief and reform," perhaps to spare him=
 from acknowledging its impact on the deficit or any trade-offs it would re=
quire. He promises to "cap the deductions used by the wealthy and Washingto=
n special interests," implying that he will stick it to the rich.

But a very large and very regressive tax cut is exactly what Bush has descr=
ibed here. It is a provable fact, despite his effort to escape scrutiny thr=
ough vagueness. In 2012, the Tax Policy Center analyzed proposals by Mitt R=
omney, which ran along the same lines as what Bush has put forward. Like Bu=
sh, Romney proposed to reduce the top tax rate to 28 percent, eliminate the=
 estate tax, and eliminate the taxes that pay for Obamacare. Romney also ca=
lled his plan a "tax reform," and promised it would not add to the deficit.=
 The Tax Policy Center found that the loss in revenue from these proposed c=
uts was so large that even the complete elimination of every deduction and =
loophole that benefits the rich would not fill the fiscal hole. Therefore, =
enacting his proposed rate cuts without reducing revenue would have resulte=
d in a tax hike on the middle class to pay for the tax cut for the rich.

Bush, unlike Romney, does not promise revenue neutrality. But he is offerin=
g essentially the same goodies to high-income taxpayers. So his huge tax cu=
t for the rich would - as a necessary, arithmetic outcome - result in some =
combination of higher taxes for the non-rich and reduced revenue - ergo, hi=
gher debt. Bush has not explained what spending he would cut in order to of=
fset the higher deficits his tax cuts would usher in. He has proposed to ra=
ise the Social Security retirement age, but the savings of these cuts would=
 be minuscule in comparison with the revenue loss.

For obvious reasons, Bush does not cast his policies as a reprise of his br=
other's. Instead he argues that they replicate the success he claims to hav=
e brought about as governor of Florida:

I know that enacting these policies works because I've done it before. As g=
overnor of Florida, I cut taxes every single year - returning a total of $1=
9 billion to Floridians. The state's economy took off, growing at an averag=
e rate of 4.4%. Households saw bigger paychecks as median incomes rose by a=
n average of $1,300. Florida's pro-growth climate created 1.3 million new j=
obs.

In fact, economists have examined the performance of Florida's economy unde=
r Bush and found that the high rates of growth were attributable to a housi=
ng bubble much larger than the one in the country as a whole. (Jim Tankersl=
ey has a particularly strong analysis, but others have reached the same con=
clusions.) During Bush's tenure, housing prices in Florida soared, fueling =
economic growth. Bush was fortunate to leave office at the beginning of 200=
7, before the popping of the housing bubble wreaked havoc on Florida's econ=
omy and state budget.

The Florida economy under Jeb Bush was the American economy under George W.=
 Bush, but more so. His tax plan is the same thing. It has been clear for m=
onths that the policy direction of the Republican Party is a return to Bush=
ism. Marco Rubio is trying this too, as is John Kasich. The odd proposition=
 of the Jeb candidacy is that the man best positioned to sell this idea to =
a skeptical America is another guy named Bush.

nter analyzed proposals by Mitt Romney,
 which ran along the same lines as what Bush has put forward. Like Bush, Ro=
mney proposed to reduce the top tax rate to 28 percent, eliminate the estat=
e tax, and eliminate the taxes that pay for Obamacare. Romney also called h=
is plan a &#8220;tax reform,&#8221; and promised
 it would not add to the deficit. The Tax Policy Center found that the loss=
 in revenue from these proposed cuts was so large that even the complete el=
imination of every deduction and loophole that benefits the rich would not =
fill the fiscal hole. Therefore,
 enacting his proposed rate cuts without reducing revenue would have result=
ed in a tax hike on the middle class to pay for the tax cut for the rich.</=

<br>
<span style=3D"background:white">Bush, unlike Romney, does not promise reve=
nue neutrality. But he is offering essentially the same goodies to high-inc=
ome taxpayers. So his huge tax cut for the rich would &#8212; as a necessar=
y, arithmetic outcome &#8212; result in some combination
 of higher taxes for the non-rich and reduced revenue &#8212; ergo, higher =
debt. Bush has not explained what spending he would cut in order to offset =
the higher deficits his tax cuts would usher in. He has proposed to raise t=
he Social Security retirement age, but
 the savings of these cuts would be minuscule in comparison with the revenu=
e loss.</span><br>
<br>
<span style=3D"background:white">For obvious reasons, Bush does not cast hi=
s policies as a reprise of his brother&#8217;s. Instead he argues that they=
 replicate the success he claims to have brought about as governor of Flori=
da:</span><br>
<br>
<i><span style=3D"background:white">I know that enacting these policies wor=
ks because I&#8217;ve done it before. As governor of Florida, I cut taxes e=
very single year &#8212; returning a total of $19 billion to Floridians. Th=
e state&#8217;s economy took off, growing at an average
 rate of 4.4%. Households saw bigger paychecks as median incomes rose by an=
 average of $1,300. Florida&#8217;s pro-growth climate created 1.3 million =
new jobs.</span><br>
</i><br>
<span style=3D"background:white">In fact, economists have examined the perf=
ormance of Florida&#8217;s economy under Bush and found that the high rates=
 of growth were attributable to a housing bubble much larger than the one i=
n the country as a whole. (Jim Tankersley
 has a particularly strong analysis, but others have reached the same concl=
usions.) During Bush&#8217;s tenure, housing prices in Florida soared, fuel=
ing economic growth. Bush was fortunate to leave office at the beginning of=
 2007, before the popping of the housing
 bubble wreaked havoc on Florida&#8217;s economy and state budget.</span><b=
r>
<br>
<span style=3D"background:white">The Florida economy under Jeb Bush was the=
 American economy under George W. Bush, but more so. His tax plan is the sa=
me thing. It has been clear for months that the policy direction of the Rep=
ublican Party is a return to Bushism.
 Marco Rubio is trying this too, as is John Kasich. The odd proposition of =
the Jeb candidacy is that the man best positioned to sell this idea to a sk=
eptical America is another guy named Bush.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
