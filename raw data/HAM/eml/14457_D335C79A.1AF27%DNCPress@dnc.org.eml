Cruz refuses to answer on personhood during MSNBC town hall<http://www.msnb=
c.com/msnbc/cruz-refuses-answer-personhood-during-msnbc-town-hall?cid=3Dsm_=
tw_msnbc>
JANE C. TIMM // MSNBC

Ted Cruz refused to answer eight direct questions Thursday about whether or=
 not he=92d support personhood bills =96 legislation that would give Consti=
tutional rights to fertilized eggs =96 despite pledging to support it last =
year.

I told you I=92m not going to get into the labels, but what I will say is w=
e should protect life. But I=92m not interested in anything that restricts =
birth control,=94 he said after being pressed at length by Chuck Todd in th=
e MSNBC town hall that will air in full Thursday at 8 p.m. =93And I=92m not=
 interested in anything that restricts in vitro fertilization because I thi=
nk parents who are struggling to create life, to have a child, that is a wo=
nderful thing.=94

This carefully-crafted answer seem designed to speak to all sides of the de=
bate, as a sort of political code-switching. His answer, read with the diff=
erent definitions of birth control and abortion held by each side of the de=
bate, means different things. Anti-abortion activists consider emergency co=
ntraception and intrauterine devices  (IUDs) =96 birth control methods doct=
ors say prevent, but do not end, pregnancy =96 to be =93early abortion,=94 =
and some oppose common in vitro fertilization procedures because the embryo=
 may not survive the process. But Cruz=92s determined refusal to disavow pe=
rsonhood tows most of the anti-abortion activists=92 party line, while stre=
ssing support of birth control and IVF speaks to the more moderate Republic=
an voters he is trying to appeal to in New York.

It=92s unclear what Cruz defines to be birth control =96 he wouldn=92t say =
when asked repeatedly =96 but he referenced the Little Sisters of the Poor =
Supreme Court case, saying it involves  =93abortion-inducing drugs.=94 The =
case focuses on contraception, emergency contraception, and IUDs.

RELATED: Ted Cruz tackles =91the condom police=92

The New York primary marks a crucial turning point for Cruz=92s candidacy: =
It=92s the first of many more moderate states in the primary schedule, wher=
e the very conservative senator needs to start broadening his appeal to kee=
p going.

Cruz has no real hope of winning outright here =96 front-runner Donald Trum=
p is still the odds-on favorite in his home state =96 but he needs to peel =
off a significant number of delegates if he wants to keep Trump from winnin=
g a majority of the nation=92s delegates, which would force a contested con=
vention that puts the nomination in the hands of delegates the Cruz campaig=
n has been working hard to woo.

Cruz insisted during the MSNBC Town Hall that the strength of the GOP has b=
een his =93focus every day=94 right now, and that =93the way to win and tur=
n the country around is to unite the party.=94

Read the full exchange on personhood below.

TODD: Good thing you brought up abortion. You=92ve been on both sides of th=
e personhood issue. You were hesitant to support it and then you signed a p=
ledge saying you wanted to see personhood =96 this idea that the minute, th=
e minute, of conception essentially that that fetus has rights.

(CROWD CLAPS)

That=92s a divisive issue. It get=92s into some contraception disputes. Whe=
re are you on personhood? Are you going to pursue this as an agenda or are =
you just simply supporting the idea? Do you know what I mean by the differe=
nce?

CRUZ: Well listen, some of the labels in this debate can get confusing beca=
use different people mean different things about labels. I don=92t want to =
get in a back and forth ion labels. I believe every human life is a gift fr=
om God and we should cherish and protect and celebrate them.

=93(CROWD CHEERS)
TODD: So you decide when life begins. I mean, I=92ll be honest. That=92s th=
e dispute here. Right? When does life begin? And when do they have constitu=
tional rights?

CRUZ: I will say, when it comes to birth control. It is clear that American=
s have a right to birth control. I am not interested in any legislation=97

TODD: All kinds?

CRUZ:  =96 Any restrictions that restrict birth control.

TODD: All kinds?

CRUZ: And you know. Listen.

TODD: I hate to get into the details here but IUD is a big one because=97

CRUZ: Chuck -

TODD: =96 of what some people view that it=92s not contraception because=97

CRUZ: You know it=92s interesting, this debate. It actually illustrates som=
ething that the media doesn=92t understand. The media often describes, and =
says,  life is an issue that is an advantage for the Democrats. You know wh=
o doesn=92t believe that?

TODD: Actually, that wasn=92t what my question is.

CRUZ: But=97 let me go with this for a second because I=92m going to loop b=
ack to this.

TODD: Okay.

CRUZ: You know who doesn=92t believe that? Democrats. Name the last preside=
ntial race where Democrats campaigned trumpeting their support for abortion=
. You think about the 2012 election. The 2012 election the Democrats focuse=
d over and over again on the war on women, which was a totally made up thre=
at. But it focused on contraceptives. It wasn=92t on abortion. It was on co=
ntraceptives. And and it was. Listen, I have been around conservatives my e=
ntire life. I have never met a single human being, in any place, who wanted=
 to ban contraceptives.

TODD: There=92s some people that are not thrilled with it. Not for religiou=
s reasons.

CRUZ: Listen. There are people who because of their faith don=92t use contr=
aceptives. That=92s =96 you have a right to follow your faith. That=92s not=
 my faith. I=92m Southern Baptist. My faith doesn=92t have a problem with c=
ontraceptives but I respect those whose faith differs from mine and the gre=
at thing about our country is you can live according to your faith. If you=
=92re  faith says don=92t use birth control then you don=92t use it. You kn=
ow, in my family, I=92ve joked. Heidi and I have two little girls. I=92m ve=
ry glad we don=92t have 17.

(CROWD LAUGHS)

You know, we can have some tolerance and some diversity. But the fact that =
the Democrats had to create this made up threat on contraceptives shows tha=
t most Americans want to protect life. And I hope that we have a culture th=
at values every human life from the moment of conception to the moment of n=
atural death.

(CROWD CLAPS)

TODD: Personhood. Are you going to purse it as an addendum?

CRUZ: I told you I=92m not going to get into the labels but what I will say=
 is we should protect life but I=92m not interested in anything that restri=
cts birth control. And I=92m not interested in anything that restricts in v=
itro fertilization because I think parents who are struggling to create lif=
e, to have a child, that is a wonderful thing.

TODD: It sounds like you think this movement doesn=92t=97there isn=92t legi=
slation yet you could support yet for this movement.

CRUZ: What I believe is that we should defend life. And I=92ll tell ya, I h=
ave a long record of defending life =96 of defending, for example =96

TODD: Well, no one is questioning whether you=92re pro-life. This is a diff=
erent. That=92s why I=92m asking. Would you pursue this?

CRUZ: I will happily support anything that protects life. And protecting li=
fe is a value that matters. Whether it is stopping partial birth abortion w=
hich I think is a barbarism. Or whether it is fairly enforcing the criminal=
 laws against Planned Parenthood. You know a few months ago, we had this se=
ries of videos ttat were horrifying.
