With Donald Trump=92s recent sweeping victories, it=92s clear he=92s the on=

Last night, Ted Cruz and John Kasich announced they=92ve entered an unusual=
 agreement<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/24/=

 their failing campaigns=97 dividing their efforts in states with upcoming =
primaries to stop Trump from clinching more victories. Of course, it=92s to=

Kasich and Cruz=92s desperate attempts to thwart Trump=92s inevitable nomin=
ation doesn=92t end with the new agreement. The two candidates, who are now=
 mathematically eliminated and are hoping to stop Trump at their convention=
 in Cleveland, are now attempting to change the story and generate buzz by =
talking about possible running mates. Yes, really. On Sunday, Kasich said<h=
