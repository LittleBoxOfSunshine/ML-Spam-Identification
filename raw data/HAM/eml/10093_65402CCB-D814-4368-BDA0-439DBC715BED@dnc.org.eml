Excerpts from DNC Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz Press Call on the State of =
the Presidential Race

Today, DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz hosted a press call to discu=
ss the state of the race and preview Donald Trump=92s meetings with Republi=
can leadership tomorrow. From senior leaders to the voters of Nebraska and =
West Virginia yesterday, Republicans have started to fret about their party=
=92s deepening divide to embrace their divisive and dangerous standard bear=
er. Democrats, on the other hand, have shown in state after state that our =
voters are excited about our primary, and optimistic about both of our cand=
idates. Despite the historic chaos among Republicans, it=92s now clear that=
 Donald Trump is the Republican Party.
Please find excerpts below from the call as prepared for delivery:

Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz



Of course we now know that Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee, but we =
wanted to take a moment to discuss the historic and unprecedented division =
taking place on the Republican side --- especially visible this week as Don=
ald Trump prepares to sit down tomorrow with Senate Leader Mitch McConnell =
and House Speaker Paul Ryan. The irony is that Trump=92s impending nominati=
on is the result of years of the Republican Party elevating extreme voices,=
 and using divisive campaigns that sought to exploit unfounded fears for po=
litical gain. Well they=92ve made their bed, and now they=92re lying in it.=
 With his lock on the Republican nomination, Donald Trump has ensured that =
his Party=92s problems won=92t be limited to convention chaos -- he=92s goi=
ng to force GOP races big and small across the country to have to own his u=
gly, divisive and dangerous rhetoric all the way to the general election.



There has never been a situation in which the sitting Speaker of the House =
of Representatives simply doesn=92t want to support his party=92s nominee. =
It=92s stunning that Paul Ryan had to say he was willing to step down as th=
e Chair of his party=92s convention. The distress amongst party leaders is =
palpable. The list of Republican leaders who refuse to support Donald Trump=
 got longer this week, with Ted Cruz joining Ryan, and a slew of former GOP=
 presidential candidates and Republican presidents who are equally dismayed=
 at his divisive and dangerous rhetoric. In exit polls yesterday, just ten =
percent of Republican voters in West Virginia and three percent in Nebraska=
 said they think their party is united. Majorities of Republican primary vo=
ters in recent weeks have expressed concern about their party being divided=
. When you look at the trend lines nationally on our side, In contest after=
 contest, Democratic voters are reporting their enthusiasm for both of our =
candidates.


Democrats are building the infrastructure for the general election, and we=
=92re doing it with voters enthusiastic because they see our candidates hav=
e the right ideas to build on the progress of the last seven years. So we=
=92re very confident that we=92re well positioned heading into the general =
election and that we=92ll have the strongest candidate. But we=92re not tak=
ing anything for granted, we=92re going to hold Trump and Republicans up an=
d down the ballot accountable for their repeated promises to drag our count=
ry right back to the reckless policies that were in place in 2009 when the =
last Republican president left office; when we were losing 800,000 jobs a m=
onth; and, when countless Americans lost their homes and savings.



So that=92s another reason that this Trump - Ryan - McConnell meeting matte=
rs. It=92s a reminder that what the Republican presumptive nominee is promi=
sing is the same brand of trickle-down economic policies that help those at=
 the top while costing hardworking Americans. Despite their fretting over h=
is divisive and dangerous rhetoric, when you look under the hood, Trump doe=
sn=92t look much different from Ryan or McConnell, and certainly like many =
of the down ballot Republicans. Despite his attempts at slight-of-hand, for=
 example, it=92s clear that Trump=92s reckless tax plan is modeled on what =
the Republican Party has done for years, built on the same failed foundatio=
n of rewarding those at the top<http://www.npr.org/2015/12/22/460743371/ana=
lysis-trump-tax-plan-boosts-the-rich-could-be-a-drag-on-the-economy> by sla=
shing the top income tax rate. Trump=92s plan would bring that tax rate to =
25 percent from 39.6 percent. That would give<http://www.nbcnews.com/politi=
cs/first-read/first-read-why-trump-s-flip-flop-taxes-matters-n570431> the =
=93top 0.1% of income earners like himself an average tax cut of more than =
$1.3 million.=94 Republicans in Congress also want to lower<http://www.taxj=
usticeblog.org/archive/2015/10/paul_ryan_wants_to_cut_taxes_f.php#.VzJmBoSD=
Gkp> the individual tax rate for the wealthiest Americans to 25 percent. Tr=
ump also plans to substantially<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-=
reform> reduce the corporate tax rate, instead of fixing loopholes that all=
ow some large companies to pay no federal income tax at all. Paul Ryan and =
his colleagues have also proposed cutting corporate taxes down to 25 percen=
t =96 making Trump=92s 15 percent plan even more extreme than the Ryan Budg=
et.



It=92s the same old Republican playbook. And it=92s consistent with Trump=
=92s history of making money off the backs of hardworking people. Trump=92s=
 Republican bona fides go further. He actually said at one of the Republica=
n Party=92s debates that wages were =93too high=94. He not only opposes rai=
sing the federal minimum wage but thinks there shouldn=92t be a federal min=
imum wage at all. Now he tries to play sleight of hand, but that=92s what h=
e promised. And Trump=92s statement this past week that the United States o=
f America, as a country, shouldn=92t honor its debt and just print more mon=
ey is flat out dangerous. But it=92s consistent with McConnell and Ryan, wh=
o have allowed their colleagues in Congress to bring our country to the bri=
nk of default by playing games with the debt ceiling, and threatened our cr=
edit rating. Put simply, Trump and the Republicans he=92s meeting with cann=
ot be trusted on the economy. When they win, the American people lose. Trum=
p is divisive and dangerous, and he lacks the judgment and temperament to b=
e president. The contrast couldn=92t be clearer with our candidates, who I=
=92m proud of, who have run substantive and spirited campaigns.
