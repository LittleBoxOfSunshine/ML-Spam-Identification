NEW YORK TIMES // PATRICK HEALY, YAMICHE ALCINDOR and JEREMY W. PETERS
Defiant and determined to transform the Democratic Party, SenatorBernie San=
ders is opening a two-month phase of his presidential campaign aimed at inf=
licting a heavy blow on Hillary Clinton in California and amassing enough l=
everage to advance his agenda at the convention in July =97 or even wrest t=
he nomination from her.

Advisers to Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday that he was newly resolved to rem=
ain in the race, seeing an aggressive campaign as his only chance to pressu=
re Democrats into making fundamental changes to how presidential primaries =
and debates are held in the future. They said he also held out hope of capi=
talizing on any late stumbles by Mrs. Clinton or any damage to her candidac=
y, whether by scandal or by the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. T=
rump.

After sounding subdued if not downbeat about the race for weeks, Mr. Sander=
s resumed a combative posture against Mrs. Clinton, demanding on Wednesday =
that she debate him before the June 7 primary in California and highlightin=
g anew what he asserted were her weaknesses against Mr. Trump.

Mr. Sanders, his advisers said, has been buoyed by a stream of polls showin=
g him beating Mr. Trump by larger margins than Mrs. Clinton in some battleg=
round states, and by his belief that an upset victory in California could h=
ave a psychological impact on convention delegates who already have doubts =
about Mrs. Clinton.

But his newly resolute attitude is also the cumulative result of months of =
anger at the national Democratic Party over a debate schedule that his camp=
aign said favored Mrs. Clinton; a fund-raising arrangement between the part=
y and the Clinton campaign; the appointment of fierce Clinton partisans as =
leaders of important convention committees; and the party=92s rebuke of Mr.=
 Sanders on Tuesday for not clearly condemning a melee at the Nevada Democr=
atic convention on Saturday.

While Mr. Sanders says he does not want Mr. Trump to win in November, his a=
dvisers and allies say he is willing to do some harm to Mrs. Clinton in the=
 shorter term if it means he can capture a majority of the 475 pledged dele=
gates at stake in California and arrive at the Philadelphia convention with=
 maximum political power.

Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the campaign did not thin=
k its attacks would help Mr. Trump in the long run, but added that the sena=
tor=92s team was =93not thinking about=94 the possibility that they could h=
elp derail Mrs. Clinton from becoming the first woman elected president.

=93The only thing that matters is what happens between now and June 14,=94 =
Mr. Devine said, referring to the final Democratic primary, in the District=
 of Columbia. =93We have to put the blinders on and focus on the best case =
to make in the upcoming states. If we do that, we can be in a strong positi=
on to make the best closing argument before the convention. If not, everyon=
e will know in mid-June, and we=92ll have to take a hard look at where thin=
gs stand.=94

The prospect of a drawn-out Democratic fight is deeply troubling to party l=
eaders who are eager for Mrs. Clinton and House and Senate candidates to tu=
rn to attacking Mr. Trump without being diverted by Democratic strife. Mr. =
Sanders has won nearly 10 million votes, compared to Mrs. Clinton=92s 13 mi=
llion, and Democratic leaders say she needs time to begin courting the youn=
g voters, liberals and other Sanders supporters who view her as an ally of =
corporate and big-money interests.

But Mr. Sanders has sharpened his language of late, saying Tuesday night th=
at the party faced a choice to remain =93dependent on big-money campaign co=
ntributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy=94=
 or =93welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real eco=
nomic and social change.=94

Mr. Sanders=92s street-fighting instincts have been encouraged by his like-=
minded campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, who has been blistering against the C=
linton camp and the party establishment. On Wednesday, he took to CNN to ac=
cuse Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic nat=
ional chairwoman, of =93throwing shade on the Sanders campaign from the ver=
y beginning.=94

For weeks, some current and former Sanders campaign workers have privately =
acknowledged feeling disheartened about Mr. Weaver=92s determination to go =
after the Democratic National Committee, fearing a pitched battle with the =
party they hope to support in the general election. The intraparty fighting=
 has affected morale, they say, and raised concerns that Mr. Weaver, a long=
time Sanders aide who more recently ran a comic book store, was not devoted=
 to achieving Democratic unity. Several described the campaign=92s message =
as having devolved into a near-obsession with perceived conspiracies on the=
 part of Mrs. Clinton=92s allies.

Democratic leaders said they wanted to do everything possible to avoid havi=
ng Clinton-Sanders tensions send the Philadelphia convention into the sort =
of chaos they had expected to mar the Republican convention. So far, though=
, Mr. Sanders has not indicated that he would ask his delegates to support =
Mrs. Clinton, as she did in 2008 for Barack Obama.

=93I=92m hopeful that the two candidates will come together, and soon, whic=
h could blunt the possibility of real trouble at our convention,=94 said Ed=
ward G. Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania and a Clinton supporte=
r who is chairman of the Philadelphia host committee for the convention. =
=93But you look at what happened in Nevada, and you worry.=94

The melee there, at which Sanders supporters revolted and threatened the st=
ate Democratic chairwoman in a fight over delegates, intensified concerns a=
mong Clinton allies. Senator Barbara Boxer of California, who attended the =
convention, said she spoke with Mr. Sanders late Tuesday and said he was =
=93distressed=94 by the Nevada episode.

=93He will be judged as whether or not he has leadership qualities by the w=
ay he handles this,=94 she said.

Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who is close to Mr. Sanders, spoke with Mr. S=
anders on Friday about not letting the state convention devolve into a mess=
y fight. They spoke again on Tuesday afternoon, and Mr. Reid complained tha=
t a staff member who had attended feared for her safety. But Mr. Sanders=92=
s subsequent statement condemning the violence, which mostly dwelled on how=
 dismissively he felt the party was treating him, did little to soothe Mr. =
Reid=92s unease.

=93Bernie and I have known each other for a long time, and I believe he is =
better than this,=94 Mr. Reid said Wednesday.

But some Sanders supporters said that Democrats were ignoring an undercurre=
nt of anger among those who fear that Mrs. Clinton, if elected, would lack =
the courage to challenge her friends and political contributors.

=93We want to have progressive values and socialism on the convention=92s a=
genda, rather than slip back into centrist Democratic thinking if she gets =
elected,=94 said Tick Segerblom, a state senator in Nevada and a Sanders su=
pporter. =93I think there could be some chaos at the convention =96 at leas=
t outside, with a lot of anarchists, socialists, young people.=94

Mrs. Clinton=92s campaign has largely taken Mr. Sanders=92s latest broadsid=
es in stride. In soliciting donations Wednesday, it said that the two-front=
 battle against Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump was =93one of the toughest parts =
of our campaign so far.=94 A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment=
 about Mr. Sanders=92s debate proposal in California.

Privately, Mrs. Clinton=92s advisers said Mr. Sanders could win California =
but emphasized their confidence that Mrs. Clinton would still win the nomin=
ation. She now has a total of 2,293 pledged delegates and superdelegates; s=
he needs 90 more to win the nomination, although superdelegates can shift t=
heir support up to the convention. Mr. Sanders has 1,533 pledged delegates =
and superdelegates.

Mr. Sanders is now running slightly behind Mrs. Clinton in California in pu=
blic polls. Ben Tulchin, Mr. Sanders=92s pollster, pointed to signs of risi=
ng voter registration in California among young people and independents =97=
 two core Sanders constituencies =97 as evidence that he could win the stat=
e. But Hispanic registration is also rising, which could benefit Mrs. Clint=
on. With Mr. Sanders expected to campaign aggressively over the next three =
weeks, his supporters in the state said they were focused on winning the pr=
imary, not on November.

=93If you want to talk about historic, let=92s talk about the record turnou=
t numbers at his rallies,=94 said Mayor Bao Nguyen of Garden Grove, Calif.,=
 a Sanders supporter. =93Senator Sanders isn=92t obliged to help Secretary =
Clinton if she wins. That=92s a decision his team can make if they face tha=
t choice.=94

Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, Mr. Sanders=92s lone endorser in =
the Senate, said that the party=92s divisions would only deepen if Mr. Sand=
ers was driven from the race now.

=93You can=92t say to them, =91Hey we don=92t want to hear your views,=92 a=
nd shut the door on them,=94 Mr. Merkley said, =93and then a month later op=
en the door and say, =91Hey, can you come in and help us out?=92
