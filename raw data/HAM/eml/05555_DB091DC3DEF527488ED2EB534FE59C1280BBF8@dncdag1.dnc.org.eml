The presumptive nominee seeks to exert control over the Republican Party.

Donald Trump's campaign is hashing out the details of an agreement with Rep=
ublican Party leaders that could allow the presumptive GOP presidential nom=
inee to raise six-figure checks for his presidential campaign, multiple sou=
rces with direct knowledge of the negotiations tell POLITICO.

The fundraising agreement was among the subjects discussed at a Monday meet=
ing at the Republican National Committee's Washington offices between top R=
NC officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, and senior Trump aides, in=
cluding campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, senior adviser Paul Manafort an=
d political director Rick Wiley, according to the sources.

The talks represent the first formal steps towards a merger between the off=
icial apparatus of the Republican Party and a candidate who many party lead=
ers scorned until recently, and about whom there remains deep leeriness in =
some Republican quarters.

Since Trump essentially clinched the GOP nomination with a win in last week=
's Indiana primary, his staff have moved quickly to put their stamp on the =
party's general election planning process. Wiley has paid several visits to=
 the party's headquarters on Capitol Hill to assess its efforts, according =
to the sources. The campaign also has been discussing convention-related is=
sues with the RNC, including credentials and rules, the sources said, addin=
g that the campaign is expected in the coming days to formally deputize a s=
taffer as a liaison to the national party committee.

And deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner this week is set to lead a del=
egation to the convention site, Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena, to receive=
 a briefing from RNC officials involved in planning for the July event, as =
POLITICO first reported<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-=
michael-glassner-convention-222878> last week.

Fundraising was not a major focus of Monday's meetings, according to RNC se=
nior strategist Sean Spicer. "It was 3 =BD hours on briefings from all the =
RNC divisions regarding the capabilities and resources that we have been co=
mpiling to win in November," said Spicer, who attended the meeting, and sai=
d it included presentations on the party's ground game, and its data, commu=
nications and research efforts.

The conversations are also partly an effort to lay the groundwork for a Thu=
rsday meeting in Washington between Trump, Priebus and House Speaker Paul R=
yan, who announced last Thursday that he is withholding his endorsement unt=
il Trump outlines a stronger commitment to conservative principles.

The perception among Trump's inner circle is that Ryan is attempting to lev=
erage his position as chairman of the Cleveland convention into securing a =
deal that protects the party's control over vendor contracts and how the mo=
ney raised jointly by the party and Trump's campaign is spent.

"Trump is a tough negotiator, understands the history of what he's entitled=
 to here," another Trump confidant said. "They want the RNC to be autonomou=
s but they'll work with the Trump campaign. They need Trump to help raise t=
he money but they want their vendors to be the ones to spend the money."

But Trump may be more reliant on the national party than past presidential =
nominees, since his campaign has invested relatively little in field staff,=
 voter data or a fundraising operation.

Some of Trump's infrastructure deficiencies can be traced to his unwillingn=
ess to dig deep into his own fortune to finance his campaign, which he has =
pledged from the beginning to self-finance.

Entering into a joint fundraising agreement and leaning on the party for ca=
sh and staff would help fill that void in an election expected to cost each=
 side more than $1 billion. But it also could undermine his rhetoric about =
being independent from the party's donor class.

Trump has already agreed to appear next week at a $25,000 per-plate fundrai=
ser to benefit the New Jersey Republican Party, just days after the New Yor=
k billionaire tapped Gov. Chris Christie to run his presidential transition=
.

The May 19 event is being billed as a "roundtable" with Christie and Trump,=
 and will be held at the Lawrenceville National Guard Armory, according to =
an invitation obtained by POLITICO. Just 12 people will be permitted to att=
end the roundtable, according to a note sent with the invitation.

The RNC has been taking the lead in reaching out to state parties to put to=
gether the joint fundraising arrangement with Trump's campaign, and its pla=
ns are actually further along than they were at this point four years ago, =
said one source familiar with the negotiations.

"I know (the Trump campaign staff) have been impressed with what the RNC al=
ready has on the ground," said the source. "Four years ago, when Romney wal=
ked into the building, the RNC didn't have anywhere close to the field staf=
f that it has now. ... There is a big difference."

Yet efforts to finalize the agreement also could test the willingness of st=
ate GOP officials to get behind a presumptive nominee who some official ope=
nly opposed during the contentious primary.

Colorado's state party appeared to gloat last month after Trump's vanquishe=
d rival Ted Cruz swept all 34 delegate slots at the state's caucus. "We did=
 it. #NeverTrump," the state party tweeted, only to delete and disavow<http=
://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/colorado-gop-nevertrump-tweet-221766> the=
 post minutes later.

Party spokesman Kyle Kohli on Monday said the Colorado GOP hasn't had any t=
alks with Trump or the RNC about a joint fundraising agreement.

The South Carolina Republican Party is open to participating but hasn't eng=
aged in any talks yet, said the chairman, Matt Moore.

The more state parties that participate, the more money a Trump joint fundr=
aising committee can accept, thanks in part to a 2014 Supreme Court case ca=
lled McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission<http://www.politico.com/stor=
y/2014/04/mccutcheon-supreme-court-ruling-105303>. It struck down aggregate=
 limits on total giving to federal campaigns, allowing maximum donations to=
 as many different committees as a donor wanted.

Trump's likely general election opponent, Hillary Clinton, created an unpre=
cedented joint fundraising committee<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/=
clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670> with the Democr=
atic National Committee and 32 state party committees that can accept check=
s as large as $356,100 this year.

Early in the election cycle, the talk among GOP state party officials was o=
f a joint fundraising committee that could include all 50 states and six te=
rritories, allowing maximum donations of about $1 million per person, accor=
ding to one state party chairman. But those talks quieted as Trump's surpri=
sing rise threw the GOP primary into chaos, said the chairman.

Sources with knowledge of the RNC's current plans said its joint fundraisin=
g arrangement would include between four and 12 state committees, which cou=
ld allow the committee to accept checks ranging from $78,800 and $158,000.
The joint committee could help Trump's campaign as well as the RNC, which h=
as struggled to keep its finances intact. The committee ended March with ju=
st $16 million on hand and nearly $2 million in outstanding debt. Taken tog=
ether, the bank account is a fraction of where the committee had been at si=
milar points in 2008 and 2012.
Many Republican state party chairs, who depend on the RNC to fund a get-out=
-the-vote program, are anxious to see Trump and the committee form an agree=
ment.

"We are a battleground state and we can expect a lot of money to support ou=
r push," said Rob Gleason, the Pennsylvania GOP chair. "We already were get=
ting a lot of money from the RNC, but we need a lot more."
"Trump should be able to get us up to speed," he added.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign is hashing out the de=
tails of an agreement with Republican Party leaders that could allow the pr=
esumptive GOP presidential nominee to raise six-figure checks
 for his presidential campaign, multiple sources with direct knowledge of t=
he negotiations tell POLITICO.<br>
<br>
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The fundraising agreement was among the subjects di=
scussed at a Monday meeting at the Republican National Committee&#8217;s Wa=
shington offices between top RNC officials, including chairman
 Reince Priebus, and senior Trump aides, including campaign manager Corey L=
ewandowski, senior adviser Paul Manafort and political director Rick Wiley,=
 according to the sources.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
The talks represent the first formal steps towards a merger between the off=
icial apparatus of the Republican Party and a candidate who many party lead=
ers scorned until recently, and about whom there remains deep leeriness in =
some Republican quarters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><br>
Since Trump essentially clinched the GOP nomination with a win in last week=
&#8217;s Indiana primary, his staff have moved quickly to put their stamp o=
n the party&#8217;s general election planning process. Wiley has paid sever=
al visits to the party&#8217;s headquarters on Capitol
 Hill to assess its efforts, according to the sources. The campaign also ha=
s been discussing convention-related issues with the RNC, including credent=
ials and rules, the sources said, adding that the campaign is expected in t=
he coming days to formally deputize
 a staffer as a liaison to the national party committee.<o:p></o:p></span><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">And deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner this w=
eek is set to lead a delegation to the convention site, Cleveland&#8217;s Q=
uicken Loans Arena, to receive a briefing from RNC officials involved
 in planning for the July event, as&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://www.politico.com=
/story/2016/05/donald-trump-michael-glassner-convention-222878" target=3D"_=
blank">POLITICO first reported</a>&nbsp;last week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Fundraising was not a major focus of Monday's meeti=
ngs, according to RNC senior strategist Sean Spicer. &#8220;It was 3 =BD ho=
urs on briefings from all the RNC divisions regarding the capabilities
 and resources that we have been compiling to win in November,&#8221; said =
Spicer, who attended the meeting, and said it included presentations on the=
 party&#8217;s ground game, and its data, communications and research effor=
ts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The conversations are also partly an effort to lay =
the groundwork for a Thursday meeting in Washington between Trump, Priebus =
and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who announced last Thursday
 that he is withholding his endorsement until Trump outlines a stronger com=
mitment to conservative principles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The perception among Trump's inner circle is that R=
yan is attempting to leverage his position as chairman of the Cleveland con=
vention into securing a deal that protects the party's control
 over vendor contracts and how the money raised jointly by the party and Tr=
ump's campaign is spent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&#8220;Trump is a tough negotiator, understands the=
 history of what he's entitled to here,&quot; another Trump confidant said.=
 &quot;They want the RNC to be autonomous but they'll work with the Trump
 campaign. They need Trump to help raise the money but they want their vend=
ors to be the ones to spend the money.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">But Trump may be more reliant on the national party=
 than past presidential nominees, since his campaign has invested relativel=
y little in field staff, voter data or a fundraising operation.<o:p></o:p><=
/span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Some of Trump&#8217;s infrastructure deficiencies c=
an be traced to his unwillingness to dig deep into his own fortune to finan=
ce his campaign, which he has pledged from the beginning to self-finance.<o=
:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Entering into a joint fundraising agreement and lea=
ning on the party for cash and staff would help fill that void in an electi=
on expected to cost each side more than $1 billion. But
 it also could undermine his rhetoric about being independent from the part=
y&#8217;s donor class.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Trump has already agreed to appear next week at a $=
25,000 per-plate fundraiser to benefit the New Jersey Republican Party, jus=
t days after the New York billionaire tapped Gov. Chris
 Christie to run his presidential transition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The May 19 event is being billed as a &quot;roundta=
ble&quot; with Christie and Trump, and will be held at the Lawrenceville Na=
tional Guard Armory, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO.
 Just 12 people will be permitted to attend the roundtable, according to a =
note sent with the invitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The RNC has been taking the lead in reaching out to=
 state parties to put together the joint fundraising arrangement with Trump=
&#8217;s campaign, and its plans are actually further along than
 they were at this point four years ago, said one source familiar with the =
negotiations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&#8220;I know (the Trump campaign staff) have been =
impressed with what the RNC already has on the ground,&#8221; said the sour=
ce. &#8220;Four years ago, when Romney walked into the building, the RNC di=
dn&#8217;t
 have anywhere close to the field staff that it has now. &#8230; There is a=
 big difference.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Yet efforts to finalize the agreement also could te=
st the willingness of state GOP officials to get behind a presumptive nomin=
ee who some official openly opposed during the contentious
 primary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=

 month after Trump&#8217;s vanquished rival Ted Cruz swept all 34 delegate =
slots at the state&#8217;s caucus. &#8220;We did it. #NeverTrump,&#8221; th=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Party spokesman Kyle Kohli on Monday said the Color=
ado GOP hasn&#8217;t had any talks with Trump or the RNC about a joint fund=
raising agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The South Carolina Republican Party is open to part=
icipating but hasn&#8217;t engaged in any talks yet, said the chairman, Mat=
t Moore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The more state parties that participate, the more m=
oney a Trump joint fundraising committee can accept, thanks in part to a 20=
14 Supreme Court case called&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://www.politico.com/story/=
2014/04/mccutcheon-supreme-court-ruling-105303" target=3D"_blank">McCutcheo=
n
 v. Federal Election Commission</a>. It struck down aggregate limits on tot=
al giving to federal campaigns, allowing maximum donations to as many diffe=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Trump&#8217;s likely general election opponent, Hil=
lary Clinton, created an&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://www.politico.com/story/2016=
/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670" target=3D"_=
blank">unprecedented
 joint fundraising committee</a>&nbsp;with the Democratic National Committe=
e and 32 state party committees that can accept checks as large as $356,100=
 this year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Early in the election cycle, the talk among GOP sta=
te party officials was of a joint fundraising committee that could include =
all 50 states and six territories, allowing maximum donations
 of about $1 million per person, according to one state party chairman. But=
 those talks quieted as Trump&#8217;s surprising rise threw the GOP primary=
 into chaos, said the chairman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Sources with knowledge of the RNC&#8217;s current p=
lans said its joint fundraising arrangement would include between four and =
12 state committees, which could allow the committee to accept
 checks ranging from $78,800 and $158,000.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The joint committee could help Trump&#8217;s campai=
gn as well as the RNC, which has struggled to keep its finances intact. The=
 committee ended March with just $16 million on hand and nearly
 $2 million in outstanding debt. Taken together, the bank account is a frac=
tion of where the committee had been at similar points in 2008 and 2012.<o:=
p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Many Republican state party chairs, who depend on t=
he RNC to fund a get-out-the-vote program, are anxious to see Trump and the=
 committee form an agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
uot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&#8220;We are a battleground state and we can expec=
t a lot of money to support our push,&#8221; said Rob Gleason, the Pennsylv=
ania GOP chair. &#8220;We already were getting a lot of money from the RNC,
 but we need a lot more.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&q=
