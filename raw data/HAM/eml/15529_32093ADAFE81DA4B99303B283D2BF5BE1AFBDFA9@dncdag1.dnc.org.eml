WASHINGTON POST // HAROLD MEYERSON

All presidential candidates tout their works, and few works are more reveal=
ing than the condition of the states that this election=92s crop of Republi=
can hopefuls serve, or recently served, as governors. Of these GOP govs and=
 ex-govs, surely no one intends to get more mileage out of his state=92s st=
anding than Texas=92s Rick Perry.

=93We will unleash an era of economic growth and limitless opportunity,=94 =
Perry pledged in announcing his candidacy last week. =93It can be done beca=
use it has been done in Texas.=94

Texas is the one state to which the word =93miracle=94 has been attached in=
 recent years, as an acknowledgment that its economy actually created jobs =
during the recession . As with North Dakota, Texas owed much of its success=
 at spawning jobs to the oil boom. (Economist and New York Times columnist =
Paul Krugman calculates that oil fueled about one-third of the Lone Star St=
ate=92s higher growth rate.) And as with North Dakota, Texas=92s job creati=
on has ground to a halt in recent months, even as other states have churned=
 ahead, as the declining price of oil has caused production to slacken.

But the flaw of the miracle is more fundamental than its reliance on oil. F=
or even when Texas could boast of the quantity of its jobs, it could never =
boast of their quality. Indeed, on two of the most crucial measures of job =
quality, Texas rates dead last.

The first measure is the percentage of Texans who are medically uninsured. =
By any recent index, before Obamacare or after Obamacare, the share of Texa=
ns with no health insurance exceeds that of Americans anyplace else. That i=
s partly due to the state=92s reluctance to accept the expansion of Medicai=
d, though many states have refused Obamacare=92s federally subsidized expan=
sion of the program; partly due to the state=92s large number of undocument=
ed immigrants who are ineligible for governmental health coverage, though C=
alifornia, which is home to many more undocumented immigrants, manages to i=
nsure a far greater share of its residents; and partly due to the fact that=
 the share of jobs that come with insurance in Texas is also comparatively =
low. Texas has long been a state with one of the lowest levels of unionizat=
ion, which is a pretty fair predictor of skimpy benefits and low wages.

The second measure of job quality is the share of people qualifying for gov=
ernment poverty programs who are nonetheless employed. In April, the Univer=
sity of California Center for Labor Research and Education released a study=
 quantifying the number of Americans receiving Medicaid, food stamps, welfa=
re, children=92s health insurance coverage or the earned-income tax credit =
who have an employed family member. Low-paid work has become so prevalent, =
the study showed, that the yearly tab of federal dollars going to working f=
amilies was $128 billion. The state with the highest share of funds going t=
o such families was Texas.

Note that this is federal aid, not state aid (which, in Texas, is notably s=
tingy). Taxpayers in the other 49 states subsidized the so-called Texas mir=
acle. Without everyone else=92s help, the vast Texas throng of the working =
poor would have been so destitute that consumption levels would have dwindl=
ed. Texas=92s use of federal dollars to keep its workers afloat is only dee=
pened by its favor-the-rich-and-soak-the-poor tax policies. As a result of =
the state=92s lack of an income tax and high sales taxes, the poorest 20 pe=
rcent of Texans pay 12.5 percent of their incomes in state and local taxes =
=97 one of the highest levels in the United States =97 while the wealthiest=
 1 percent pay just 2.9 percent.

Of those defending the Texas model of economics, the most honest has been l=
ibertarian economist Tyler Cowen. =93The real reason Americans are headed t=
o Texas,=94 he has written, is that they =93are being pushed (and pulled) b=
y the major economic forces that are reshaping the American economy=94 =97 =
chiefly =93the hollowing out of the middle class.=94 In Texas, Cowen argues=
, low-wage jobs go further than elsewhere because living costs are lower. A=
nd, he neglects to add, because saps all across the nation enable Texas=92s=
 employers to pay poverty-level wages.

=93Without Texas,=94 Perry boasted when he announced his candidacy, =93Amer=
ica would have lost 400,000 jobs=94 between 2008 and 2014. But without Amer=
ica paying Texas=92s freight, the miracle would have sunk in the muck.
