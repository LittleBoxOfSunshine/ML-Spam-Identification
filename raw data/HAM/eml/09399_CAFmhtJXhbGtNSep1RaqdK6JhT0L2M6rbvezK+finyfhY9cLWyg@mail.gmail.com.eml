*FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:* May 4, 2016
Brandon Lorenz | Brandon.Lorenz@hrc.org | 202-772-3888

*HRC Announces Endorsement of Catherine Cortez Masto for United States
Senate*



*WASHINGTON *-- Today the Human Rights Campaign =E2=80=93 the nation=E2=80=
=99s largest
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) civil rights organization =E2=
=80=93
announced its endorsement of Catherine Cortez Masto for the U.S. Senate
seat being vacated by Nevada Sen. Harry Reid.



=E2=80=9CAs Nevada=E2=80=99s next Senator, Catherine Cortez Masto will cont=
inue to fight
for equal rights and protections for all,=E2=80=9D said* HRC President Chad=
 Griffin*.
=E2=80=9CCatherine is a problem solver who is committed to equality and ens=
uring
that everyone, including LGBT people, can live free from fear of
discrimination. While Congressman Heck and Sharron Angle threaten to
jeopardize our progress, Catherine has proven she'll be the leader we need
to fight to pass the Equality Act and move us closer to full federal
equality."



=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s an incredible honor to receive the support of HRC, an=
 organization
that has fought tirelessly for equal rights and protections for every
American,=E2=80=9D said *Cortez Masto.* =E2=80=9CAs Nevada=E2=80=99s next S=
enator, I will work with
HRC to ensure their historic gains are protected, and will be dedicated to
the continued fight against LGBT discrimination. It is outrageous that in
2016 people can still be at risk of losing their jobs in this country
because of whom they love. Unlike my opponents, Sharron Angle and
Congressman Heck, in the Senate I will focus on ensuring LGBT people are
treated equally under the law by working to end discrimination.=E2=80=9D



Congressman Heck has refused to support the Equality Act, comprehensive
legislation to protect LGBT people from discrimination, and opposed
marriage equality.


*The Human Rights Campaign is America=E2=80=99s largest civil rights organi=
zation
working to achieve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality. By
inspiring and engaging all Americans, HRC strives to end discrimination
against LGBT citizens and realize a nation that achieves fundamental
fairness and equality for all.*



*Paid for by the Human Rights Campaign PAC and authorized by Catherine
Cortez Masto for Senate*
