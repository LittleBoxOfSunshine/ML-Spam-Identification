> New York Times
> By JEREMY W. PETERS and ALAN RAPPEPORT
> MAY 18, 2016
> =20
> WASHINGTON =E2=80=94 Senator Bernie Sanders=E2=80=99s relationship with th=
e leadership of the Democratic Party and his colleagues on Capitol Hill was s=
trained further on Wednesday as he and his campaign remained defiant over th=
e way they say his success is being belittled and undermined by people in th=
e party who are loyal toHillary Clinton.
> =20
> Whatever tolerance Democrats have for Mr. Sanders=E2=80=99s continuing his=
 increasingly long-shot presidential bid was quickly evaporating, with some o=
f his closest allies in the party suggesting his efforts to rein in his most=
 unruly supporters was half-hearted.
> =20
> =E2=80=9CBernie and I have known each other for a long time,=E2=80=9D said=
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader and one of Mr. Sanders=E2=
=80=99 best friends in the Senate. =E2=80=9CAnd I believe he is better than t=
his.=E2=80=9D
> =20
> Vice President Joe Biden also weighed in, saying that while Mr. Sanders is=
 =E2=80=9Ca good guy,=E2=80=9D he needed =E2=80=9Cto be more aggressive in s=
peaking out.=E2=80=9D
> =20
> The dispute centered around the Democratic state convention in Nevada over=
 the weekend in which Mr. Sanders was denied the delegates he thought he had=
 earned, a development that infuriated his supporters there and led some to t=
hrow chairs and later threaten the state party chairwoman.
> =20
> The Democratic Party of Nevada pushed back against the Sanders campaign=E2=
=80=99s criticism that the process wrongly deprived him of delegates, saying=
 that =E2=80=9Csimple math=E2=80=9D dictated the outcome and that Mr. Sander=
s was simply outnumbered. =E2=80=9CBernie Sanders=E2=80=99s campaign was not=
 organized,=E2=80=9D the party said in a statement, noting that nearly 500 o=
f his seats at the convention were vacant because his supporters had failed t=
o show up.
> =20
> National party leaders, such as the Democratic National Committee chairwom=
an,Debbie Wasserman Schultz, have also criticized how Mr. Sanders has handle=
d the unrest in Nevada, adding to the frustration within his campaign.
> Mr. Sanders=E2=80=99s campaign manager took to cable news on Wednesday to a=
ssail the party and Ms. Schultz.
> =E2=80=9CThe chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, it is clear a=
lmost from the get-go she has been working against Bernie Sanders =E2=80=94 t=
here=E2=80=99s no doubt about it, for personal reasons,=E2=80=9D Jeff Weaver=
, Mr. Sanders=E2=80=99s campaign manager, said of Ms. Wasserman Schultz on M=
SNBC. =E2=80=9CShe has been the divider and not really provided leadership t=
hat the Democratic Party needs,=E2=80=9D Mr. Weaver added.
> =20
> Nowhere has the strain in the Democratic Party been more evident lately th=
an in Mr. Sanders=E2=80=99s relationship with Mr. Reid. Few members of the S=
enate are closer to Mr. Sanders than Mr. Reid, who had tried to head off any=
 confrontation by speaking personally with Mr. Sanders on Friday to stress t=
he importance of not letting the state convention devolve into a messy fight=
 over a handful of delegates.
> =20
> =E2=80=9CIf you want the two damn delegates, you can have them,=E2=80=9D M=
r. Reid told Mr. Sanders, according to someone with firsthand knowledge of t=
he discussions between the two senators. Though Mr. Reid has endorsed Mrs. C=
linton, he has said that he believes Mr. Sanders has earned a right to remai=
n in the race.
> =20
> After the convention went awry, Mr. Reid and Mr. Sanders spoke again on Tu=
esday afternoon. Mr. Reid expressed dismay that Mr. Sanders=E2=80=99s suppor=
ters had acted so belligerently. A member of his own staff was at the conven=
tion and feared for her own safety, Mr. Reid said. He also said that the way=
 Sanders supporters had been harassing Roberta Lange, the state party chairw=
oman =E2=80=94 filling her voice mail with threatening, obscene messages and=
 showing up at her Las Vegas restaurant in protest =E2=80=94 was over the li=
ne.
> =20
> Mr. Sanders said he agreed and believed that the violence should be condem=
ned. But when he released his statement on Tuesday night, which made only a p=
assing reference to the violence at the convention, a perplexed Mr. Reid tol=
d his staff that he thought the gesture was =E2=80=9Csilly=E2=80=9D and bene=
ath Mr. Sanders, according to the person who spoke with Mr. Reid.
> =20
> The two senators have not spoken since.
> =20
> Mr. Sanders appeared to be taken somewhat by surprise at the way the Nevad=
a melee was being portrayed, and how negatively it was reflecting on his cam=
paign.
> =20
> Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, Mr. Sanders=E2=80=99s lone endor=
ser in the Senate, said in an interview that he had spoken with Mr. Sanders o=
n Wednesday and that Mr. Sanders was forceful in his condemnation of the vio=
lence.
> =E2=80=9CHe wants to make sure that everyone who asks the question knows t=
he answer: that he 100 percent rejects that type of conduct,=E2=80=9D Mr. Me=
rkley said. =E2=80=9CWe have to step forward and say, totally unacceptable,=E2=
=80=9D he added. =E2=80=9CThat is the exact opposite of what Trump did. Trum=
p basically embraced violence, encouraged violence. That is a different stor=
y. That is the Republican story.=E2=80=9D
> =20
> Mr. Merkley said Mr. Sanders remained committed to staying in the race. Tu=
rning the pleas of party unity that some Democrats are making around, Mr. Me=
rkley said that the rift in the party would only deepen if Mr. Sanders was d=
riven from the race now.
> =20
> =E2=80=9COne of the reasons it is so important for him to stay in this rac=
e is that when we go to the convention and we=E2=80=99re building the bridge=
 that brings everyone together, people have to feel like they were heard, th=
at they were respected,=E2=80=9D Mr. Merkley said.
> =20
> =E2=80=9CYou can=E2=80=99t say to them, =E2=80=98Hey, we don=E2=80=99t wan=
t to hear your views,=E2=80=99 and shut the door on them, and then a month l=
ater open the door and say, =E2=80=98Hey, can you come in and help us out?=E2=
=80=99=E2=80=9D he added. =E2=80=9CHe fully intends to go forward.=E2=80=9D
