- He's going to win IN, hasn't even started on HRC yet. Based on her record, thinks it should be a Republican win and maybe an easy one
- voters don't want Cruz, he's leading by millions of votes. He's close to breaking the record
- Cuomo says Trumps language on raping China/woman card offends people: Trump says as far as China is concerned everyone knows that's true. Trump says Clinton doesn't do a good job with men who go off the reservation if you look at her record. He's saying what people want to hear
- Pressed on Clinton comments and saying inappropriate: Clinton has been taking a lot of heat for her statement. It's a very harsh statement. It's basically like "I can handle men," if he made that statement about a woman it would be a big story
- The "Indians have gone wild" on that statement. They've said it's a disastrous and want a retraction
- It's a very nasty statement to men and if he made that statement it would be a big story
- She is playing the woman card and without it she'd have no chance of winning
- Women want strength and security, they want to know about women's health issues. He's going to do a better job for women than Clinton can do
- Trump balloon in LA protest: Says he hopes he looks better than the balloon, refusing to comment on protests, talking about the size of his crowds. Says he's going to create jobs and bring them back to this country
- Thinks a lot of the Bernie Sanders young people will join his campaign. The Democrats have treated Bernie Sanders and his followers unbelievable badly. It's a rigged system
- Going to keep jobs in this country, hitting Carrier. Going to make them pay, there's going to be consequences like a tariff or a tax. Our business are moving out of our country and they're moving out fast
- NAFTA has been a total disaster for the United States. All of that will change with him. Going to have strong borders, going to build a wall and Mexico will pay for it. Filling in the tunnels will be easy
- President did an okay job at WHCD.
- He build a great company and deals with leaders around the world. Has probably more experience than anyone looking at this position. I've made a lot of money doing it.
- The time he went to the WHCD and the president made fun of him, he had a great time. But knew this time no matter how great a time he had, they would say he was miserable.
- The press lies more than Lying Ted
- He has tremendous success dealing very successfully with other countries. Hits Clinton on Syria, Benghazi. He's made a fortune going outside of this country. Made a tremendous amount of money doing deals outside this country
