We are a ways away from knowing what our event needs will be since we are i=
n this holding pattern. I am not sure that I am recalling us doing florals =
at any of our previous Finance convention events, at least not on a large s=
cale, but let me think back. Because our events are generally standing even=
ts, we don't need centerpieces.

I know some of the constituency groups do their own individual events, such=
 as LGBT, WLF, etc. These are usually smaller and more tailored so there co=
uld be some needs there but we won't know for quite some time.

If we need flowers, we can certainly use her! Unfortunately, the stuff does=
 not come together until very close in.
