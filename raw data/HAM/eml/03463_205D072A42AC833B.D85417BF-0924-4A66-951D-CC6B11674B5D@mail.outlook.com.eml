Hi all =97 A few of these to send from the First Lady next week. Let me kno=
w if you have any flags, and thanks!

=97v1(EJB)=97
Sender: Michelle Obama
Subject:

Friend=97

No matter how full Barack's plate gets, he always makes time for reading le=
tters from folks like you. And when he can, he writes back, because he know=
s who he serves.

And thanks to supporters like you, we=92ve been able to accomplish so much =
on behalf of so many. When I look around and see just how far we=92ve come =
in the past seven and a half years, I=92m truly amazed by the steps forward=
 we=92ve made on everything from health care to higher education to making =
sure we=92re leaving the planet a little better off than we found it for ou=
r children and grandchildren.

All of that is because folks like you stood up for what you believed in and=
 dug deep to help us cross this finish line. I know if he had the time, Bar=
ack would write a personal thank you note to each and every one of you. Bec=
ause that is how we got to where we are today. So this is my way of offerin=
g our thanks from the bottom of our hearts.

Our work isn=92t done yet, and so much will hang in the balance of this upc=
oming election, but I know that with supporters like you fighting the good =
fight, we=92re going to continue to build on this progress and see even mor=
e amazing things to come.

If you=92re ready to stand up again and help us get there this November, ad=
d your name with mine:

LINK

Thank you again, NAME.

Michelle


=97v2(CH)--
Sender: Michelle Obama
Subject:

Thank you so much, NAME. Really.

I know I say that often, but it=92s because I mean it. When I think about w=
hat folks like you have come together to accomplish over the past seven and=
 a half years, my heart feels so full. We=92ve come so far and done so much=
, and it=92s absolutely because you=92ve been on the front lines fighting f=
or the change we believe in, change that truly makes a difference in people=
=92s lives.

Our kids and grandkids are more likely to grow up in a world where their on=
ly limits are how big they=92re willing to dream and how hard they=92re wil=
ling to work. They=92ll inherit a country with a growing economy, with oppo=
rtunity to explore affordable higher educations options, with the chance to=
 get a start in life without the overwhelming burden of health insurance co=
sts because mom and dad can cover them for a few more years.

And it=92s worth pointing out, NAME: There are some folks who thought we=92=
d never see this day. But your tenacity and your unwavering commitment to f=
orming a more perfect union are what carried us through the most difficult =
parts of this journey. And I=92m so proud be able to say I was there workin=
g with you.

Right now, the next chapter of our country is entirely in your hands, NAME.=
 And I have total faith that you=92ll do great things because I=92ve seen w=
hat you can do.

But this moment is all about celebrating you, because you are the reason we=
=92ve made it this far, and the reason we=92ll keep doing the work that mat=
ters to make a difference.

So, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so, so much.

Michelle

P. S. =97 The first step in continuing this fight long after Barack and the=
 girls and I have left the White House is by electing leaders who want to f=
ight with us. Add your name if you=92re ready to do whatever it takes betwe=
en now and November 8th to make sure we do it:

Sender: Michelle Obama
Subject:

I write to you a lot, NAME, for so many different reasons. Sometimes I'm as=
king you to make a contribution to help get more Democrats elected across t=
he country. Sometimes I'm asking you to take a stand against the Republican=
s who want to take Barack's place in the Oval Office and undo all our hard =
work. But today, I want to say something else:

Thank you.

It goes unsaid too often by too many people, and I want to make sure I neve=
r ever forget to thank you for your commitment to Barack, and to this movem=
ent and the change we're creating together. Because at the end of the day, =
that's what this has all been about -- change we truly believe in, and chan=
ge that we fight for. I'm so grateful that you're on this team, fighting fo=
r our values, and fighting to improve the lives of millions of Americans. A=
nd I can't tell you enough how much it means that you've stood by us for al=
l these years, and that you're going to continue to stand up for what we be=
lieve in long after Barack has left office.

I know our work doesn't end when the next president steps into the White Ho=
use, and I know you'll keep pushing this country forward with your passion =
and your commitment to our Democratic values of equality and opportunity fo=
r all. So today, add your name next to mine to say you're ready for what's =
next:

LINK

Once again: Thank you, NAME.

Michelle
