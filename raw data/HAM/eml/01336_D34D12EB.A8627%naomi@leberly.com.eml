See below - somehow, I was lucky enough to get out of lunch and only have t=

below -
How hard is it?
Any advice on how to further answer this - I replied with something about t=
he campaign needing primary money and probably not counting victory fund mo=
ney for too much at this point?

The one question I need to get a handle on is what I get if I give the $33,=
400 by June 1 to the Victory Fund - either from the campaign or the DNC. an=
d, how does that compare to being a Hillraiser.

Well=85 giving to the DNC only strengthens it for when she is the nominee a=
nd gets you into the convention -
The argument for giving thru the Victory Fund is credit or access=85. If th=
e campaign will give you more credit for giving through the victory fund an=
d more access because you can attend a smaller event post convention with t=
hat max out check - then, you should wait - but going to convention is also=
 part of =93being there=94 and =93getting credit=94
So=85. Stephen Bittel is the co-chair with Henry Munoz and there are a hand=
ful of vice chairs including me - the staff and Stephen gave lists to each =
of the Vice Chairs - but I am happy to throw this back to the staff so you =
can discuss the options with them - no problem whatsoever -
Always happy to talk - lunch may 12 or 20? Lunch is harder this month becau=
se there are so many luncheons :(
And just send some times to talk on the phone - better than playing phone t=
ag!

We're back for good on the 8th. I plan on going to the convention and, of c=
ourse, want the best package but, in the scheme of everything, it's less im=
portant than Hillary becoming President. Happy to talk with you but my incl=
ination is to give to the Victory Fund. Also, I'm curious who asked you to =
reach out. They usually call me directly. In any event, let's talk, either =
by phone or over lunch, as I always value your opinion.

Glad the kids are doing well. That's most important.


Be well

B -
Hi!!! How are you? Are you and Sue back here full time yet?  today=92s weat=
her is probably not helping on that front - :(
I am the same as ever - busy with PP and the boys - my younger one is a mon=
th away from high school graduation!! Yay! And the older one is almost done=
 with freshman year and on his way home next week -
So=85.. Lucky you=85. I have been asked to contact you about your giving to=
 the DNC=85..I thought I would email you rather than call and put you on th=
e spot.
I know you are all in for Hillary (thank goodness things are looking good t=
here finally), but the DNC is looking to past generous supporters like you =
for contributions now, before the convention.  I know there is an argument =
for giving through the Hillary Victory Fund, but it is also important to gi=
ve now if you want anything at convention=85.. If you do another DNC max ou=
t check now, before June 1, you qualify for a convention package=85.. And I=
 am expecting you want to be there!  It has been my experience that the DNC=
 can do more for donors than the campaign can - at this point in the cycle =
for a first term presidential candidate -
You know=85 I am as up front and straightforward as possible - so there you=
 go
Let me know what you are thinking - the convention package information is a=
ttached
Xoxoxo
Naomi
