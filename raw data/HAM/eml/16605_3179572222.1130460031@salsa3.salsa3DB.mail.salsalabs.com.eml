Andrew -- If you've heard the recent news out of North Carolina, you're probably as outraged as I am. 

This shocking new law makes it possible for private companies to discriminate against LGBT Americans while taking away victims' right to legal recourse in North Carolina state court. That means any store owner, manager, or landlord can discriminate against someone for being gay without that person being able to sue them! 

The law also eviscerates all local protections for LGBT people and makes it impossible for cities to pass protections in the future.

North Carolina isn't alone in this -- legislators in Wisconsin, Kansas, Missouri, and several other states are now considering similar bills. Unless we stand up and fight, these laws will spread across the country.

Add your name and join me in standing up for the rights of LGBT citizens.

These laws are about one thing: Punishing LGBT Americans and creating pathways for private companies and citizens to discriminate against whoever they want.

Our nation has made tremendous strides towards equality, but we clearly still have a lot of work to do. If we don't take a stand against discrimination now, what's happening in North Carolina could happen anywhere, even Virginia.

Join me today and take a stand against this outrageous display of discrimination.
