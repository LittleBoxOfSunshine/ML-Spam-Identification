1) SCHOOL'S OUT: A school once run by BERNIE SANDERS' wife is shutting its doors. POLITICO's Kimberly Hefling reports that Burlington College, which Jane Sanders ran from 2004 to 2011, will close its doors on May 27 because of financial and accrediting problems. The closure is directly related to a big-ticket purchase that Jane Sanders spearheaded during her tenure. 

The school made a big real estate purchase to replace cramped campus space, acquiring 33 acres along Lake Champlain. The hope was that the scenic Vermont property would attract new students and donors. But the play did not work and the school, with around 70 students, will now shut its doors. Read more at: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e08780df339aa500acf6bdae1b9d4004b8a6954706534dde87 

Happy Monday. And happy anniversary to "Top Gun." We always bring a "Highway to the Danger Zone" mentality to your 2016 Blast. Don't we? Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through the day's campaign news, so send your tips, complaints and best cockpit chatter to: hjackson@politico.com. 

2) IS BENGHAZI's POLITICAL POWER WANING?: Before he left, the top counsel for the House Select Committee on Benghazi determined nothing could have been done to prevent deaths the night of an attack on a state department facility. Exchanges between Lt. General Dana Chipman and Leon Panetta show Chipman believed Panetta had taken the right steps on the night of the attack, POLITICO's Rachael Bade reports. Not that this revelation is likely to end scrutiny. Going forward, Republicans, led by Rep. Trey Gowdy are likely to press for more information. HILLARY CLINTON, though, benefits from releases like this. Aggressive attempts by House Democrats to release information that supports her
 essentially lengthen the debate: Zombifying a line of attack. It's still out there, but every leak like this diminishes its power. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e0479cdbe0e743a4fb7d9b79c1e8a7d5de60e41bc4b72001de 

3) LADIES FIGHT: A splash across The New York Times front page seems to have driven at least a newscycle's worth of stories about DONALD TRUMP and women. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e0f513bc9e64f2cced4380e9f3f8b6bd4be855c5e1a48272bd One of the subject's of the Times' piece, Rowanne Brewer Lane, complained today that the piece cast in a negative light an experience that, she said, was not negative. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e0e96f6a063957512a394ccb19025f88e216973fc514a677ef Fox News' Megyn Kelly chimed in that Trump had "no doubt" used some controversial language about women. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e01e6653aa021cbbd2538a2d48f05195693e495ab8c8acc8cf And Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus sort of addressed it - defending Trump but also calling for "a degree of
 diversity" when Trump picks his vice presidential canidate. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e0e4f4654c6830d98c351045166a9b261cd7f7380b94bbf8d4 

4) MAYBE TRUMP? Much attention has been paid to Republicans who might be endangered by DONALD TRUMP at the top of the ticket. But what about Democrats in Trump Country? POLITICO's Burgess Everett and Seung Min Kim talk to red state Democrats who sound, if nothing else, Trump curious. "The people will have a chance to vote. If Donald Trump is elected president there will be a great opportunity to sit down and have a conversation about what that agenda looks like," explained Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. The North Dakota Democrat is one of several senators up for reelection in 2018 who will be wondering what impact Trump has on their political futures. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e05e40859480dcdf333892a491959f0e49562e7de01bc2ef53 

5) PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE: In the category of vice presidential watch: POLITICO's Edward-Isaac Dovere picks up on an interesting move from Housing and Urban Development Sec. Julian Castro. He is set to announce changes to a controversial program that sells bad mortgages on the agency's books. The issue has been a sticking point for progressive activists, who have criticized the former Houston Mayor as being insufficiently liberal. Whether this is enough to quash those concerns is an open question, but it is an interesting move from a candidate oft-mentioned as a potential running mate for HILLARY CLINTON. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e0282d5c2b2b131d3d15ba74adddeeaf4cd0e9c7898414de85 

BLAST NOTE: You may have missed this Jeff Greenfield piece for POLITICO Magazine on why, this cycle, being a VP choice isn't as great an honor as it has been. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e0e333f8e5d0935b82d61398cc80a603c8c2d64af2221c5dd9 Oh. And yes, this more than qualifies for our VP selection theme song: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e034a3b40f65d68fd9275dbe06cf7185c5c9574ef1179b5dee 

TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, JOHN KASICH says no, DONALD TRUMP says nuh-uh. HILLARY CLINTON says Bill Clinton will be involved, but not that involved. Howard Wolfson steps up, BERNIE SANDERS takes San Juan. Homer Simpson chimes in, too.

NO KAS: JOHN KASICH rules out a third-party bid that would have been pretty hard to mount anyway. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e08efe83fb8efa10c4230c687bdf105e689b19725fcc6c3898 

BRIT BASHING: DONALD TRUMP responds to British Prime Minister David Cameron, tells him he is not dumb. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e01ed84dd8dd9e622a7bce38692050de037c4b7d58689280c7 

SO, FIRST DUDE THEN: HILLARY CLINTON says her husband won't be a Cabinet secretary. (ABC) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e02da73193dbd77646d78522d7d8b1e316524e308fb1668885 But, per CNN, he'll serve as a top economic advisor. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e02ca824b92a3ef913c707a3689aa386f8f77d759cb71ac81f 

BLAST NOTE: A former president running, say, the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Transportation sounds like a decent spec-script for a sitcom. 

WARREN SHOT: The New York Times looks at whether Elizabeth Warren could have beaten HILLARY CLINTON. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e043441eefb32da62c0f8fc2f83120c2a3fb732a1dd51b2a38 

WOLF HALL: Clinton 2008 aide Howard Wolfson, most recently seen as a potential architect of MICHAEL BLOOMBERG's candidacy, is hosting a fundraiser for HILLARY CLINTON. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e054b5e5819267d28e355d7e210bb5ca49e6385e0192b3ead5 

'SINCERE' PRAISE: HILLARY CLINTON wins plaudits for her outreach to black women. (Huffington Post) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e0ab0b7fdef9f3eba9508d462d274a4457853e531f826d3448 

IF YOU HAVE TO LISTICLE IT ... : "13 Times HILLARY CLINTON was cooler than you thought." (US Weekly) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e012ac3a09de6a18a8b17dfec5d0bb99393a7defbcdb5232f9 

BERN BABY BERN: DONALD TRUMP keeps insisting BERNIE SANDERS should mount a third-party candidacy. (Business Insider) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e00bb095c52d5980f6174732e83f56d91733ec4999e831cde8 

SAN JUAN ARDIENTE: BERNIE SANDERS was in San Juan and says he'd be an ally for Puerto Rico. (CNN). http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e0c4a49e0fabdc6924e84c14b73541a2279b3d9391b076e68a 

THE LESSON IS NEVER TRY: Last night, on a live episode of "The Simpsons" Homer Simpson "endorsed" BERNIE SANDERS and seemed to imply he'll stay in Springfield even if DONALD TRUMP is elected. Yup. (Newsweek) http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e066d4d1a814f903b4e4a8075aee1c2f7df3959e9beb9580da 

WHAT'S NEXT: Kentucky has a primary tomorrow! And so does Oregon! HILLARY CLINTON's been ahead in Kentucky but BERNIE SANDERS has been campaigning hard there and Clinton recently spent money on ads (and is in the Bluegrass State today). Sanders is favored in Oregon.

THEY SAID IT: "I mean, I view myself as a person that - like everybody else - is fighting for survival. I, that's all I view myself as." - DONALD TRUMP in an interview with Megyn Kelly. Master of his own self perception. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=885a81e8513039e06b18d561689abeba237c58cf5cb405428a7634ad344f7f03 

MAGIC NUMBER: 135. That's the number of delegates on the line for Democrats in Kentucky and Oregon tomorrow. (Kentucky has 61, Oregon 74.)
