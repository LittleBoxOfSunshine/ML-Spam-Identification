The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Justin --

It's Thursday night, the Republican primary debate is about
to start --  and that means that it's finally time for GOP Bingo!

http://GOPBingo.com

The rules are pretty simple: Go to the new website my team
and I set up, pick one of the ten Republicans (don't worry,
you can give them back after the debate!), then follow along
to see how many of our predictions come true.

Once you win, make sure you share your "BINGO!" on Facebook
and Twitter so your friends and family can see that you
survived the first GOP primary debate (and join in on the
fun, too).

Thousands of Democrats have already signed up to play
online tonight -- so don't miss out on this:

http://GOPBingo.com

See you on the internet, and have fun!
