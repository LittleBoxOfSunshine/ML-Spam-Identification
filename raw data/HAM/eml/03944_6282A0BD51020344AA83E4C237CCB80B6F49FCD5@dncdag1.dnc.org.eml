CA gave us Reagan and my wife Heidi.
Thanks former CA Gov. Pete Wilson for his endorsement.
Touts his announcement of Carly Fiorina as his running mate. Also talks up her background from rising from secretary to CEO. Carly is a leader you know well.
I can picture HRC tossing and turning thinking about Carly in her jail cell.
Republicans in CA are used to adversity. You have seen out of control liberalism. No need to look any further than out-of-control environmental regulations. Hits fresh water being dumped into the ocean for a bait fish.
Over 17,000 farm jobs have been lost. Hits endangered species lists. Jokes saying that we should put up a disco ball, play Barry White and let nature take its course.
Cruz: the endangered species act should not be used as a cudgel to hurt the economy.
The Republican Party is going to be the party of jobs.
California has seen the evil of the face of jihad, referencing the terrorist attack in San Bernardino
The CA primary will decide this Republican nomination.
Hits Hillary and Trump for being flip sides of the same coin. Also criticizes HRC and Trump for supporting Obamacare, Planned Parenthood, wanting to be neutral to be Israel and Palestine and the Iranian nuclear deal
Highlights Trump's support for prominent CA democrats like Kamala Harris

--

This election will come down to jobs, freedom and security.
Cruz: lift the boot of the necks of small business.
Cruz: If I am elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. We will pass health insurance that's personal, portable and affordable. We will pass a simple flat tax so that every American can fill out our taxes on a postcard. After we do that, we should abolish the IRS.
Cruz: we're going to rein in the EPA, federal agencies that have descended like locusts killing jobs all across the country.
We're going stop amnesty, secure the border. We're going to end sanctuary cities, welfare benefits for those here illegally. Goes on to say that will bring back manufacturing jobs from China and Mexico..
We're going to see manufacturing jobs coming back
Next important thing at stake is freedom. Says two branches hang in the balance in this election. Goes on to talk about different rights at stake if another liberal Supreme Court justice is appointed. Guns rights, religious liberty, sovereignty and school choice
Hits Trump for suggesting he would compromise religious liberty and second amendment rights to keep and bear arms. Adds that he's been supporting left wing Democratic politicians for 40 years.
Cruz: I give you my solemn commitment that every justice I appoint will be a principled constitutionalist that will protect the Bill of Rights. I will not compromise your religious liberty or right to keep and bear arms.
Cruz hits Trump for saying he would be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians. Adds that he will stand unapologetically with Israel.
Talks about how readiness and morale in the military has plummeted. Goes on to talk about how he will rebuild the military by repealing Obamacare, adopting a flat tax and stopping amnesty.
Cruz: no longer will our military be governed by political correctness. Criticizes President Obama for not saying radical Islamic terrorism.
Cruz: We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. To the jihadist, your day of reckoning is coming. Speaks out against the rules of engagement that he says is tying the hands of our military men and women.
Cruz: If military force is needed we should use overwhelming force, kill the enemy and get the heck out.
We started with 17 candidates, young dynamic candidates. Democratic field consist of a wild-eyed socialist with views that are dangerous for America and the world and Bernie Sanders.
Cruz: We're seeing Republicans coming together and uniting behind this campaign. 60-75% of Republicans recognize that nominating Donald Trump would be a train wreck.
Touts the fact that 5 of 17 presidential candidates have endorsed his campaign.
Closes by asking for support
