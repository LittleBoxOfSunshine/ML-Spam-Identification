I thinks it's going to be fine. Our leg staff is very protective. Reply to the whole chain with this context and I'm sure it will be okay.

Our ANA contact (Monisha Smith) mentioned Zika and opioids because they've been in the news lately and POTUS has given some high level speeches about it lately. If the issues come up at all, it will be the 9,000 foot view of the issues but I think the majority of the conversation is going to be political gossip and presidential election strategy.
