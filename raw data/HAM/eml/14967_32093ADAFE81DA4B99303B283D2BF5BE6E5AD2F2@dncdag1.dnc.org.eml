No, John Kasich, I don't want Taylor Swift tickets<http://www.thecollegianu=
r.com/article/2015/10/no-john-kasich-i-dont-want-taylor-swift-tickets>
THE COLLEGIAN // KAYLA SOLSBAK

My hand was raised, my body half-way out of my back-row seat, when Gov. Joh=
n Kasich finally acknowledged me.

"I'm sorry, I don't have any Taylor Swift concert tickets," he said, his ey=
es meeting mine.

The older members of the audience chuckled as my friends' jaws dropped to t=
he floor. It was astonishingly clear that Gov. Kasich did not come to Richm=
ond for my vote.

On Monday morning, hundreds of students and community members poured into t=
he Jepson Alumni Center to ask questions of the presidential candidate. Whe=
n my friends and I arrived, we were asked to sit in a special section direc=
tly behind where Kasich would speak. We declined, but other students filled=
 the seats. It was clear they were put there for the cameras with the expec=
tation that they wouldn't speak.

Kasich's opening statements painted a picture of an ambitious son of a mail=
man's rise to success, citing anecdotes about his college years, including =
one in which he met with President Nixon as a freshman. He continued on to =
give advice to students, lecturing on lack of spirituality and drug usage. =
"I know I'm going to sound like your dad, but don't mess around with the dr=
ugs," Kasich said.

While the lectures were condescending, the real issue was that Kasich chose=
 not to listen to students in his forum. Most of the questions came from ol=
der members of the community, many vocalizing their support of Kasich befor=
e throwing him a softball question. Kasich barreled through a Planned Paren=
thood question, dismissing the young woman who posed it, and derided me whe=
n I had the audacity to raise my hand. Kasich came to Richmond to pander to=
 retired Republicans. He could gain points by belittling me and my peers, s=
o that's what he did.

What continues to strike me is the hypocrisy of his condescension. He toute=
d his ambitious energy as an 18-year-old man, but as soon as I, an 18-year-=
old woman, exhibited ambition, I became the target of his joke. The same pa=
ssion that drove Kasich to speak with President Nixon drove me to ask the c=
andidate a question I care deeply about. In a way, I was taking the governo=
r's advice: "Always ask."

In a half-hearted attempt to connect with young voters, Kasich entered the =
town hall forum with the 2014 hit song "Shut Up and Dance With Me" blasting=
 from the speakers. While my friends all found it out of place, I realized =
that the song's title accurately reflects Kasich's message to young voters:=
 shut up and elect me. If the candidate wants to connect with my peers, he =
can't do it through superficial pop culture references. If he wants our vot=
es, he needs to listen to our voices and address the issues we care about. =
The president leads the country, not the VMAs, and it's insulting that the =
governor doesn't think we can distinguish between the two.

I didn't go to a town hall forum for Taylor Swift tickets, Gov. Kasich. I w=
ent because it's my civic duty to be an informed voter. Please start treati=
ng me like one.
