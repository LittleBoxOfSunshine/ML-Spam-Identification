e=3D"2" style=3D"color: #000000;">In 2013, Providence Day embarked on the C=
harging Forward campaign at the direction of the Board of Trustees, and in =
full partnership with school leadership. The goal of the ambitious -- yet a=
chievable -- $27 million comprehensive campaign is to enhance all aspects o=
f student life, both inside and outside the classroom, for generations to c=
ome.</font></p> <p><font size=3D"2" style=3D"color: #000000;">The progress =
and ultimate success of the anticipated five-year Charging Forward campaign=
 has depended on a thoughtful, strategic, and measured approach. Since the =
planning for the campaign began in 2011, the Board has remained committed t=
o balancing fiscal responsibility with an entrepreneurial spirit, while alw=
ays acting in the best interest of the school.</font></p> <p><font size=3D"=
2" style=3D"color: #000000;">This transformational initiative has been met =
with incredible acts of philanthropy from our community, with more than $18=
.6 million being raised to date.</font></p> <p><font size=3D"2" style=3D"co=
lor: #000000;">As a valued member of the Providence Day family, you will be=
 pleased to know that we will break ground in Summer 2016. This decision wa=
s based on several positive factors, including a booming construction indus=
try, a strong economy, and the widespread enthusiasm our community has show=
n thus far by investing in the campaign.</font></p> <p><font size=3D"2" sty=
le=3D"color: #000000;">Most important in this decision, however, is our ful=
l confidence that PD faculty, staff, parents, alumni, alumni parents, and g=
randparents will continue to support the campaign with the same Charger spi=
rit and pride that have propelled us to this moment. We must continue the g=
reat momentum and focus on reaching our individual Capital, Endowment, and =
Annual Fund goals. We know you will rise to the challenge.</font></p> <p><f=
ont size=3D"2" style=3D"color: #000000;">Please plan to join us for a celeb=
ratory Groundbreaking event on Wednesday, May 25 at 4pm. You will receive a=
n email invitation next week.</font></p> <p><font size=3D"2" style=3D"color=
: #000000;">To everyone who has already contributed to the Charging Forward=
 campaign, and to the many whose generous gifts we still anticipate, thank =
you for empowering our mission and for safeguarding the future of Providenc=
e Day School. We look forward to seeing you on May 25.</font><br></p> <p><f=
