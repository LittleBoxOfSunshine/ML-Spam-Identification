INSIDE THE RYAN-TRUMP DETENTE - Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan with the back story on the consequential meeting for POLITICO: "As Donald Trump and Paul Ryan approached their big meeting with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, a key detail had been worked out ahead of time: Who, besides the principals, would be in the room? It was agreed that each man would be allowed a single aide. Trump tapped Paul Manafort, his D.C. fixer, and Ryan chose Kevin Seifert, his political director."

--"But when the big session was set to begin - after Trump and Ryan had met privately with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus - the New York billionaire suddenly allowed a flock of his campaign advisers inside. So Ryan invited in several of his own top hands. The rapprochement between the GOP's presumed standard-bearer and its top elected official - assuming that's what this is - is clearly a work in progress."

--"The two are on separate planets, ideologically and temperamentally, and one much-hyped morning summit was never going to produce some magical mind-meld. But now - after a get-together that was described by sources as pleasant, productive, even interesting - Trump and Ryan are waltzing toward 'unity,' or something approaching it." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79741dfa621f70a5e61d96c3f9c45133db1bca7bb775ea4b24db40e06a66b3c4

--Trump endorser complains: Rachael Bade reports for POLITICO: "One of Donald Trump's top allies in Congress slammed the presumptive GOP nominee after he failed to meet with rank-and-file lawmakers backing his campaign during his ballyhooed trip to Capitol Hill on Thursday.

Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) told POLITICO that Trump refused multiple requests to meet with members of Congress working to round up support for him in Washington." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79741dfa621f70a576cdffb79f8fafad863db5221b90221aba8a9a57a7a78f60

HAPPY FRIDAY, May 13, 2016 and you're reading the Huddle, where we're breathing a big sigh of relief after this long week. Burgess Everett will guide you through the wacky world of Congress via Huddle next week, so hit him up at beverett@politico.com and on Twitter at @burgessev.

My new followers include @SenatorLankford and @reemadodin.

TODAY IN CONGRESS - The House is in at 9 a.m. with first votes between 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. and last votes from 11:45 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. to finish up work on opioid legislation. It's Friday, so the Senate is out.

AROUND THE HILL - Reps. David Jolly (R-Fla.), Richard Nugent (R-Fla.), Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.) and Pete Olson (R-Texas) on Police Week at 9 a.m. at House Triangle. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democrats will hold a news conference on the House's fetal tissue probe at 9:15 a.m. in HVC Studio A. Rep. Brad Ashford (D-Neb.) will lead a news conference on the Kerrie Orozco Act at noon at House Triangle. House Republicans will hold a news conference following the passage of opioid legislation at the second round of votes at H-207. Approximate time is 12:30 p.m.

CRUZ CROSSES CAPITOL TO THANK HOUSE TEXAS GOP - Sen. Ted Cruz went to the Texas Republican delegation's weekly lunch on Thursday to thank members for their support during his failed presidential run. Several of the Lone Star State's GOP lawmakers had endorsed the senator. He was greeted with some "Texas Republican delegation love," according to Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas). What exactly does that mean? Barton would only reveal that includes "All the Blue Bell ice cream and Collin Street Bakery pecan pie you can eat."

SENATE TO VOTE ON ZIKA NEXT WEEK - The AP's Andrew Taylor: "Top Senate negotiators announced agreement Thursday on a $1.1 billion emergency funding measure to battle the Zika virus. That's less than President Barack Obama's $1.9 billion request, which has upset some senior Democrats. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., told reporters that she still prefers Obama's proposal but has reached agreement with Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., on the smaller measure, which is likely to be added next week to a bill funding veterans and transportation programs. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., immediately set up a floor vote on the measure for next week." 

--"Aides to both Democrats and Republicans said the Blunt-Murray proposal is likely to pass easily in the Senate, though Sens. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., are demanding a vote on the full $1.9 billion administration request. No. 2 Sen. Republican John Cornyn of Texas is likely to offer an alternative that is financed with spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. Both of those plans are likely to fall to filibusters, however, leaving the Blunt-Murray compromise as the only option." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79741dfa621f70a518bf9e4895eb4e5830e965f0b66a905db40c9004192e13ad

LAWMAKERS RENEWING AUMF PUSH - HuffPo's Jen Bendery: "A frustrated group of House lawmakers is taking another crack at forcing Congress to debate a war it has already spent billions of dollars on - without ever actually voting to authorize it. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said Thursday that she and a handful of other members will try to add language to a must-pass defense authorization bill that would require Congress to pass a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force for the self-described Islamic State." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79741dfa621f70a587a81ab18ecc487880fb797a1b19283efa280ad70e2178fc

JOHN BOEHNER, UNPLUGGED (AGAIN) - The Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus from Las Vegas: "The former speaker offered some unsolicited criticism of [Ted] Cruz, [Donald] Trump's roughest rival in the primary fight, who has frequently tangled with Republican Party leaders. 'Thank God that guy from Texas didn't win,' he said, calling the 2013 government shutdown led by Mr. Cruz the 'dumbest thing I ever saw.'"

--"Referencing his comments last month calling Mr. Cruz 'Lucifer in the flesh,' Mr. Boehner joked, 'I got criticized by some Satanic organization for giving Lucifer a bad name.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79741dfa621f70a5a2f69bfc11630917114539b4db57e3b5a69ae8025a8179d5

THURSDAY'S TRIVIA WINNER - Greg Smith was the first person to correctly answer that Adlai Stevenson was the grandson of Grover Cleveland's vice president who was the Democratic nominee for president twice. Stevenson ran in 1952 and 1956.

TODAY'S TRIVIA - Greg has today's question: Which vice president's father was president of Princeton? Name both the vice president and the father. The first person to correctly answer will get a mention in the next day's Huddle. E-mail skim@politico.com.

It's Friday, so the Senate is out.</p><p><b>AROUND THE HILL - </b>Reps. <b>David</b> <b>Jolly</b> (R-Fla.), <b>Richard</b> <b>Nugent</b> (R-Fla.), <b>Tom</b> <b>MacArthur</b> (R-N.J.), <b>Gus</b> <b>Bilirakis</b> (R-Fla.) and <b>Pete</b> <b>Olson</b> (R-Texas) on Police Week at 9 a.m. at House Triangle. House Minority Leader <b>Nancy</b> <b>Pelosi</b> (D-Calif.) and other Democrats will hold a news conference on the House's fetal tissue probe at 9:15 a.m. in HVC Studio A. Rep. <b>Brad</b> <b>Ashford
</b> (D-Neb.) will lead a news conference on the Kerrie Orozco Act at noon at House Triangle. House Republicans will hold a news conference following the passage of opioid legislation at the second round of votes at H-207. Approximate time is 12:30 p.m.</p><p><b>CRUZ CROSSES CAPITOL TO THANK HOUSE TEXAS GOP 
</b>- Sen. Ted Cruz went to the Texas Republican delegation's weekly lunch on Thursday to thank members for their support during his failed presidential run. Several of the Lone Star State's GOP lawmakers had endorsed the senator. He was greeted with some &quot;Texas Republican delegation love,&quot; according to Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas). What exactly does that mean? Barton would only reveal that includes &quot;All the Blue Bell ice cream and Collin Street Bakery pecan pie you can eat.&quot;</p><p><b>SENATE TO VOTE ON ZIKA NEXT WEEK
</b> - The AP's Andrew Taylor: &quot;Top Senate negotiators announced agreement Thursday on a $1.1 billion emergency funding measure to battle the Zika virus. That's less than President Barack Obama's $1.9 billion request, which has upset some senior Democrats. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., told reporters that she still prefers Obama's proposal but has reached agreement with Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., on the smaller measure, which is likely to be added next week to a bill funding veterans and transportation programs. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., immediately set up a floor vote on the measure for next week.&quot; </p>
<p>--&quot;Aides to both Democrats and Republicans said the Blunt-Murray proposal is likely to pass easily in the Senate, though Sens. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., are demanding a vote on the full $1.9 billion administration request. No. 2 Sen. Republican John Cornyn of Texas is likely to offer an alternative that is financed with spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. Both of those plans are likely to fall to filibusters, however, leaving the Blunt-Murray compromise as the only option.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79741dfa621f70a518bf9e4895eb4e5830e965f0b66a905db40c9004192e13ad" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/xMit7h</a></p><p><b>LAWMAKERS RENEWING AUMF PUSH
</b> - HuffPo's Jen Bendery: &quot;A frustrated group of House lawmakers is taking another crack at forcing Congress to debate a war it has already spent billions of dollars on - without ever actually voting to authorize it. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said Thursday that she and a handful of other members will try to add language to a must-pass defense authorization bill that would require Congress to pass a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force for the self-described Islamic State.&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79741dfa621f70a587a81ab18ecc487880fb797a1b19283efa280ad70e2178fc" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/yTjFDr</a></p><p><b>JOHN BOEHNER, UNPLUGGED (AGAIN) - 
</b>The Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus from Las Vegas:  &quot;The former speaker offered some unsolicited criticism of [Ted] Cruz, [Donald] Trump's roughest rival in the primary fight, who has frequently tangled with Republican Party leaders. 'Thank God that guy from Texas didn't win,' he said, calling the 2013 government shutdown led by Mr. Cruz the 'dumbest thing I ever saw.'&quot;</p><p>--&quot;Referencing his comments last month calling Mr. Cruz 'Lucifer in the flesh,' Mr. Boehner joked, 'I got criticized by some Satanic organization for giving Lucifer a bad name.'&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=79741dfa621f70a5a2f69bfc11630917114539b4db57e3b5a69ae8025a8179d5" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/3sbOfi</a></p><p>
