The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Friends-

In complete candor, I cannot think of a single presidential election in my =
lifetime (and yes, I was born after the Johnson-Goldwater race) when it =
was more important for us to defeat the Republican nominee for president.  =
Not only are women insulted and denigrated by the other party's nominee on =
an almost daily basis, but our more than two-century old system of =
constitutional checks, balances and compromise is very much at risk.=20

Accordingly, please join me and special guests Tina Tchen and noted =
women's rights attorney Gloria Allred on May 31st at 7:00 p.m. for dinner =
to help raise awareness for critical DNC efforts to make sure, for the =
sake of ourselves and of our children, that the arc of history keeps =
bending toward justice.=20

Please see the formal invitation below.

My very best regards,

Robbie
