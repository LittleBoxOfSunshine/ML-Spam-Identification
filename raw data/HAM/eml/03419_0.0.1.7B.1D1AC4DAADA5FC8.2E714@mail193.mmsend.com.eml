Most business relationships are memorialized by a written contract. Extreme=
 care must be exercised to ensure that what appears on the printed page acc=
urately reflects the wishes of the parties and provides sufficient safeguar=
ds for your company should an issue arise. Too often, however, parties rush=
 into signing a contract or attorneys recycle old agreements that may inclu=
de terms that do not reflect the needs of the parties or the specifics of t=
he particular deal. This can lead to trouble down the road should a dispute=
 arise. Please join us for this four-part series as we covers the common ch=
aracteristics of many contracts and issues to consider to help you ensure t=
hat what appears in the written document reflects your company's needs shou=

Insurance Concerns in Commercial Contracts: Addressing Unique Risk Profiles=
 for Your Deal http://www.financialofficerwebadvisor.com/schedule/detail/in=
surance-concerns-in-commercial-contracts

May 18, 2016 @ 1 PM (ET)

Commercial contracts too often include outdated, boilerplate insurance prov=
isions copied from prior transactions without consideration for the specifi=
c circumstances of the individual agreement. Relying on these old terms can=
 be a significant problem for your company should a problem surface during =
the course of the agreement. In this webinar, we will examine specific insu=
rance issues for you to take into account when your company negotiates its =
next commercial contract, including drafting specific provisions to protect=
 your company's best interests in numerous situations that nearly all busin=
esses routinely face.

Employer Negligence Claims: What Are They and What They Mean for HR http://=

May 19, 2016 @ 1 PM (ET)

Employers can be at risk for lawsuits based upon claims of negligence. Thes=
e can include allegations of both negligent hiring and retention. Negligent=
 hiring typically occurs when employers and usually the Human Resources Dep=
artment fail to check both a candidate's references and conduct a backgroun=
d check.=A0Negligent retention occurs when an employee shows warning signs =
of becoming violent and the company doesn't take action.=A0In this webinar,=
 we will discuss relevant cases on both negligent hiring and retention and =
provide recommendations on best practices for avoiding these types of claim=
s.

Succession Planning for Businesses: Preparing Now for the Future of the Com=
pany http://www.financialofficerwebadvisor.com/schedule/detail/succession-p=
lanning-for-businesses--preparing-now

June 1, 2016 @ 1 PM (ET)

Succession planning is a critical step to a business' survival beyond the w=
orking lives of its founders. There is no "one size fits all" succession pl=
an for an organization; each business' plan is unique. However, there are c=
ommon techniques that may be used to assist business clients in their succe=
ssion goals regardless of whether the plan involves a gift to a family memb=
er, a transition to a long-term employee or a sale to an unrelated third-pa=
rty buyer. Please join us as we discuss legal techniques that can be tailor=
ed to satisfy your institution's specific succession planning goals. In add=
ition, hear tips on how to avoid the most common pitfalls in the planning p=
rocess.

Linking KPIs with Business Strategy: An Important Tool for Measuring How We=
ll a Company Is Achieving Its Goals and Objectives http://www.financialoffi=
cerwebadvisor.com/schedule/detail/linking-kpis-with-business-strategy

June 2, 2016 @ 1 PM (ET)

KPIs, key performance indicators, are metrics which are used to assess how =
a business is performing against its business objectives. KPIs can be finan=
cial or nonfinancial in nature, and it's the finance area of the company th=
at most frequently takes the lead in developing these key performance measu=
res. Too many companies are missing a real opportunity to improve their per=
formance by not utilizing KPIs which adequately reflect the nature of their=
 business. Please join us as we explore the nature and importance of KPIs, =
and examine actionable techniques for improving your KPIs that can be imple=
mented immediately, to help better manage your business.

Health Plan Dependent Eligibility Audits: Potential Benefits and Best Pract=
ices http://www.financialofficerwebadvisor.com/schedule/detail/health-plan-=
dependent-eligibility-audits

June 7, 2016 @ 1 PM (ET)

As health coverage costs continue to increase, there's growing interest in =
eligibility audits. In addition, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) added some n=
ew limits on retroactive cancellation of health plan coverage, even when th=
e cancellation is based on a lack of eligibility. Those ACA rules apply to =
grandfathered and non-grandfathered health plans, insured and self-funded p=
lans, and they impose notice and external review requirements. Please join =
us as we offer best practices for conducting health plan dependent audits a=
long with the related regulatory requirements.

The Attorney-Client Privilege: Beyond the Basics http://www.financialoffice=
rwebadvisor.com/schedule/detail/the-attorney-client-privilege--beyond-the-b=
asics

June 8, 2016 @ 1 PM (ET)

While the attorney-client privilege is one of the most recognizable legal d=
octrines in the United States, its scope, applicability and limitations oft=
en go unappreciated. Likewise, there are a number of myths related to the p=
rivilege on which many attorneys misguidedly rely every day. What communica=
tions actually are privileged? Who is the "client" when a business entity i=
s involved? What special considerations are there if the attorney is in-hou=
se counsel? When will a third-party's presence destroy or not destroy the p=
rivilege? What happens to the privilege if a company is sold? Join us for a=
 fast-paced discussion of the attorney-client privilege that will go well b=
eyond the basics.

How to Read an Insurance Policy: Understanding Your Coverage Before a Loss =
Occurs http://www.financialofficerwebadvisor.com/schedule/detail/how-to-rea=
d-an-insurance-policy--understanding

June 9, 2016 @ 1 PM (ET)

You make great investments in training, support and developing an employee =
and then that person leaves and uses all of that special knowledge to take =
your customers and business secrets to a competitor. How can you protect yo=
ur company's interests before that scenario takes place? Can you use a Non-=
Compete/Non-Solicitation Agreement to limit the damage? Yes, if you know ho=
w to draft one that is enforceable. Please join us as we examine the key co=
nsiderations for requiring that employees sign a non-compete agreement, fac=
tors that will impact whether an agreement can be enforced, and alternative=
s to a non-compete agreement that should be considered.

Beyond the Basics of Contract Drafting: Exploring the More Complex Details =
http://www.financialofficerwebadvisor.com/schedule/detail/beyond-the-basics=
-of-contract-drafting--exploring-the-details

June 16, 2016 @ 1 PM (ET)

While there are many common terms and themes that appear in contracts, each=
 agreement has its own distinctive characteristics specific to the company =
and the particulars of the deal. Those unique issues often require nuanced =
contract drafting to ensure they are accurately captured in the agreement. =
Please join us as we discuss some of the more complex issues drafters face =
when crafting a contract, helping you avoid potential ambiguities that coul=
d derail a deal or lead to costly dispute resolution.

Director and Officer Liability: The New Normal of Increased Scrutiny and Li=
ability http://www.financialofficerwebadvisor.com/schedule/detail/director-=
and-officer-liability--the-new-normal

June 29, 2016 @ 12 PM (ET)

Businesses are now facing increased investigation and litigation. This scru=
tiny often falls on the shoulders of the officers and directors of the orga=
nization. With multiple actions coming from different government agencies a=
nd regulatory bodies, it can be a costly legal quagmire. Government regulat=
ors are increasing enforcement actions against corporate directors, particu=
larly in cases relating to oversight and management of internal financial c=
ontrols. Moreover, regulators have looked to impose personal liability on c=
hief compliance officers for compliance failures at the highest levels. Ple=
ase join us for a program that examines the recent trends in director and o=
fficer liability exposure and how you can minimize and mitigate liabilities=
 for your officers, directors and your business.

The Foundation of Contract Drafting: The Devil Is in the Details http://www=
.financialofficerwebadvisor.com/schedule/detail/the-foundation-of-contract-=
drafting--the-devil-is-in-the-detail

May 26, 2016 @ 1 PM (ET)

A well-drafted contract at the outset of any relationship can serve to defi=
ne the parties' relationship in order to avoid conflicts down the road, and=
 function as the vehicle for conflict resolution when things go south. Ambi=
guities, omissions and inconsistencies can doom the relationship and compli=
cate any subsequent conflicts. Please join us as we cover the core principl=
es that should appear in any well-drafted contract to help ensure that the =
parties' relationship on paper is well-defined and includes the proper safe=
guards to protect everyone's interests.

ized by a written contract. Extreme care must be exercised to ensure that w=
hat appears on the printed page accurately reflects the wishes of the parti=
es and provides sufficient safeguards for your company should an issue aris=
e. Too often, however, parties rush into signing a contract or attorneys re=
cycle old agreements that may include terms that do not reflect the needs o=
f the parties or the specifics of the particular deal. This can lead to tro=
uble down the =0A=
road should a dispute arise. Please join us for this four-part series as we=
 covers the common characteristics of many contracts and issues to consider=
 to help you ensure that what appears in the written document reflects your=

                            Employers can be at risk for lawsuits based upo=
n claims of negligence. These can include allegations of both negligent hir=
ing and retention. Negligent hiring typically occurs when employers and usu=
ally the Human Resources Department fail to check both a candidate's refere=
nces and conduct a background check.&nbsp;Negligent retention occurs when a=
n employee shows warning signs of becoming violent and the company doesn't =
take action.&nbsp;In this webinar, we will discuss =0A=
relevant cases on both negligent hiring and retention and provide recommend=
ations on best practices for avoiding these types of claims.=0A=

                           Succession planning is a critical step to a busi=
ness' survival beyond the working lives of its founders. There is no &quot;=
one size fits all&quot; succession plan for an organization; each business'=
 plan is unique. However, there are common techniques that may be used to a=
ssist business clients in their succession goals regardless of whether the =
plan involves a gift to a family member, a transition to a long-term employ=
ee or a sale to an unrelated third-party buyer. Please join us =0A=
as we discuss legal techniques that can be tailored to satisfy your institu=
tion's specific succession planning goals. In addition, hear tips on how to=
 avoid the most common pitfalls in the planning process.=0A=
