*Time to re-examine Nevada=E2=80=99s caucus system
<http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/time-re-examine-nevada-s-caucus-syste=
m>*



*By Roberta Lange*

*Special to the Review-Journal*


Posted April 25, 2016



On Feb. 20, voters made their voices heard in the Democratic presidential
race at precinct caucuses across Nevada, many of them for the first time.
The contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders was energetic and
hard-fought, a clear reminder of why the country needs an early state with
Nevada=E2=80=99s demographic, regional and cultural diversity.



But despite the substantial innovations the Nevada State Democratic Party
incorporated this year, the caucus process remains difficult for too many
people. The neighborhood meeting format may have made sense in an earlier
time, but it simply doesn=E2=80=99t make as much sense today.



We sought out input over the past two months, and we=E2=80=99re listening. =
Long
lines and technological mishaps are not acceptable, and they turn voters
off from taking part in an important civic duty.



But before we look at how we can improve things in future elections, let=E2=
=80=99s
remember how we got here in the first place.



Nevada has actually been a presidential caucus state by statute since 1981.
When Nevada and South Carolina were formally moved up on the presidential
calendar for the 2008 election cycle, the Democratic National Committee
wanted the balance of adding one primary state and one caucus state to join
Iowa and New Hampshire before Super Tuesday. We were able to become an
early state because the Nevada Legislature had defined us in state law as a
caucus state.



The reality is that Nevada has been a caucus state for decades, and the
only change in 2008 was our early-state status =E2=80=94 and the increased
attention from voters, candidates and the media that came with it.



In the 2015 legislative session, Nevada Republicans led a poorly timed
effort to shift our state to a presidential primary system and change the
rules in the middle of the game. The push demonstrated a total lack of
understanding of the politics surrounding the presidential primary calendar=
.



This plan, introduced less than a year before the presidential nominating
process began, created serious uncertainty and would have put Nevada at
risk of losing its early slot on the calendar. Local county registrars were
vocal in expressing their logistical concerns. Democratic legislators were
right to prevent this plan from becoming law.



Opposing the Republicans=E2=80=99 misguided proposal was never about preser=
ving the
caucuses for the sake of the caucuses. It was about preserving Nevada=E2=80=
=99s
vital role as one of the four early states.



With the caucuses in the rear-view mirror, now is the right time for
Nevadans to re-examine our existing caucus system and foster a thoughtful
discussion about how we move forward to make this process more convenient
and accessible.



Whether it=E2=80=99s shifting to a state-funded primary or substantially re=
vamping
the mechanics of the party-run caucuses, we will need to work with the
Nevada legislature and the DNC to protect our priorities as Democrats: to
increase voter access and retain our important position in this process.



A presidential primary, managed and paid for by the state, could divert
limited resources away from critical and underfunded services such as
education and mental health. It would also repeal the same-day voter
registration currently enjoyed by Democratic caucus-goers in Nevada. If
Republicans are sincere about increasing voter participation, their calls
for changing the caucus system must include adopting same-day voter
registration.



Nevada=E2=80=99s caucuses empowered our diverse population to be heard in 2=
016,
helping ensure that Western values are represented in the Democratic Party
and our national political discourse. We need to make certain that happens
again in 2020 =E2=80=94 in a way that=E2=80=99s easier and opens the door f=
or more Nevada
voters. We look forward to continuing this conversation and hearing your
ideas in the months ahead.
