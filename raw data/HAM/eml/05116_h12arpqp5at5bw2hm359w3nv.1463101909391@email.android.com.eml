Subject: letter from Delegate to DWS

HI.  Hal Gazaway is the chair of HD 19.  He generally has been helpful to u=
s in dealing with the insurgency.  He wrote and sent out the 2nd attachment=
 (letter to delegates) yesterday =96 I had no idea he was going to say what=
 he did about DWS.  Then, today he brought me the letter to DWS (first atta=
chment).

He said, if she were to address these issues in the first 5 minutes of her =
talk Saturday night, it might reassure people and keep them from walking ou=
t.  He said he=92s asking people to hear her out and give her a chance.

I said I would pass this on.  I don=92t know anything about the issues he i=
s raising in this letter.
