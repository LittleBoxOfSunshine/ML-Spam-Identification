THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary



________________________________________________________________



For Immediate Release May 2, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING



BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room









**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.



12:52 P.M. EDT







 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I hope you've all recovered from=
 a busy weekend of source-building. (Laughter.) I know it was all busines=
s all the time over the weekend for everybody in this room. So hope you f=
ound time for a little fun, as well.







 I do not have any announcements to start. So, Kevin, we can go straight =
to your questions.







 Q Thank you, Josh. What is the White House's reaction to Puerto Rico's d=
efault of $370 million in bond payments? Did it have better options? And =
will this default create more urgency for lawmakers and the Obama adminis=
tration to work something out?







 MR. EARNEST: Kevin, I sure hope it creates a new sense of urgency for me=
mbers of Congress to address this situation. It's a situation that we've =
been concerned about for quite some time. It's now been 194 days since th=
e administration put forward our legislative proposal for addressing this=
 situation. So I think that should be an indication to you and to the peo=
ple of Puerto Rico that the administration has been focused on this for s=
ix months now. And unfortunately, we havent seen the kind of movement in =
the Republican-led Congress that we need to see to make a bailout of Puer=
to Rico less likely.=20







The truth is, what the administration is seeking is to empower the Puerto=
 Rican government with the kind of restructuring authority that cities al=
l across the country have. And the administration believes that that rest=
ructuring authority should be contingent on the Puerto Rican government m=
aking some needed financial reforms. We also believe that there should be=
 a mechanism for accountability and verifying that those reforms are bein=
g appropriately implemented.=20







 So that's why it's wrong for people to describe this as a bailout. But t=
he situation gets worse by the day. And some days, in some situations -- =
in some days, the situation gets notably worse. And it only makes a bailo=
ut more likely, which is why we continue to press hard for Republicans in=
 Congress to stop dragging their feet and to address a situation that's h=
aving a negative impact on more than 3 million Americans who live in Puer=
to Rico.







 Q Were there better options than today's default, such as maybe slashing=
 government services? Is that the route Puerto Rico should have gone?







 MR. EARNEST: I think you'd be hard-pressed to make that case. But I'm ce=
rtainly no financial expert. I'm not aware of all of the options that wer=
e available to the Puerto Rican government. And I dont think there's anyb=
ody here who can -- well, I'll just say, I dont think there are any good =
options for the Puerto Rican government at this point. And that's exactly=
 why this restructuring authority is badly needed. You might even say tha=
t it's overdue. And it's also why a set of financial reforms is overdue, =
because there clearly are some significant problems that are plaguing the=
 Puerto Rican government's budget but also having a negative impact on th=
e broader economy.=20







 So this situation requires an urgent response, and Republicans in Congre=
ss have been dragging their feet for too long.







 Q Can you talk about where the President stands on this idea of creating=
 safe zones within Syria? In the past, he's described them as impractical=
. And I would like to ask you, what has changed and what is the U.S. prep=
ared to do to enforce these safe zones?







 MR. EARNEST: So, Kevin, I think there has been, in the lexicon here of d=
escribing the chaotic situation in Syria, there has been some, shall we s=
ay, confusion. The confusion does not stem from any government officials =
that I've seen, but it does apply to some observers of the situation. The=
 President's view of safe zones has not changed. The President does not b=
elieve at this point that safe zones are a practical alternative to what =
currently is happening in Syria right now. There have been some who have =
advocated for the creation of no-fly zones or safe zones inside of Syria =
that would essentially provide a sanctuary for Syrian citizens.=20







The President is concerned about that kind of proposal because it puts th=
e United States on the hook for essentially safeguarding the safe zones. =
That would require a significant commitment of ground troops. It would al=
so put those ground troops on the front lines, because presumably you wou=
ld have ISIL trying to encroach on those safe zones or trying to infiltra=
te them, and it could set up a very dangerous situation for American forc=
es that doesnt actually make a lot of progress in terms of degrading and =
destroying ISIL.=20







 Now, the context in which safe zones has most recently been mentioned ha=
s been in the context of the cessation of hostilities. The cessation of h=
ostilities was an agreement that the United States, Russia, and the rest =
of the international community, including the Assad regime, signed on to =
at the beginning of the year. And we warned -- we were aware at the begin=
ning of the implementation of that cessation of hostilities that there we=
re likely to be violations; that the implementation of that cessation of =
hostilities was likely to be bumpy. And the truth is, for most of the las=
t couple of months, that cessation of hostilities has worked more effecti=
vely in reducing the violence in Syria than most people thought. And we w=
ere, frankly, surprised that the level of violence did reduce as much -- =
did come down as far as it did.=20







 There have been violations all along. Whats happened in the last couple =
of weeks is that we've seen an increase in the severity and frequency of =
violations of the cessation of hostilities. And what we have sought to do=
 is to refresh that cessation of hostilities in those areas of the countr=
y where we've seen it start to fray.







 And the United States has been engaged in conversations with the Russian=
s to try to get them to use their influence with the Assad regime to go b=
ack to living up to the commitments that they made in the context of the =
cessation of hostilities all across the country. This is a nationwide com=
mitment that has been made. And in many places in the country it has yiel=
ded positive impacts on the ground. But there are some areas where it has=
 started to fray. And that is where we are reinforcing our efforts to ref=
resh the cessation of hostilities.=20







 Q Are you saying this is a much narrower area of safe zones?







 MR. EARNEST: I would not call it safe zones. I would not call it safe zo=
nes. I know that there are some observers who are describing it as safe z=
ones. I have not seen anybody in the U.S. government refer to them as saf=
e zones. I certainly havent referred to them as safe zones. And the reaso=
n is that it gets too complicated to try to differentiate between what we=
're talking about here. Lets be clear: The President is against safe zone=
s. Hes expressed that from the beginning because he doesn't want to put t=
he United States in the situation of trying to enforce it.







 The focus of our military should be on degrading and destroying ISIL. We=
 should, however, collectively as an international community, be conscien=
tious about living up to the commitments that were made by all the partie=
s in the context of the cessation of hostilities. In those areas where we=
've seen the cessation start to fray in recent weeks, we need to reinforc=
e our efforts to refresh the cessation of hostilities.=20







 And in particular, the Assad regime needs to live up to the commitments =
that they have made. And we would like to see the Russians use the influe=
nce that they have with the Assad regime to get them to do it.







 I guess this is the last thing Ill say about it. Russia did that once be=
fore. For several weeks we did have the effective implementation of a ces=
sation of hostilities in which the Assad regime did curb their military a=
ctivities. Just in the last couple of weeks we've seen the Assad regime g=
o back to some of the nasty tactics. And wed like to see the Russians go =
back to using their influence with the Assad regime to get them to live u=
p to the cessation of hostilities in the way that they did before.=20







 Roberta.







 Q I wanted to ask about the Greenpeace leaks of T-TIP. Today, Greenpeace=
 published about half of the deal that's being negotiated, on a website. =
And we've already seen the response from USTR on this. But Im wondering i=
f you can tell us how damaging the White House feels that these leaks are=
 for the prospects of reaching some kind of deal before the President lea=
ves office.







 MR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the veracity of any of the documents that =
have been published. But I can tell you that we're not particularly conce=
rned about these purported leaks.







 The truth is the President has been very clear about what our strategy i=
s when it comes to international trade. The President around the world ha=
s sought high-standard agreements. The reason for that is simple: That's =
consistent with our values. We believe that there should be high standard=
s when it comes to human rights and labor rights and worker rights and en=
vironmental standards. And that's a good thing.







 So we want the world to observe higher standards. But we also know that =
if the rest of the world observes those higher standards, that's going to=
 level the playing field for American businesses and workers that already=
 observe those standards. And that's going to create expanded economic op=
portunity for the American people. So that's the kind of trade strategy t=
hat the President has pursued in Asia, and its the kind of strategy that =
has guided our participation in the T-TIP talks. But as it relates to the=
 veracity of those documents, I just don't have any comment.







 Q But are you concerned about the implications of these leaks on public =
opinion about T-TIP and how that might affect the eventual negotiations t=
oward a deal by the end of the year?







 MR. EARNEST: No, Im not. And as the President described when he was in E=
urope just last week, our focus is on trying to complete these negotiatio=
ns by the end of the year. I do not anticipate that we're going to be abl=
e to get Congress to act on it and have this agreement going into effect =
before the President leaves office. But there is the potential -- and we =
certainly are aiming -- to complete these talks by the end of the year. A=
nd I don't think theres anything about this leak that is going to have a =
material impact on our ability to do that.







 Q And over the weekend there was whats being called an unprecedented bre=
ach of Baghdads Green Zone -- hundreds of people storming over the glass =
walls around the zone, demanding political reforms. And this happened rig=
ht after the Vice Presidents visit, obviously. So Im wondering what your =
assessment is of what the visit accomplished and how concerned is the Whi=
te House that this upheaval is really starting to -- or going to interfer=
e with the fight against the Islamic State and plans for the coalition to=
 support Iraqi and Kurdish forces as they begin to look at Mosul.







 MR. EARNEST: Well, its almost two weeks ago now that the President did a=
 news conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where he was asked quite directl=
y by a journalist from The Washington Post about the political situation =
inside of Iraq. And the President noted at the time that he was concerned=
 about the situation there.=20







 He noted that the dynamics of the political debate inside of *Syria Iraq=
 right now are a little bit different than they traditionally have been; =
that the political dialogue right now that has been so challenging is not=
 one that breaks down along sectarian lines, but rather some disagreement=
 within the Shia community in Iraq about the proper way to govern the cou=
ntry.=20







 So this presents some unique challenges. And given the concerns about th=
e situation inside of Iraq, Vice President Biden made his first trip to I=
raq in more than four years. So I think the significance of a vice presid=
ential visit underscores the significance of the challenges that are faci=
ng Iraq right now.=20







 Obviously the Vice Presidents message was to reiterate our support for t=
he reforms that are being pursued by the Abadi-led government. The Vice P=
resident also used his visit to underscore the U.S. and international com=
munitys commitment to economic support for Iraq. There are significant ec=
onomic reforms that the government needs to implement. Theres also some n=
eeded assistance that can be provided to Iraqi authorities that are seeki=
ng to rebuild communities that ISIL had previously controlled. And that i=
s going to be a critical part of our effort to prevent ISIL from retaking=
 those communities.







 And the President spent a lot of time talking about the need to support =
this Iraqi effort when he met with the GCC countries in Riyadh last week =
-- two weeks ago.







 And then the final thing that I think is important for people to underst=
and is Vice President Biden was also there to talk about ongoing U.S. and=
 international support for the military campaign to degrade and ultimatel=
y destroy ISIL. Those military efforts in Iraq are led by Iraqi forces th=
at are under the command and control of the Iraqi central government. And=
 we have been able to effectively work with Iraqi forces to drive ISIL ou=
t of about 40 percent of the populated territory that they previously hel=
d. That represents important progress. And we are looking for ways to kee=
p that momentum going, including beginning to support Iraqi operations ar=
ound Mosul to eventually prepare for the retaking of that city.







 So there is obviously a lot of business that Vice President Biden was en=
gaged in while he was in Iraq. And those conversations took place at a cr=
itical time for that country.=20







 Let's move around a little bit. Andrew.







 Q A follow-up question on Iraq. The events of the weekend have obviously=
 shown again how powerful Muqtada al-Sadr is. I was wondering if you coul=
d just remind us of what the U.S. position is with regard to him? Do U.S.=
 officials meet with him? Do you consider him an interlocutor?=20







 MR. EARNEST: Im not aware of any high-level government meetings between =
U.S. officials and Muqtada al-Sadr. But Id check with the State Departmen=
t about that. I don't know if hes participated in any other broader meeti=
ngs that may have included U.S. officials. So you should confirm that inf=
ormation with them.







 Q But you would acknowledge that he is an important figure in Iraqi poli=
tics, even if he doesn't play a formal role?







 MR. EARNEST: Well, Im certainly no expert in trying to divine what sort =
of influence individual figures in Iraq may have in the political situati=
on there. I think as a matter of policy, the U.S. government certainly re=
spects the sovereignty of the nation of Iraq and the responsibility that =
the Iraqi people have to determine political outcomes in their country. W=
e're entirely respectful of that process.







 And, Andrew, in reading the news coverage over the weekend and in talkin=
g to some senior officials here at the White House who work on this issue=
 all the time, I was reminded of the summer of 2014. Youll recall that wh=
en ISIL made its dramatic advance across the Iraqi desert and deeply encr=
oached into Iraqi territory, there were significant questions raised abou=
t what the U.S. role would be in trying to get ISIL out of the country. I=
n those early days the question was what the United States would do to pr=
otect Iraq from ISIL.







 And youll recall at the time the President laid down a pretty clear mark=
er that addressing the political failures of the Maliki government in Ira=
q was necessary before the United States could commit to the kind of mili=
tary support that we're providing now. The reason for that is -- the asse=
ssment of our experts here is that Malikis focus on governing along secta=
rian lines inside of Iraq significantly weakened the Iraqi government, bu=
t it also had a deleterious impact on the competence of Iraqi security fo=
rces. You essentially had some forces that were unwilling to defend some =
parts of the country based on the sectarian identification of the populat=
ion.=20







 And President Obama made clear that a military commitment on the part of=
 the United States would be contingent upon the establishment of an Iraqi=
 central government that prioritized uniting the country across sectarian=
 lines; that the ability of Kurds and Sunnis and Shia in Iraq to work tog=
ether to defeat ISIL was going to be critical to their success. And Prime=
 Minister Abadi has demonstrated a commitment to prioritizing a governmen=
t philosophy that unites the country.







 And thats why the United States has been supportive of his efforts to im=
plement reforms, but ultimately those reforms need to be responsive to th=
e concerns and priorities of the Iraqi people. Thats his top priority. He=
s the leader of a sovereign nation. And thats why the United States can b=
e supportive of his efforts, but ultimately its Prime Minister Abadi list=
ening to the Iraqi people that will make decisions about how to effective=
ly run that country.



 Q Do you think Abadi is backsliding slightly on his promises to make a n=
on-sectarian government?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think he has demonstrated during his time - speakin=
g broadly, he has demonstrated during his time in office that hes committ=
ed to a multi-sectarian Iraq, and he has governed consistent with that vi=
sion. For him, its a legitimate national security priority and I think he=
 understands the stakes. I also think hes not just doing that because its=
 his own personal preference and because its critical to the national sec=
urity of the country; I think hes doing that because he thinks its a refl=
ection of the ambitions of the Iraqi people and that the success of his c=
ountry will depend upon his success in unifying that country to counter t=
he challenges that they currently face.



 Because, look, we also have to remember its not just ISIL that poses a t=
hreat to Iraq. Iraq is going through some pretty challenging, wrenching c=
hanges to their economy. The significantly lower price of oil has proved =
to be a significant challenge to that country. There are also challenges =
related to their infrastructure, like repairing the Mosul Dam, that are t=
ime-consuming both in terms of the amount of money thats required to deal=
 with that situation but it also requires a level of expertise that is no=
t easily found.=20



So there are some significant challenges, and Prime Minister Abadi is dea=
ling with a lot right now. And the rest of the international community is=
 going to be supportive of him as he tries to make the changes consistent=
 with his responsibilities as the Prime Minister of Iraq.



 Justin.



 Q First, I just wanted to follow on the second part of Robertas question=
, which is the impact of the instability. Over the weekend, on plans to r=
etake Mosul, obviously those efforts are going to take buy-in from all th=
e different parts of competing interests within Iraq. And there had been =
a sense, I think after the trip, that the political situation had calmed,=
 planning to kind of finalize how they were going to go into Mosul could =
continue and be completed to prevent inaction. So Im wondering, now that =
there seems to be backsliding there, if the President's sort of perceived=
 deadline at the end of the year is in danger or could be pushed back far=
ther.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, based on the briefings that Ive received this morning=
, our national security professionals have not detected any impact on our=
 ongoing counter-ISIL activities in Iraq, based on the political instabil=
ity in Baghdad over the weekend. The United States and our coalition part=
ners conducted 59 airstrikes and six artillery strikes against ISIL targe=
ts in northern Iraq and Anbar Province. That was just over the weekend. A=
nd the ongoing effort to offer training, advice, and assistance to Iraqi =
forces has continued unabated.=20



So what we have said all along is that specific military decisions like w=
hen to begin the operation against Mosul will be made by Iraqi forces and=
 the Iraqi central government. Again, we continue to respect the sovereig=
nty of this independent nation, and we continue to partner with them and =
work effectively with them, both to carry out ongoing operations to degra=
de and ultimately destroy ISIL, but also to plan for future military oper=
ations.



Q I wanted to ask about the Presidents trip to Flint later this week. Gov=
ernor Snyder has been under a lot of pressure, and eventually he kind of =
did a photo-op to drink the tap water in Flint as a sign of solidarity. S=
o Im wondering if the President is going to drink the filtered Flint wate=
r while he is there and if he also plans to meet with Governor Snyder.



MR. EARNEST: Im not aware of any photo-ops that involve the Presidents co=
nsumption of water. Based on what the EPA has communicated to the public,=
 is that properly filtered water in Flint is safe to drink. So I certainl=
y would encourage people to continue to listen to the advice that they ge=
t from our scientific and public health experts about what water is safe =
to drink, and the President will certainly follow that advice.



Q And then the last thing is, news came of Malias college plans over the =
weekend, and Im wondering if you might be able to shed any insight on wha=
t shes doing with her gap year.



MR. EARNEST: I cannot.



April.



Q Josh, I want to follow up kind of on Justin. And I have another questio=
n. Its kind of an urban week for the President. Hes traveling to Flint an=
d then hes also doing the Howard University commencement. Are there any t=
hreads that are going to travel through to both of his speeches, in Flint=
 and in Howard? And will he be making any news when it comes to the urban=
 front?



MR. EARNEST: Well, stay tuned. Im not in a position to begin previewing t=
he Presidents commencement address at Howard at this point, but the Presi=
dent and his team have been working on his speech for a couple of weeks n=
ow. But check in later this week, and maybe Ill be able to give you a bet=
ter sense of what the Presidents plans are for that speech.



Q All right. And I also want to ask you -- this weekend at his last White=
 House Correspondents Association Dinner, he gave jokes, got some ribbing=
. What did he think about the final words that were delivered to him and =
of him, the President of the United States -- a word that is one of the w=
orst words many people say you could say to anyone, that's gone down in h=
istory? What did he think about that? What's his reaction?







MR. EARNEST: Well, April, I think the first thing that I would observe is=
 that any comedian who signed up to follow President Obama at the White H=
ouse Correspondents' Dinner is assuming one of the most difficult tasks i=
n comedy. Just by nature of the engagement, that's a tough job, following=
 the President of the United States.=20







President Obama also, over the years, has shown himself to be rather adep=
t at delivering a speech that consists primarily of one- or two-liners, a=
nd the President enjoys that opportunity.







So the point is that Mr. Wilmore had a difficult job that he was facing o=
n Saturday, and the President's expectation is he took -- as Mr. Wilmore =
took on that responsibility, is that comedians are going to go right up t=
o the line.







Q Did he cross the line? Many African Americans in that room, to include =
civil rights leaders, black comedians, were very appalled. Even members o=
f the Republican Party -- black Republicans were upset, black Democrats w=
ere upset. People felt that not just throwing it at him, but throwing it =
at them, and also it diminished the office of the presidency and it dimin=
ished him. Did he cross the line?







MR. EARNEST: April, what I would say is that it's not the first time that=
 people, on the Monday after the White House Correspondent's Dinner, that=
 some people have observed that the comedian on Saturday night crossed th=
e line. That happened in 2006, after Stephen Colbert delivered his speech=
. There were many people who felt like he had overstepped his bounds in d=
elivering his remarks. To a lesser extent, many people made the same obse=
rvation about the presentation of Wanda Sykes in 2009. So it's not the fi=
rst time that we've had a conversation like this in which these kinds of =
concerns have been raised or expressed.=20







Look, I had an opportunity to speak to the President about this briefly t=
his morning, and he said that he appreciated the spirit of the sentiments=
 that Mr. Wilmore expressed. He ended his speech by saying that he couldn=
t put into words the pride that he felt in the President. And he made the=
 observation that our country has make remarkable progress just in his li=
fetime -- from not being willing to accept an African American quarterbac=
k, to electing and reelecting an African American not just to lead the Un=
ited States, but to lead the free world. Again, I take Mr. Wilmore at his=
 words that he found that to be a powerful transformation just in his lif=
etime, and something that he seemed to be pretty obviously proud of.







Q Did Mr. Wilmore's use of freedom of speech give the President's detract=
ors fodder now to be able to be able to call him that and call others tha=
t?







MR. EARNEST: Well, I have no idea what impact Larry Wilmore's speech is g=
oing to have on the President's critics, and I dont think I'm going to sp=
end much time worrying about it.







Q I understand that there is a conversation about that word. The Presiden=
t, in June of last year, used it as a teaching moment to show that issues=
 of race are still a problem in this country. But Wilmore used it for the=
 President somewhat as a butt of the joke. And you were in that room, as =
well as I was. There was an eerie, awkward silence and quietness. And peo=
ple didnt know how to handle that.







MR. EARNEST: Well, April, I know this is a word that does -- let me say i=
t this way: I'm confident that Mr. Wilmore used the word by design. He wa=
s seeking to be provocative. But I think any reading of his comments make=
s clear he was not using the President as the butt of a joke. So what is =
true is that this is a tough assignment that any comedian takes on when t=
hey sign up for this job. And the President's expectation when he walks i=
n that room is that that comedian and other people are going to get much =
closer to the line than they ordinarily would as they try to make a joke.=








Q I just want to be very clear: So the President is okay with his use and=
 how he used the N-word, "jiggaboo," "Negro Night," and thug"?=20







MR. EARNEST: Well, April, I'll just restate what I said before, which is =
that the President expressed -- well, what the President said is that he =
appreciated the spirit of Mr. Wilmore's expressions on Saturday night.







Jordan.







Q Thanks, Josh. I want to follow up on one of Justin's questions about th=
e Flint trip. Governor Snyder told reporters this morning he's looking to=
 meet with the President. So is that meeting going to happen on Wednesday=
?







MR. EARNEST: I guess his schedule got a little freed up, huh?







Q I guess so.







MR. EARNEST: I guess so. We're still putting together the President's vis=
it. It's traditional for the President, when he travels to a state, to in=
vite the governor to at least greet him on the tarmac. That invitation wa=
s extended to Governor Snyder in the context of this visit. And we're obv=
iously pleased that it looks like he'll now be in Flint on that day. So w=
e'll keep you posted on what sort of interactions they may have.







Q And on the Supreme Court fight, the President is doing a series of loca=
l interviews this afternoon.







MR. EARNEST: He is.







Q And I know some of the groups that are allied with the White House are =
doing some protests and other things like that in some of the states wher=
e Republican senators reside, over the recess. But what I'm wondering fro=
m you is, what are you looking for out of these actions over this week? I=
 know your ultimate goal is hearings and a vote. But what needs to happen=
 over this week for you to define your efforts as a success?







MR. EARNEST: Jordan, we're going to continue to apply pressure to Republi=
cans to do their job. It's a pretty simple message that we're delivering.=
 Since 1875, every Supreme Court nominee, who hasnt later been retracted =
by the President of the United States, has received a hearing and/or a vo=
te by the United States Senate. That's why what Republicans are vowing to=
 do is unprecedented and a dramatic escalation of partisan politics. That=
's problematic because, even in this era of divided government and polari=
zed politics, there's been an effort by both sides to try to insulate the=
 U.S. justice system and the institution of the United States Supreme Cou=
rt from that political stray voltage. But Republicans have, in this case,=
 ramped it up. Look, even Senator Graham, who served four years on the Se=
nate Judiciary Committee, has acknowledged that what Republicans are vowi=
ng to do and are doing is unprecedented.=20







Several Republicans -- or at least a couple of them come to mind -- have =
indicated that they're treating President Obama's nominee differently tha=
n they would treat a nominee that's put forward by a Republican President=
. They're acknowledging that this is not driven by some peculiar reading =
of the Constitution, but it's driven by a raw, partisan political calcula=
tion that Republicans in the Senate have made to obstruct this nominee no=
t because of any concerns about the nominee's judicial philosophy; they'r=
e obstructing this nominee simply because Chief Judge Garland was put for=
ward by Barack Obama. That's unfortunate particularly when you consider t=
hat Chief Judge Garland is somebody who has more experience on the federa=
l judiciary than any Supreme Court nominee in American history. He served=
 on the second-highest court in the land for 19 years. In taking a close =
look at that record, it's evident that he understands that the job of a f=
ederal judge is to interpret the law, not advance a political agenda.=20







So that's the argument that we'll make. I recognize -- I would acknowledg=
e that this is an argument that we've spent a lot of the last two months =
making. But this is an opportunity for the President to sit before local =
television anchors and make the argument once again, and present it, hope=
fully, in a compelling way that will have an impact on the constituents o=
f five or six Republican senators.







Q Right. But we havent seen any real movement on the question of hearings=
 or -- hearings or a vote from these five senators, despite you making th=
ese arguments over and over again. So if we dont hear movement over this =
next week when you're applying that pressure, is that going to be concern=
ing to you?







MR. EARNEST: Well, we started out with Republicans across the board -- at=
 least the Senate Republican Leader saying that Republicans wouldnt meet =
with the President's nominee. But as you know, Chief Judge Garland has no=
w met with 14 different Republican senators, and there are more plans for=
 when Congress returns from their weeklong recess next week.







So we have made some progress in that regard, and we're going to continue=
 to just apply pressure to Republicans until I make the case that they sh=
ould do their job. Look, I've said this before too: The American people e=
xpect that if you're going to show up every two weeks and collect a paych=
eck, that you should do your job. And right now, Senate Republicans arent=
 doing it despite the fact they are picking up a six-figure paycheck.







Mike.







Q Two topics. First, back to the safe zones question. So I just want to c=
larify -- what you guys call them are "safe areas," not "safe zones," cor=
rect?







MR. EARNEST: Well, I dont think there's a term of art, Mike. What we're t=
rying to do --







Q Well, the President called it safe areas when he was asked about this d=
uring the press conference with President [sic] Merkel in Germany, and he=
 said there's no space between him and Chancellor Merkel on the question =
of whether or not there are areas to carve out in Syria that he would sup=
port the idea of carving out what he called "safe areas" through the poli=
tical process. So I just want to make sure that what you're suggesting se=
ems to be different than what the President said during that news confere=
nce. He says he supports the idea of carving out some safe areas in Syria=
 through the political process. You're saying he doesnt support any such =
thing?







MR. EARNEST: Mike, what we're trying to do is we're trying to put back in=
 place a cessation of hostilities across the country. The cessation of ho=
stilities applies everywhere in Syria.



 Q So the President said, "If we can get the political transition to sepa=
rate out areas where a moderate oppositions that's at the table controls =
it, that should be a safe area. If it's ISIL or Nusra, that's not a safe =
area. And that's the concept we've been trying to build."







So that suggests that there are -- I mean, short of a complete cessation =
of hostilities -- which I suppose you would support, first and foremost -=
- but short of that, it does seem like the President supports the idea of=
 creating some space inside Syria that is safe, whether you call it a zon=
e or an area.







MR. EARNEST: Well, what our goal, Mike, is to reinforce the effective imp=
lementation of a cessation of hostilities nationwide in Syria. And there =
are particular areas where there have been repeated and increasing violat=
ions of the cessation of hostilities. And our goal is to reinforce our ef=
fort to refresh the cessation of hostilities in those areas where we've s=
een violations. But that is not a reference to any sort of new tactic to =
try to address the political situation in Syria. Our goal all along has b=
een to implement a cessation of hostilities all across the country to try=
 to add some momentum to the ongoing political talks.







 The other thing that I have said before, but not from the context of the=
se conversations thats a relevant fact, is neither Nusra or other extremi=
st groups like ISIL have signed on to the cessation of hostilities. So we=
 would like to see a cessation of hostilities all across the country, but=
 that is not going to have an impact on the ability of the United States =
or our coalition partners to go after ISIL.



 Q And then on a second topic, back to Flint. The President and the White=
 House has been highly critical I think of the state environmental appara=
tus in Michigan for their failures, as have a lot of people. As the Presi=
dent goes back, what is the President prepared to say or apologize for in=
 terms of the federal government and the EPAs failures to act more quickl=
y in the face of the water problems in Flint? I mean, there have been som=
e lower-level resignations from EPA -- and I know that some of the federa=
l officials have been there since and are I guess going back ahead of the=
 Presidents visit -- but is the President prepared to say to the people o=
f Flint that we screwed up too, at the federal level?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President is prepared to acknowledge that=
, as President of the United States, he takes responsibility for lots of =
things. But whats also true is that the blue-ribbon independent commissio=
n that was appointed by the Republican governor of the state of Michigan =
found, primary responsibility for the water contamination in Flint lies w=
ith the MDEQ," which is the state-run environmental agency in Michigan.



 Whats also true is that the Attorney General has filed criminal charges =
against some state employees for their role in this as well. So I dont, h=
owever, expect for the President to spend a lot of time talking about spe=
cific accountability, primarily because there continues to be ongoing inv=
estigations into that accountability, and the President doesnt want to be=
 perceived as weighing in on one side or the other.



 But the President will certainly go to Michigan and make a forceful case=
 that as the President of the United States, he feels responsible for the=
 safety and wellbeing of every American, no matter which community they l=
ive in. And I think that would certainly explain the widespread federal e=
ffort in Flint to help the people of Flint deal with this emergency situa=
tion. 7.3 million liters of water have been distributed by federal employ=
ees. Weve seen 55,000 water and pitcher filters be distributed in communi=
ties there. About a quarter of a million replacement cartridges have been=
 passed out as well. Theres been a significant expansion of health care a=
ccess, paid for by the federal government. This access comes both in the =
forms of expanding Medicaid eligibility, but also in terms of offering gr=
ants to local health care providers so that they have more resources to t=
reat more people.=20



 So this is all a reflection of the federal governments commitment to hel=
ping the people of Flint deal with whats a tragic situation.



 Q But one last thing. I mean, thats sort of post-crisis, right? Thats th=
e response to the crisis once it had been fully realized.=20



MR. EARNEST: That's right.



Q I guess the question is, is the President prepared to - hes going to be=
 meeting with a group of people, I guess, around the table. If they look =
at him and say, yes, obviously there were failures at the state level but=
 where was the federal government a year ago, a year and a half ago, two =
years ago when this was all happening -- what does he say to them?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think he says that the EPA takes very seriously the=
 responsibility that they have to work effectively with state regulators =
to ensure the clean air and clean water of everybody in America. And that=
s why more than six weeks ago, the administrator of the EPA sent a letter=
 to governors all across the country, making clear exactly what responsib=
ilities state regulators have when it comes to enforcing the lead and cop=
per rule. She was also clear in that letter that there will be a response=
 from the EPA if the state regulators fall down on the job.=20



 So that level of clarity hopefully will prevent the situation in Flint f=
rom reemerging in other communities. And that obviously is a top priority=
 of the Presidents as well.



 Josh.



 Q Thanks, Josh. Back to the Supreme Court. I just want to ask you the qu=
estion: Have you given any consideration to the thought process of Senate=
 Republicans that you mentioned are taking some heat from their constitue=
nts on Merrick Garland and their decision to completely dismiss the nomin=
ating process rather than go ahead and at least go through the motions of=
 the process, even if the outcome is predetermined?



 MR. EARNEST: Look, I think its pretty clear whats happening here. The re=
ason that the leader of Republicans in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, issue=
d a statement just hours after the announcement of Justice Scalias death =
is that he wanted to try to shut down the process as soon as possible. He=
 recognized that if the President put forward a highly qualified, experie=
nced, respectable individual with impeccable legal credentials to fill th=
at vacancy, that there would be enormous pressure on Republicans to vote =
and confirm this individual.=20



 And thats exactly what Republicans are trying not to do. The President e=
ffectively called their bluff by nominating someone that even Republicans=
 have described as a consensus nominee. Even Republicans who have met wit=
h Chief Judge Garland have had very positive things to say about his char=
acter and about his aptitude for the job. So people like Pat Toomey said =
that he was "very, very smart and very knowledgeable." Republican Senator=
 Rob Portman from Ohio described Chief Judge Garland as an impressive guy=
. Senator Flake from Arizona described Chief Judge Garland as obviously a=
 man of accomplishment and keen intellect. Senator Lindsey Graham from So=
uth Carolina described him as honest and capable and described his reputa=
tion as beyond reproach.



 So what Republicans are trying to do is theyre trying to prevent a situa=
tion in which Chief Judge Garland sits before the Senate Judiciary Commit=
tee and answers any questions that come his way. We know that if theres a=
 hearing like this, its going to be - its going to get lots of attention.=
 It will be carried live on many of the networks that are represented in =
this room, at least for parts of the hearing. And the expectation the Pre=
sident has is that Chief Judge Garland is going to use his brilliant lega=
l mind and 19 years of judicial experience to effectively answer those qu=
estions.



 And once that hearing is completed, youll really see pressure on Republi=
cans to explain their position, trying to block his confirmation to the S=
upreme Court. So what we have seen from Republicans, particularly Republi=
can leaders in Washington, is to shut down this effort before it can buil=
d momentum. But I think in spite of their efforts, we have built up some =
momentum and some pressure on Republicans.



 And I do think this is why every Republican senator across the country, =
including Senator Ayotte, is facing a central question: Are they going to=
 listen to Republican leaders in the United States Senate and not do thei=
r job? Or are they going to do what the United States Constitution requir=
es? And that is to offer their advice and consent for the Presidents choi=
ce to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.=20



 Following the instructions of Republican leaders in Washington I dont th=
ink is going to be a particularly persuasive explanation for their conduc=
t when Republican senators are facing their constituents.



 Mark.



 Q Im sorry, on Syria, I still dont understand. If safe zones or safe are=
as is not the purpose in Geneva, then why are negotiators there looking a=
t maps and drawing up lines of areas where allegedly civilians and/or mem=
bers of the moderate opposition could shelter? Theyre looking at maps. Th=
ats what our people are telling us.



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, Mark, the goal of the conversations in Geneva are to b=
uild confidence in a political transition. And what the negotiators in Ge=
neva on the opposition side of the table have indicated is its very diffi=
cult for them to engage in political talks when their constituents back h=
ome are being bombed recklessly and tragically by the regime.



 And so the idea behind the cessation of hostilities was to try to bring =
the violence between the opposition and the government to an end so that =
negotiations could take place. So what the negotiators are doing is tryin=
g to find a way to get the regime to stop bombing their people so that th=
ey can try to come to some sort of political agreement. What we found is =
that at least for a while, when the cessation of hostilities was initiall=
y implemented, that that actually worked out a little bit better than any=
body expected.



 And part of that was because the Russian government, President Putin, wa=
s willing to put his own credibility on the line and was willing to make =
a strong case to the Assad regime that they needed to abide by the cessat=
ion of hostilities. And we want them to just go back and do the same thin=
g.



 Q No, I get that. But what I dont understand is, if theyre sitting down =
and drawing lines on a map and saying this area is going to be off limits=
, is that not a safe zone or a safe area, or propose some other way to ca=
ll it?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the reason that I dont think I would describe=
 it that way is that ISIL and Nusra are not part of the cessation of host=
ilities. Its the Assad regime that has signed onto the cessation of hosti=
lities. So I think when there was a broader discussion about safe zones a=
nd the President was asked directly in a news conference about whether or=
 not he would support the concept of a safe zone, and the President expre=
ssed his strong opposition to it, is that he didnt want to create a situa=
tion in which the United States was on the hook for protecting that safe =
zone from incursions by extremists, by Nusra, by ISIL, or by the regime. =
So the conversations that are taking place in Geneva right now are focuse=
d very specifically on where we can reinforce our efforts to implement su=
ccessfully a cessation of hostilities, to try to lower the violence, to a=
dvance political talks, but also allow the shipment of humanitarian relie=
f into areas that have long been caught in the crossfire.



 Megan.



 Q Josh, thanks. Theres two topics I wanted to ask about. First, the 28 p=
ages of classified documents in the 9/11 Commission report. CIA Director =
John Brennan over the weekend saying that there could be some inaccuracie=
s in there and some unvetted information. Is the President concerned abou=
t that? And how close is the White House to releasing those documents?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I saw that there was a little attention that was gene=
rated by Director Brennans comments. I have to admit I was surprised by t=
hat attention because there was an op-ed that was written just last week =
by Lee Hamilton and Governor Kean from New Jersey. Mr. Hamilton and Mr. K=
ean were the chair of the independent commission that took a look at the =
9/11 attacks, both the events that led to the attacks but also proposed r=
eforms that would prevent those kinds of attacks from occurring on Americ=
an soil ever again.=20



They wrote that op-ed and indicated that they also saw the 28 pages. They=
 described those 28 pages as unvetted, law enforcement investigative mate=
rials. And they said they had an opportunity to review that material, to =
follow up on leads, and that they actually conducted interviews not just =
in the United States but around the world to follow up on that informatio=
n. And as weve discussed many times in this room over the last several we=
eks, the conclusion of their report is that they found no evidence that t=
he Saudi government as an institution had supported al Qaeda.



 So Director Brennans comments are entirely in line with those that were =
put forward by Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, who had a responsi=
bility to look at that material, to follow up on the claims, and to offer=
 up an unclassified conclusion about what was included there.



 Q So how close is the White House to releasing the documents? And is the=
re concern that releasing them is going to be a mistake?



 MR. EARNEST: The White House is not responsible for releasing the docume=
nts. Those documents are currently in the possession of the Office of the=
 Director of National Intelligence. That is the office that is responsibl=
e for processing sensitive information that is being considered for publi=
c release. They have a declassification process that they conduct that is=
 part of their standard operating procedure. I would acknowledge that the=
y have been conducting that process on this material for quite some time.=
 And the Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, has indicated th=
at they are hopeful they can complete that process by the end of June.



 Q And second, on Donald Trump and some comments that he made over the we=
ekend. He seemed to indicate that campaigning is more difficult than gove=
rning, saying, "It's harder to become President, in my opinion, than to d=
o a great job at being President." Would the President agree with that as=
sessment? Or do you have a comment?



 MR. EARNEST: I dont have any comment on that.



 Julianna, nice to see you. I'm used to you sitting one chair behind you.=
=20



 Q I know, me too.



 MR. EARNEST: So welcome back to the briefing.



 Q It's good to be in the front row. Thank you. Just going back to Saturd=
ay night, can you talk a little bit about how the cameo with former Speak=
er John Boehner came about in the President's speech?



 MR. EARNEST: Sure. Well, it's pretty simple and in some ways depicted in=
 the video, which is that the White House called Speaker Boehner and aske=
d him if he'd be interested in participating in the video. And I think as=
 was evident from the finished product, he was an enthusiastic participan=
t in the production.



 Look, Speaker Boehner has a well-known and very good sense of humor. And=
 he made I think a very positive contribution to our comedic efforts in t=
he film.



 Q When was it filmed? And did they meet in addition to the taping to tal=
k about current events, politics, Congress?



 MR. EARNEST: They had an opportunity to spend time together in the conte=
xt of filming the video. There was no separate meeting. But the video was=
 actually just filmed on Friday, so just a few days ago.



 Q And did they talk about the Speaker's comments about Ted Cruz from the=
 night before?



 MR. EARNEST: There was not a detailed discussion of those comments, no.



 Q And then, also, over the weekend, Bernie Sanders said that there was g=
oing to be a contested convention, and essentially called on Democratic s=
uper-delegates to flip to support him. Is that something the President th=
inks is appropriate?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, what the President thinks is appropriate is individua=
l candidates should make their own decisions about running their campaign=
. And we've obviously seen a very rigorous campaign on the Democratic sid=
e, and there's still some contests to go and more opportunities for Democ=
ratic voters across the country to weigh in on who they believe should re=
present our party in the general election. And the President thus far has=
 refrained from weighing on that debate too much.



 Ron.



 Q On Flint and the governor, you mentioned that the White House has exte=
nded an invitation for him to meet the President at the airport. Its soun=
ds like the governor wants a lot more in terms of a substantive meeting w=
ith the President, and has requested that. Has there been a response to t=
hat request?



 MR. EARNEST: We havent determined the President's schedule for his trip =
to Flint. As a matter of standard operating procedure, we invited the gov=
ernor to come to the airport. So the invitation to Governor Snyder's offi=
ce was not unique; it's one that's even been extended to him a few times =
before.



 Q I guess the question is, does the President see the governor as someon=
e that he thinks is important to meet and spend some time with there as a=
 solution found to the problem?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President certainly intends to spend quite a bit =
of time when he's in Flint talking to local residents, talking to local o=
fficials. I dont know at this point exactly the extent of the conversatio=
ns that the President will have with Governor Snyder, but we'll let you k=
now.



 Q And given what you were saying about how the state has been sort of bl=
amed for all this, I was wondering how could he see the Governor as havin=
g the capacity and the credibility to be a viable partner in this whole p=
rocess going forward.







 MR. EARNEST: Well, Governor Snyder, to his credit, has recognized that t=
here is an important role for the state to play in helping the citizens o=
f Flint recover.







 And obviously the U.S. government, the federal government, at the direct=
ion of President Obama, has been deeply involved in that recovery effort.=
 But state officials have been, too. Ill leave it to the state officials =
to detail what contributions they have made to that.







 But look, this is a situation that should transcend politics. This shoul=
d be an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to come together and tr=
y to right many of the wrongs that have been sustained by the citizens of=
 Flint.







 Q And does the President have any specific priorities in terms of what h=
e wants to see happen as a result of this visit? I know that theres the i=
dea of generally reassuring residents, and you delineated the list of the=
 water. So is there some aspect of this crisis that the President thinks =
should be changed, focused on, alleviated as a result of this?







 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- I would not anticipate that the President =
will make big news by announcing a new package of relief for the city of =
Flint. Obviously, theres been a significant commitment of resources to tr=
y to help the people of Flint in this urgent situation. You've heard me h=
ere advocate on a couple of occasions that Congress should get involved h=
ere. Congress should mobilize some resources that could be used to addres=
s the situation in Flint.







 I think whats also true is the President will make a broader argument ab=
out just how important it is for government at all levels to function eff=
ectively. That stands in pretty stark contrast to some Republican candida=
tes who suggest that environmental agencies shouldnt even exist.







 Q On the Iraq situation, just quickly. The Green Zone barriers were brea=
ched. And the reporting suggested that a lot of the security forces there=
 basically let the protesters in. So is the United States confident that =
wont happen again? And are you concerned about the level of security in t=
hat area? And I know the reporting was that the embassy was never threate=
ned, and there were false rumors about evacuations, but that aspect of th=
e situation, you had this fortress for 12 or 13 years, and now it does no=
t seem to be a fortress anymore. How concerned about you about that?







 MR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, the President of the United States is concerned =
every day about the safety and security of Americans serving our country =
overseas. And that includes our diplomats. That is always a top priority =
and at the top of the list when it comes to making decisions about U.S. p=
olicy in countries around the world.







 For example, in the immediate aftermath of the ISIL advance across Iraq =
in 2014, the Presidents primary concern was about the safety of American =
diplomats and American personnel in Erbil and in Baghdad. And the initial=
 military response that President Obama mobilized was to safeguard those =
American citizens. So this is always a top priority.=20







 I can tell you that the U.S. has received assurances from Iraqi official=
s that they understand their obligations to protect diplomatic facilities=
. And we certainly take them at their word. But look, we're going to cont=
inue to closely monitor the situation because the safety and security of =
our personnel is always the Presidents top priority.







 Q Is it true that the security guards essentially let the protesters in,=
 didn't stop them? That's got to be worrying.







 MR. EARNEST: Its a pretty chaotic situation there. Im not sure that anyb=
ody knows exactly what happened on the ground. But look, we're always int=
erested in understanding how developments on the ground could have an imp=
act on the safety and security of American citizens who are serving over =
in Iraq. That is the Presidents top priority. We're going to continue to =
monitor the situation closely as a result. And we have received assurance=
s from the Iraqi government and from Iraqi security forces that they're p=
repared to live up to their international obligations to protect diplomat=
s that are serving in Baghdad.=20







 Q Has there been some contemplation of increasing the security posture a=
t the U.S. embassy or inside the Green Zone as a result of this?







 MR. EARNEST: Decisions that are made specifically about enhancing the se=
curity around any particular diplomatic facility would be made over at th=
e State Department. But obviously we're continuing to closely watch the s=
ituation. And if the security experts determine that additional security =
is needed, well make sure they have the resources necessary to make those=
 changes.







 Kevin.







 Q Thanks, Josh. I want to take you back to the 28 pages. And based on yo=
ur earlier comments, you're generally aware of what Director Brennan said=
, using words like, inaccurate, uncorroborated, and unvetted -- echoing t=
he column that we saw in USA Today. Does the President concur with that a=
ssessment, that analysis of whats in those 28 pages?







 MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the President has not read the 28 pages. Hes b=
een briefed on their contents. And look, I think you can reliably assume =
that based on the comments both of Director Brennan and Governor Kean and=
 Congressman Hamilton, who don't serve in the Obama administration, that =
what both of them have described is an accurate understanding of the cont=
ents of those 28 pages.







 Q Okay. And then based on that, does the President feel like the DNI nee=
ds to move forward with its review? It's been more than 14 years -- and y=
ou have I have talked about this -- it just doesnt seem like there's any =
reason not to release it, based on the fact that you said a number of peo=
ple have looked at this and there doesnt seem to be anything that would a=
ffect national security. Maybe a little embarrassing perhaps on some circ=
umstances. But again, it's preliminary information. It's not hard-and-fas=
t stuff. They're saying that this is partial information. And why not jus=
t release it so the American people --



 MR. EARNEST: I'm going to defer to the experts who have a day-to-day res=
ponsibility for determining what sensitive national security information =
can be released to the public without having a negative impact on our int=
erests or our ability to protect the American people. And that is what sh=
ould drive the decision. And the good news is that our intelligence offic=
ials have indicated that they expect to complete that process by the end =
of June. And we'll look forward to their decision at that point.



 Q And just one last nugget on that one. Is there any reason why the Pres=
ident would not have read those pages? You've said previously he was gene=
rally aware, and then you said he's been briefed on them. Why not read th=
em?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President obviously reads a lot of material on a =
day-to-day basis. Again, I'm not sure that he felt it was necessary for h=
im to read those 28 pages.



 Q He's not opposed to reading it --



 MR. EARNEST: Correct.



 Q -- just hasnt gotten around to it.



 MR. EARNEST: That's correct.



 Q Okay. Last, I want to ask you about the cruise from Miami to Cuba. An =
historic day not just in South Florida but obviously over on the island. =
Any thoughts or comments on that?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I havent seen the latest reports on this. Obviously t=
he goal of the President's policy changes towards Cuba was motivated by a=
 desire to begin to normalize relations between the United States and Cub=
a, because the President's assumption is that for 50 years we tried to is=
olate the Cuban government in the hopes that that would apply pressure to=
 them to do a better job of respecting the basic human rights of the Cuba=
n people. That didnt work for five decade. That policy of isolation was c=
arried out with little tangible impact.=20



 So the President decided that we needed to try a different strategy, and=
 that that this strategy would be focused on engagement -- engagement bet=
ween the Cuban people and American citizens; engagement between the Cuban=
 government and the U.S. government; engagement between Cuban businesses =
and American businesses -- and that by establishing those deeper ties, we=
 would be able to better advance our interests and our values.



 And look, this is a policy change that's only been in place for a little=
 over a year at this point. But look, I think we're optimistic about the =
progress that we have made thus far. There certainly is a lot more work t=
o be done, and there's certainly a number of additional reforms we'd like=
 to see the Cuban government undertake. But I think it would be hard to d=
eny that this policy change hasnt benefitted the American people. And loo=
k, I think the best proof point for that is to go and ask my counterparts=
 at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau, and other =
traditionally Republican-supporting institutions that have been strongly =
supportive of this President's change of policy towards Cuba.



 Olivier.



 Q Thanks, Josh. Will we be getting the drone civilian casualty report be=
fore the anniversary of the NDU speech?



 MR. EARNEST: Olivier, I dont have an update for you on the timing of tha=
t report. Obviously, the President's top counterterrorism advisor, Lisa M=
onaco, delivered a speech six weeks or so ago now, indicating that we wer=
e prepared to begin releasing additional material about the results of co=
unterterrorism operations. I dont have an update for you in terms of timi=
ng, though.



 Q And does the President believe that Japan deserves a formal U.S. gover=
nment apology for the bombing of Hiroshima?



 MR. EARNEST: No, he does not.



 Q And last one. Just to button up April's line of questioning -- because=
 we're being asked -- how much visibility did the White House have into w=
hat Mr. Wilmore was going to say on Saturday night?



 MR. EARNEST: None.



 Michelle.



 Q So wait, just to further clarify that clarification -- (laughter) --



 MR. EARNEST: Could I possibly be clearer than none? I'll try. (Laughter.=
)=20



 Q Sorry, Josh.



 MR. EARNEST: That's okay. Occupational hazard.



 Q So Wilmore's team didnt run by the possibility that he would throw in =
the N-word at the end of his spiel?



 MR. EARNEST: No. The White House staff did not vet the President's remar=
ks with Mr. Wilmore. And Mr. Wilmore did not vet his remarks with the Whi=
te House staff.



 Q Okay. And based on what you were saying before, are you saying that th=
e President was not bothered at all by the use of that word?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm saying that the President appreciated the sentiment tha=
t Mr. Wilmore expressed in his speech. And I think any fair reading of th=
e last three paragraphs of that speech I think make clear that the person=
al views that Mr. Wilmore was expressing came from a genuine place. And h=
e expressed his -- he said at the end --



 Q Was that a copy they gave you before to vet? (Laughter.)=20



 MR. EARNEST: No. At the risk of free publicity, this is the blogpost fro=
m Jonathan Capehart at The Washington Post. But in here he included the e=
nd of Mr. Wilmore's remarks, and he said -- this is Mr. Wilmore here -- h=
e said, "A black man was thought by his mere color not good enough to lea=
d a football team. And now to live in your time, Mr. President, when a bl=
ack man can lead the free world, words alone do me no justice." That is a=
n authentic expression of his personal viewpoint, and it's an authentic e=
xpression of his appreciation for the President of the United States, but=
 also for the capacity of this country to change. And the President has o=
bserved that progress on a number of occasions, and Mr. Wilmore was doing=
 the same.



 Q And I didnt really expect to be on this subject so soon, but while we'=
re on it -- some of the jokes that the President made about Hillary Clint=
on kind of got a mixed reaction. Some people think that they were harsher=
 than expected. Did he have a conversation with Clinton, either before or=
 after the dinner, on the subject?



 MR. EARNEST: He did not. But it appears that that conversation was not n=
ecessary, because I did see the Tweet from Secretary Clinton indicating h=
er approval for those comments.



 Q Right. But he didnt reach out to her, either before or after, to --



 MR. EARNEST: No, he did not.



 Q Actually, one of President Obama's more cutting jokes was at CNN. So w=
as he saying that --



 MR. EARNEST: Don't tell me you guys got all sensitive. (Laughter.) It's =
all in good fun.



 Q Okay, so he doesnt think that CNN has a problem journalistically?



 MR. EARNEST: He doesnt.



 Q Does he think that Hillary Clinton is the presumptive next President o=
f the United States?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President obviously had an apt joke about turning=
 over the podium at the White House Correspondents' Dinner to the next Pr=
esident, no matter who she is. Again, look the President was making a jok=
e and acknowledging that there are a number of votes that remain to be ca=
st before the American people have decided who will assume the awesome re=
sponsibility of addressing the White House Correspondents' Dinner next ye=
ar.



 Q Okay. And on the subject -- back to the 28 pages.



 MR. EARNEST: Mr. Nakamura did not like my joke. (Laughter.) So there's a=
 reason that I will not be assuming the podium at the White House Corresp=
ondents' Dinner.



 Q I mean, we've been through this, and the President had an opportunity =
to just recently sit down with the Saudis on this. But given the reaction=
 that could come after the release of those pages, is there any expectati=
on that this will affect the relationship with the Saudis?







 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think its difficult to anticipate exactly what the =
reaction will be if that decision is made. So I sort of hesitate to hazar=
d a guess that's rooted in a hypothetical here. But the one thing I think=
 I would point out is simply that the President did have an opportunity t=
o meet with King Salman for about two hours in Riyadh shortly after we ar=
rived in Saudi Arabia a week ago last Wednesday.=20







 They met for two hours, and this question about the 28 pages did not com=
e up in their meeting. I assure you they covered a wide variety of topics=
, but this was not one of them. So I think that would be at least one ind=
ication that this is not an issue that rates at the same level of some of=
 the other challenges that are plaguing the Middle East right now.







 Q Okay, its been months now since the President put forward Garland as t=
he nominee. And given that public pressure is something that you're going=
 for -- either to change minds now, or change voters minds later -- but g=
iven that at this point, with the public pressure that you've tried to ap=
ply, that outside groups have tried to apply, do you feel like the public=
 outrage isnt necessarily there when you see that very few Republican sen=
ators minds have changed at this point? And does that tell you that possi=
bly the public outrage wont be there to change anything at the polls, as =
well?







 MR. EARNEST: Look, we're not seeking to provoke public outrage. We want =
to have a discussion about whether or not Republicans in the Senate are p=
repared to do their job.







 There are plenty of candidates out there that may be trying to stoke tha=
t outrage to achieve a political aim of one form or another. I think the =
President would observe that's precisely the problem. Lets focus a little=
 less on provoking public outrage and a little more on doing your job. An=
d that's what Republicans, and particularly Republicans in the Senate hav=
e refused to do.







 Q Yes, but some of the words and phrases you've used to describe what Re=
publicans are doing are pretty harsh. And the fact that no -- if you're g=
oing for public pressure, the fact that no Republican minds have changed =
at this point, does that tell you that its not working?=20







 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think a lot of Republican minds across the country =
have concluded that Republican senators who are refusing to do their job =
just because Mitch McConnell asked them to I think is an indication that =
we are making some progress. There are at least two Republican senators t=
hat have come out in support of Chief Judge Garland getting a hearing and=
 a vote. Theres at least one high-profile Senate candidate in the state o=
f Florida that has come out and indicated that Chief Judge Garland deserv=
es a vote. There are some former Republican senators -- people like Dick =
Lugar and Tom Coburn -- who have come out and indicated that they believe=
 that Chief Judge Garland deserves a hearing and a vote.=20







I don't know if those people changed their minds, or if this is the view =
that they had all along. But there is plenty of evidence to indicate that=
 there are plenty of Republicans who agree with the case that President O=
bama has made, which is that Republicans should not for the first time si=
nce 1875 deny a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. That would be=
 an unprecedented escalation of partisan politics into a Supreme Court pr=
ocess that has historically been shielded from a lot of partisan stray vo=
ltage.







 Look, there have been politics that have polluted this process in the pa=
st. The President has acknowledged that theres no one party that is respo=
nsible for that. But theres also no denying that it is Republicans in thi=
s instance that they're escalating this partisanship in a way that's not =
good for the country. And it certainly is not fair to a distinguished pub=
lic servant like Chief Judge Garland who has more federal judicial experi=
ence than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history.







 Q Does the administration still think that this is going to go to a vote=
 -- to hearings and a vote, ultimately?=20







 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I have refrained from predicting legislative o=
utcomes.







 Q No -- Denis McDonough, maybe a month and a half ago, said that he beli=
eved that this would go there, and then you agreed, and you felt that tha=
t's -- do you still feel that way?







 MR. EARNEST: I still feel that that's exactly what should happen. And we=
 wouldnt be making this case, and the President wouldnt be devoting about=
 an hour of his afternoon to talking to local television anchors if we di=
dn't think this is something that can and should be done.







David.=20







 Q Josh, a couple more on Hiroshima. We're about less than three weeks be=
fore the President leaves for Asia. Im wondering if you can provide an up=
date as to whether the President will visit Hiroshima.







 MR. EARNEST: I don't have an update for you in terms of the Presidents s=
chedule when hes in Japan at this point. But we're obviously hard at work=
 planning that trip.







 Q Can you rule it out? We're less than three weeks from the trip.=20







 MR. EARNEST: I cannot --=20







Q -- added a potential stop --=20







 MR. EARNEST: I can't rule it out at this point. The Presidents itinerary=
 for this trip to Japan is not yet set. But well --







 Q But you guys are actively considering it?







 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think we've actively considered it every time the P=
resident has decided to travel to Japan. I think hes been there, what, th=
ree or four times now, Mark, as President? I don't mean to put you on the=
 spot there. (Laughter.) The President has been to Japan three or four ti=
mes as President. And each time the President has traveled there, this qu=
estion has come up and we've considered it each time.







 Q Has the President spoken directly with Secretary Kerry about the merit=
s of a visit to Hiroshima after his trip? Or has the President reached ou=
t to his ambassador, Caroline Kennedy, about what she thinks about that?







 MR. EARNEST: Well, certainly Ambassador Kennedy and her office have been=
 involved in planning our trip. I don't know whether or not the President=
 has had a specific conversation with Secretary Kerry since he returned f=
rom his trip to Hiroshima just a few weeks ago. But this is something tha=
t we're considering.







 But again, we're not considering it for the first time. This is somethin=
g that -- this is a question that has come up every time the President ha=
s planned to travel to Japan.=20







 Q Final thing on that. There have been a number of op-eds written since =
Secretary Kerry visited -- from The New York Times and The Washington Pos=
t -- that were in favor; the Weekly Standard and others I think were agai=
nst it. But Wendy Sherman I think had an op-ed encouraging the President =
to go -- published by CNN -- a former high-ranking State Department offic=
ial familiar with nuclear issues. Im wondering if the President is monito=
ring that coverage on how the administration overall, the West Wing feels=
 about sort of the reaction on net to John Kerrys visit and these calls f=
or the President to go.







 MR. EARNEST: I don't know that the President has read each of the materi=
als that you've just described. But hes certainly aware of the public deb=
ate that consideration of a visit like this has prompted. And that's enti=
rely appropriate. But until we make -- its a little hard to talk about un=
til we've made a decision one way or the other.







 Q Do you know on net that the general sentiment favors -- is supporting =
a trip, whether you go or not?







 MR. EARNEST: I think its hard to tell at this point. But I think once we=
've made a decision, well be prepared to explain how we arrived at that d=
ecision once we've announced it.







 Chris, Ill give you the last one.







 Q Great. On the President today engaging in media interviews to encourag=
e Senate action on Judge Garland, theres another nominee the full Senate =
hasnt acted on since he was named by the President nearly six months ago =
-- Eric Fanning for Army Secretary. Will the President employ the same ef=
fort to get him confirmed?







 MR. EARNEST: The President certainly will continue to make clear that he=
 believes that Mr. Fanning would serve with distinction as Secretary of t=
he Army.







 Mr. Fanning is somebody that has extensive experience at the Department =
of Defense. Hes served in a number of roles there. And he would bring tha=
t experience and that judgement to the Secretarys office. The President b=
elieves that he is exactly the right person for the job. And its unconsci=
onable for Republicans to continue to block his nomination for no good re=
ason.







 Q Last week, Senator McCain attempted to get a vote on the nominee, but =
he was blocked by Senator Roberts, who has placed a hold on the nominatio=
n. What is the White House strategy for convincing Senator Roberts to lif=
t the hold on Fanning?







 MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously the White House has made a strong and effec=
tive case to Democrats and Republicans in the Senate that Mr. Fanning des=
erves confirmation. And well continue to make that argument on the merits=
 to everyone who continues to try to block his nomination.







 Q Senator Roberts mentioned on the floor a phone call he received from t=
he White House on the nomination. What did that consist of?







 MR. EARNEST: Well, Im not privy to that phone call. I can't confirm that=
 it occurred. We're going to continue to make a strong case on the merits=
 that our national security would be enhanced by the Senate confirming th=
e Secretary of the Army, particularly when its somebody as distinguished =
as Mr. Fanning.







 Q And given Senator Robertss voting record, and the fact that Eric Fanni=
ng would be the first openly gay person to serve as Army Secretary, do yo=
u think sexual orientation is a factor on this hold?







 MR. EARNEST: I have no idea what the motivations are of Republicans to u=
nfairly block the nomination of a patriotic American to this critical nat=
ional security post.







 Q Its public record that Senator Roberts voted against "don't ask, don't=
 tell" repeal; against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act; in favor of=
 a constitutional amendment that would have banned same-sex marriage nati=
onwide. Doesn't that raise questions about the motivations behind this ho=
ld?







 MR. EARNEST: I have no idea what his motivations are. I can tell you tha=
t his actions, though, are wrong. Mr. Fanning is a distinguished public s=
ervant. Hes a patriotic American. Hes been nominated by the President of =
the United States to a critically important job. And the Senate should st=
op obstructing that nomination.=20







 Mark, I put you on the spot earlier, so Ill give you the last one.







 Q Okay, thanks. What can you tell us about the five hours that the Presi=
dent spent yesterday with the Obama Foundation?







 MR. EARNEST: Not much. I can tell you that the President was visiting wi=
th architects who had submitted designs related to his presidential libra=
ry. But this is a process that's been administered by the foundation. So =
Id refer you to them for specific questions about that process.







 Q Why did he leave the White House for that meeting?=20







 MR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that there is an opportunity t=
o make these presentations. And it was concluded that for logistical reas=
ons it would be easier to convene that series of meetings offsite.







 Q Was he doing fundraising?







 MR. EARNEST: No, no, he was not.







 Q Has he started doing fundraising?







 MR. EARNEST: He has not. He has not. The President has made clear that h=
e wont be raising money for the foundation until after he leaves office.







 Q And one other question. Is the White House upset about Chinas decision=
 not to let the Stennis carrier group have a port visit in Hong Kong?







 MR. EARNEST: Its my understanding -- you should check with the Departmen=
t of Defense on this -- I know that even as the Chinese made that announc=
ement, there actually was a U.S. naval vessel that had made a port of cal=
l in Hong Kong. So it does not appear to be a significant change in polic=
y that they're administering. But obviously the Stennis carrier group has=
 made a port of call in Hong Kong before. But I can't speak to what the C=
hinese government may have had in mind by denying this request.







 Thanks, everybody. Well see you tomorrow.=20

 Josh.&nbsp; What is the White House's reaction to Puerto Rico's default of=
 $370 million in bond payments?&nbsp; Did it have better options?&nbsp; And=
 will this default create
 more urgency for lawmakers and the Obama administration to work something =
out?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Kevin, I su=
re hope it creates a new sense of urgency for members of Congress to addres=
s this situation.&nbsp; It's a situation that we've been concerned about fo=
r
 quite some time.&nbsp; It's now been 194 days since the administration put=
 forward our legislative proposal for addressing this situation.&nbsp; So I=
 think that should be an indication to you and to the people of Puerto Rico=
 that the administration has been focused
 on this for six months now.&nbsp; And unfortunately, we haven&#8217;t seen=
 the kind of movement in the Republican-led Congress that we need to see to=
 make a bailout of Puerto Rico less likely.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">The truth is, what the administration is seeking is to =
empower the Puerto Rican government with the kind of restructuring authorit=
y that cities all across the country have.&nbsp; And
 the administration believes that that restructuring authority should be co=
ntingent on the Puerto Rican government making some needed financial reform=
s.&nbsp; We also believe that there should be a mechanism for accountabilit=
y and verifying that those reforms are
 being appropriately implemented.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's why it's wrong for p=
eople to describe this as a bailout.&nbsp; But the situation gets worse by =
the day.&nbsp; And some days, in some situations -- in some days, the situa=
tion
 gets notably worse.&nbsp; And it only makes a bailout more likely, which i=
s why we continue to press hard for Republicans in Congress to stop draggin=
g their feet and to address a situation that's having a negative impact on =
more than 3 million Americans who live
 in Puerto Rico.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think you=
'd be hard-pressed to make that case.&nbsp; But I'm certainly no financial =
expert.&nbsp; I'm not aware of all of the options that were available to th=
e Puerto
 Rican government.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t think there's anybody here who c=
an -- well, I'll just say, I don&#8217;t think there are any good options f=
or the Puerto Rican government at this point. &nbsp;And that's exactly why =
this restructuring authority is badly needed.&nbsp; You might
 even say that it's overdue.&nbsp; And it's also why a set of financial ref=
orms is overdue, because there clearly are some significant problems that a=
re plaguing the Puerto Rican government's budget but also having a negative=
 impact on the broader economy.

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

lk about where the President stands on this idea of creating safe zones wit=

 I would like to
 ask you, what has changed and what is the U.S. prepared to do to enforce t=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; So, Kevin, =
I think there has been, in the lexicon here of describing the chaotic situa=
tion in Syria, there has been some, shall we say, confusion.&nbsp; The conf=
usion
 does not stem from any government officials that I've seen, but it does ap=
ply to some observers of the situation.&nbsp; The President's view of safe =
zones has not changed.&nbsp; The President does not believe at this point t=
hat safe zones are a practical alternative
 to what currently is happening in Syria right now.&nbsp; There have been s=
ome who have advocated for the creation of no-fly zones or safe zones insid=
e of Syria that would essentially provide a sanctuary for Syrian citizens.&=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">The President is concerned about that kind of proposal =
because it puts the United States on the hook for essentially safeguarding =
the safe zones.&nbsp; That would require a significant
 commitment of ground troops.&nbsp; It would also put those ground troops o=
n the front lines, because presumably you would have ISIL trying to encroac=
h on those safe zones or trying to infiltrate them, and it could set up a v=
ery dangerous situation for American
 forces that doesn&#8217;t actually make a lot of progress in terms of degr=
ading and destroying ISIL.

 zones has most recently been mentioned has been in the context of the cess=
ation of hostilities.&nbsp; The cessation of hostilities was an agreement
 that the United States, Russia, and the rest of the international communit=
y, including the Assad regime, signed on to at the beginning of the year.&n=
bsp; And we warned -- we were aware at the beginning of the implementation =
of that cessation of hostilities that
 there were likely to be violations; that the implementation of that cessat=
ion of hostilities was likely to be bumpy.&nbsp; And the truth is, for most=
 of the last couple of months, that cessation of hostilities has worked mor=
e effectively in reducing the violence
 in Syria than most people thought.&nbsp; And we were, frankly, surprised t=
hat the level of violence did reduce as much -- did come down as far as it =
did.

 has started to fray.&nbsp; And that is where we are reinforcing our effort=

e not seen
 anybody in the U.S. government refer to them as safe zones.&nbsp; I certai=

hat it gets too complicated to try to differentiate between what we're talk=
ing about here.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s be clear:&nbsp; The President
 is against safe zones.&nbsp; He&#8217;s expressed that from the beginning =
because he doesn't want to put the United States in the situation of trying=
 to enforce it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 which the Assad regime did curb their military activities.&nbsp; Just in t=
he last couple of weeks we've seen the Assad regime go back to some of the =

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth is the President has=
 been very clear about what our strategy is when it comes to international =
trade.&nbsp; The President around the world has sought high-standard agreem=
ents.
 &nbsp;The reason for that is simple:&nbsp; That's consistent with our valu=
es.&nbsp; We believe that there should be high standards when it comes to h=
uman rights and labor rights and worker rights and environmental standards.=
&nbsp; And that's a good thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

serves those higher standards, that's going to level the playing field
 for American businesses and workers that already observe those standards.&=
nbsp; And that's going to create expanded economic opportunity for the Amer=
ican people.&nbsp; So that's the kind of trade strategy that the President =
has pursued in Asia, and it&#8217;s the kind of
 strategy that has guided our participation in the T-TIP talks.&nbsp; But a=
s it relates to the veracity of those documents, I just don't have any comm=

 I do not anticipate that we're going to be able to get Congress to act on =

 going to interfere with the fight against the Islamic State and plans for =
the coalition to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces as they begin to look at =

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, it&#8=
217;s almost two weeks ago now that the President did a news conference in =
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where he was asked quite directly by a journalist from=
 The
 Washington Post about the political situation inside of Iraq.&nbsp; And th=
e President noted at the time that he was concerned about the situation the=
re.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He noted that the dynamics of =
the political debate inside of *<s>Syria</s> Iraq right now are a little bi=
t different than they traditionally have been; that the political
 dialogue right now that has been so challenging is not one that breaks dow=
n along sectarian lines, but rather some disagreement within the Shia commu=
nity in Iraq about the proper way to govern the country.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this presents some unique c=
hallenges.&nbsp; And given the concerns about the situation inside of Iraq,=
 Vice President Biden made his first trip to Iraq in more than four years.&=
nbsp;
 So I think the significance of a vice presidential visit underscores the s=
ignificance of the challenges that are facing Iraq right now.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously the Vice President&#=
8217;s message was to reiterate our support for the reforms that are being =
pursued by the Abadi-led government.&nbsp; The Vice President also used his=
 visit
 to underscore the U.S. and international community&#8217;s commitment to e=
conomic support for Iraq.&nbsp; There are significant economic reforms that=
 the government needs to implement.&nbsp; There&#8217;s also some needed as=
sistance that can be provided to Iraqi authorities that
 are seeking to rebuild communities that ISIL had previously controlled.&nb=
sp; And that is going to be a critical part of our effort to prevent ISIL f=
rom retaking those communities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the President spent a lot =
of time talking about the need to support this Iraqi effort when he met wit=
h the GCC countries in Riyadh last week -- two weeks ago.<o:p></o:p></span>=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the final thing that =
I think is important for people to understand is Vice President Biden was a=
lso there to talk about ongoing U.S. and international support for
 the military campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.&nbsp; Those =
military efforts in Iraq are led by Iraqi forces that are under the command=
 and control of the Iraqi central government.&nbsp; And we have been able t=
o effectively work with Iraqi forces to drive
 ISIL out of about 40 percent of the populated territory that they previous=
ly held.&nbsp; That represents important progress.&nbsp; And we are looking=
 for ways to keep that momentum going, including beginning to support Iraqi=
 operations around Mosul to eventually prepare
 for the retaking of that city.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

uqtada al-Sadr.&nbsp; But I&#8217;d check with the State Department about t=
hat.&nbsp; I don't

17;m certainly no expert in trying to divine what sort of influence individ=
ual figures in Iraq may have in the political situation there.&nbsp; I thin=
k as a
 matter of policy, the U.S. government certainly respects the sovereignty o=
f the nation of Iraq and the responsibility that the Iraqi people have to d=
etermine political outcomes in their country.&nbsp; We're entirely respectf=
ul of that process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Andrew, in reading the ne=
ws coverage over the weekend and in talking to some senior officials here a=
t the White House who work on this issue all the time, I was reminded
 of the summer of 2014.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll recall that when ISIL made its d=
ramatic advance across the Iraqi desert and deeply encroached into Iraqi te=
rritory, there were significant questions raised about what the U.S. role w=
ould be in trying to get ISIL out of the country.&nbsp;
 In those early days the question was what the United States would do to pr=
otect Iraq from ISIL.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you&#8217;ll recall at the=
 time the President laid down a pretty clear marker that addressing the pol=
itical failures of the Maliki government in Iraq was necessary before the
 United States could commit to the kind of military support that we're prov=
iding now.&nbsp; The reason for that is -- the assessment of our experts he=
re is that Maliki&#8217;s focus on governing along sectarian lines inside o=
f Iraq significantly weakened the Iraqi government,
 but it also had a deleterious impact on the competence of Iraqi security f=
orces.&nbsp; You essentially had some forces that were unwilling to defend =
some parts of the country based on the sectarian identification of the popu=
lation.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And President Obama made clear=
 that a military commitment on the part of the United States would be conti=
ngent upon the establishment of an Iraqi central government that prioritize=
d
 uniting the country across sectarian lines; that the ability of Kurds and =
Sunnis and Shia in Iraq to work together to defeat ISIL was going to be cri=
tical to their success.&nbsp; And Prime Minister Abadi has demonstrated a c=
ommitment to prioritizing a government
 philosophy that unites the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why the Unite=
d States has been supportive of his efforts to implement reforms, but ultim=
ately those reforms need to be responsive to the concerns and priorities
 of the Iraqi people.&nbsp; That&#8217;s his top priority.&nbsp; He&#8217;s=
 the leader of a sovereign nation.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why the United St=
ates can be supportive of his efforts, but ultimately it&#8217;s Prime Mini=
ster Abadi listening to the Iraqi people that will make decisions about
 how to effectively run that country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you thi=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I thi=
nk he has demonstrated during his time &#8211;- speaking broadly, he has de=
monstrated during his time in office that he&#8217;s committed to a multi-s=
ectarian
 Iraq, and he has governed consistent with that vision.&nbsp; For him, it&#=
8217;s a legitimate national security priority and I think he understands t=
he stakes.&nbsp; I also think he&#8217;s not just doing that because it&#82=
17;s his own personal preference and because it&#8217;s critical to
 the national security of the country; I think he&#8217;s doing that becaus=
e he thinks it&#8217;s a reflection of the ambitions of the Iraqi people an=
d that the success of his country will depend upon his success in unifying =
that country to counter the challenges that
 they currently face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because, look, we also have to=
 remember it&#8217;s not just ISIL that poses a threat to Iraq.&nbsp; Iraq =
is going through some pretty challenging, wrenching changes to their econom=
y.&nbsp;
 The significantly lower price of oil has proved to be a significant challe=
nge to that country.&nbsp; There are also challenges related to their infra=
structure, like repairing the Mosul Dam, that are time-consuming both in te=
rms of the amount of money that&#8217;s required
 to deal with that situation but it also requires a level of expertise that=
 is not easily found.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">So there are some significant challenges, and Prime Min=
ister Abadi is dealing with a lot right now.&nbsp; And the rest of the inte=
rnational community is going to be supportive of him
 as he tries to make the changes consistent with his responsibilities as th=
e Prime Minister of Iraq.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I j=
ust wanted to follow on the second part of Roberta&#8217;s question, which =
is the impact of the instability.&nbsp; Over the weekend, on plans to retak=
e Mosul, obviously
 those efforts are going to take buy-in from all the different parts of com=
peting interests within Iraq.&nbsp; And there had been a sense, I think aft=
er the trip, that the political situation had calmed, planning to kind of f=
inalize how they were going to go into
 Mosul could continue and be completed to prevent inaction.&nbsp; So I&#821=
7;m wondering, now that there seems to be backsliding there, if the Preside=
nt's sort of perceived deadline at the end of the year is in danger or coul=
d be pushed back farther.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, based=
 on the briefings that I&#8217;ve received this morning, our national secur=
ity professionals have not detected any impact on our ongoing counter-ISIL =
activities
 in Iraq, based on the political instability in Baghdad over the weekend.&n=
bsp; The United States and our coalition partners conducted 59 airstrikes a=
nd six artillery strikes against ISIL targets in northern Iraq and Anbar Pr=
ovince.&nbsp; That was just over the weekend.&nbsp;
 And the ongoing effort to offer training, advice, and assistance to Iraqi =
forces has continued unabated.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">So what we have said all along is that specific militar=
y decisions like when to begin the operation against Mosul will be made by =
Iraqi forces and the Iraqi central government.&nbsp;
 Again, we continue to respect the sovereignty of this independent nation, =
and we continue to partner with them and work effectively with them, both t=
o carry out ongoing operations to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, but =
also to plan for future military
 operations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to ask about the President=
&#8217;s trip to Flint later this week.&nbsp; Governor Snyder has been unde=
r a lot of pressure, and eventually he kind of did a photo-op to drink the
 tap water in Flint as a sign of solidarity.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m wondering i=
f the President is going to drink the filtered Flint water while he is ther=
e and if he also plans to meet with Governor Snyder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not aware of any photo-ops=
 that involve the President&#8217;s consumption of water.&nbsp; Based on wh=
at the EPA has communicated to the public, is that properly filtered
 water in Flint is safe to drink.&nbsp; So I certainly would encourage peop=
le to continue to listen to the advice that they get from our scientific an=
d public health experts about what water is safe to drink, and the Presiden=
t will certainly follow that advice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

&#8217;s also doing
 the Howard University commencement.&nbsp; Are there any threads that are g=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, stay tuned.&nbsp; I&#8217;m no=
t in a position to begin previewing the President&#8217;s commencement addr=
ess at Howard at this point, but the President and his team have been
 working on his speech for a couple of weeks now.&nbsp; But check in later =
this week, and maybe I&#8217;ll be able to give you a better sense of what =
the President&#8217;s plans are for that speech.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; And I also want to=
 ask you -- this weekend at his last White House Correspondents&#8217; Asso=
ciation Dinner, he gave jokes, got some ribbing.&nbsp; What did he think ab=
out
 the final words that were delivered to him and of him, the President of th=
e United States -- a word that is one of the worst words many people say yo=
u could say to anyone, that's gone down in history?&nbsp; What did he think=
 about that?&nbsp; What's his reaction?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, April, I think the first thing=
 that I would observe is that any comedian who signed up to follow Presiden=
t Obama at the White House Correspondents' Dinner is
 assuming one of the most difficult tasks in comedy.&nbsp; Just by nature o=
f the engagement, that's a tough job, following the President of the United=
 States.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">President Obama also, over the years, has shown himself=
 to be rather adept at delivering a speech that consists primarily of one- =
or two-liners, and the President enjoys that opportunity.<o:p></o:p></span>=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

at he was facing on Saturday, and the President's expectation is he took --=
 as Mr. Wilmore took on that responsibility, is
 that comedians are going to go right up to the line.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

;Courier New&quot;">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; April, what I would say is that it's=
 not the first time that people, on the Monday after the White House Corres=
pondent's Dinner, that some people have observed that
 the comedian on Saturday night crossed the line.&nbsp; That happened in 20=
06, after Stephen Colbert delivered his speech.&nbsp; There were many peopl=
e who felt like he had overstepped his bounds in delivering his remarks.&nb=
sp; To a lesser extent, many people made the same
 observation about the presentation of Wanda Sykes in 2009.&nbsp; So it's n=
ot the first time that we've had a conversation like this in which these ki=
nds of concerns have been raised or expressed.&nbsp;

;Courier New&quot;">Look, I had an opportunity to speak to the President ab=
out this briefly this morning, and he said that he appreciated the spirit o=
f the sentiments that Mr. Wilmore expressed.&nbsp;
 He ended his speech by saying that he couldn&#8217;t put into words the pr=
ide that he felt in the President.&nbsp; And he made the observation that o=
ur country has make remarkable progress just in his lifetime -- from not be=
ing willing to accept an African American quarterback,
 to electing and reelecting an African American not just to lead the United=
 States, but to lead the free world.&nbsp; Again, I take Mr. Wilmore at his=
 words that he found that to be a powerful transformation just in his lifet=
ime, and something that he seemed to
 be pretty obviously proud of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

;Courier New&quot;">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that there is a conver=
sation about that word.&nbsp; The President, in June of last year, used it =
as a teaching moment to show that issues of race are still a problem
 in this country.&nbsp; But Wilmore used it for the President somewhat as a=
 butt of the joke.&nbsp; And you were in that room, as well as I was.&nbsp;=
 There was an eerie, awkward silence and quietness.&nbsp; And people didn&#=

hat does -- let me say it this way:&nbsp; I'm confident that Mr. Wilmore us=
ed the word by design.&nbsp; He was seeking to be provocative.&nbsp;
 But I think any reading of his comments makes clear he was not using the P=
resident as the butt of a joke.&nbsp; So what is true is that this is a tou=
gh assignment that any comedian takes on when they sign up for this job.&nb=
sp; And the President's expectation when he
 walks in that room is that that comedian and other people are going to get=
 much closer to the line than they ordinarily would as they try to make a j=
oke.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 over the recess.&nbsp; But what I'm wondering from you is, what are you lo=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Jordan, we're going to continue to a=
pply pressure to Republicans to do their job.&nbsp; It's a pretty simple me=
ssage that we're delivering.&nbsp; Since 1875, every Supreme
 Court nominee, who hasn&#8217;t later been retracted by the President of t=
he United States, has received a hearing and/or a vote by the United States=
 Senate.&nbsp; That's why what Republicans are vowing to do is unprecedente=
d and a dramatic escalation of partisan politics.&nbsp;
 That's problematic because, even in this era of divided government and pol=
arized politics, there's been an effort by both sides to try to insulate th=
e U.S. justice system and the institution of the United States Supreme Cour=
t from that political stray voltage.&nbsp;
 But Republicans have, in this case, ramped it up.&nbsp; Look, even Senator=
 Graham, who served four years on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has ackno=
wledged that what Republicans are vowing to do and are doing is unprecedent=
ed.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">Several Republicans -- or at least a couple of them com=
e to mind -- have indicated that they're treating President Obama's nominee=
 differently than they would treat a nominee that's
 put forward by a Republican President.&nbsp; They're acknowledging that th=
is is not driven by some peculiar reading of the Constitution, but it's dri=
ven by a raw, partisan political calculation that Republicans in the Senate=
 have made to obstruct this nominee not
 because of any concerns about the nominee's judicial philosophy; they're o=
bstructing this nominee simply because Chief Judge Garland was put forward =
by Barack Obama.&nbsp; That's unfortunate particularly when you consider th=
at Chief Judge Garland is somebody who
 has more experience on the federal judiciary than any Supreme Court nomine=
e in American history.&nbsp; He served on the second-highest court in the l=
and for 19 years.&nbsp; In taking a close look at that record, it's evident=
 that he understands that the job of a federal
 judge is to interpret the law, not advance a political agenda.&nbsp; <o:p>=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

ze -- I would acknowledge that this is an argument that we've spent a lot o=
f the last two months making.&nbsp; But this is an opportunity
 for the President to sit before local television anchors and make the argu=
ment once again, and present it, hopefully, in a compelling way that will h=
ave an impact on the constituents of five or six Republican senators.<o:p><=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we started out with Republican=
s across the board -- at least the Senate Republican Leader saying that Rep=
ublicans wouldn&#8217;t meet with the President's nominee.&nbsp;
 But as you know, Chief Judge Garland has now met with 14 different Republi=
can senators, and there are more plans for when Congress returns from their=
 weeklong recess next week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

term of art, Mike.&nbsp; What we're trying to do --<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the President called it safe =
areas when he was asked about this during the press conference with Preside=
nt [sic] Merkel in Germany, and he said there's no space between
 him and Chancellor Merkel on the question of whether or not there are area=
s to carve out in Syria that he would support the idea of carving out what =
he called &quot;safe areas&quot; through the political process.&nbsp; So I =
just want to make sure that what you're suggesting
 seems to be different than what the President said during that news confer=
ence.&nbsp; He says he supports the idea of carving out some safe areas in =
Syria through the political process.&nbsp; You're saying he doesn&#8217;t s=
upport any such thing?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Mike, what we're trying to do is we'=
re trying to put back in place a cessation of hostilities across the countr=
y.&nbsp; The cessation of hostilities applies everywhere
 in Syria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Pre=
sident said, &quot;If we can get the political transition to separate out a=
reas where a moderate oppositions that's at the table controls it, that sho=
uld be a safe
 area.&nbsp; If it's ISIL or Nusra, that's not a safe area.&nbsp; And that'=
s the concept we've been trying to build.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">So that suggests that there are -- I mean, short of a c=
omplete cessation of hostilities -- which I suppose you would support, firs=
t and foremost -- but short of that, it does seem
 like the President supports the idea of creating some space inside Syria t=
hat is safe, whether you call it a zone or an area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, what our goal, Mike, is to rei=
nforce the effective implementation of a cessation of hostilities nationwid=
e in Syria.&nbsp; And there are particular areas where there
 have been repeated and increasing violations of the cessation of hostiliti=
es.&nbsp; And our goal is to reinforce our effort to refresh the cessation =
of hostilities in those areas where we've seen violations.&nbsp; But that i=
s not a reference to any sort of new tactic
 to try to address the political situation in Syria.&nbsp; Our goal all alo=
ng has been to implement a cessation of hostilities all across the country =
to try to add some momentum to the ongoing political talks.<o:p></o:p></spa=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing that I have sa=
id before, but not from the context of these conversations that&#8217;s a r=
elevant fact, is neither Nusra or other extremist groups like ISIL have
 signed on to the cessation of hostilities.&nbsp; So we would like to see a=
 cessation of hostilities all across the country, but that is not going to =
have an impact on the ability of the United States or our coalition partner=
s to go after ISIL.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then o=
n a second topic, back to Flint.&nbsp; The President and the White House ha=
s been highly critical I think of the state environmental apparatus in Mich=
igan for their
 failures, as have a lot of people.&nbsp; As the President goes back, what =
is the President prepared to say or apologize for in terms of the federal g=
overnment and the EPA&#8217;s failures to act more quickly in the face of t=
he water problems in Flint?&nbsp; I mean, there
 have been some lower-level resignations from EPA -- and I know that some o=
f the federal officials have been there since and are I guess going back ah=
ead of the President&#8217;s visit -- but is the President prepared to say =
to the people of Flint that we screwed
 up too, at the federal level?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I thi=
nk the President is prepared to acknowledge that, as President of the Unite=
d States, he takes responsibility for lots of things.&nbsp; But what&#8217;=
s also
 true is that the blue-ribbon independent commission that was appointed by =
the Republican governor of the state of Michigan found, &#8220;primary resp=
onsibility for the water contamination in Flint lies with the MDEQ,&quot; w=
hich is the state-run environmental agency
 in Michigan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s also true is that=
 the Attorney General has filed criminal charges against some state employe=
es for their role in this as well.&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t, however, expect =
for the
 President to spend a lot of time talking about specific accountability, pr=
imarily because there continues to be ongoing investigations into that acco=
untability, and the President doesn&#8217;t want to be perceived as weighin=
g in on one side or the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the President will certain=
ly go to Michigan and make a forceful case that as the President of the Uni=
ted States, he feels responsible for the safety and wellbeing of every
 American, no matter which community they live in.&nbsp; And I think that w=
ould certainly explain the widespread federal effort in Flint to help the p=
eople of Flint deal with this emergency situation.&nbsp; 7.3 million liters=
 of water have been distributed by federal
 employees.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen 55,000 water and pitcher filters be dist=
ributed in communities there.&nbsp; About a quarter of a million replacemen=
t cartridges have been passed out as well.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been a signi=
ficant expansion of health care access, paid for by the federal
 government.&nbsp; This access comes both in the forms of expanding Medicai=
d eligibility, but also in terms of offering grants to local health care pr=
oviders so that they have more resources to treat more people.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is all a reflection of=
 the federal government&#8217;s commitment to helping the people of Flint d=
eal with what&#8217;s a tragic situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one la=
st thing.&nbsp; I mean, that&#8217;s sort of post-crisis, right?&nbsp; That=
&#8217;s the response to the crisis once it had been fully realized.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That's right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess the question is, is the Pre=
sident prepared to &#8211;- he&#8217;s going to be meeting with a group of =
people, I guess, around the table.&nbsp; If they look at him and say, yes, =
obviously
 there were failures at the state level but where was the federal governmen=
t a year ago, a year and a half ago, two years ago when this was all happen=
ing -- what does he say to them?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I thi=
nk he says that the EPA takes very seriously the responsibility that they h=
ave to work effectively with state regulators to ensure the clean air and
 clean water of everybody in America.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why more than =
six weeks ago, the administrator of the EPA sent a letter to governors all =
across the country, making clear exactly what responsibilities state regula=
tors have when it comes to enforcing the lead
 and copper rule.&nbsp; She was also clear in that letter that there will b=
e a response from the EPA if the state regulators fall down on the job.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that level of clarity hopef=
ully will prevent the situation in Flint from reemerging in other communiti=
es.&nbsp; And that obviously is a top priority of the President&#8217;s as =
well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jo=
sh.&nbsp; Back to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; I just want to ask you the quest=
ion:&nbsp; Have you given any consideration to the thought process of Senat=
e Republicans that you
 mentioned are taking some heat from their constituents on Merrick Garland =
and their decision to completely dismiss the nominating process rather than=
 go ahead and at least go through the motions of the process, even if the o=
utcome is predetermined?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Look, I thi=
nk it&#8217;s pretty clear what&#8217;s happening here.&nbsp; The reason th=
at the leader of Republicans in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, issued a state=
ment just hours
 after the announcement of Justice Scalia&#8217;s death is that he wanted t=
o try to shut down the process as soon as possible.&nbsp; He recognized tha=
t if the President put forward a highly qualified, experienced, respectable=
 individual with impeccable legal credentials
 to fill that vacancy, that there would be enormous pressure on Republicans=
 to vote and confirm this individual.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s exactly what =
Republicans are trying not to do.&nbsp; The President effectively called th=
eir bluff by nominating someone that even Republicans have described as a c=
onsensus
 nominee.&nbsp; Even Republicans who have met with Chief Judge Garland have=
 had very positive things to say about his character and about his aptitude=
 for the job.&nbsp; So people like Pat Toomey said that he was &quot;very, =
very smart and very knowledgeable.&quot;&nbsp; Republican
 Senator Rob Portman from Ohio described Chief Judge Garland as &#8220;an i=
mpressive guy.&#8221;&nbsp; Senator Flake from Arizona described Chief Judg=
e Garland as &#8220;obviously a man of accomplishment and keen intellect.&#=
8221;&nbsp; Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina described him
 as &#8220;honest and capable&#8221; and described his reputation as &#8220=
;beyond reproach.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what Republicans are trying=
 to do is they&#8217;re trying to prevent a situation in which Chief Judge =
Garland sits before the Senate Judiciary Committee and answers any question=
s
 that come his way.&nbsp; We know that if there&#8217;s a hearing like this=
, it&#8217;s going to be &#8211;- it&#8217;s going to get lots of attention=
.&nbsp; It will be carried live on many of the networks that are represente=
d in this room, at least for parts of the hearing.&nbsp; And the expectatio=
n
 the President has is that Chief Judge Garland is going to use his brillian=
t legal mind and 19 years of judicial experience to effectively answer thos=
e questions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And once that hearing is compl=
eted, you&#8217;ll really see pressure on Republicans to explain their posi=
tion, trying to block his confirmation to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; So what =
we
 have seen from Republicans, particularly Republican leaders in Washington,=
 is to shut down this effort before it can build momentum.&nbsp; But I thin=
k in spite of their efforts, we have built up some momentum and some pressu=
re on Republicans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I do think this is why eve=
ry Republican senator across the country, including Senator Ayotte, is faci=
ng a central question:&nbsp; Are they going to listen to Republican leaders
 in the United States Senate and not do their job?&nbsp; Or are they going =
to do what the United States Constitution requires?&nbsp; And that is to of=
fer their advice and consent for the President&#8217;s choice to fill a vac=
ancy on the Supreme Court.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the instructions of =
Republican leaders in Washington I don&#8217;t think is going to be a parti=
cularly persuasive explanation for their conduct when Republican senators
 are facing their constituents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m =
sorry, on Syria, I still don&#8217;t understand.&nbsp; If safe zones or saf=
e areas is not the purpose in Geneva, then why are negotiators there lookin=
g at maps and drawing up
 lines of areas where allegedly civilians and/or members of the moderate op=
position could shelter?&nbsp; They&#8217;re looking at maps.&nbsp; That&#82=
17;s what our people are telling us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, Mark, =
the goal of the conversations in Geneva are to build confidence in a politi=
cal transition.&nbsp; And what the negotiators in Geneva on the opposition =
side
 of the table have indicated is it&#8217;s very difficult for them to engag=
e in political talks when their constituents back home are being bombed rec=
klessly and tragically by the regime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so the idea behind the ces=
sation of hostilities was to try to bring the violence between the oppositi=
on and the government to an end so that negotiations could take place.&nbsp=
;
 So what the negotiators are doing is trying to find a way to get the regim=
e to stop bombing their people so that they can try to come to some sort of=
 political agreement.&nbsp; What we found is that at least for a while, whe=
n the cessation of hostilities was initially
 implemented, that that actually worked out a little bit better than anybod=
y expected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And part of that was because t=
he Russian government, President Putin, was willing to put his own credibil=
ity on the line and was willing to make a strong case to the Assad
 regime that they needed to abide by the cessation of hostilities.&nbsp; An=
d we want them to just go back and do the same thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I get =
that.&nbsp; But what I don&#8217;t understand is, if they&#8217;re sitting =
down and drawing lines on a map and saying this area is going to be off lim=
its, is that not a safe
 zone or a safe area, or propose some other way to call it?<o:p></o:p></spa=
n></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I gue=
ss the reason that I don&#8217;t think I would describe it that way is that=
 ISIL and Nusra are not part of the cessation of hostilities.&nbsp; It&#821=
7;s the Assad
 regime that has signed onto the cessation of hostilities.&nbsp; So I think=
 when there was a broader discussion about safe zones and the President was=
 asked directly in a news conference about whether or not he would support =
the concept of a safe zone, and the President
 expressed his strong opposition to it, is that he didn&#8217;t want to cre=
ate a situation in which the United States was on the hook for protecting t=
hat safe zone from incursions by extremists, by Nusra, by ISIL, or by the r=
egime.&nbsp; So the conversations that are
 taking place in Geneva right now are focused very specifically on where we=
 can reinforce our efforts to implement successfully a cessation of hostili=
ties, to try to lower the violence, to advance political talks, but also al=
low the shipment of humanitarian
 relief into areas that have long been caught in the crossfire.<o:p></o:p><=

;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, than=
ks.&nbsp; There&#8217;s two topics I wanted to ask about.&nbsp; First, the =
28 pages of classified documents in the 9/11 Commission report.&nbsp; CIA D=
irector John Brennan over the
 weekend saying that there could be some inaccuracies in there and some unv=
etted information.&nbsp; Is the President concerned about that?&nbsp; And h=
ow close is the White House to releasing those documents?<o:p></o:p></span>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I saw=
 that there was a little attention that was generated by Director Brennan&#=
8217;s comments.&nbsp; I have to admit I was surprised by that attention be=
cause there
 was an op-ed that was written just last week by Lee Hamilton and Governor =
Kean from New Jersey.&nbsp; Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Kean were the chair of the=
 independent commission that took a look at the 9/11 attacks, both the even=
ts that led to the attacks but also proposed
 reforms that would prevent those kinds of attacks from occurring on Americ=
an soil ever again.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">They wrote that op-ed and indicated that they also saw =
the 28 pages.&nbsp; They described those 28 pages as unvetted, law enforcem=
ent investigative materials.&nbsp; And they said they had
 an opportunity to review that material, to follow up on leads, and that th=
ey actually conducted interviews not just in the United States but around t=
he world to follow up on that information.&nbsp; And as we&#8217;ve discuss=
ed many times in this room over the last several
 weeks, the conclusion of their report is that they found no evidence that =
the Saudi government as an institution had supported al Qaeda.<o:p></o:p></=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Director Brennan&#8217;s co=
mments are entirely in line with those that were put forward by Governor Ke=
an and Congressman Hamilton, who had a responsibility to look at that mater=
ial,
 to follow up on the claims, and to offer up an unclassified conclusion abo=
ut what was included there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how clo=
se is the White House to releasing the documents?&nbsp; And is there concer=
n that releasing them is going to be a mistake?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The White H=
ouse is not responsible for releasing the documents.&nbsp; Those documents =
are currently in the possession of the Office of the Director of National I=
ntelligence.&nbsp;
 That is the office that is responsible for processing sensitive informatio=
n that is being considered for public release.&nbsp; They have a declassifi=
cation process that they conduct that is part of their standard operating p=
rocedure.&nbsp; I would acknowledge that they
 have been conducting that process on this material for quite some time.&nb=
sp; And the Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, has indicated t=
hat they are hopeful they can complete that process by the end of June.<o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And second=
, on Donald Trump and some comments that he made over the weekend.&nbsp; He=
 seemed to indicate that campaigning is more difficult than governing, sayi=
ng, &quot;It's harder
 to become President, in my opinion, than to do a great job at being Presid=
ent.&quot;&nbsp; Would the President agree with that assessment?&nbsp; Or d=
o you have a comment?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's good =
to be in the front row.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Just going back to Saturday =
night, can you talk a little bit about how the cameo with former Speaker Jo=
hn Boehner came
 about in the President's speech?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp;=
 Well, it's pretty simple and in some ways depicted in the video, which is =
that the White House called Speaker Boehner and asked him if he'd be intere=
sted
 in participating in the video.&nbsp; And I think as was evident from the f=
inished product, he was an enthusiastic participant in the production.<o:p>=
</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, Speaker Boehner has a we=
ll-known and very good sense of humor.&nbsp; And he made I think a very pos=
itive contribution to our comedic efforts in the film.<o:p></o:p></span></p=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When was i=
t filmed?&nbsp; And did they meet in addition to the taping to talk about c=
urrent events, politics, Congress?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; They had an=
 opportunity to spend time together in the context of filming the video.&nb=
sp; There was no separate meeting.&nbsp; But the video was actually just fi=
lmed on
 Friday, so just a few days ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did th=
ey talk about the Speaker's comments about Ted Cruz from the night before?<=
o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; There was n=
ot a detailed discussion of those comments, no.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, =
also, over the weekend, Bernie Sanders said that there was going to be a co=
ntested convention, and essentially called on Democratic super-delegates to=
 flip
 to support him.&nbsp; Is that something the President thinks is appropriat=
e?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, what =
the President thinks is appropriate is individual candidates should make th=
eir own decisions about running their campaign. And we've obviously seen
 a very rigorous campaign on the Democratic side, and there's still some co=
ntests to go and more opportunities for Democratic voters across the countr=
y to weigh in on who they believe should represent our party in the general=
 election.&nbsp; And the President thus
 far has refrained from weighing on that debate too much.<o:p></o:p></span>=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Flint a=
nd the governor, you mentioned that the White House has extended an invitat=
ion for him to meet the President at the airport.&nbsp; Its sounds like the=
 governor wants
 a lot more in terms of a substantive meeting with the President, and has r=
equested that.&nbsp; Has there been a response to that request?<o:p></o:p><=
/span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; We haven&#8=
217;t determined the President's schedule for his trip to Flint.&nbsp; As a=
 matter of standard operating procedure, we invited the governor to come to=
 the airport.&nbsp;
 So the invitation to Governor Snyder's office was not unique; it's one tha=
t's even been extended to him a few times before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess th=
e question is, does the President see the governor as someone that he think=
s is important to meet and spend some time with there as a solution found t=
o the
 problem?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, the P=
resident certainly intends to spend quite a bit of time when he's in Flint =
talking to local residents, talking to local officials.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t=
 know at
 this point exactly the extent of the conversations that the President will=
 have with Governor Snyder, but we'll let you know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And given =
what you were saying about how the state has been sort of blamed for all th=
is, I was wondering how could he see the Governor as having the capacity an=
d the
 credibility to be a viable partner in this whole process going forward.<o:=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Gover=
nor Snyder, to his credit, has recognized that there is an important role f=
or the state to play in helping the citizens of Flint recover.<o:p></o:p></=
span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And obviously the U.S. governm=
ent, the federal government, at the direction of President Obama, has been =
deeply involved in that recovery effort.&nbsp; But state officials have
 been, too.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll leave it to the state officials to detail what=
 contributions they have made to that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But look, this is a situation =
that should transcend politics.&nbsp; This should be an opportunity for Dem=
ocrats and Republicans to come together and try to right many of the wrongs
 that have been sustained by the citizens of Flint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

he President have any specific priorities in terms of what he wants to see =
happen as a result of this visit?&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that there&#8217;s the=
 idea of generally reassuring
 residents, and you delineated the list of the water.&nbsp; So is there som=
e aspect of this crisis that the President thinks should be changed, focuse=
d on, alleviated as a result of this?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I thi=
nk -- I would not anticipate that the President will make big news by annou=
ncing a new package of relief for the city of Flint.&nbsp; Obviously, there=
&#8217;s
 been a significant commitment of resources to try to help the people of Fl=
int in this urgent situation.&nbsp; You've heard me here advocate on a coup=
le of occasions that Congress should get involved here.&nbsp; Congress shou=
ld mobilize some resources that could be used
 to address the situation in Flint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think what&#8217;s also true=
 is the President will make a broader argument about just how important it =

 pretty stark contrast to some Republican candidates who suggest that envir=

p; And the reporting suggested that a lot of the security forces there basi=

 in.&nbsp; So is the United States confident that won&#8217;t happen again?=
&nbsp; And are you concerned about the level of security in that area?&nbsp=
; And I know the reporting was that the embassy was never threatened, and t=
here were false rumors about evacuations, but that aspect
 of the situation, you had this fortress for 12 or 13 years, and now it doe=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ron, =
the President of the United States is concerned every day about the safety =
and security of Americans serving our country overseas.&nbsp; And that incl=
udes
 our diplomats.&nbsp; That is always a top priority and at the top of the l=
ist when it comes to making decisions about U.S. policy in countries around=
 the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in the immediate =
aftermath of the ISIL advance across Iraq in 2014, the President&#8217;s pr=
imary concern was about the safety of American diplomats and American perso=

 uncorroborated, and unvetted -- echoing the column that we saw in USA Toda=
y.&nbsp; Does the President concur with that assessment, that analysis of w=
hat&#8217;s in those 28 pages?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

, the President has not read the 28 pages.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been briefed on=
 their contents.&nbsp; And look, I think you can reliably assume that based=
 on the comments
 both of Director Brennan and Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, who d=
on't serve in the Obama administration, that what both of them have describ=
ed is an accurate understanding of the contents of those 28 pages.<o:p></o:=

e forward with its review?&nbsp; It's been more than 14 years -- and you ha=
ve I have talked
 about this -- it just doesn&#8217;t seem like there's any reason not to re=
lease it, based on the fact that you said a number of people have looked at=
 this and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything that would affect nationa=
l security.&nbsp; Maybe a little embarrassing perhaps
 on some circumstances.&nbsp; But again, it's preliminary information.&nbsp=
; It's not hard-and-fast stuff.&nbsp; They're saying that this is partial i=

o defer to the experts who have a day-to-day responsibility for determining=

 without having a negative impact on our interests or our ability to protec=

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

; Last, I want to ask you about the cruise from Miami to Cuba.&nbsp; An his=
toric day not just in South Florida but obviously over on the island.&nbsp;=
 Any thoughts or comments
 on that?&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I hav=
en&#8217;t seen the latest reports on this.&nbsp; Obviously the goal of the=
 President's policy changes towards Cuba was motivated by a desire to begin=
 to normalize
 relations between the United States and Cuba, because the President's assu=
mption is that for 50 years we tried to isolate the Cuban government in the=
 hopes that that would apply pressure to them to do a better job of respect=
ing the basic human rights of the
 Cuban people.&nbsp; That didn&#8217;t work for five decade.&nbsp; That pol=
icy of isolation was carried out with little tangible impact.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the President decided that =
we needed to try a different strategy, and that that this strategy would be=
 focused on engagement -- engagement between the Cuban people and
 American citizens; engagement between the Cuban government and the U.S. go=
vernment; engagement between Cuban businesses and American businesses -- an=
d that by establishing those deeper ties, we would be able to better advanc=
e our interests and our values.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And look, this is a policy cha=
nge that's only been in place for a little over a year at this point.&nbsp;=
 But look, I think we're optimistic about the progress that we have made
 thus far.&nbsp; There certainly is a lot more work to be done, and there's=
 certainly a number of additional reforms we'd like to see the Cuban govern=
ment undertake.&nbsp; But I think it would be hard to deny that this policy=
 change hasn&#8217;t benefitted the American people.&nbsp;
 And look, I think the best proof point for that is to go and ask my counte=
rparts at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau, and ot=
her traditionally Republican-supporting institutions that have been strongl=
y supportive of this President's
 change of policy towards Cuba.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; A=
t the risk of free publicity, this is the blogpost from Jonathan Capehart a=
t The Washington Post.&nbsp; But in here he included the end of Mr. Wilmore=
's remarks,
 and he said -- this is Mr. Wilmore here -- he said, &quot;A black man was =
thought by his mere color not good enough to lead a football team.&nbsp; An=
d now to live in your time, Mr. President, when a black man can lead the fr=
ee world, words alone do me no justice.&quot;&nbsp;
 That is an authentic expression of his personal viewpoint, and it's an aut=
hentic expression of his appreciation for the President of the United State=
s, but also for the capacity of this country to change.&nbsp; And the Presi=
dent has observed that progress on a
 number of occasions, and Mr. Wilmore was doing the same.<o:p></o:p></span>=

&#8217;t really expect to be on this subject so soon, but while we're on it=
 -- some of the jokes that the President made about Hillary Clinton kind of=
 got a mixed
 reaction.&nbsp; Some people think that they were harsher than expected.&nb=

 is.&nbsp; Again, look the President was making a joke and acknowledging th=

 the White House Correspondents' Dinner

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=

've been through this, and the President had an opportunity to just recentl=

 come after
 the release of those pages, is there any expectation that this will affect=

nk it&#8217;s difficult to anticipate exactly what the reaction will be if =
that decision is made.&nbsp; So I sort of hesitate to hazard a guess that's=
 rooted
 in a hypothetical here.&nbsp; But the one thing I think I would point out =
is simply that the President did have an opportunity to meet with King Salm=
an for about two hours in Riyadh shortly after we arrived in Saudi Arabia a=
 week ago last Wednesday.&nbsp;

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They met for two hours, and th=
is question about the 28 pages did not come up in their meeting.&nbsp; I as=
sure you they covered a wide variety of topics, but this was not one of
 them.&nbsp; So I think that would be at least one indication that this is =
not an issue that rates at the same level of some of the other challenges t=
hat are plaguing the Middle East right now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 -- either to change
 minds now, or change voters&#8217; minds later -- but given that at this p=
oint, with the public pressure that you've tried to apply, that outside gro=
ups have tried to apply, do you feel like the public outrage isn&#8217;t ne=
cessarily there when you see that very few Republican
 senators&#8217; minds have changed at this point?&nbsp; And does that tell=
 you that possibly the public outrage won&#8217;t be there to change anythi=

 the fact that no Republican minds have changed at this point, does that te=

;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I thi=
nk a lot of Republican minds across the country have concluded that Republi=
can senators who are refusing to do their job just because Mitch McConnell
 asked them to I think is an indication that we are making some progress.&n=
bsp; There are at least two Republican senators that have come out in suppo=
rt of Chief Judge Garland getting a hearing and a vote.&nbsp; There&#8217;s=
 at least one high-profile Senate candidate in the
 state of Florida that has come out and indicated that Chief Judge Garland =
deserves a vote.&nbsp; There are some former Republican senators -- people =
like Dick Lugar and Tom Coburn -- who have come out and indicated that they=
 believe that Chief Judge Garland deserves
 a hearing and a vote.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoPlainText"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot=
;Courier New&quot;">I don't know if those people changed their minds, or if=
 this is the view that they had all along.&nbsp; But there is plenty of evi=
dence to indicate that there are plenty of Republicans
 who agree with the case that President Obama has made, which is that Repub=
licans should not for the first time since 1875 deny a Supreme Court nomine=
e a hearing and a vote.&nbsp; That would be an unprecedented escalation of =
partisan politics into a Supreme Court
 process that has historically been shielded from a lot of partisan stray v=
oltage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 that have polluted this process in the past.&nbsp; The President has ackno=

 But there&#8217;s
 also no denying that it is Republicans in this instance that they're escal=
ating this partisanship in a way that's not good for the country.&nbsp; And=
 it certainly is not fair to a distinguished public servant like Chief Judg=

 experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history.<o:p><=

 submitted designs related to his presidential library.&nbsp; But this is a=
 process
 that's been administered by the foundation.&nbsp; So I&#8217;d refer you t=

;Courier New&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; It&#8217;s =
my understanding -- you should check with the Department of Defense on this=
 -- I know that even as the Chinese made that announcement, there actually =
was
 a U.S. naval vessel that had made a port of call in Hong Kong.&nbsp; So it=
 does not appear to be a significant change in policy that they're administ=
ering.&nbsp; But obviously the Stennis carrier group has made a port of cal=
l in Hong Kong before.&nbsp; But I can't speak
 to what the Chinese government may have had in mind by denying this reques=
t.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
