THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release May 4, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

AFTER MEETING WITH FEDERAL RESPONDERS ON THE FLINT, MICHIGAN WATER CRISIS=




Food Bank of Eastern Michigan

Flint, Michigan





1:46 P.M. EDT



 THE PRESIDENT: Well, I just had the opportunity to meet with the federal=
 responders who have been on the ground here in Flint, joined by Governor=
 Rick Snyder and Mayor Karen Weaver. And our discussion underscored how i=
mportant it was for us to mount a whole-of-government effort across agenc=
ies and across levels of government to meet one core mission, and that is=
 make sure that the people of Flint are healthy; that they've got safe wa=
ter to drink and to use; that we are ensuring that we have a plan for the=
 system to work over the long term; and that we are certain that our kids=
 here in Flint are going to be able to take advantage of their talents an=
d opportunities well into the future.



 So we've got a short-term challenge, which is water, but we've also got =
a long-term challenge, which is making sure that the city of Flint can pr=
osper going forward.



 I want to thank everybody whos participating. Everybody here has been wo=
rking hard on the ground for months now to respond to this crisis. It's a=
n all-hands-on-deck approach. And just to give you some examples of the w=
ork that's being done -- FEMA is expanding access to water and filters by=
 providing water commodities to the state of Michigan. The EPA has been a=
ctively testing and monitoring the city's water, and is providing technic=
al assistance to the city to make sure that the water distribution system=
 is safe again. The CDC is investigating concerns that we've heard from p=
eople about health symptoms that may have been connected to the water.=20=




 Some good news -- we're hoping that if it hasnt already happened, that i=
t's going to happen shortly, that legislation is being passed by the stat=
e of Michigan that allows the federal government, in partnership with the=
 state, to expand access to Medicaid and provide additional services to i=
ndividuals under 21. So making sure that our kids are covered and have th=
ese additional services, as well as pregnant women. And I want to thank t=
he state of Michigan, working with us, to develop that plan.



 Thanks to the USDA, and Debbie Stabenow has been outstanding in guiding =
this. And obviously the rest of the Michigan congressional delegation hav=
e worked hard on this, as well. USDA is making sure that infants get the =
formula that they need and that children are getting access to healthy fo=
od.=20



 There are a couple of things that I want to address to the press directl=
y. I'm going to have a chance after this meeting to meet with a number of=
 Flint families so that they can address directly to me their fears and c=
oncerns, as well as their hopes, and then I'll have a chance to speak to =
a larger audience after that. But a couple of things that I want to focus=
 on right now. Number one is that it is really important, particularly wi=
th this expansion of Medicaid, that any parent in the city of Flint takes=
 the time to check to make sure that their kids arent affected, that they=
 dont have elevated lead levels. And I know that that can be hard. Someti=
mes folks have difficulty accessing the system. One of the things that we=
 spent a lot of time talking about is how do we make sure that there is e=
nough community outreach so that people know that there are doctors out t=
here and health providers who will see their children.=20



But I want everybody in the city of Flint to just know that you should ha=
ve your child checked -- because although lead poisoning or lead impacts =
can be serious, what is also true is that there are a lot of ways to addr=
ess whatever concerns are raised and to make sure that those kids are hea=
lthy and are thriving. So the key is to know, like any other situation wh=
ere your kid might get sick or have some sort of environmental impact, yo=
u got to know what's going on and then take the steps that are needed to =
make sure that they get the treatment or the help that they need. And if =
you dont know, then that could end up leading to problems.



So we're really going to emphasize parents accessing the expanded health =
care providers that are going to be available here in the city of Flint. =
That's point number one.



Point number two. I know that there is a lot of suspicion about whether o=
r not the water coming out of people's taps in their homes are safe, or w=
hether they are still contaminated and still a problem. And I want to emp=
hasize that the EPA has looked at this very carefully, and they are very =
confident that if you use a filter, then it is safe for kids over six. We=
're still, out of an abundance of caution, recommending bottled water for=
 children who are under the age of six, or pregnant women. But if you're =
over six, then, in fact, filtered water is safe and it works. And that's =
not just the opinion of federal agencies. A lot of independent studies ha=
ve been done to confirm that the water is safe.



So, working with the state and the city, filters are now available for ev=
erybody in this city. And the key is for people to go ahead and access th=
em and use them. And I'm going to emphasize this when I'm speaking to the=
 larger audience: I understand why people might be mistrustful and concer=
ned. But right now, it is safe for you to install a filter in your home, =
or to use a standalone filter and to go ahead and drink that water. But y=
ou got to use it. And it's available to you -- for free. But people have =
to have confidence that will work.



That doesnt mean that we still dont have to replace a number of the pipes=
 in this city. And the mayor is working hard on a plan to fast-track gett=
ing pipe replacement. The governor is budgeting dollars to expand that pr=
ogram. And the congressional delegation of Michigan is working hard so th=
at we get additional funds to help replace those pipes that pose a threat=
. But that may be a long-term process. It may take a year. It may take tw=
o years. It might take more to get all the pipes replaced. And in the mea=
ntime, folks have to be able to use water. So trust that the tests have b=
een done and the filter system works.=20



Third point. In order for us to clean out the system, to flush out the co=
ntaminants, and to have confidence that, as we fix the system, its actual=
ly going to be safe for all the households in Flint, we need everybody in=
 Flint to start helping us flush out that system. And so I guess theres a=
 program called Flush For Flint. Its not the most elegant name. (Laughter=
.) But the concept is pretty simple if you think about it, and that is we=
 need everybody to turn on their tap in the kitchen, in the tub for five =
minutes a day so that the water is running and whatever contaminants are =
sitting in there start getting pushed out.=20



And what that allows us to do is then to go back after some water has bee=
n running and the flushing has taken place, then the EPA can go back and =
test some more and see, all right, where are the levels now? How are we d=
oing in terms of coating the pipes? What steps being taken -- are they be=
ing effective or do additional steps need to be taken? But were not going=
 to know that if people just let the water sit there.=20



Now, I understand if people are scared and theyre not using their water, =
that they may wonder why is it up to me to be part of this process of fix=
ing it. But the bottom line is, is if youre not doing your part, then the=
se outstanding folks around the table who want to help cant do theirs.



So Im urging everybody in Flint to participate in this flushing program. =
Again, its a matter of turning on your tap in the kitchen, in the bathroo=
m, five minutes a day, just to get that water flowing, getting some of th=
e contaminants out. It will then be retested after that.=20



Now, these are all short-term issues. And one of the things that we all e=
mphasized here is that the city of Flint had suffered from some hard time=
s and neglect long before this particular crisis. And what Im encouraged =
by is I think a recognition at every level of government that we have to =
take what has been a crisis and see if we can turn this into an opportuni=
ty to rebuild Flint even better than before.



The problems of water were a symptom of a broader issue, and that is a ci=
ty that had lost a lot of resources, lost a lot of its tax base, was cutt=
ing a lot of services, and increasingly, didnt have capacity. And so our =
goal here is to use this moment in which everybodys attention is focused =
to see if we can start rebuilding and moving Flint in a better direction.=




Im confident that we can do that if were all working together. And I emph=
asized to the governor and I emphasized to the mayor that my job here tod=
ay is not to sort through all the ins and outs of how we got to where we =
are, but rather to make sure that all of us are focused on what we need t=
o do moving forward on behalf of the children of Flint. Thats my priority=
. And thats got to be all of our priorities.=20



And there are times for politics and there are times for turf battles -- =
this is not one of those times. This is where everybody locks arms and is=
 focused on getting the job done. And Im very proud of the team -- Gina M=
cCarthy at the EPA, Secretary Burwell at Health and Human Services, and e=
verybody who is represented around this table. Thats their commitment, an=
d thats their order from me. And Dr. Lurie, whos been heading up the fede=
ral response, I think has been doing a great job in coordination here.



But all of us are going to have to really keep our eye on the ball, even =
when the cameras go away. Thats what we owe to the people of Flint, and t=
hats what we owe to their kids.



Last point. I think people are understandably scared when they hear that =
their child may have ingested some lead, it may have gotten into their sy=
stem, and that that may have some long-term impacts or create particular =
challenges for kids. But it is really important for all of us to remember=
 that kids are resilient. And every kid in Flint is special, and has capa=
city, and can do great things. And the fact that they may have had some d=
rinking water that was contaminated doesnt automatically mean somehow tha=
t theyre going to have huge problems or that theyre not going to be able =
to reach that potential.



And so for the parents who are out there, I want to emphasize: Get your c=
hild checked, but be confident that your child can thrive and will be fin=
e as long as you know what they need, and know how to access the resource=
s that they need. Its useful to remember, just to keep things in perspect=
ive, that the laws banning lead paint in homes and reducing the lead that=
 was in our environment, those laws really were put in place just a gener=
ation ago.=20



When I was five or six or seven, a lot of homes still had lead paint in i=
t. I might have ingested some lead paint when I was two or three years ol=
d, because at the time, people didnt know it. So weve got an entire coupl=
e of generations of Americans who have done really well despite the fact =
that they may have had something that is not optimal. And how lead intera=
cts with any particular child is going to be different, and what each chi=
ld needs is going to be different. And some kids are going to be fine, an=
d theyre not going to be affected. Some kids may have more of an -- it mi=
ght have more of an effect.=20



But the bottom line is, is that we now know what to do. We know how to mi=
tigate these effects. But parents and communities have to be proactive in=
 order to assure that were doing the right thing by our kids. We cant jus=
t sit back and feel panicked and feel scared. Those emotions are understa=
ndable. But if we want to make sure that our kids are properly taken care=
 of, then weve got to be proactive and get out ahead of this thing.



All right? Thank you again, everybody, for the great work that you guys h=
ave done. Thank you, press. I will see you again in the larger rally.



Q  Try the water?



THE PRESIDENT: Generally I dont do stunts, but here you go. (Takes a sip =
of water.) Now, this had a filter on it. The water around this table was =
Flint water that was filtered. And it just confirms what we know scientif=
ically, which is that if youre using a filter, if youre installing it, th=
en Flint water at this point is drinkable. That does not -- I want to rep=
eat -- negate the need for us to go ahead and replace some of these pipes=
, because ultimately you want a system in which you dont have to put a fi=
lter on it in order to be assured that its safe.



But as a short-term measure, this is the right thing to do. And, frankly,=
 its going to be a lot more convenient than people traveling long distanc=
es to try to lug back a bunch of bottled water. All right?=20



Thank you guys.=20

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, =
I just had the opportunity to meet with the federal responders who have bee=
n on the ground here in Flint, joined by Governor Rick Snyder and Mayor Kar=
en Weaver.&nbsp; And our discussion underscored how important it
 was for us to mount a whole-of-government effort across agencies and acros=
s levels of government to meet one core mission, and that is make sure that=
 the people of Flint are healthy; that they've got safe water to drink and =
to use; that we are ensuring that
 we have a plan for the system to work over the long term; and that we are =
certain that our kids here in Flint are going to be able to take advantage =
of their talents and opportunities well into the future.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we've got a short-term c=
hallenge, which is water, but we've also got a long-term challenge, which i=
s making sure that the city of Flint can prosper going forward.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to thank everybody w=
ho&#8217;s participating.&nbsp; Everybody here has been working hard on the=
 ground for months now to respond to this crisis.&nbsp; It's an all-hands-o=
n-deck approach.&nbsp; And just to give you some examples of the work that'=
s
 being done -- FEMA is expanding access to water and filters by providing w=
ater commodities to the state of Michigan.&nbsp; The EPA has been actively =
testing and monitoring the city's water, and is providing technical assista=
nce to the city to make sure that the
 water distribution system is safe again.&nbsp; The CDC is investigating co=
ncerns that we've heard from people about health symptoms that may have bee=
n connected to the water.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some good news -- we're hop=
ing that if it hasn&#8217;t already happened, that it's going to happen sho=
rtly, that legislation is being passed by the state of Michigan that allows=
 the federal government, in partnership with the state, to expand
 access to Medicaid and provide additional services to individuals under 21=
.&nbsp; So making sure that our kids are covered and have these additional =
services, as well as pregnant women.&nbsp; And I want to thank the state of=
 Michigan, working with us, to develop that
 plan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to the USDA, and Deb=
bie Stabenow has been outstanding in guiding this.&nbsp; And obviously the =
rest of the Michigan congressional delegation have worked hard on this, as =
well.&nbsp; USDA is making sure that infants get the formula that
 they need and that children are getting access to healthy food.&nbsp; <o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a couple of thing=
s that I want to address to the press directly.&nbsp; I'm going to have a c=
hance after this meeting to meet with a number of Flint families so that th=
ey can address directly to me their fears and concerns, as
 well as their hopes, and then I'll have a chance to speak to a larger audi=
ence after that.&nbsp; But a couple of things that I want to focus on right=
 now.&nbsp; Number one is that it is really important, particularly with th=
is expansion of Medicaid, that any parent
 in the city of Flint takes the time to check to make sure that their kids =
aren&#8217;t affected, that they don&#8217;t have elevated lead levels.&nbs=
p; And I know that that can be hard.&nbsp; Sometimes folks have difficulty =
accessing the system.&nbsp; One of the things that we spent
 a lot of time talking about is how do we make sure that there is enough co=
mmunity outreach so that people know that there are doctors out there and h=
ealth providers who will see their children.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But I want everybody in t=
he city of Flint to just know that you should have your child checked -- be=
cause although lead poisoning or lead impacts can be serious, what is also =
true is that there are a lot of ways
 to address whatever concerns are raised and to make sure that those kids a=
re healthy and are thriving.&nbsp; So the key is to know, like any other si=
tuation where your kid might get sick or have some sort of environmental im=
pact, you got to know what's going on
 and then take the steps that are needed to make sure that they get the tre=
atment or the help that they need.&nbsp; And if you don&#8217;t know, then =
that could end up leading to problems.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we're really going to =
emphasize parents accessing the expanded health care providers that are goi=
ng to be available here in the city of Flint.&nbsp; That's point number one=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Point number two.&nbsp; I=
 know that there is a lot of suspicion about whether or not the water comin=
g out of people's taps in their homes are safe, or whether they are still c=
ontaminated and still a problem.&nbsp; And I want
 to emphasize that the EPA has looked at this very carefully, and they are =
very confident that if you use a filter, then it is safe for kids over six.=
&nbsp; We're still, out of an abundance of caution, recommending bottled wa=
ter for children who are under the age
 of six, or pregnant women.&nbsp; But if you're over six, then, in fact, fi=
ltered water is safe and it works.&nbsp; And that's not just the opinion of=
 federal agencies.&nbsp; A lot of independent studies have been done to con=
firm that the water is safe.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, working with the stat=
e and the city, filters are now available for everybody in this city.&nbsp;=
 And the key is for people to go ahead and access them and use them.&nbsp; =
And I'm going to emphasize this when I'm speaking
 to the larger audience:&nbsp; I understand why people might be mistrustful=
 and concerned.&nbsp; But right now, it is safe for you to install a filter=
 in your home, or to use a standalone filter and to go ahead and drink that=
 water.&nbsp; But you got to use it.&nbsp; And it's
 available to you -- for free.&nbsp; But people have to have confidence tha=
t will work.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That doesn&#8217;t mean t=
hat we still don&#8217;t have to replace a number of the pipes in this city=
.&nbsp; And the mayor is working hard on a plan to fast-track getting pipe =
replacement.&nbsp; The governor is budgeting dollars to expand
 that program.&nbsp; And the congressional delegation of Michigan is workin=
g hard so that we get additional funds to help replace those pipes that pos=
e a threat.&nbsp; But that may be a long-term process.&nbsp; It may take a =
year.&nbsp; It may take two years.&nbsp; It might take more
 to get all the pipes replaced.&nbsp; And in the meantime, folks have to be=
 able to use water.&nbsp; So trust that the tests have been done and the fi=
lter system works.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Third point.&nbsp; In ord=
er for us to clean out the system, to flush out the contaminants, and to ha=
ve confidence that, as we fix the system, it&#8217;s actually going to be s=
afe for all the households in Flint, we need everybody
 in Flint to start helping us flush out that system.&nbsp; And so I guess t=
here&#8217;s a program called Flush For Flint.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not the mos=
t elegant name.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But the concept is pretty simple if=
 you think about it, and that is we need everybody to turn on their
 tap in the kitchen, in the tub for five minutes a day so that the water is=
 running and whatever contaminants are sitting in there start getting pushe=
d out.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And what that allows us t=
o do is then to go back after some water has been running and the flushing =
has taken place, then the EPA can go back and test some more and see, all r=
ight, where are the levels now?&nbsp; How
 are we doing in terms of coating the pipes?&nbsp; What steps being taken -=
- are they being effective or do additional steps need to be taken?&nbsp; B=
ut we&#8217;re not going to know that if people just let the water sit ther=
e.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, I understand if peop=
le are scared and they&#8217;re not using their water, that they may wonder=
 why is it up to me to be part of this process of fixing it.&nbsp; But the =
bottom line is, is if you&#8217;re not doing your part,
 then these outstanding folks around the table who want to help can&#8217;t=
 do theirs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I&#8217;m urging every=
body in Flint to participate in this flushing program.&nbsp; Again, it&#821=
7;s a matter of turning on your tap in the kitchen, in the bathroom, five m=
inutes a day, just to get that water flowing, getting
 some of the contaminants out.&nbsp; It will then be retested after that.&n=
bsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, these are all short-=
term issues.&nbsp; And one of the things that we all emphasized here is tha=
t the city of Flint had suffered from some hard times and neglect long befo=
re this particular crisis.&nbsp; And what I&#8217;m
 encouraged by is I think a recognition at every level of government that w=
e have to take what has been a crisis and see if we can turn this into an o=
pportunity to rebuild Flint even better than before.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The problems of water wer=
e a symptom of a broader issue, and that is a city that had lost a lot of r=
esources, lost a lot of its tax base, was cutting a lot of services, and in=
creasingly, didn&#8217;t have capacity.&nbsp; And
 so our goal here is to use this moment in which everybody&#8217;s attentio=
n is focused to see if we can start rebuilding and moving Flint in a better=
 direction.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I&#8217;m confident that =
we can do that if we&#8217;re all working together.&nbsp; And I emphasized =
to the governor and I emphasized to the mayor that my job here today is not=
 to sort through all the ins and outs of how we got to
 where we are, but rather to make sure that all of us are focused on what w=
e need to do moving forward on behalf of the children of Flint.&nbsp; That&=
#8217;s my priority.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s got to be all of our priorities=
.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And there are times for p=
olitics and there are times for turf battles -- this is not one of those ti=
mes.&nbsp; This is where everybody locks arms and is focused on getting the=
 job done.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m very proud of the team
 -- Gina McCarthy at the EPA, Secretary Burwell at Health and Human Service=
s, and everybody who is represented around this table.&nbsp; That&#8217;s t=
heir commitment, and that&#8217;s their order from me.&nbsp; And Dr. Lurie,=
 who&#8217;s been heading up the federal response, I think has
 been doing a great job in coordination here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But all of us are going t=
o have to really keep our eye on the ball, even when the cameras go away.&n=
bsp; That&#8217;s what we owe to the people of Flint, and that&#8217;s what=
 we owe to their kids.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Last point.&nbsp; I think=
 people are understandably scared when they hear that their child may have =
ingested some lead, it may have gotten into their system, and that that may=
 have some long-term impacts or create particular
 challenges for kids.&nbsp; But it is really important for all of us to rem=
ember that kids are resilient.&nbsp; And every kid in Flint is special, and=
 has capacity, and can do great things.&nbsp; And the fact that they may ha=
ve had some drinking water that was contaminated
 doesn&#8217;t automatically mean somehow that they&#8217;re going to have =
huge problems or that they&#8217;re not going to be able to reach that pote=
ntial.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so for the parents wh=
o are out there, I want to emphasize:&nbsp; Get your child checked, but be =
confident that your child can thrive and will be fine as long as you know w=
hat they need, and know how to access the
 resources that they need.&nbsp; It&#8217;s useful to remember, just to kee=
p things in perspective, that the laws banning lead paint in homes and redu=
cing the lead that was in our environment, those laws really were put in pl=
ace just a generation ago.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">When I was five or six or=
 seven, a lot of homes still had lead paint in it.&nbsp; I might have inges=
ted some lead paint when I was two or three years old, because at the time,=
 people didn&#8217;t know it.&nbsp; So we&#8217;ve got an
 entire couple of generations of Americans who have done really well despit=
e the fact that they may have had something that is not optimal.&nbsp; And =
how lead interacts with any particular child is going to be different, and =
what each child needs is going to be
 different.&nbsp; And some kids are going to be fine, and they&#8217;re not=
 going to be affected.&nbsp; Some kids may have more of an -- it might have=
 more of an effect.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But the bottom line is, i=
s that we now know what to do.&nbsp; We know how to mitigate these effects.=
&nbsp; But parents and communities have to be proactive in order to assure =
that we&#8217;re doing the right thing by our kids.&nbsp;
 We can&#8217;t just sit back and feel panicked and feel scared.&nbsp; Thos=
e emotions are understandable.&nbsp; But if we want to make sure that our k=
ids are properly taken care of, then we&#8217;ve got to be proactive and ge=
t out ahead of this thing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All right?&nbsp; Thank yo=
u again, everybody, for the great work that you guys have done.&nbsp; Thank=
 you, press.&nbsp; I will see you again in the larger rally.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp=
; Try the water?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Gene=
rally I don&#8217;t do stunts, but here you go.&nbsp; (Takes a sip of water=
.)&nbsp; Now, this had a filter on it.&nbsp; The water around this table wa=
s Flint water that was filtered.&nbsp; And it just confirms what we
 know scientifically, which is that if you&#8217;re using a filter, if you&=
#8217;re installing it, then Flint water at this point is drinkable.&nbsp; =
That does not -- I want to repeat -- negate the need for us to go ahead and=
 replace some of these pipes, because ultimately
 you want a system in which you don&#8217;t have to put a filter on it in o=
rder to be assured that it&#8217;s safe.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But as a short-term measu=
re, this is the right thing to do.&nbsp; And, frankly, it&#8217;s going to =
be a lot more convenient than people traveling long distances to try to lug=
 back a bunch of bottled water.&nbsp; All right?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
