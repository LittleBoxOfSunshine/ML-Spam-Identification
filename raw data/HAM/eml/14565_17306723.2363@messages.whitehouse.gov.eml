_________________________________________________________________

 For Immediate Release May 20, 2016





REMARKS BY THE FIRST LADY

AT PARTNERSHIP FOR A HEALTHIER AMERICAS

BUILDING A HEALTHIER AMERICA SUMMIT=20



Renaissance Hotel

Washington, D.C.





11:48 A.M. EDT



 MRS. OBAMA: Well, hello! (Applause.) All right, this is a fired-up, read=
y-to-go crowd, right? Absolutely. (Applause.) You all, thank you so much!=
 Rest yourselves, because I hear youve been working all year. (Laughter.)=
=20



To say it is a pleasure and an honor to be here with you today is an unde=
rstatement. I am so thrilled and so proud. And I want to start by thankin=
g Jim, not just for that generous introduction but for his tremendous lea=
dership. He has been amazing. I just got through talking to the board jus=
t telling them that I couldnt be more proud of the folks who helped to st=
art this thing.=20



And I would have to thank Larry Soler as well for his longstanding servic=
e and dedication to the PHA, and all the original board members and the f=
olks who came on board. I just want to take a moment to give them all a r=
ound of applause, and to congratulate them on their phenomenal accomplish=
ments. (Applause.) **



And of course, to the growing staff, one -- there are more than one. Than=
k you all for doing such great work. Absolutely. (Applause.) And I want t=
o acknowledge our FDA Commissioner, Dr. Robert Califf. And were pleased t=
hat he was able to join us today, so lets give him a round of applause. (=
Applause.)=20



And I want to recognize all the folks who have made such outstanding comm=
itments this year to raising a healthier generation, including Westin, an=
d Trinity Health, and Dicks Sporting Goods, and so many others. I got to =
meet many of them backstage. Thank you. Thank you all for becoming a part=
 of this team. Congratulations on your commitments. (Applause.)=20



Finally, most of all, I want to thank all of you here. For years, even de=
cades - long before childhood obesity was ever in the headlines - so many=
 of you were leading the charge. I spoke to a woman who said shes been wo=
rking on this issue for 16 years -- leading that charge, creating program=
s, lobbying for policies, reformulating products, and doing everything yo=
u could to raise awareness about this issue.=20



And since we first launched Lets Move!, PHA has brought together partners=
 like you in more than 50,000 locations across all 50 states. And what yo=
u all have achieved in just six years, man, it truly takes my breath away=
. Lets just look at the stats. I know you all have been talking about it,=
 but I want to go over it again. (Laughter.)=20



Because of you, 1.6 million kids are now in healthy daycares, eating more=
 than 225 million healthy snacks and meals a year. Those are our babies. =
Were doing it there. (Applause.) Thirty million kids are eating healthier=
 school breakfasts and lunches. Ten million kids are getting 60 minutes o=
f physical activity at a Lets Move! Active School. Theyre getting that ev=
ery day. Eighty million Americans are living in a Lets Move! City, Town o=
r County with summer meal programs, and athletic leagues, and new parks a=
nd playgrounds. Eight point one million people in underserved areas final=
ly have somewhere to buy groceries, including 1,000 convenience stores th=
at are now selling fresh food. I love that. (Applause.)=20



And PHAs FNV campaign to market fruits and vegetables has gotten 1 billio=
n media impressions in just one year. Yes, thats billion. My husband woul=
d die for those numbers. (Laughter.) And they say that 70 percent of folk=
s who saw the campaign said they ate more produce as a result. So its not=
 just idle hits and views; people are actually being impacted.



And today, I am thrilled to announce another new achievement to add to th=
at list - and its a big one, as far as Im concerned. For the first time i=
n 20 years, the FDA has finalized a new and improved nutrition facts labe=
l that will be on nearly 800,000 food products nationwide. The calorie co=
unt is bigger, bigger font, so you can actually see it. (Laughter.) The s=
erving sizes are more realistic. And, most important of all, this label w=
ill tell you how much sugar in your snack was added during processing, an=
d how much of it comes from ingredients like fruit. (Applause.) So very s=
oon -- very soon -- you will no longer need a microscope, a calculator, o=
r a degree in nutrition to figure out whether the food youre buying is ac=
tually good for our kids. So thats a phenomenal achievement. (Applause.) =
And I want to thank everyone at the FDA who worked to get this over the f=
inish line. I hope you all are proud, because this was not easy to do.



These are extraordinary accomplishments. And as I said at the outset, you=
 all should be proud. Because together, you all are truly transforming th=
e way our kids live and eat. And even more importantly, as many of you kn=
ow from your work on the ground, and contrary to what the naysayers predi=
cted, millions of kids are truly embracing this change.=20



After all that hand-wringing when we first launched Lets Move! about how =
kids are picky eaters, and schools wouldnt be able to prepare more nutrit=
ious meals that students would actually enjoy, and food manufacturers wou=
ldnt make healthy versions of their products that young consumers would p=
refer - remember all that? I do. (Laughter.) Well, after all that, it tur=
ns out that kids are even more excited about this stuff than we are. And =
after six years, its becoming their new normal. Many of them dont know an=
ything else.=20



And let me tell you, I see this everywhere I go. I saw it at the Burke Co=
unty Middle School in rural Georgia. Now, Burke County Schools have a Fre=
sh Fruit and Vegetable Grant Program where they expose their elementary s=
chool kids to over 65 fruits and vegetables. And last year, when some of =
those same students reached middle school, they decided that they wanted =
to plant their own garden. And now, theyre learning math and science less=
ons from that garden. Theyre even writing a cookbook for the food theyve =
grown.



And the day I visited, their lunch menu - which, by the way, like 98 perc=
ent of schools nationwide, now meets our healthier meal standards - (appl=
ause) -- yes, indeed. But they were having for lunch local cabbage that w=
as delicious, collard greens, and sweet potatoes. And let me tell you, th=
ose kids devoured that food. They were practically licking their plates.



Because, look, their school nutrition team has developed creative recipes=
 for vegetables that kids love. Theyve done the work. Theyve also created=
 healthier versions of kids favorite foods, like everything from barbeque=
 chicken sandwiches with fresh sauce on homemade wheat buns -- homemade b=
uns, all of their buns are homemade -- (laughter) -- baked southern chick=
en with a garden fresh vegetable cheese casserole that was really good --=
 they do that instead of mac and cheese. So obviously I tried some of the=
 dishes, and I have to tell you, the food was really good. And you could =
tell that it was prepared by loving hands, because talking to the men and=
 women who worked in those kitchens, it was important for them to do righ=
t by the kids and make that food taste good. Thats the kind of healthy fo=
od these kids are now used to eating every day.=20



Kids in urban settings are also embracing this change. I saw it just last=
 month at the Phillips Academy Charter School in Newark, New Jersey. Now,=
 this is an inner-city school where the kids were bursting with excitemen=
t as they showed me the garden they had planted on the rooftop of the sch=
ool, right in a very urban setting. That garden was their pride and joy. =
They were showing off their little composting thing. They had their nice =
little dresses on and they were rolling that pen. (Laughter.) Oh, they we=
re so cute. The eighth graders there had been harvesting and eating those=
 vegetables since first grade. So you see, were starting to see the growt=
h of these kids who started there.=20



But after spending time with the kids, pulling worms out of their compost=
 heap -- that was a great shot for the cameras -- (laughter) -- we shared=
 a snack -- and this was their regular snack -- of quinoa protein bars --=
 handmade, homemade -- with beet smoothies, which, by the way, all those =
kids gulped down. I wasnt even that keen on the beet smoothie, but they w=
ere like, just try it, youll like it, youll get used to it. (Laughter.) B=
ut this is the kind of food they were eating every day for most of their =
elementary school years. So they were used to it. This was their normal.



Thats the kind of transformation were seeing in kids all across this coun=
try. Theyre learning through first-hand experience that healthy food can =
be fun and delicious. And theyre making the connection between what they =
eat and how they feel. In fact, just last week, Im sure many of you saw t=
he New York Times article about how when schools start teaching students =
- particularly their athletes - about nutrition, kids actually start chan=
ging their behavior. And in this article, one young man said he went from=
 eating ice cream and soda every day to having grilled chicken salads and=
 fish because he now understands that his nutrition affects his performan=
ce on the playing field.=20

So when we talk about raising a healthier generation, this is what we mea=
n. And its happening before our very eyes. Because today, from the time o=
ur kids are barely old enough to talk, so many of them are hearing a new =
set of messages and being exposed to a new set of options around healthy =
eating. And they are internalizing those messages. They are owning and lo=
ving those choices. And as a result, theyre developing a set of habits an=
d preferences that will set them on a healthy path for the rest of their =
lives.



And while its incredibly exciting that weve had this kind of impact, its =
also not all that surprising. Because heres the thing -- ultimately, our =
children are a reflection of our investment in them, plain and simple. So=
 if we refuse to put in the effort to provide nutritious food for our kid=
s, they will reflect that back in poor health and life outcomes. But if w=
e stand up for whats best for them, if we demand better choices for them =
and get then excited about those choices, then they will absolutely follo=
w our lead. And then our culture will shift in response to those choices.=




And I really want to emphasize that last point about culture change. See,=
 its no accident that fast-food places are now serving apples and skim mi=
lk in their kids meals, or that food and beverage companies -- including =
many in the room here today -- have cut 6.4 trillion calories from their =
products and are racing to stock grocery shelves with healthier options. =
These companies are simply responding to rapidly changing consumer demand=
s. And that change is happening more quickly than we could have ever imag=
ined.=20



I mean, just think about it. If six years ago, someone had told you that =
Fenway Park would have a 5,000 square foot farm on their rooftop to provi=
de fresh produce for their fans -- (applause) -- or that 50 million Ameri=
cans would visit a government website called MyPlate to learn about healt=
hy eating, or that sales of kale would jump 50 percent in just four years=
 -- (laughter and applause) -- or that the first unanimously chosen NBA M=
VP, Steph Curry, would choose fruits, vegetables, and water as his primar=
y product endorsements - (applause) -- if someone had told you all that s=
ix years ago, you would have thought they had were out of their minds. Bu=
t thats the kind of meaningful, tangible change that were seeing througho=
ut the country.



And I want to be very clear: You all did this, not me. I might have added=
 a little sparkle or publicity -- (laughter) -- but you all did the work.=
 You did the work. You made the commitments. You stepped up.=20



So the truth is, is that it actually doesnt matter where Im sitting eight=
 months from now. What matters is that we all keep standing together on b=
ehalf of our kids. Thats what matters. (Applause.) Because while you all =
might have felt more empowered these last six years because someone in th=
e White House was excited about this issue, the real power lies with all =
of the parents and consumers, all the partners - and, most importantly, a=
ll these kids that you all have helped to inspire.



And while next year I will no longer be First Lady, I just want you to kn=
ow that I will always be here as a partner in this effort -- always. (App=
lause.)=20



So Im not here today to give a victory speech, and these certainly arent =
my closing remarks on this issue -- just the opposite. I was passionate a=
bout this issue long before I became First Lady, and I plan to work on it=
 long after I leave the White House. Because as far as Im concerned, ever=
ything weve done before today was simply phase one of our work together. =
That was phase one. (Applause.) And while we have accomplished a lot, we =
are just getting started.



Yes, its true that childhood obesity rates have stopped rising for the fi=
rst time in decades. Yes, its true that rates are dropping for our younge=
st kids. But during this first phase, we havent yet achieved the ultimate=
 change we seek, which is to end our epidemic of childhood obesity once a=
nd for all. Instead, what weve done is been laying the groundwork for tha=
t change.



Weve been finding innovative and inspirational new ways to raise awarenes=
s and create new products and build new programs and policies. And if we =
truly want to achieve our goal, were going to need to continue and scale =
up these efforts, and we need to give them time to actually have their in=
tended impact.



We also need to be thinking about the new voices, the champions, the new =
ideas we can bring to this work. Whos our next Steph Curry? Whats the nex=
t FNV or Drink Up campaign? We got to keep it moving. (Laughter.) In this=
 next phase, were going to need to get even more creative, even more inno=
vative. Weve got to find new ways to reach these kids in ways they will h=
ear it.=20



And were also going to need some patience, real patience, and a whole lot=
 of perseverance. Because as you all know, this is not a trendy issue of =
the month or even an issue of the year. This is a generational problem. I=
t took us decades to get here, and its going to take us years to climb ou=
r way back. And the only way we can do that is by continuing to focus on =
one thing and one thing only, and that is doing whats best for our kids.



See, if that is our North Star that guides everything we do, if we focus =
not just on our profit margins but on how our products affect our kids he=
alth, if we realize that investments in P.E. and recess and nutritious sc=
hool food are absolutely essential to ensure the success of all of our ki=
ds, if we keep pushing our kids at home just to eat their veggies every n=
ight, then we can absolutely reach our goal of raising a healthier genera=
tion.=20



So when we encounter folks with an agenda that doesnt include our kids he=
alth, we cant get tired. We cant get frustrated. We cant give up. Because=
 we know that those folks arent our biggest obstacle. Our biggest obstacl=
e is our own complacency.=20



And when one in three kids in this country is still overweight or obese; =
when were spending billions of dollars treating obesity-related condition=
s; when four-star generals are sounding the alarm on this issue because t=
hey are struggling to recruit young people who can meet the fitness stand=
ards of our military -- then the stakes are far too high to back down eve=
n for a single second.



So let me end with a quote from Donna Martin. Donna is the Director of th=
e School Nutrition Program for the Burke County Public School System that=
 I talked about earlier. In a blog post that she wrote after my visit, sh=
e says: This is our chance to help mold the future that our children will=
 endure for the rest of their lives. It goes without saying that regardle=
ss of political stance, personal or religious beliefs, that is a statemen=
t that we can all believe in.



And I couldnt agree more. And thats why Im in this, and Im in this for li=
fe. Im in this until we fix this.=20



So today, I want to ask all of you: Are you in this with me? (Applause.) =
Whats that? Are you all in this? (Applause.) Wait, wait, come on, PHA Sum=
mit, are you guys in? Are you ready for this fight? Are you ready to keep=
 adding commitments and building on this success? (Applause.) Because Im =
in. I am so far in. We have gotten so much done. (Applause.)=20



I am so glad to hear that, because we have a lot of work ahead of us, but=
 if we keep coming together and digging deep, and making real investments=
 in our kids health, then I know we can solve this problem. Were on our w=
ay. I know we can give every child in this country the bright future that=
 we know they deserve. I am so grateful to you all. Congratulations for e=
verything you have done and what you will continue to do. Lets roll up ou=
r sleeves and keep it going.=20



Thank you all so much. God bless. (Applause.)=20



 END 12:09 P.M. EDT

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=3D"_GoBack"></a>MRS=
. OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, hello!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; All right, this is a fi=
red-up, ready-to-go crowd, right?&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp=
;You all, thank you so much!&nbsp; Rest yourselves, because I hear you=92ve=
 been working all
 year.&nbsp; (Laughter.) <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">To say it is a pleasure a=
nd an honor to be here with you today is an understatement.&nbsp; I am so t=
hrilled and so proud.&nbsp; And I want to start by thanking Jim, not just f=
or that generous introduction but for his tremendous
 leadership.&nbsp; He has been amazing.&nbsp; I just got through talking to=
 the board just telling them that I couldn=92t be more proud of the folks w=
ho helped to start this thing.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I would have to thank=
 Larry Soler as well for his longstanding service and dedication to the PHA=
, and all the original board members and the folks who came on board.&nbsp;=
 I just want to take a moment to give them
 all a round of applause, and to congratulate them on their phenomenal acco=
mplishments.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And of course, to the gro=
wing staff, one -- there are more than one.&nbsp; Thank you all for doing s=
uch great work.&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I want to ack=
nowledge our FDA Commissioner, Dr. Robert Califf.&nbsp; And we=92re
 pleased that he was able to join us today, so let=92s give him a round of =
applause.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I want to recognize a=
ll the folks who have made such outstanding commitments this year to raisin=
g a healthier generation, including Westin, and Trinity Health, and Dick=92=
s Sporting Goods, and so many others.&nbsp;
 I got to meet many of them backstage.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you all=
 for becoming a part of this team.&nbsp; Congratulations on your commitment=
s.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Finally, most of all, I w=
ant to thank all of you here.&nbsp; For years, even decades -=96 long befor=
e childhood obesity was ever in the headlines =96- so many of you were lead=
ing the charge.&nbsp; I spoke to a woman who said
 she=92s been working on this issue for 16 years -- leading that charge, cr=
eating programs, lobbying for policies, reformulating products, and doing e=
verything you could to raise awareness about this issue.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And since we first launch=
ed Let=92s Move!, PHA has brought together partners like you in more than 5=
0,000 locations across all 50 states.&nbsp; And what you all have achieved =
in just six years, man, it truly takes my breath
 away.&nbsp; Let=92s just look at the stats.&nbsp; I know you all have been=
 talking about it, but I want to go over it again.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Because of you, 1.6 milli=
on kids are now in healthy daycares, eating more than 225 million healthy s=
nacks and meals a year.&nbsp; Those are our babies.&nbsp; We=92re doing it =
there.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thirty million kids are eating
 healthier school breakfasts and lunches.&nbsp; Ten million kids are gettin=
g 60 minutes of physical activity at a Let=92s Move! Active School.&nbsp; T=
hey=92re getting that every day.&nbsp; Eighty million Americans are living =
in a Let=92s Move! City, Town or County with summer meal
 programs, and athletic leagues, and new parks and playgrounds.&nbsp; Eight=
 point one million people in underserved areas finally have somewhere to bu=
y groceries, including 1,000 convenience stores that are now selling fresh =
food.&nbsp; I love that.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And PHA=92s FNV campaign =
to market fruits and vegetables has gotten 1 billion media impressions in j=
ust one year.&nbsp; Yes, that=92s billion.&nbsp; My husband would die for t=
hose numbers.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And they say that 70 percent
 of folks who saw the campaign said they ate more produce as a result.&nbsp=
; So it=92s not just idle hits and views; people are actually being impacte=
d.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And today, I am thrilled =
to announce another new achievement to add to that list -=96 and it=92s a b=
ig one, as far as I=92m concerned.&nbsp; For the first time in 20 years, th=
e FDA has finalized a new and improved nutrition
 facts label that will be on nearly 800,000 food products nationwide.&nbsp;=
 The calorie count is bigger, bigger font, so you can actually see it.&nbsp=
; (Laughter.)&nbsp; The serving sizes are more realistic.&nbsp; And, most i=
mportant of all, this label will tell you how much sugar
 in your snack was added during processing, and how much of it comes from i=
ngredients like fruit.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; So very soon -- very soon --=
 you will no longer need a microscope, a calculator, or a degree in nutriti=
on to figure out whether the food you=92re buying
 is actually good for our kids.&nbsp; So that=92s a phenomenal achievement.=
&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I want to thank everyone at the FDA who worked=
 to get this over the finish line.&nbsp; I hope you all are proud, because =
this was not easy to do.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">These are extraordinary a=
ccomplishments.&nbsp; And as I said at the outset, you all should be proud.=
&nbsp; Because together, you all are truly transforming the way our kids li=
ve and eat.&nbsp; And even more importantly, as many
 of you know from your work on the ground, and contrary to what the naysaye=
rs predicted, millions of kids are truly embracing this change.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">After all that hand-wring=
ing when we first launched Let=92s Move! about how kids are picky eaters, a=
nd schools wouldn=92t be able to prepare more nutritious meals that student=
s would actually enjoy, and food manufacturers
 wouldn=92t make healthy versions of their products that young consumers wo=
uld prefer -=96 remember all that?&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Well=
, after all that, it turns out that kids are even more excited about this s=
tuff than we are.&nbsp; And after six years, it=92s becoming
 their new normal.&nbsp; Many of them don=92t know anything else.&nbsp; <o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And let me tell you, I se=
e this everywhere I go.&nbsp; I saw it at the Burke County Middle School in=
 rural Georgia.&nbsp; Now, Burke County Schools have a Fresh Fruit and Vege=
table Grant Program where they expose their elementary
 school kids to over 65 fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; And last year, when so=
me of those same students reached middle school, they decided that they wan=
ted to plant their own garden.&nbsp; And now, they=92re learning math and s=
cience lessons from that garden.&nbsp; They=92re even
 writing a cookbook for the food they=92ve grown.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the day I visited, th=
eir lunch menu =96- which, by the way, like 98 percent of schools nationwid=
e, now meets our healthier meal standards -=96 (applause) -- yes, indeed.&n=
bsp; But they were having for lunch local cabbage
 that was delicious, collard greens, and sweet potatoes.&nbsp; And let me t=
ell you, those kids devoured that food.&nbsp; They were practically licking=
 their plates.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Because, look, their scho=
ol nutrition team has developed creative recipes for vegetables that kids l=
ove.&nbsp; They=92ve done the work.&nbsp; They=92ve also created healthier =
versions of kids=92 favorite foods, like everything
 from barbeque chicken sandwiches with fresh sauce on homemade wheat buns -=
- homemade buns, all of their buns are homemade -- (laughter) -- baked sout=
hern chicken with a garden fresh vegetable cheese casserole that was really=
 good -- they do that instead of
 mac and cheese.&nbsp; So obviously I tried some of the dishes, and I have =
to tell you, the food was really good.&nbsp; And you could tell that it was=
 prepared by loving hands, because talking to the men and women who worked =
in those kitchens, it was important for them
 to do right by the kids and make that food taste good.&nbsp; That=92s the =
kind of healthy food these kids are now used to eating every day.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Kids in urban settings ar=
e also embracing this change.&nbsp; I saw it just last month at the Phillip=
=92s Academy Charter School in Newark, New Jersey.&nbsp; Now, this is an in=
ner-city school where the kids were bursting with
 excitement as they showed me the garden they had planted on the rooftop of=
 the school, right in a very urban setting.&nbsp; That garden was their pri=
de and joy.&nbsp; They were showing off their little composting thing.&nbsp=
; They had their nice little dresses on and they
 were rolling that pen.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Oh, they were so cute.&nbsp=
; The eighth graders there had been harvesting and eating those vegetables =
since first grade.&nbsp; So you see, we=92re starting to see the growth of =
these kids who started there.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But after spending time w=
ith the kids, pulling worms out of their compost heap -- that was a great s=
hot for the cameras -- (laughter) -- we shared a snack -- and this was thei=
r regular snack -- of quinoa protein
 bars -- handmade, homemade -- with beet smoothies, which, by the way, all =
those kids gulped down.&nbsp; I wasn=92t even that keen on the beet smoothi=
e, but they were like, just try it, you=92ll like it, you=92ll get used to =
it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But this is the kind of food
 they were eating every day for most of their elementary school years.&nbsp=
; So they were used to it.&nbsp; This was their normal.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That=92s the kind of tran=
sformation we=92re seeing in kids all across this country.&nbsp; They=92re =
learning through first-hand experience that healthy food can be fun and del=
icious.&nbsp; And they=92re making the connection between
 what they eat and how they feel.&nbsp; In fact, just last week, I=92m sure=
 many of you saw the New York Times article about how when schools start te=
aching students =96- particularly their athletes =96- about nutrition, kids=
 actually start changing their behavior.&nbsp; And
 in this article, one young man said he went from eating ice cream and soda=
 every day to having grilled chicken salads and fish because he now underst=
ands that his nutrition affects his performance on the playing field.&nbsp;=
&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So when we talk about rai=
sing a healthier generation, this is what we mean.&nbsp; And it=92s happeni=
ng before our very eyes.&nbsp; Because today, from the time our kids are ba=
rely old enough to talk, so many of them are hearing
 a new set of messages and being exposed to a new set of options around hea=
lthy eating.&nbsp; And they are internalizing those messages.&nbsp; They ar=
e owning and loving those choices.&nbsp; And as a result, they=92re develop=
ing a set of habits and preferences that will set
 them on a healthy path for the rest of their lives.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And while it=92s incredib=
ly exciting that we=92ve had this kind of impact, it=92s also not all that =
surprising.&nbsp; Because here=92s the thing -- ultimately, our children ar=
e a reflection of our investment in them, plain and
 simple.&nbsp; So if we refuse to put in the effort to provide nutritious f=
ood for our kids, they will reflect that back in poor health and life outco=
mes.&nbsp; But if we stand up for what=92s best for them, if we demand bett=
er choices for them and get then excited about
 those choices, then they will absolutely follow our lead.&nbsp; And then o=
ur culture will shift in response to those choices.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I really want to emph=
asize that last point about culture change.&nbsp; See, it=92s no accident t=
hat fast-food places are now serving apples and skim milk in their kids=92 =
meals, or that food and beverage companies --
 including many in the room here today -- have cut 6.4 trillion calories fr=
om their products and are racing to stock grocery shelves with healthier op=
tions.&nbsp; These companies are simply responding to rapidly changing cons=
umer demands.&nbsp; And that change is happening
 more quickly than we could have ever imagined.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I mean, just think about =
it.&nbsp; If six years ago, someone had told you that Fenway Park would hav=
e a 5,000 square foot farm on their rooftop to provide fresh produce for th=
eir fans -- (applause) -- or that 50 million
 Americans would visit a government website called MyPlate to learn about h=
ealthy eating, or that sales of kale would jump 50 percent in just four yea=
rs -- (laughter and applause) -- or that the first unanimously chosen NBA M=
VP, Steph Curry, would choose fruits,
 vegetables, and water as his primary product endorsements =96- (applause) =
-- if someone had told you all that six years ago, you would have thought t=
hey had were out of their minds.&nbsp; But that=92s the kind of meaningful,=
 tangible change that we=92re seeing throughout
 the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I want to be very cle=
ar:&nbsp; You all did this, not me.&nbsp; I might have added a little spark=
le or publicity -- (laughter) -- but you all did the work.&nbsp; You did th=
e work.&nbsp; You made the commitments.&nbsp; You stepped up.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So the truth is, is that =
it actually doesn=92t matter where I=92m sitting eight months from now.&nbs=
p; What matters is that we all keep standing together on behalf of our kids=
.&nbsp; That=92s what matters.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Because
 while you all might have felt more empowered these last six years because =
someone in the White House was excited about this issue, the real power lie=
s with all of the parents and consumers, all the partners =96- and, most im=
portantly, all these kids that you
 all have helped to inspire.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And while next year I wil=
l no longer be First Lady, I just want you to know that I will always be he=
re as a partner in this effort -- always.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I=92m not here today t=
o give a victory speech, and these certainly aren=92t my closing remarks on=
 this issue -- just the opposite.&nbsp; I was passionate about this issue l=
ong before I became First Lady, and I plan to
 work on it long after I leave the White House.&nbsp; Because as far as I=
=92m concerned, everything we=92ve done before today was simply phase one o=
f our work together.&nbsp; That was phase one.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And =
while we have accomplished a lot, we are just getting started.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Yes, it=92s true that chi=
ldhood obesity rates have stopped rising for the first time in decades.&nbs=
p; Yes, it=92s true that rates are dropping for our youngest kids.&nbsp; Bu=
t during this first phase, we haven=92t yet achieved
 the ultimate change we seek, which is to end our epidemic of childhood obe=
sity once and for all.&nbsp; Instead, what we=92ve done is been laying the =
groundwork for that change.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We=92ve been finding inno=
vative and inspirational new ways to raise awareness and create new product=
s and build new programs and policies.&nbsp; And if we truly want to achiev=
e our goal, we=92re going to need to continue
 and scale up these efforts, and we need to give them time to actually have=
 their intended impact.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We also need to be thinki=
ng about the new voices, the champions, the new ideas we can bring to this =
work.&nbsp; Who=92s our next Steph Curry?&nbsp; What=92s the next FNV or Dr=
ink Up campaign?&nbsp; We got to keep it moving.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
 In this next phase, we=92re going to need to get even more creative, even =
more innovative.&nbsp; We=92ve got to find new ways to reach these kids in =
ways they will hear it.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we=92re also going to=
 need some patience, real patience, and a whole lot of perseverance.&nbsp; =
Because as you all know, this is not a trendy issue of the month or even an=
 issue of the year.&nbsp; This is a generational
 problem.&nbsp; It took us decades to get here, and it=92s going to take us=
 years to climb our way back.&nbsp; And the only way we can do that is by c=
ontinuing to focus on one thing and one thing only, and that is doing what=
=92s best for our kids.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">See, if that is our North=
 Star that guides everything we do, if we focus not just on our profit marg=
ins but on how our products affect our kids=92 health, if we realize that i=
nvestments in P.E. and recess and nutritious
 school food are absolutely essential to ensure the success of all of our k=
ids, if we keep pushing our kids at home just to eat their veggies every ni=
ght, then we can absolutely reach our goal of raising a healthier generatio=
n.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So when we encounter folk=
s with an agenda that doesn=92t include our kids=92 health, we can=92t get =
tired.&nbsp; We can=92t get frustrated.&nbsp; We can=92t give up.&nbsp; Bec=
ause we know that those folks aren=92t our biggest obstacle.&nbsp; Our
 biggest obstacle is our own complacency.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And when one in three kid=
s in this country is still overweight or obese; when we=92re spending billi=
ons of dollars treating obesity-related conditions; when four-star generals=
 are sounding the alarm on this issue
 because they are struggling to recruit young people who can meet the fitne=
ss standards of our military -- then the stakes are far too high to back do=
wn even for a single second.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So let me end with a quot=
e from Donna Martin.&nbsp; Donna is the Director of the School Nutrition Pr=
ogram for the Burke County Public School System that I talked about earlier=
.&nbsp; In a blog post that she wrote after my
 visit, she says:&nbsp; =93This is our chance to help mold the future that =
our children will endure for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; It goes without=
 saying that regardless of political stance, personal or religious beliefs,=
 that is a statement that we can all believe
 in.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I couldn=92t agree mo=
re.&nbsp; And that=92s why I=92m in this, and I=92m in this for life.&nbsp;=
 I=92m in this until we fix this.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So today, I want to ask a=
ll of you:&nbsp; Are you in this with me?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; What=92s =
that?&nbsp; Are you all in this?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Wait, wait, come o=
n, PHA Summit, are you guys in?&nbsp; Are you ready for this fight?&nbsp; A=
re
 you ready to keep adding commitments and building on this success?&nbsp; (=
Applause.)&nbsp; Because I=92m in.&nbsp; I am so far in.&nbsp; We have gott=
en so much done.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I am so glad to hear that=
, because we have a lot of work ahead of us, but if we keep coming together=
 and digging deep, and making real investments in our kids=92 health, then =
I know we can solve this problem.&nbsp; We=92re
 on our way.&nbsp; I know we can give every child in this country the brigh=
t future that we know they deserve.&nbsp; I am so grateful to you all.&nbsp=
; Congratulations for everything you have done and what you will continue t=
o do.&nbsp; Let=92s roll up our sleeves and keep it going.&nbsp;
