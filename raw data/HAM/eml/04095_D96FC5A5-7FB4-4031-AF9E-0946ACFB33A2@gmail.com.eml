Republican voters remain remarkably pessimistic about the state of their par=
ty. More than eight in 10 call the party divided, and 43 percent say they ar=
e discouraged about its future. About two-thirds think Mr. Trump can unite t=
he party this year.

By contrast, fewer than half of Democratic voters say their party is divided=
, and eight in 10 are hopeful about its future. More than eight in 10 think M=
rs. Clinton can unite the party after the primaries end next month.
