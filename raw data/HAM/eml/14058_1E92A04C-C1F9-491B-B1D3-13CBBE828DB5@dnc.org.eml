In an interview taped earlier Saturday for the NBC News program =93Meet the=
 Press,=94 Sanders was asked about his differences and similarities with Cl=
inton.

=93I think there is a lot that unites us. I think there is a lot that divid=
es us. I think the fact that all of us are in agreement that Donald Trump w=
ould be a disaster for this country if he became president unites us. The f=
act that we understand, for example, that climate change is real while our =
Republican opponents ignore that reality unites us,=94 Sanders told Chuck T=
odd.

=93On the other hand, I think what divides us is the understanding on the p=
art of millions of people who are supporting my candidacy that it really is=
 too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. We have t=
o deal in very substantive way with income and wealth inequality. We need t=
o understand that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee h=
ealth care to all people, not to provide paid family and medical leave. We =
have to deal aggressively with a corrupt campaign finance system which allo=
ws big- money interests to buy elections. Those are areas I think of differ=
ence,=94 Sanders said.

BALTIMORE =96 More than 6,600 supporters cheered U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders o=
n Saturday as he continued to draw distinctions with rival Hillary Clinton =
ahead of next Tuesday=92s round of presidential primary contests in five No=
rtheast and mid-Atlantic states.

Maryland Democrats go to the polls on Tuesday along with voters in Pennsylv=
ania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Sanders was headed to rallies=
 in Delaware later Saturday and in Rhode Island on Sunday.

=93All of you are enormously powerful people if you choose to exercise that=
 right,=94 Sanders told the rally at Royal Farms Arena. =93Our job is to te=
ll the establishment that the status quo is not acceptable.=94

He spelled out clear differences between his record and Clinton=92s on camp=
aign funding, foreign policy and war, the minimum wage, Wall Street reform,=
 climate change, college affordability, retirement security and other criti=
cal issues.

Sanders contrasted his grassroots campaign, which is supported by more than=
 7 million donations averaging about $27 apiece, to Hillary Clinton=92s cam=
paign bankrolled by high-dollar donors to her White House campaign and to h=
er super PACs, which have taken more than $25 million from Wall Street and =
other special interests.

Sanders was introduced by the civil rights activist and actor Danny Glover =
and by Benjamin Jealous, the former head of the NAACP.
