Below is a letter from a coalition, led by the March of Dimes, of more than=
 60 national medical and other organizations, which calls out the House GOP=
 for inadequate Zika funding levels in their bill, which is being considere=
d on the House Floor today.
As the groups write, =93we are profoundly disappointed in the inadequate fu=
nding levels proposed in H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations Act.  =
This initiative fails to provide appropriate resources to address any of th=
e needed public health efforts to protect pregnant women and their infants =
from Zika virus.  The bill provides less than one-third of its funding to t=
he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the public health efforts=
 desperately needed this summer, such as laboratory capacity, vector contro=
l, and public education.  It also appears to restrict funding for the Natio=
nal Institutes of Health only to engaging in vaccine development, which wou=
ld prevent its use for time-critical needs like cohort studies to determine=
 risk of and susceptibility to birth defects caused by Zika.  The fact that=
 this funding is only available until the end of September places unwarrant=
ed and counterproductive constraints on its use.=94
The full letter is below.
May 18, 2016

Dear Representative,

The undersigned organizations committed to the health and wellbeing of our =
nation=92s children and families urge you to provide emergency supplemental=
 funding to combat Zika virus at or near the President=92s requested levels=
, and to reject proposals that fall far short of those amounts, particularl=
y those that would fund efforts against Zika by cutting other vital public =
health programs and priorities.

As you know, the Zika virus is responsible for causing thousands of severe =
birth defects in South America over the past year.  It also appears likely =
that Zika is causing miscarriages and less severe birth defects to an as-ye=
t-unknown extent.  Zika has spread northward steadily and is now reported t=
o affect almost 50 nations in the Americas.  Already, all but five states i=
n the U.S. have reported travel-associated Zika cases, and as many as 30 st=
ates fall within the range of the mosquito known to carry this virus.  As s=
ummer begins, it is possible that Zika virus could gain a foothold in porti=
ons of the United States, particularly along our Gulf Coast.

Robust federal, state, tribal and territorial public health responses are c=
ritical to our ability to respond to Zika and prevent the terrible birth de=
fects it causes.  The President has requested emergency funding to engage i=
n a full range of public health efforts to prevent transmission and educate=
 the American people about how to protect themselves and their loved ones, =
as well as to assist Zika-endemic nations in stemming the virus.  The packa=
ge represents an appropriately full-fledged response to a potential public =
health crisis that could have dire consequences for infants and families.

In contrast, we are profoundly disappointed in the inadequate funding level=
s proposed in H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations Act.  This initia=
tive fails to provide appropriate resources to address any of the needed pu=
blic health efforts to protect pregnant women and their infants from Zika v=
irus.  The bill provides less than one-third of its funding to the Centers =
for Disease Control and Prevention for the public health efforts desperatel=
y needed this summer, such as laboratory capacity, vector control, and publ=
ic education.  It also appears to restrict funding for the National Institu=
tes of Health only to engaging in vaccine development, which would prevent =
its use for time-critical needs like cohort studies to determine risk of an=
d susceptibility to birth defects caused by Zika.  The fact that this fundi=
ng is only available until the end of September places unwarranted and coun=
terproductive constraints on its use.

Underfunding Zika prevention efforts will come with a heavy human and econo=
mic toll.  In addition to experiencing the pain of families with infants bo=
rn with dreadful preventable birth defects, our nation can expect costs of =
approximately $10 million in lifetime costs of care for each affected baby.=
  Most of those costs are likely to be borne by the government through Medi=
caid programs.

Our nation has no time to waste.  Even now, it will require an extraordinar=
y effort to move emergency funds into the field to make a meaningful differ=
ence in Zika prevention this summer.  We urge you to support full funding f=
or Zika prevention and to reject half-measures.
