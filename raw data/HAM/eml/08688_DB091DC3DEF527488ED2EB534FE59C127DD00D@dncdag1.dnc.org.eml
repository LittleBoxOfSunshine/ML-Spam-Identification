Bernie Sanders Looks to Promote His Ideas at Democratic Convention
Sam Frizell<http://time.com/author/sam-frizell/>
1:26 PM ET

Bernie Sanders is losing the primary battle, but he's still waging a war fo=
r the soul of the Democratic Party.

Now all-but eliminated from winning the Democratic nomination, the Vermont =
Senator and his advisers are drawing up plans for a fight over the party's =
platform and rules at the July convention, hoping to inscribe his ideas int=
o the party's DNA.

That could mean putting into the text ideas that Clinton and her allies hav=
e resisted, such as raising the federal minimum wage<https://www.washington=
post.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/15/what-hillary-clinton-actually-thinks-about=
-the-minimum-wage/> to $15 an hour or making Democratic primaries more open=
, Sanders allies say. His advisers are considering tactics that would take =
advantage of theparty's arcane rules to push proposals through the party-co=
ntrolled committees, perhaps as far the convention floor.

The looming fight at the convention has become a key motive for Sanders to =
continue contesting major primary states. "If we don't win, we intend to wi=
n every delegates we can," he said at a rally on Wednesday, "so that when w=
e go to Philadelphia, we will have the votes to put together the strongest =
progressive agenda that any party has ever seen."

But Sanders will face some of the same challenges in his platform fight tha=
t he faced in his campaign, with much of the agenda on the convention floor=
 controlled by Clinton and her allies within the party. He has lost a strin=
g of devastating losses in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York and other deleg=
ate-rich states in recent days, which means he will have fewer supporters c=
ompared with Clinton in the convention halls.

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the Democratic National Committ=
ee, has already appointed the leaders of the three committees Sanders hopes=
 to influence. Co-chairing the Rules Committee is former Rep. Barney Frank,=
 a vocal Clinton ally who has repeatedly criticized Sanders for having few =
accomplishments in Congress. A co-chair for the Platform Committee is Conne=
cticut Gov. Dan Malloy, a close Clinton ally who has harshly targeted Sande=
rs' gun control stance.

Moreover, it is unclear Clinton herself is willing to compromise with Sande=
rs if he does make stringent demands. "I am winning. And I'm winning becaus=
e of what I stand for and what I've done and what I stand for," Clinton sai=
d on Monday, indicating her resistance to shifting her platform.

Clinton added that in the 2008 elections, she supported then-Sen. Barack Ob=
ama without preconditions, despite being closer in popular vote to him than=
 Sanders is to her today. "We got to the end in June and I did not put down=
 conditions. I didn't say, 'You know what, if Senator Obama does x, y and z=
, maybe I'll support him,'" she said.

Sanders and his advisers have not yet settled on issues they wish to advanc=
e at the convention. On Monday, Sanders said that Clinton would need to ado=
pt single-payer healthcare and a more comprehensive climate change plan if =
she wants to win over his supporters. His allies are adamant that he get a =
strong hearing at the convention and say on the platform, which could lead =
to a contentious fight in Philadelphia.

"This resurgence of the progressive wing of the party has been a good thing=
 and it demands its day in the sun at the convention," said Rep. Ra=FAl Gri=
jalva, a Sanders backer, in an interview. "The platform has to be more refl=
ective of the issues [Sanders] has put up front."

The rules to the convention are complex, and Sanders' and his advisors, who=
 spoke on the condition of anonymity, have not settled on the best method t=
o help set the party's platform. But even if Sanders enters the convention =
with between 1,500 and 1,900 delegates-well under the number of delegates h=
e would need to win the nomination-he will have a strong base of grassroots=
 organizers committed to his ideas.

"These are people that very much believe in Bernie Sanders' agenda. They're=
 going to care about this a lot," a Sanders aide said. "I don't think the D=
NC or the Clinton campaign have wrapped their mind around that."

Though the leadership of the party's three key committees generally favors =
Clinton, Sanders could have significant leverage over the convention.

Each party committee has 187 members. Twenty-five are appointed by the DNC =
chair, and the other 162 are apportioned according to each candidate's supp=
ort in state primaries and caucuses. If Sanders wins 40% of the total deleg=
ates in all primaries, he will have roughly the same representation among t=
he 162 members on the committees who are not appointed by the DNC chair. Th=
ose delegates will largely be hand-picked Sanders loyalists.

According to party rules, Sanders only needs support from 20% of each commi=
ttee to propose amendments that could make it to the floor of the open conv=
ention-which could in turn spur a contentious, public fight in primetime.

If Sanders' backers in the platform committee push for a $15 minimum wage, =
for example, and Clinton's supporters oppose it, the Sanders camp could iss=
ue a "minority report" with 25% support and bring the debate to the convent=
ion floor. That would force Clinton supporters to decide whether to vote ag=
ainst a measure popular with the Democratic base.

One change the Sanders campaign has long eyed is making the Democratic prim=
aries open to voting by independents. "One of the things that we will be fi=
ghting for on the platform, whether he's the candidate or not, is electoral=
 reform," said Jane Sanders, Bernie's wife, in an interview with CNN this w=
eek<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D5em7D9DC5do>. "The process needs to c=
hange. We need an open electoral system, same-day registration and open pri=
maries."

Still, Clinton's broad support in the party is in institutional bulwark aga=
inst any attempt by Sanders to control the proceedings. The 25 most-senior =
members on each committee have already been chosen by Wasserman Schultz. On=
 the Platform Committee, for example, at least 16 of the 25 members appoint=
ed by the party are known Clinton allies.

Much of the party's infrastructure is made up of stalwarts who came up duri=
ng President Bill Clinton's tenure and have longstanding connections with t=
he family. Others endorsed Clinton early in the race.

"Because the Party's platform is a statement of our values, the DNC is comm=
itted to an open, inclusive and representative process," said Luis Miranda,=
 communications director at the Democratic National Committee. "[J]ust as w=
e did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate."

Sanders' campaign has not decided how it will approach the convention. It m=
ay heed a call to party unity and ensure any negotiations are careful and c=
ontained within the committees. Or it may take a more ambitious approach.

In the divisive 1980 Democratic convention, losing candidate and then-Senat=
or Ted Kennedy battled with President Jimmy Carter over major platform poin=
ts, bringing amendments to the convention floor in a show of defiance. Kenn=
edy was able to help push the Equal Rights Amendment into the party's platf=
orm. At the end of the convention, Carter was ungracefully forced to follow=
 his rival around the stage to seek a reconciliatory victory gesture.

Recent Democratic conventions have been tamer affairs. Clinton in 2008 conc=
eded the nomination to Obama and did not seek an open fight on ideological =
issues, letting the nominee set the agenda.

Sanders has already defined much of the conversation in this race. Clinton =
has moved toward Sanders' position against the Keystone Pipeline and the Tr=
ans-Pacific Partnership, and borrowed much of his rhetoric on income inequa=
lity and other issues.

Clinton campaign aides are hopeful that the party will come together in Jul=
y despite Sanders' language. Jane Sanders said on Tuesday that the campaign=
 "will not play the role of spoiler" and Sanders himself has said he will d=
o everything he can to prevent a Republican from being elected.

"In the end, we have every confidence that our party will be able to come t=
ogether," Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon said. "At this point in time=
, when the primary is still eight weeks left to be contested, I think there=
's still plenty of time for Sen Sanders to make a decision as to how he wou=
ld conduct himself, and what he would ask his supporters come this summer."
