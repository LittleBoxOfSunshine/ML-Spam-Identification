off the record, I agree. We have to blame Republicans in Congress for the r=
ise of Trump. We've worked a lot of great language into our narrative about=
 how whether you go back to the Southern Strategy Nixon used, or 2002's aff=
irmative action focus, or 2004 DOMA, or 2005/2006 immigration...and then of=
 course the Republican Congress helping fuel the Tea Party...that they made=
 their bed and now they're lying in it. Unfortunately, there is a faction w=
ithin Clinton world that seems to be in the mindset that they can win witho=
ut anyone else, and they're promoting the idea that the focus should be on =
showing how Republicans are shunning Trump because he's so extreme. They wo=
rry that our narrative, the points you make about who to blame, make Trump =
look like everyone else, and thus a viable option.

I think we need downballot to be able to fuel the top of the ticket, so I d=
isagree with their approach, and I'm never going to get state parties to we=
lcome GOPers shunning Trump because we're trying to beat those too. Somethi=
ng for you to be aware of.

Maybe some of the language at the end of my post today could be helpful?
