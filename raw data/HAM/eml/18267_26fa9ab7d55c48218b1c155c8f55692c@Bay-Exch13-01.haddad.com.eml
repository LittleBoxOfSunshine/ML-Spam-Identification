I have something the 7th I could bail on, but would rather not.  June 9 I m=
ay have to be in DC.  This is getting difficult!

Maybe we should have the first one at my apartment -- combining host and pi=
tchman makes it a little easier to get their two schedules to mesh. <grin> =
If I can get a date from David Hyde Pierce tonight, I'll let you know.

I'm in SF the week after Memorial Day.
How about June 7 or 9 at our apt? Maybe, to Andy's point, we could hold a s=
econd event that week. We could focus on women and engageing them.
We'd need a third event in NYC.
I'll send David Von Storch an email about hosting an event in DC.

Good morning guys:

I'm sorry I wasn't able to join you last week for the latest call.

June 1st is workable, but as its only two weeks from today, I'll encourage =
that we consider dates starting on the 8th, with a commitment from staff th=
at an invite is ready for approval on 5/17 (tomorrow).

Also, do we know of staff have a vetted invitation list (email addresses) r=
eady to us for distribution of invites?

Best,
Rod
