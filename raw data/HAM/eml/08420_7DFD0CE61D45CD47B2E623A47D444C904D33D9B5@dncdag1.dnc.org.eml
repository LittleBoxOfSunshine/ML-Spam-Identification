Nothing new
(except being gracious in victory toward Cruz for once)

Trump Election Night Speech

Thanks his family, including deceased parents and brother
Tremendous victory tonight
- Was 25 points down
Thanks Bobby Knight
- Somebody that knows how to win. That's what our country needs
Massive Victory
- So many negative ads run against me
- The people are smart. They get it
- $8 million spent against me. We spent $900,000
Now going to Nebraska and West Virginia
- We will put miners back to work
- HRC said she wanted to put miners out of work
Tremendous run starting with NY
- We didn't get credit for performances early on
- Don't need the credit now, because we are facing HRC
HRC won't be a good president
- Bad on trade. Her husband signed NAFTA
- I've witnessed the carnage of NAFTA
If companies want to leave the state, go ahead, compete
- But there will be serious consequences if they want to leave the country
All my life I've been in competitions
- Whether sports, business, or now politics
- Some of the best competitors I've met on GOP stage
On Cruz: I don't know if he likes me or not, but he's one hell of a competi=
tor
- Cruz is a smart guy, great future
- One tough competitor
America First
- Other countries have not paid fair share
- Unfair to tax payers
- Other countries will respect us more
- Great relationships with many foreign countries
- Has to be a two-way street
- We spent $4 million in Mid East, yet our infrastructure is like a third-w=
orld country
Defeat ISIS
Vets have been treated so badly
Rasmussen poll
- Now leading HRC
We will have great numbers with the Hispanics
- The Hispanics want jobs. The African Americans want jobs
Just spoke to Reince Priebus
- Had a tough job with 17 candidates
- Now it's down to one? Is it one? You'll have to explain the status of tha=
t
Thanks his staff
- Thanks Ivanka's husband Jared
Says Cruz dropping out was a brave thing to do
- But we have to bring unity
Lots of politicians coming aboard
- Thanks Jeff Sessions, Sarah Palin, Jerry Falwell Jr.
- Won with the evangelicals tonight
- Won with virtually every category
Want to congratulate Ted Cruz
- Tough, smart competitor
Thanks wife, family, campaign staff, Trump organization staff
Make America Great Again. Start winning again.
