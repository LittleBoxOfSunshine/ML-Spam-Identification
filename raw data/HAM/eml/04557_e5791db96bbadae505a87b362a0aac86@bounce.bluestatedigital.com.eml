Luis --

Over the next few months, we've got to challenge ourselves=20
to keep asking one simple question: What can we do to keep=20
moving this country forward?

On a day-to-day basis, the answer may change, but our
mission won't. We've got to continue working so middle-class
families have a fighting chance at getting ahead in this
country. We've got to expand opportunity for our kids and
grandkids so they can forge a path to success. We've got to
protect the work we've done together and keep striving for a
more perfect union.

Knowing what we need to accomplish and how much is at stake
will keep me going every day long after I'm finished serving
as your president. But if we want to keep up this progress,
we've got to elect leaders who will fight for and with us.

We've got 181 days until Election Day, Luis, and we can't
afford to be complacent. So right now, if you're with me and
willing to do whatever it takes to win on November 8th, then
add your name next to mine and let's make this happen together:
