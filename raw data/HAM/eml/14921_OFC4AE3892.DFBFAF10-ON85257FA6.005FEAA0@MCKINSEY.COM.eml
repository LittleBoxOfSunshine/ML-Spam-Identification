Zach-
So I have another couple considering the 33,400 for the convention. I have
told them that at that donation level they get the two credentials for the
convention, invites to the WH holiday party, probably some event this year
or next with the president, and maybe something related to the
inauguration. I think they're close to deciding. If we could be a notch
more definitive on the inauguration I am sure we could tip them over. And I
would hope when they sign up a couple more mutual friends might as well.

Please advise.
M
