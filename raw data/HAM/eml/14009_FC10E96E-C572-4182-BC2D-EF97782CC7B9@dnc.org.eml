Hey guys re-upping.=20

Added in Rosenwald but kept the last sentence as "faith"... Not to get into=
 a whole philosophical thing but reading it as "Jewish people" just sounds =
like we're trying to advance Israelis.=20

Looks good! 2 quick things:
1. I would turn "faith" (last words) into "people"
2. I think we need to add a sentence about a historical contribution or the=
 legacy of Jewish Americans to education. Maybe a sentence about Rosenwald?=
 Arkin-- thoughts?

This month, we celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month by marking the impo=
rtant contributions that Jews have made to American life.=20

From a young age, I was taught that a central tenet of our faith is tikkun =
olam =96 or - repairing the world. As Jews and as active citizens, my paren=
ts helped me understand that it is our responsibility to help and advocate =
for others.=20

This year's theme - education - builds upon that legacy of tikkun olam. We =
know that education can be the silver bullet for parents who want to give t=
heir children a better life or a chance to escape the cycle of poverty. Edu=
cation is also our best defense against bigotry and ignorance in society. J=
ewish Americans have made major contributions to American education system,=
 most notably Julius Rosenwald's effort to help build more than 5,000 schoo=
ls in the American South. By fighting for a better education for all Americ=
ans, Jewish Americans can do our part to repair our country and the world.

There's a reason why two-thirds of Jews identify with the Democratic Party:=
 because the Democratic Party's values are in sync with the values of the J=
ewish community, like tzedakah, or charity, gemilut hasadim, the gift of lo=
ving kindness, and the cause of social justice. This Jewish American Herita=
ge Month, I'm proud to call myself a Democrat because I know that we are no=
t only advancing the causes of our party but of the Jewish faith.=20
