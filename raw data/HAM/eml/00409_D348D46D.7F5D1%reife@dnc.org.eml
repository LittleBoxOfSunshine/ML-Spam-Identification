The GOP=92s approval rating is at its lowest point in over 20 years, NAME.

According to a Pew Research study released this week, 62 percent of America=
ns have an unfavorable impression of the Republican Party =97 the highest t=
hat number has been since 1992.

Perhaps it=92s because the frontrunner to be their party=92s presidential n=
ominee has views on foreign policy that sound laughable =97 until you reali=
ze that they=92re downright dangerous.

https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/725106571022352384

Or maybe it=92s because the guy running in a distant second is one of the m=
ost disliked people in Washington =97 even (especially?) by members of his =
own party.

https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/725705930944483328

Or that the party that once prided itself on being a friend to business and=
 on its commitment to fiscal responsibility is now home to candidates like =
these.

https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/725420084836110341

Or maybe still it=92s because the Republican Party has made no secret that =
its only surefire way to win elections is to make sure fewer people are abl=
e to vote against them.

https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/725470015734960128

For all these reasons and more, the Republican Party continues to dig itsel=
f deeper into a hole with American voters =97 and as always, Factivists are=
 happy to help them out by tweeting, sharing, and forwarding this email to =
get the word out on just how disastrous the GOP would be for our country.

Thanks, NAME. Talk to you next week.

P.S. =97 We=92re sure you=92ve heard from concerned friends, neighbors, and=
 family members looking at the prospect of a President Trump and asking, =
=93how can I help stop this?=94 Well, one good step is inviting them to bec=
ome a Factivist like you so they can be on the front lines of stopping the =
GOP and electing Democrats this November!
