Well but I thought this was consistent with our conversation.

From what Mark tells me about the call he had with you, I'm surprised becau=
se I didn't hear that when we spoke. There's no way we're going to get our =
state parties to praise Ryan, that's a losing proposition because it would =
hurt them down ballot. They can't give down ballot candidates an easy out s=
o we need better clarity on what it is you're thinking because the idea tha=
t we would prop up Paul Ryan as a model isn't going to work.

Subject: Press events re: this week=92s Trump/Ryan meeting

Hey everyone =96

Tomorrow, Donald Trump is coming to Washington D.C. to meet with Paul Ryan,=
 Reince Priebus, and Mitch McConnell. The Ryan meeting is the highlight bec=
ause Ryan has withheld his endorsement of Trump thus far. This is an ideal =
opportunity to highlight the historic mess that is the Republican Party, wi=
th the Speaker of the House of Representatives not ready to fully endorse h=
is Party=92s nominee, and a slew of former GOP presidential candidates, for=
mer Republican presidents and vulnerable Senate and House candidates trying=
 to distance themselves from their standard bearer.

We=92re asking state party communications directors to put together events =
around Thursday morning=92s Trump-Ryan meeting to deliver the message that =
while Trump and Ryan may have a personal disagreement, they are both pushin=
g the same divisive and dangerous agenda. We=92re also asking state party c=
ommunications directors to echo these events with op-eds and letters to the=
 editor in local papers, and surrogates on television and radio.

Attached please find a packet with materials to put together an event. In t=
his packet you=92ll find:


=95         Sample talking points / message guidance

=95         A sample advisory

=95         A sample press release

=95         A sample op-ed

=95         Four sample letters to the editor
DNC can offer national surrogates to appear via satellite or phone on local=
 television and radio broadcasts to amplify the message. Please reach out t=
o walker@dnc.org<mailto:walker@dnc.org> if you would like to book one of ou=
r surrogates. Members of Congress and Senators who are currently in Washing=
ton can also use our studio to do local hits.

Here=92s what we=92re looking for in terms of event logistics:


=95         Types of speakers:

o   State Party Chairs, Vice-Chairs, and EDs

o   Local Elected Officials

o   Allied Groups =96 Planned Parenthood, NAACP, Mi Familia Vota, etc.

o   Labor

o   People sharing personal stories

=95         About 15-20 supporters

=95         Signs that say =93Reject the Trump-Ryan Agenda=94 =96 we have a=
 mockup that can be found here<http://Trump-Ryan-Sign.pdf>.

=95         A big push to get local TV to the event =96 studies show that l=
ocal TV is the dominant player in most markets and Americans trust local TV=
 news about 20 points more than they trust national TV news.
The Republican Party has elevated offensive policies and extreme voices usi=
ng divisive campaigns for years, and now they=92re stuck with Donald Trump=
=92s reckless and dangerous campaign heading into the general election. We =
have to make sure we hold Republicans in Congress and in every state accoun=
table for their Party=92s dysfunction as they chaotically tumble toward the=
 general election.

And while Republicans argue, Democratic voters are overwhelming in agreemen=
t that our primary has been exciting, and large majorities would support ei=
ther one of our candidates.

This meeting is also a reminder that what Trump has promised and what Repub=
licans up and down the ballot have pushed for is the same brand of trickle-=
down economic policies that help those at the top while costing hardworking=
 Americans. It=92s the same old Republican playbook of cutting taxes for th=
e rich at the expense of middle-class families, opposing measures like equa=
l pay and paid family leave, and reckless policies that would only to drag =
America back into a recession<http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2=
016/05/donald-trumps-economy/481743/>. We can=92t afford to go back to losi=
ng 800,000 jobs a month as the last Republican president left office.
