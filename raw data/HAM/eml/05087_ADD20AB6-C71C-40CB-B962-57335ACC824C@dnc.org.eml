He doesn't have to release them because he "has no political experience" an=

Trump "doesn't want to give out that information to the general public and =

SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I think it is an unusual circumstance where you got a bi=

lot about the fact that he pushes the limits, that he doesn't want to pay a=

way. So what would be in there that he wouldn't want people to see?

SCARAMUCCI: Well, I think it has to do with three things. The complication =
of the return, the fact that he's under an audit, he feels that he doesn't =
want to give out that information to the general public and have a whole ni=
ghtmare situation with opposition research trying to pick holes through the=
 return. I think the more meaningful thing is he's trying to get the Americ=
an public to focus on the policies that could heal the economy and create t=
he middle class jobs, Martha, that, frankly, my mom and dad experienced whe=
n I was growing up. So we've hollowed out the middle of the United States. =
The economic pain that's out there is being felt not only by the Donald Tru=
mp supporters, but also the Bernie Sanders supporters on the other side of =
the aisle. And so his attitude is why focus on this? It is non-material iss=
ue to my campaign. If it were something illegal, the Department of Justice =
or IRS would bring something against him. It is clearly not an illegal thin=
g. His attitude is, what you just said -- it is optional. Let's make it opt=

>> All right.

SCARAMUCCI:  You have the option not to do it.

Says Trump will need less money than traditional candidates

First entrepreneur to go straight into White House

Tax Returns?

-          Too complicated

-          Doesn=92t want to open them up to opposition research poking hol=
es

-          Wants to focus instead on creating middle-class jobs

-          Non-material issue to the campaign

-          Optional. Clearly not a legal issue, because IRS would do someth=
ing
