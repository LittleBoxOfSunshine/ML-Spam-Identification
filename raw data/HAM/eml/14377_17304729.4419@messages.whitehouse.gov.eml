REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA,

PRIME MINISTER SIGURDUR JOHANNSSON OF ICELAND

AND PRIME MINISTER LARS RASMUSSEN OF DENMARK

IN EXCHANGE OF TOASTS

AT STATE DINNER ON THE OCCASION OF U.S.-NORDIC LEADERS SUMMIT



South Lawn Tent=20





8:54 P.M. EDT





 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good evening, everyone. On behalf of Michelle and mysel=
f, welcome to the White House. And welcome to this very special dinner as=
 we celebrate the great ties and longstanding friendship between the Unit=
ed States and our five Nordic partners. (Applause.)=20



Please join me in welcoming President Niinist and Mrs. Haukio of Finland.=
 (Applause.) Prime Minister Solberg and Mr. Finnes of Norway. (Applause.)=
 Prime Minister and Mrs. Lfven of Sweden. (Applause.) Prime Minister and =
Mrs. Rasmussen of Denmark. (Applause.) And Prime Minister Jhannsson and M=
rs. Ingjaldsdottir of Iceland. (Applause.)=20



Now, we all know that our Nordic friends share a pride in their common Vi=
king heritage. But I think we can all admit that the Vikings could be a l=
ittle rough. (Laughter.) They didnt always have the best manners at the d=
ining table. (Laughter.) Their outfits were not always appropriate. (Laug=
hter.) But times have changed, and tonight, our Nordic friends are much b=
etter behaved. (Laughter.) We are honored to have you here. And as you ca=
n see from our dcor -- winter is coming. (Laughter.)=20



This evening, we have three toasts. So Im going to be brief. And I dont w=
ant things to get out of hand. One of the great Old Norse poems -- the Hv=
aml from Iceland -- offered advice on how to welcome a guest -- sort of l=
ike a Miss Manners for Vikings -- (laughter.)



Less good than they say for the sons of men

Is the drinking oft of ale

For the more they drink the less they can think

 And keep a watch over their wits. (Laughter.)=20



Good advice. It's perhaps easier said than done. It is true that our Nord=
ic friends have a reputation today, unlike the past, for modesty and prop=
riety. But dont let them fool you. In these Nordic countries, things actu=
ally can get a little wild. I understand that in Norway, for example, one=
 of the big hits on TV is National Firewood Night. (Laughter.) This is tr=
ue. A video of logs burning for hours. (Laughter.) And hours. And hours. =
That's crazy. (Laughter.) Another show involved a video camera being stra=
pped to the front of a train, so viewers could watch the rails -- for sev=
en hours. (Laughter.) This sounds like riveting entertainment. (Laughter.=
)=20



So were not going to do anything that crazy tonight. (Laughter.) But we a=
re grateful for our friendship with the Nordic peoples -- even if we do s=
ometimes get a little jealous about how perfect they seem to be.=20



If youve visited any of these Nordic countries, everything is orderly. Ev=
erything is clean. Everybody is well-behaved. It even prompted a best-sel=
ling book called, The Almost Nearly Perfect People. But there were some s=
hockers. Apparently, Nordic countries can sometimes get into heated argum=
ents about which country is happiest. (Laughter.) They also do get into a=
rguments about who has the better hockey players -- until America steals =
them away. (Laughter.) And they also have arguments about who has the hon=
or of being the true hometown of Santa Claus. So these are fierce debates=
 that take place among our Nordic friends. (Laughter.)=20



But our work today actually does remind us of why we so value our Nordic =
partners so much. In each other, we find those who we work with in pursui=
t of common values that we cherish the most. We stand together so that ci=
tizens can live in security and peace. We labor so our economies can crea=
te opportunity where prosperity goes -- not just to the top, but for the =
many. Together, were on the forefront of the fight against climate change=
, to preserve our glaciers, our fjords, to protect indigenous peoples of =
the Arctic. And in our own countries and around the world, we stand for t=
he dignity and equality of all people.=20



And many of our Nordic friends are familiar with the great Danish pastor =
and philosopher Grundtvig. And among other causes, he championed the idea=
 of the folk school -- education that was not just made available to the =
elite but for the many; training that prepared a person for active citize=
nship that improves society. Over time, the folk school movement spread, =
including here to the United States. And one of those schools was in the =
state of Tennessee -- it was called the Highlander Folk School.



At Highlander, especially during the 1950s, a new generation of Americans=
 came together to share their ideas and strategies for advancing civil ri=
ghts, for advancing equality, and for advancing justice. We know the name=
s of some of those who were trained or participated in the Highlander Sch=
ool. Ralph Abernathy. John Lewis. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. They were a=
ll shaped, in part, by Highlander and the teachings of a great Nordic phi=
losopher -- and they ended up having a ripple effect on the Civil Rights =
Movement, and ultimately on making America a better place. We would not h=
ave been here had it not been for that stone that was thrown in a lake an=
d created ripples of hope that ultimately spread across an ocean to the U=
nited States of America. And I might not be standing here were it not for=
 the efforts of people like Ella Baker and others who participated in the=
 Highlander Folk School.=20



So that's just one, small measure of the enormous, positive influence tha=
t our Nordic friends have had on our country. And it's part of the reason=
 why we so value their friendship. I've said before, and I will repeat, t=
hey punch above their weight. And their values, their contributions not j=
ust to making their own countries function well but making the whole worl=
d a better place makes them one of our most valuable partners everywhere =
in the world. And we are very grateful for the outstanding work that they=
 do.



So I propose a toast. To the friendship between us and the values that we=
 share. May our nations keep standing together and bending that arc of th=
e moral universe in the direction of justice and peace and equality for a=
ll. Skl! Cheers!=20



And with that, I want to welcome Prime Minister Jhannsson of Iceland, to =
be followed by Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark. (Applause.)=20



PRIME MINISTER JHANNSSON: Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, let me begin by expr=
essing my pleasure of being here tonight, for your gracious hosting of th=
e Nordic leaders, and for the warm welcome you have extended to Iceland. =
We are honored to be here as allies, as partners, and most importantly, a=
s friends of the United States. We bring with us the warm greetings and g=
ood wishes of our people.



Relations between Iceland and the United States have always been strong. =
Our initial and ongoing defense partnership has blossomed into a broad fr=
iendship that includes the commercial, academic and cultural ties. And, y=
es, that does sometimes include actress in swan dresses. (Laughter.)



Our friendship is based on solidarity and cooperation on some of todays m=
ost complex problems. Building on our 2013 meeting in Stockholm at todays=
 summit, I am pleased we have recognized the excellent Nordic-U.S. cooper=
ation and shared achievements. I'm also pleased that we have committed in=
 our joint statement to further deepen and broaden our cooperation on sev=
eral key international issues.=20



Our world views and interests align. We share the same values -- respect =
for freedom and democracy, an unshakeable commitment to justice, human ri=
ghts and the rule of law. We are committed to the principles of gender eq=
uality and womens empowerment. We work together for peace and security.=20=




As we near the end of your time in office, Mr. President, I would like to=
 use this opportunity to commend your leadership, not least on the challe=
nges of climate change, the conclusion of the Paris climate agreement, an=
d on the Arctic.=20



The population of Iceland is a thousand times smaller than that of the Un=
ited States. As you might expect from Viking descended Northmen, we do no=
t hide behind our apparent lack of superpowers status. (Laughter.) What w=
e lack in manpower we make up in volcanoes. (Laughter.) We are still figu=
ring out how to aim them -- (laughter and applause) -- however, so bear w=
ith us. (Laughter.)=20



Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to propose a toast. To the President; =
to the First Lady; to the people of the United States of America; and to =
the enduring friendship between our peoples. Skl! (Applause.)=20





PRIME MINISTER RASMUSSEN: Mr. President; First Lady; dear colleagues from=
 my neighboring countries; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen. On=
ce I was seven years old, my mama told me, go make yourself some friends =
or youll be lonely. (Laughter.) Those lyrics are from the Danish singer, =
Lukas Grahams number one hit song here in the U.S. (Applause.) And I'm a =
lucky guy because my predecessors didnt wait for the song to be released =
before they actually followed this advice.



And therefore, I'm so privileged and happy to be here tonight, surrounded=
 by friends from the Nordic countries, but first and foremost, you, Mr. P=
resident, and your fantastic and dedicated wife, Michelle, and all of you=
r fellow Americans. The United States is truly one of Denmarks closest fr=
iends.=20



The first time you invited me into the Oval Office, Mr. President, you sa=
id that Denmark is punching above our weight. It made me proud. It made u=
s Danes feel a little special. Now, some six years later, I understand th=
at not only Denmark, but all the Nordic countries punch above our weight.=
 (Laughter.) But, nevertheless, I'm still proud. (Laughter and applause.)=




And I truly believe the same goes for my colleagues. So you can count on =
us. And you know that. And that's probably why we are all invited here to=
night, because we punch above our weight. And we will continue to do so. =
And after tonights splendid dinner, we will definitely step up into a who=
le new weight class. (Laughter.)



The ties between the United States and the Nordics are strong and go way =
back. As you said, Nordic Vikings cross the Atlantic centuries ago and di=
scovered amazing America. And ever since, millions left our rainy and win=
dy countries looking for a new start in America -- many of them settled i=
n Minnesota. (Applause.) I guess the weather there made them feel right a=
t home. (Laughter.) And the Nordic settlers took part in making America b=
right and beautiful.=20



Scarlett Johansson is just a living proof of that. (Laughter.) And the Sw=
edes and the Finns and the Icelanders did their part, too, contributing t=
o the gene pool that gave you Julia Roberts, Matt Damon and Uma Thurman. =
And the Norwegians -- well, they gave you Karl Rove. (Laughter and applau=
se.) Among many other things. (Laughter.)=20



So I guess it's true to say that we have had a certain impact on America.=
 (Laughter.) In many different ways. So the quick question is, can we Nor=
dics still contribute to America? And the answer is a simple as it is fam=
ous -- Yes, we can! (Applause.)



Nordic architects like Bjarke Engels contributed to transforming American=
 cities with projects like the New York skyline and the redesign of the S=
mithsonian here in Washington, based on a vision of making urban areas mo=
re livable, smart and sustainable. Both the U.S. and the Nordic countries=
 try to set positive standards for the world of tomorrow, taking the lead=
, so to speak.



And speaking of taking the lead, speaking of leadership, it is easy to se=
e the importance and value of your leadership, Mr. President. So without =
interfering in American politics, I can truly and without a doubt say tha=
t you have been the best President you have ever had. (Applause.)=20



Now your presidency is coming to an end. And I have something to admit. I=
'm very fond of the Donald, too. (Laughter.) I support him as president. =
Hes pretty smart, shows great leadership skills, a true visionary. And I'=
m, of course, talking about Donald Tusk, who is President of the European=
 Council. (Laughter.) Which, in your absence, is the best President you c=
ould have. (Laughter.)=20



Well, being a role model is not always easy, so I've heard. But you, Mr. =
President, have come to represent a dream for millions of Americans and p=
eople across the world. We share a common vision of securing good, afford=
able health care to all. And I greatly respect your achievement in this r=
egard. Your leadership was also key to the Paris agreement on climate cha=
nge last year. (Applause.) Well, both of us were disappointed after Copen=
hagen, but then we worked hard, and finally, in Paris, we succeeded. And =
we continue our work together on the green transition.



And recently, Mr. President, you swept the White House in the rainbow col=
ors. Being the first country on Earth to allow same-sex partnership, Denm=
ark admires and supports your fight for diversity and equal rights. (Appl=
ause.)=20



Nevertheless, your presidency is slowly coming to an end. So Congress wil=
l probably try to block both of your initiatives in the time to come. I g=
uess that can be frustrating. Believe me, being the leader of a very smal=
l minority government, I know that from personal experience. (Laughter.) =
And if I may, allow me to give you a piece of personal advice. When I get=
 too frustrated, I let off steam by cooking. And I can recommend that. An=
d if you do take my advice, I think you could be inspired by the new Nord=
ic cuisine. It already involves eatable varieties such as musk, bark, and=
 eating ants. (Laughter.) But maybe you could be helpful in our search fo=
r a recipe called lame duck. (Laughter.)=20



Mr. President, you are a great friend and ally. Slrun and I will always b=
e very happy to welcome you and your family to Copenhagen. And Denmark wo=
uld, as all the Nordic countries, I believe, be honored to receive one of=
 the most inspirational and charming figures in America -- along with her=
 husband, of course. (Laughter.)



So, dear Michelle, dear Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, let me propo=
se a toast for the strong relations between our nations, the very special=
 cross-Atlantic friendship between U.S. and the Nordic countries. To frie=
ndship. Skl! Cheers! (Applause.)



PRESIDENT OBAMA: Dinner is now served. But I think we've just identified =
the next comic for the White House Correspondents Dinner. (Laughter and a=
pplause.)



Enjoy, everybody. Thank you! (Applause.)=20

ng President Niinist=F6 and Mrs. Haukio of Finland.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;=
 Prime Minister Solberg and Mr. Finnes of Norway.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; P=

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now, we all know that our=
 Nordic friends share a pride in their common Viking heritage.&nbsp; But I =
think we can all admit that the Vikings could be a little rough.&nbsp; (Lau=
ghter.)&nbsp; They didn&#8217;t always have the best manners
 at the dining table.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Their outfits were not always=
 appropriate.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But times have changed, and tonight, =
our Nordic friends are much better behaved.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; We are =
honored to have you here.&nbsp; And as you can see from our d=E9cor --
 winter is coming. (Laughter.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">This evening, we have thr=
ee toasts.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m going to be brief.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t wa=
nt things to get out of hand.&nbsp; One of the great Old Norse poems -- the
<span lang=3D"EN">H=E1vam=E1l from Iceland -- offered advice on how to welc=
ome a guest -- sort of like a Miss Manners for Vikings -- (laughter.)<o:p><=
/o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span lang=3D"EN"><o:p>&n=
bsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span lang=3D"EN">Less go=
od than they say for the sons of men<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span lang=3D"EN">Is the =
drinking oft of ale<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><span lang=3D"EN">For the=
 more they drink the less they can think<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep =
a watch o&#8217;ver their wits.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Good advice.&nbsp; It's p=
erhaps easier said than done.&nbsp; It is true that our Nordic friends have=
 a reputation today, unlike the past, for modesty and propriety.&nbsp; But =
don&#8217;t let them fool you.&nbsp; In these Nordic countries,
 things actually can get a little wild. I understand that in Norway, for ex=
ample, one of the big hits on TV is &#8220;National Firewood Night.&#8221;&=
nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; This is true.&nbsp; A video of logs burning for hou=
rs.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And hours.&nbsp; And hours.&nbsp; That's crazy.=
&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
 Another show involved a video camera being strapped to the front of a trai=
n, so viewers could watch the rails -- for seven hours.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&n=
bsp; This sounds like riveting entertainment.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;=
&nbsp;
<span lang=3D"EN"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we&#8217;re not going =
to do anything that crazy tonight.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But we are grate=
ful for our friendship with the Nordic peoples -- even if we do sometimes g=
et a little jealous about how perfect they seem to be.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">If you&#8217;ve visited a=
ny of these Nordic countries, everything is orderly.&nbsp; Everything is cl=
ean.&nbsp; Everybody is well-behaved.&nbsp; It even prompted a best-selling=
 book called, The Almost Nearly Perfect People.&nbsp; But there
 were some shockers.&nbsp; Apparently, Nordic countries can sometimes get i=
nto heated arguments about which country is happiest.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbs=
p; They also do get into arguments about who has the better hockey players =
-- until America steals them away.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
 And they also have arguments about who has the honor of being the true hom=
etown of Santa Claus.&nbsp; So these are fierce debates that take place amo=
ng our Nordic friends.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But our work today actual=
ly does remind us of why we so value our Nordic partners so much.&nbsp; In =
each other, we find those who we work with in pursuit of common values that=
 we cherish the most.&nbsp; We stand together
 so that citizens can live in security and peace.&nbsp; We labor so our eco=
nomies can create opportunity where prosperity goes -- not just to the top,=
 but for the many.&nbsp; Together, we&#8217;re on the forefront of the figh=
t against climate change, to preserve our glaciers,
 our fjords, to protect indigenous peoples of the Arctic.&nbsp; And in our =
own countries and around the world, we stand for the dignity and equality o=
f all people.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And many of our Nordic fr=
iends are familiar with the great Danish pastor and philosopher Grundtvig.&=
nbsp; And among other causes, he championed the idea of the folk school -- =
education that was not just made available
 to the elite but for the many; training that prepared a person for active =
citizenship that improves society.&nbsp; Over time, the folk school movemen=
t spread, including here to the United States.&nbsp; And one of those schoo=
ls was in the state of Tennessee -- it was
 called the Highlander Folk School.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">At Highlander, especially=
 during the 1950s, a new generation of Americans came together to share the=
ir ideas and strategies for advancing civil rights, for advancing equality,=
 and for advancing justice.&nbsp; We know
 the names of some of those who were trained or participated in the Highlan=
der School.&nbsp; Ralph Abernathy.&nbsp; John Lewis.&nbsp; Dr. Martin Luthe=
r King, Jr.&nbsp; They were all shaped, in part, by Highlander and the teac=
hings of a great Nordic philosopher -- and they ended
 up having a ripple effect on the Civil Rights Movement, and ultimately on =
making America a better place.&nbsp; We would not have been here had it not=
 been for that stone that was thrown in a lake and created ripples of hope =
that ultimately spread across an ocean
 to the United States of America.&nbsp; And I might not be standing here we=
re it not for the efforts of people like Ella Baker and others who particip=
ated in the Highlander Folk School.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that's just one, small=
 measure of the enormous, positive influence that our Nordic friends have h=
ad on our country.&nbsp; And it's part of the reason why we so value their =
friendship.&nbsp; I've said before, and I will
 repeat, they punch above their weight.&nbsp; And their values, their contr=
ibutions not just to making their own countries function well but making th=
e whole world a better place makes them one of our most valuable partners e=
verywhere in the world.&nbsp; And we are very
 grateful for the outstanding work that they do.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I propose a toast.&nbs=
p; To the friendship between us and the values that we share.&nbsp; May our=
 nations keep standing together and bending that arc of the moral universe =
in the direction of justice and peace and equality
 for all.&nbsp; Sk=E5l!&nbsp; Cheers!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And with that, I want to =
welcome Prime Minister J=F3hannsson of Iceland, to be followed by Prime Min=
ister Rasmussen of Denmark.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRIME MINISTER J=D3HANNSS=
ON:&nbsp; Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, let me begin by expressing my pleasure=
 of being here tonight, for your gracious hosting of the Nordic leaders, an=
d for the warm welcome you have extended to
 Iceland.&nbsp; We are honored to be here as allies, as partners, and most =
importantly, as friends of the United States.&nbsp; We bring with us the wa=
rm greetings and good wishes of our people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Relations between Iceland=
 and the United States have always been strong.&nbsp; Our initial and ongoi=
ng defense partnership has blossomed into a broad friendship that includes =
the commercial, academic and cultural ties.&nbsp;
 And, yes, that does sometimes include actress in swan dresses.&nbsp; (Laug=
hter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Our friendship is based o=
n solidarity and cooperation on some of today&#8217;s most complex problems=
.&nbsp; Building on our 2013 meeting in Stockholm at today&#8217;s summit, =
I am pleased we have recognized the excellent Nordic-U.S.
 cooperation and shared achievements.&nbsp; I'm also pleased that we have c=
ommitted in our joint statement to further deepen and broaden our cooperati=
on on several key international issues.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Our world views and inter=
ests align.&nbsp; We share the same values -- respect for freedom and democ=
racy, an unshakeable commitment to justice, human rights and the rule of la=
w.&nbsp; We are committed to the principles of
 gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment.&nbsp; We work together for =
peace and security.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As we near the end of you=
r time in office, Mr. President, I would like to use this opportunity to co=
mmend your leadership, not least on the challenges of climate change, the c=
onclusion of the Paris climate agreement,
 and on the Arctic.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The population of Iceland=
 is a thousand times smaller than that of the United States.&nbsp; As you m=
ight expect from Viking descended Northmen, we do not hide behind our appar=
ent lack of superpowers status.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
 What we lack in manpower we make up in volcanoes.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; =
We are still figuring out how to aim them -- (laughter and applause) -- how=
ever, so bear with us.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Ladies and gentlemen, I w=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">PRIME MINISTER RASMUSSEN:=
&nbsp; Mr. President; First Lady; dear colleagues from my neighboring count=
ries; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; Once I was seven ye=
ars old, my mama told me, go make yourself some
 friends or you&#8217;ll be lonely.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Those lyrics ar=
e from the Danish singer, Lukas Graham&#8217;s number one hit song here in =
the U.S.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I'm a lucky guy because my predecessor=
s didn&#8217;t wait for the song to be released before they actually follow=
ed
 this advice.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And therefore, I'm so pri=
vileged and happy to be here tonight, surrounded by friends from the Nordic=
 countries, but first and foremost, you, Mr. President, and your fantastic =
and dedicated wife, Michelle, and all
 of your fellow Americans.&nbsp; The United States is truly one of Denmark&=
#8217;s closest friends.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The first time you invite=
d me into the Oval Office, Mr. President, you said that Denmark is punching=
 above our weight.&nbsp; It made me proud.&nbsp; It made us Danes feel a li=
ttle special.&nbsp; Now, some six years later, I understand
 that not only Denmark, but all the Nordic countries punch above our weight=
.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But, nevertheless, I'm still proud.&nbsp; (Laught=
er and applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And I truly believe the s=
ame goes for my colleagues.&nbsp; So you can count on us.&nbsp; And you kno=
w that.&nbsp; And that's probably why we are all invited here tonight, beca=
use we punch above our weight. And we will continue
 to do so.&nbsp; And after tonight&#8217;s splendid dinner, we will definit=
ely step up into a whole new weight class. (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The ties between the Unit=
ed States and the Nordics are strong and go way back.&nbsp; As you said, No=
rdic Vikings cross the Atlantic centuries ago and discovered amazing Americ=
a.&nbsp; And ever since, millions left our rainy
 and windy countries looking for a new start in America -- many of them set=
tled in Minnesota.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I guess the weather there made t=
hem feel right at home.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And the Nordic settlers too=
k part in making America bright and beautiful.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Scarlett Johansson is jus=
t a living proof of that.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And the Swedes and the Fi=
nns and the Icelanders did their part, too, contributing to the gene pool t=
hat gave you Julia Roberts, Matt Damon and Uma
 Thurman.&nbsp; And the Norwegians -- well, they gave you Karl Rove.&nbsp; =
(Laughter and applause.)&nbsp; Among many other things.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&n=
bsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I guess it's true to s=
ay that we have had a certain impact on America.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; In=
 many different ways.&nbsp; So the quick question is, can we Nordics still =
contribute to America?&nbsp; And the answer is a simple
 as it is famous -- Yes, we can!&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Nordic architects like Bj=
arke Engels contributed to transforming American cities with projects like =
the New York skyline and the redesign of the Smithsonian here in Washington=
, based on a vision of making urban
 areas more livable, smart and sustainable.&nbsp; Both the U.S. and the Nor=
dic countries try to set positive standards for the world of tomorrow, taki=
ng the lead, so to speak.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And speaking of taking th=
e lead, speaking of leadership, it is easy to see the importance and value =
of your leadership, Mr. President.&nbsp; So without interfering in American=
 politics, I can truly and without a doubt
 say that you have been the best President you have ever had.&nbsp; (Applau=
se.)&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Now your presidency is co=
ming to an end.&nbsp; And I have something to admit.&nbsp; I'm very fond of=
 the Donald, too.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I support him as president.&nbsp;=
 He&#8217;s pretty smart, shows great leadership skills, a true visionary.&=
nbsp;
 And I'm, of course, talking about Donald Tusk, who is President of the Eur=
opean Council.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Which, in your absence, is the best =
President you could have.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Well, being a role model =
is not always easy, so I've heard. But you, Mr. President, have come to rep=
resent a dream for millions of Americans and people across the world.&nbsp;=
 We share a common vision of securing good,
 affordable health care to all.&nbsp; And I greatly respect your achievemen=
t in this regard.&nbsp; Your leadership was also key to the Paris agreement=
 on climate change last year.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Well, both of us were=
 disappointed after Copenhagen, but then we worked hard,
 and finally, in Paris, we succeeded.&nbsp; And we continue our work togeth=
er on the green transition.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And recently, Mr. Preside=
nt, you swept the White House in the rainbow colors.&nbsp; Being the first =
country on Earth to allow same-sex partnership, Denmark admires and support=
s your fight for diversity and equal rights.&nbsp;
 (Applause.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Nevertheless, your presid=
ency is slowly coming to an end.&nbsp; So Congress will probably try to blo=
ck both of your initiatives in the time to come.&nbsp; I guess that can be =
frustrating.&nbsp; Believe me, being the leader of
 a very small minority government, I know that from personal experience.&nb=
sp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And if I may, allow me to give you a piece of persona=
l advice.&nbsp; When I get too frustrated, I let off steam by cooking.&nbsp=
; And I can recommend that.&nbsp; And if you do take my advice,
 I think you could be inspired by the new Nordic cuisine.&nbsp; It already =
involves eatable varieties such as musk, bark, and eating ants.&nbsp; (Laug=
hter.)&nbsp; But maybe you could be helpful in our search for a recipe call=
ed lame duck.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Mr. President, you are a =
great friend and ally.&nbsp; S=F3lrun and I will always be very happy to we=
lcome you and your family to Copenhagen.&nbsp; And Denmark would, as all th=
e Nordic countries, I believe, be honored to receive
 one of the most inspirational and charming figures in America -- along wit=
h her husband, of course. (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, dear Michelle, dear M=
r. President, ladies and gentlemen, let me propose a toast for the strong r=
elations between our nations, the very special cross-Atlantic friendship be=
tween U.S. and the Nordic countries.&nbsp;
 To friendship.&nbsp; Sk=E5l!&nbsp; Cheers!&nbsp; (Applause.)<o:p></o:p></p=
