Jeb Bush: 'People should work longer hours'<http://www.politico.com/story/2=
015/07/jeb-bush-people-should-work-longer-hours-119884.html>
POLITICO // HANNA TRUDO

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Wednesday seemed to propose a bold solution=
 for economic troubles: "People should work longer hours," drawing negative=
 reactions from critics who suggested the last thing Americans need is to w=
ork more.

The GOP presidential contender made his suggestion during an interview with=
 the conservative New Hampshire newspaper, The Union Leader, on Wednesday t=
o address a variety of issues, including a tax reform agenda that Americans=
 could expect under his administration, ABC News <http://abcnews.go.com/Pol=
itics/jeb-bush-people-work-longer-hours/story?id=3D32313997> reported<http:=
//abcnews.go.com/Politics/jeb-bush-people-work-longer-hours/story?id=3D3231=
3997>.

Bush said, "My aspiration for the country and I believe we can achieve it, =
is 4 percent growth as far as the eye can see. Which means we have to be a =
lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time =
modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours."

After a town hall in Hudson on Wednesday night, Bush sought to clarify his =
remarks to reporters, saying that he meant that the 6.8 million Americans w=
orking part-time should have opportunities to work more hours, not that som=
eone already working full-time should be forced to work more.

"Work force participation rates are low," Bush said. "If anyone is celebrat=
ing this anemic recovery, then they are totally out of touch. The simple fa=
ct is people are really struggling. So giving people a chance to work longe=
r hours has got to be part of the answer. If not, you are going to see peop=
le lose hope. And that's where we are today."

Before the clarification, the remarks had drawn instant and intense reactio=
ns from a variety of public figures on the left, including John Podesta, a =
former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton who currentl=
y serves as the chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.

Podesta tweeted: "Americans are working pretty hard already & don't need to=
 work longer hours - they need to get paid more."

Late Wednesday evening, Clinton herself weighed in, sharing a graph from th=
e left-leaning Economic Policy Institute showing wages stagnating as produc=
tivity has risen over the last four decades:

Bush shot back Thursday morning:

The Democratic National Committee condemned Bush's remarks, slamming him as=
 "out-of-touch" and removed from the widespread concerns of middle-class Am=
ericans. In 2012, Democrats made great headway in criticizing Mitt Romney, =
the Republican nominee, for this type of perceived <http://www.washingtonpo=
st.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/08/jeb-bush-people-need-to-work-longe=
r-hours-means-they-need-full-time-not-part-time-work/> disconnect<http://ww=
w.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/08/jeb-bush-people-need=
-to-work-longer-hours-means-they-need-full-time-not-part-time-work/>.

A Bush aide responded promptly to the DNC's remarks in a statement, claimin=
g, "Under President Obama, we have the lowest work-force participation rate=
 since 1977, and too many Americans are falling behind. Only Washington Dem=
ocrats could be out-of-touch enough to criticize giving more Americans the =
ability to work, earn a paycheck, and make ends meet."

Ted Cruz's campaign also chimed in, invoking the specter of Romney's infamo=
us "47 percent" remark:

"It would seem to me that Gov Bush would want to avoid the kind of comments=
 that led voters to believe that Governor Romney was out of touch with the =
economic struggles many Americans are facing," Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler sa=
id in a statment. "The problem is not that Americans aren't working hard en=
ough. It is that the Washington cartel of career politicians, special inter=
ests and lobbyists have rigged the game against them."

According to a Gallup poll<http://www.gallup.com/poll/175286/hour-workweek-=
actually-longer-seven-hours.aspx> conducted in 2014, fewer Americans are wo=
rking the standard 40-hour week now than in previous decades. That study su=
ggested that many Americans reported working on average 47 hours per week, =
which amounts to nearly one additional workday longer than a week consistin=
g of a five-day, 9-to-5 work schedule. Beyond that, there are many American=
s who are underemployed, confined to part-time versions of what used to be =
full-time jobs.
