Thanks for the great idea.  I don't get to the convention until later Tuesda=

tar attraction of this event.  The idea makes complete sense to us since you=
 are the member of Congress who has done the absolute most for Democratic wo=
men candidates the past several cycles.  The event would give you a platform=
 to highlight your efforts, as well as include a WLF message pointing out th=
e importance of women's involvement in the Democratic Party, and serving as t=

ortant potential scenario developed over the weekend concerning the interest=
 and availability of Amahl and George Clooney in joining this event!   Amahl=
 and George said they met you, were most impressed with you as a Senator and=
 a leader, and would enjoy being associated with you at the Convention, as w=
ell.
>=20
> The above info came back to me over the weekend from Jae Kim, a former New=
 York WLF (and WLFN) member who now lives in Vancouver.  Jae has been best f=
riends with Amahl for years (bridesmaid at her wedding, etc.) Jae is also a g=
ood friend of mine, someone I mentored in the years she lived in NYC.  While=
 discussing WLF's Convention plans with Jae last Friday, I mentioned the WLF-=
OTS idea, then we digressed to the possibility of the Clooneys attending the=
 Convention.  As a result, she asked if it was acceptable to call Amahl and G=
eorge over the weekend to see whether they were attending the Convention, me=
ntion the possibility of OTS and WLF joining together that week, and see wha=
t their plans were. Jae spoke to them Saturday and as a result, they suggest=
ed the following:
>=20
> George Clooney has been invited to speak at the Convention (hasn't  accept=
ed yet but feels it's very important this year, and is tending toward accept=
ing), and if he does accept, then both of them would like to do a joint even=
t with you, OTS, and WLF.  Jae explained the importance of WLF's role in org=
anizing women thru the Democratic Party, and Amahl and George quickly agreed=
 with the idea.
>=20
> I have asked the DNC to prepare a Fact Sheet about the potential event to b=
e emailed to you and to the Clooney's personal assistant this week.
>=20
> Finally, Carol and I realize we have taken a "special friend" advantage  b=
y contacting you directly (indeed, you are a special friend) and it will be f=
ollowed up by the official invitation from the DNC Chair after our informal e=
xploration of these ideas.  We hope this plan holds a great appeal to you as=
 well, we think it would make a big impression on women at the Convention an=
d beyond, and we look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks, Kirsten ~ !
