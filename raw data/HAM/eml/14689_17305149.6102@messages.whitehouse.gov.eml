For Immediate Release May 16, 2016





REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

AT PRESENTATION OF THE MEDAL OF VALOR



East Room=20





11:30 A.M. EDT





 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. And good morning. Welcome to the White House. =
Thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for your words and your leadership. We=
've got a couple members of Congress here -- Frederica Wilson and Chris C=
ollins we want to acknowledge. And I also want to recognize Director Come=
y, members of the Fraternal Order of Police, and all the outstanding law =
enforcement officials who are here from around the country. Im proud to s=
tand with you as we celebrate Police Week. And most of all, Im proud to b=
e with the heroes on the front row, and with the families who have suppor=
ted them -- and the family of one who made the ultimate sacrifice.=20



Its been said that perfect valor is doing without witnesses what you woul=
d do if the whole world were watching. The public safety officers we reco=
gnize today with the Medal of Valor found courage not in search of recogn=
ition, they did it instinctively. This is an award that none of them soug=
ht. And if they could go back in time, I suspect theyd prefer none of thi=
s had happened.=20

As one of todays honorees said about his actions, I could have very well =
gone my whole career and not dealt with this situation and been very happ=
y with that. If they had their way, none of them would have to be here, a=
nd so we're grateful that they are and our entire nation expresses its pr=
ofound gratitude. More important, we're so grateful that they were there =
-- some on duty, others off duty, all rising above and beyond the call of=
 duty. All saving the lives of people they didnt know.



That distinction -- that these 13 officers of valor saved the lives of st=
rangers -- is the first of several qualities that they share. But their b=
ravery, if it had not been for their bravery, we likely would have lost a=
 lot of people -- mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, friends and loved on=
es. Thankfully, they are still with their families today because these of=
ficers were where they needed to be most, at a critical time: At a gas st=
ation during a routine patrol. In the middle of a busy hospital. In a gro=
cery store. On the campus of a community college. Near an elementary scho=
ol where a sheriffs deputys own children were students and his wife taugh=
t. In all of these places, in each of these moments, these officers were =
true to their oaths.



To a person, each of these honorees acted without regard for their own sa=
fety. They stood up to dangerous individuals brandishing assault rifles, =
handguns, and knives. One officer sustained multiple stab wounds while fi=
ghting off an assailant. Another endured first-degree burns to his arms a=
nd face while pulling an unconscious driver from a burning car on a freew=
ay.=20



Each of them will tell you, very humbly, the same thing -- they were just=
 doing their jobs. They were doing what they had to do, what they were tr=
ained to do, like on any other day. The officer who suffered those terrib=
le burns -- he left urgent care and went straight to work. He had to fini=
sh his shift. That sense of duty and purpose is what these Americans embo=
dy.



The truth is, its because of your courage, sometimes seen, but sometimes =
unseen, that the rest of us can go about living our lives like its any ot=
her day. Going to work, going to school, spending time with our families,=
 getting home safely. We so appreciate our public safety officers around =
the country, from our rookie cadets to our role model of an Attorney Gene=
ral. Not everyone will wear the medal that we give today, but every day, =
so many of our public safety officers wear a badge of honor.



The men and women who run toward danger remind us with your courage and h=
umility what the highest form of citizenship looks like. When you see stu=
dents and commuters and shoppers at risk, you dont see these civilians as=
 strangers. You see them as part of your own family, your own community. =
The Scripture teaches us, you love your neighbor as yourself. And you put=
 others safety before your own. In your proud example of public service, =
you remind us that loving our country means loving one another.



Today, we also want to acknowledge the profound sacrifices made by your f=
amilies. And I had the chance to meet some of them and they were all clea=
rly so proud of you, but we're very proud of them. We know that you wait =
up late, and youre worried and you're counting down the minutes until you=
r loved one walks through the door, safe, after a long shift. We know it =
never gets easier, and we thank you for that. And of course, we honor tho=
se who didnt come home, including one hero we honor posthumously today --=
 Sergeant Robert Wilson III.=20



He gave his life when two men opened fire at a video game store where Ser=
geant Wilson was buying a son a birthday present. To his family whos here=
 -- his grandmother, Constance, his brother and sister -- please know how=
 deeply sorry we are for your loss, how grateful we are for Sergeant Wils=
ons service.=20



We also honor the more than 35 whove given their lives in the line of dut=
y so far this year. One of them, an officer in Virginia named Ashley Mari=
e Guindon, was taken from us on her very first shift.



Ive seen this sacrifice when Ive joined some of you at the National Law E=
nforcement Officers Memorial not far from here. We read the names carved =
on these walls, and we grieve with the families who carry the fallen in t=
heir hearts forever. Weve been moved, deeply, by their anguish -- but als=
o by their pride in the lives their loved ones lived. And in those moment=
s, were reminded of our enduring obligation as citizens -- that they sacr=
ificed so much for -- that we do right by them and their families.=20



And medals and ceremonies like today are important, but these aren't enou=
gh to convey the true depth of our gratitude. Our words will be hollow if=
 theyre not matched by deeds. So our nation has a responsibility to suppo=
rt those who serve and protect us and keep our streets safe. We can show =
our respect by listening to you, learning from you, giving you the resour=
ces that you need to do the jobs. Thats the mission of our police task fo=
rce, which brought together local law enforcement, civil rights and faith=
 leaders, and community members to open dialogue and build trust and find=
 concrete solutions that make your jobs safer. Our country needs that rig=
ht now.



We're going to keep pushing Congress to move forward [in] a bipartisan wa=
y to make our criminal justice system fairer and smarter and more cost-ef=
fective, and enhance public safety and ensure the men and women in this r=
oom have the ability to enforce the law and keep their communities safe.=20=




A few minutes ago, I signed into law a package of bills to protect and ho=
nor our law enforcement officers, including one that will help state and =
local departments buy more bulletproof vests.=20



Emerson once said, there is always safety in valor. The public safety off=
icers we honor today give those words new meaning, for its your courage a=
nd quick thinking that gave us our safety.=20



So we want to thank you for your service. We want to thank your families =
for your sacrifice. I had a chance before I came out here to meet with th=
e recipients, and I told them that, although this particular moment for w=
hich you are being honored is remarkable, we also know that every day you=
 go out there youve got a tough job. And we could not be prouder of not o=
nly moments like the ones we recognize here today, but just the day-to-da=
y grind -- you're doing your jobs professionally; you're doing your jobs =
with character. We want you to know we could not be prouder of you, and w=
e couldn't be prouder of your families for all the contributions that you=
 make.=20



So may God bless you and your families. May God bless our fallen heroes. =
<ay God bless the United States of America.



And its now my honor to award these medals as the citations are read.

<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:<a name=3D"_G=
oBack"></a>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And good morning.&nbsp; Welcome to the W=
hite House.&nbsp; Thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for your words and you=
r leadership.&nbsp; We've got a couple members of Congress here -- Frederic=
a Wilson
 and Chris Collins we want to acknowledge.&nbsp; And I also want to recogni=
ze Director Comey, members of the Fraternal Order of Police, and all the ou=
tstanding law enforcement officials who are here from around the country.&n=
bsp; I&#8217;m proud to stand with you as we celebrate
 Police Week.&nbsp; And most of all, I&#8217;m proud to be with the heroes =
on the front row, and with the families who have supported them -- and the =
family of one who made the ultimate sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">It&#8217;s been said that=
 perfect valor is doing without witnesses what you would do if the whole wo=
rld were watching.&nbsp; The public safety officers we recognize today with=
 the Medal of Valor found courage not in search
 of recognition, they did it instinctively. This is an award that none of t=
hem sought.&nbsp; And if they could go back in time, I suspect they&#8217;d=
 prefer none of this had happened.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As one of today&#8217;s h=
onorees said about his actions, &#8220;I could have very well gone my whole=
 career and not dealt with this situation and been very happy with that.&#8=
221;&nbsp; If they had their way, none of them would have to
 be here, and so we're grateful that they are and our entire nation express=
es its profound gratitude. More important, we're so grateful that they were=
 there -- some on duty, others off duty, all rising above and beyond the ca=
ll of duty.&nbsp; All saving the lives
 of people they didn&#8217;t know.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That distinction -- that =
these 13 officers of valor saved the lives of strangers -- is the first of =
several qualities that they share.&nbsp; But their bravery, if it had not b=
een for their bravery, we likely would have
 lost a lot of people -- mothers,&nbsp; fathers, sons, daughters, friends a=
nd loved ones.&nbsp; Thankfully, they are still with their families today b=
ecause these officers were where they needed to be most, at a critical time=
:&nbsp; At a gas station during a routine patrol.&nbsp;
 In the middle of a busy hospital.&nbsp; In a grocery store.&nbsp; On the c=
ampus of a community college.&nbsp; Near an elementary school where a sheri=
ff&#8217;s deputy&#8217;s own children were students and his wife taught.&n=
bsp; In all of these places, in each of these moments, these officers
 were true to their oaths.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">To a person, each of thes=
e honorees acted without regard for their own safety.&nbsp; They stood up t=
o dangerous individuals brandishing assault rifles, handguns, and knives.&n=
bsp; One officer sustained multiple stab wounds
 while fighting off an assailant.&nbsp; Another endured first-degree burns =
to his arms and face while pulling an unconscious driver from a burning car=
 on a freeway.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Each of them will tell yo=
u, very humbly, the same thing -- they were just doing their jobs.&nbsp; Th=
ey were doing what they had to do, what they were trained to do, like on an=
y other day.&nbsp; The officer who suffered those
 terrible burns -- he left urgent care and went straight to work.&nbsp; He =
had to finish his shift.&nbsp; That sense of duty and purpose is what these=
 Americans embody.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The truth is, it&#8217;s =
because of your courage, sometimes seen, but sometimes unseen, that the res=
t of us can go about living our lives like it&#8217;s any other day.&nbsp; =
Going to work, going to school, spending time with our
 families, getting home safely.&nbsp; We so appreciate our public safety of=
ficers around the country, from our rookie cadets to our role model of an A=
ttorney General.&nbsp; Not everyone will wear the medal that we give today,=
 but every day, so many of our public safety
 officers wear a badge of honor.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The men and women who run=
 toward danger remind us with your courage and humility what the highest fo=
rm of citizenship looks like.&nbsp; When you see students and commuters and=
 shoppers at risk, you don&#8217;t see these civilians
 as strangers.&nbsp; You see them as part of your own family, your own comm=
unity.&nbsp; The Scripture teaches us, you love your neighbor as yourself.&=
nbsp; And you put others&#8217; safety before your own.&nbsp; In your proud=
 example of public service, you remind us that loving our
 country means loving one another.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Today, we also want to ac=
knowledge the profound sacrifices made by your families.&nbsp; And I had th=
e chance to meet some of them and they were all clearly so proud of you, bu=
t we're very proud of them.&nbsp; We know that
 you wait up late, and you&#8217;re worried and you're counting down the mi=
nutes until your loved one walks through the door, safe, after a long shift=
.&nbsp; We know it never gets easier, and we thank you for that.&nbsp; And =
of course, we honor those who didn&#8217;t come home,
 including one hero we honor posthumously today -- Sergeant Robert Wilson I=
II.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">He gave his life when two=
 men opened fire at a video game store where Sergeant Wilson was buying a s=
on a birthday present. To his family who&#8217;s here -- his grandmother, C=
onstance, his brother and sister -- please
 know how deeply sorry we are for your loss, how grateful we are for Sergea=
nt Wilson&#8217;s service.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We also honor the more th=
an 35 who&#8217;ve given their lives in the line of duty so far this year.&=
nbsp; One of them, an officer in Virginia named Ashley Marie Guindon, was t=
aken from us on her very first shift.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I&#8217;ve seen this sacr=
ifice when I&#8217;ve joined some of you at the National Law Enforcement Of=
ficers Memorial not far from here.&nbsp; We read the names carved on these =
walls, and we grieve with the families who carry the
 fallen in their hearts forever.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been moved, deeply, by t=
heir anguish -- but also by their pride in the lives their loved ones lived=
.&nbsp; And in those moments, we&#8217;re reminded of our enduring obligati=
on as citizens -- that they sacrificed so much for --
 that we do right by them and their families.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And medals and ceremonies=
 like today are important, but these aren't enough to convey the true depth=
 of our gratitude.&nbsp; Our words will be hollow if they&#8217;re not matc=
hed by deeds.&nbsp; So our nation has a responsibility
 to support those who serve and protect us and keep our streets safe.&nbsp;=
 We can show our respect by listening to you, learning from you, giving you=
 the resources that you need to do the jobs.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the mission=
 of our police task force, which brought together
 local law enforcement, civil rights and faith leaders, and community membe=
rs to open dialogue and build trust and find concrete solutions that make y=
our jobs safer.&nbsp; Our country needs that right now.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We're going to keep pushi=
ng Congress to move forward [in] a bipartisan way to make our criminal just=
ice system fairer and smarter and more cost-effective, and enhance public s=
afety and ensure the men and women in
 this room have the ability to enforce the law and keep their communities s=
afe.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">A few minutes ago, I sign=
ed into law a package of bills to protect and honor our law enforcement off=
icers, including one that will help state and local departments buy more bu=
lletproof vests.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Emerson once said, &#8220=
;there is always safety in valor.&#8221;&nbsp; The public safety officers w=
e honor today give those words new meaning, for it&#8217;s your courage and=
 quick thinking that gave us our safety.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we want to thank you f=
or your service.&nbsp; We want to thank your families for your sacrifice.&n=
bsp; I had a chance before I came out here to meet with the recipients, and=
 I told them that, although this particular moment
 for which you are being honored is remarkable, we also know that every day=
 you go out there you&#8217;ve got a tough job.&nbsp; And we could not be p=
rouder of not only moments like the ones we recognize here today, but just =
the day-to-day grind -- you're doing your jobs
 professionally; you're doing your jobs with character.&nbsp; We want you t=
o know we could not be prouder of you, and we couldn't be prouder of your f=
amilies for all the contributions that you make.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So may God bless you and =
your families.&nbsp; May God bless our fallen heroes.&nbsp; &lt;ay God bles=
s the United States of America.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
