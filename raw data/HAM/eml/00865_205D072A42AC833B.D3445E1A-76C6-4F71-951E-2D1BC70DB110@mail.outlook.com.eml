Hi all =97 We just got another FLOTUS send added to our calendar so would l=
ike to get these over to the WH as soon as we can this afternoon. Thanks!

Friend --

This year we celebrated six years of the Affordable Care Act, 74 straight m=
onths of private-sector job growth, and the signing of a historic global ag=
reement to fight climate change -- and none of it could have happened witho=
ut you.

Over the years, people like you have pitched in your hard-earned $10 or wha=
tever you could to help Barack and the other Democrats who represent you. Y=
our support has meant so much, and Barack and I are both so grateful.

But we can't get complacent, NAME. There's still so much we can do together=
 and a whole lot at stake in this election.

We've always been able to count on supporters like you. If you can, I hope =
you'll pitch in $10 or more before the monthly deadline on Tuesday.

Thanks so much,

Michelle

Sender: Michelle Obama
Subject:

Here's something you should know about Barack, NAME. No matter what job he'=
s had or THE office he holds, his first priority has always been to make su=
re we're leaving our country and our planet better off for the generations =
to come.

That's why he's so invested in electing the next generation of Democratic l=
eaders in November who will protect and build on everything we've done so f=
ar -- and it's why he's asked for your support.

So today I'm asking, too. If you believe in everything so far, will you pit=
ch in $10 or more and commit to electing Democrats?

LINKS

Your support has always meant so much to Barack and me. I know that the Dem=
ocrats you're helping with your contribution today will feel the same way.

Thanks so much,

Michelle

What does progress look like to you, NAME?

For me, it comes in a million different and sometimes unexpected places. Fr=
om food labels that are being updated and improved for the first time in 20=
 years to inner-city schools with rooftop vegetable gardens where students =
are learning to love having healthier options. These might not be things yo=
u think of when you look back on how far we=92ve come these past seven and =
a half years, but they=92re the pieces that when put together create the bi=
gger whole of the hope and change we worked so hard to bring about.

NAME, I can=92t thank you enough for being on this journey with us. It took=
 every single one of us sharing in this vision and knowing that when we wor=
k together, there=92s no limit to what we can accomplish. We have the capac=
ity to do so much good for so many more people =97 but we need to keep work=
ing for it. Part of that work is electing leaders who can help us continue =
building on the progress we=92ve made together. So if you can, pitch in $10=
 or more before our end-of-month deadline to help us reach our goal:

LINKS

Thank you so much, NAME. We truly wouldn=92t be here without you, and you=
=92re part of a movement that still has so much great work left to do and I=
 can=92t wait to see what=92s next.

Michelle
