Totally fine to offer it to both. 

June did $20k last year so if she did $46,800 she would be in a much better position in terms of her convention experience--hotel room, etc. But definitely worth it to pitch both.

Are we ok to offer one of the 33,400 convention packages if he finishes his 33,400 now or in coming weeks?  Gave 5k so far this year. Know it's meant mainly for "new" max outs for those who've never maxed or haven't in 4 years plus. 

Same question with June Smith. Need to look if she finished max last year.
