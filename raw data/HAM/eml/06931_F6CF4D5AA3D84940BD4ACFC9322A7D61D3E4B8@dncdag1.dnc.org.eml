ROUNDUP

UPDATE

DONALD TRUMP ROUNDUP

HOW FASCISM COMES TO AMERICA: "This is how fascism comes to America, not with jackboots and salutes (although there have been salutes, and a whiff of violence) but with a television huckster, a phony billionaire, a textbook egomaniac 'tapping into' popular resentments and insecurities, and with an entire national political party - out of ambition or blind party loyalty, or simply out of fear - falling into line behind him." [Washington Post, 5/18/16<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/this-is-how-fascism-comes-to-america/2016/05/17/c4e32c58-1c47-11e6-8c7b-6931e66333e7_story.html>]

TRUMP'S TAX TROUBLE - MORE THAN 100 LAWSUITS: "While Donald J. Trump refuses to release his federal tax returns, saying his tax rate is 'none of your business,' a USA TODAY analysis found Trump's businesses have been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and other disputes related to unpaid taxes or how much tax his businesses owe...At least five Trump companies were issued warrants totaling more than $13,000 for late or unpaid taxes in New York state just since Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015, according to state records. This spring, as Trump flew to campaign rallies around the country aboard his trademark private jet, the state of New York filed a tax warrant to try to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes from the Trump-owned company that owns the Boeing 757. The company has since paid that tax bill." [USA Today, 5/19/16<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/05/19/trumps-tax-troubles/84543538/>]

TRUMP GOT $150K FROM A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AFTER 9/11: "Donald Trump made a pretty penny off a program to help small businesses hurt by 9/11, one of many times where The Donald took advantage of government programs to save or make money off the taxpayer. The self-proclaimed billionaire, who has so far refused to release his tax returns, was one of many wealthy individuals and businesses who used a loophole in a program intended to help smaller companies in lower Manhattan recover after the Sept. 11 tragedy. Trump got $150,000 for his swanky property at 40 Wall Street because the Empire State Development Corporation, run by the state, didn't enforce federal guidelines on what defines a small business." [New York Daily News, 5/18/16<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-9-11-funds-program-net-150g-payday-article-1.2641951>]

TRUMP'S TRADE POLICY WOULD COST FAMILIES $2,200 A YEAR: "The tariffs would cost the average household $2,200 a year, or 4% of their after-tax income, according to a new study from the non-profit National Foundation for American Policy conducted by David Tuerck, Paul Bachman and Frank Conte, all of Suffolk University. This is largely because imports under Trump's policy would become more expensive, sending the price of competing American-made goods higher as well. That would effectively levy a consumption tax on purchases and cut into the incomes of shoppers." [CNN, 5/19/16<http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/19/news/economy/trump-tariffs-cost/index.html>]

TRUMP THINKS FERGUSON AND OAKLAND ARE DANGEROUS LIKE IRAQ: "So what's the most dangerous place Trump has been? 'Brooklyn,' Trump replied, joking. And then, apparently serious, he continued: 'There are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously.'" [Washington Post, 5/18/16<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/18/donald-trump-somehow-thinks-ferguson-and-oakland-are-dangerous-like-iraq/>]

TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION / DEPORTATION PLAN SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPERTS: "'I can't even begin to picture how we would deport 11 million people in a few years where we don't have a police state, where the police can't break down your door at will and take you away without a warrant,' said Michael Chertoff, who led a significant increase in immigration enforcement as the secretary of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush. Finding those immigrants would be difficult, experts said. Police officers across the country would need to ask people for proof of residency or citizenship during traffic stops and street encounters. The Border Patrol would need highway checkpoints across the Southwest and near the Canadian border. To avoid racial profiling, any American could expect to be stopped and asked for papers."

TRUMP'S BUSINESS BOOMS DURING RUN ACCORDING TO HIS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES: "The documents, including a lengthy filing released Wednesday and one from last July, show that revenue has increased by almost $190 million, with gains coming from golf courses to branded merchandise to book royalties. At his tony Florida resort Mar-a-Lago, revenue nearly doubled, climbing from about $16 million in 2014 and the first half of 2015 to about $30 million since the start of his campaign, according to the forms. Sales of his licensed bottled-water brand, Trump Ice, are up as well - from $280,000 last year to $413,000 this year, the forms show."

TRUMP DAILY UPDATE

Trump: "I Was A Good Student. I'm Like A Smart Person... I Even Talk About My Uncle Was A Professor At MIT, Just A Highly, Highly Respected Intellect. I Mean, I Come From A Very Smart Family." TRUMP: "You have to be true to yourself. I mean you're -- I was a good student. I'm like a smart person. And, you know, you listen to things, it's so tough. If you're a Republican, especially if you're a conservative Republican, what you go through is incredible. I even talk about my uncle was a professor at MIT, just a highly, highly respected intellect. I mean, I come from a very smart family--  I like to talk about it because conservatives are abused. They're abused by the media, falsely abused, but really abused by the media. But I put so many states into play, Michigan being one, Illinois. States -- I'll tell you what, the state of Washington, I was in Washington last week, the state of Washington. We had crowds that were the biggest they've ever had. They've never had crowds like that. They said it was like an Elton John came and we broke that record. Oregon, nobody would even think about Oregon. I'm going to campaign there. These are states that are locks for the Democrats." [Hannity, Fox News, 5/18/16]

Trump On Ben Rhodes: "He Should Be Fired, Maybe More Than Fired." HANNITY: "Republicans have said that Ben Rhodes who now has admitted he manipulated, he lied, he used propaganda to sell that bad Iranian deal and manipulating people in the media in particular, he also, by the way, if you go back to the "Wall Street Journal," the whole you tube video narrative as it relates to Benghazi, he started that lie. Should he be fired?" TRUMP: "He should be fired, maybe more than fired. First of all, the Iranian deal is one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated. I'm not talking about countries. I'm talking about one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated." [Hannity, Fox News, 5/18/16]


Education

The Trump Campaign Was Preparing "Revolutionary" Education Proposals That Would Upend The Current Student Loans System, Force Colleges To Share In Student Loan Risk, And Make It More Difficult For Liberal Arts Students To Obtain Student Loans. "Donald Trump has been quiet about higher education policy during his triumphant march through the Republican presidential primaries. That could be ending soon. Sam Clovis, the national co-chair and policy director of Trump's campaign, outlined for Inside Higher Ed the ideas that the presumptive GOP nominee is preparing to put forth. While final decisions have not been made on when the ideas will be formally unveiled, not to mention many details worked out, Clovis said the Trump campaign expects higher education to be a major issue in the fall general election. Some of the ideas under consideration could be 'revolutionary,' Clovis said. Proposals currently being prepared would upend the current system of student loans, force all colleges to share the risk of such loans and make it harder for those wanting to major in the liberal arts at nonelite institutions to obtain loans. And even if some of the proposals would face a skeptical Congress, these ideas could gain considerable attention if Trump uses them to parry with his Democratic opponent." [Inside Higher Ed, 5/13/16<https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/13/trumps-campaign-co-chair-describes-higher-education-policies-being-developed?utm_source=slate&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=partner>]

Trump Opposed Proposals For Free Community College And Free Higher Education. "Clovis is a tenured professor of economics at Morningside College, a small private college in Iowa, who is currently on leave to work for the Trump campaign. Some of Clovis's recent pronouncements on Trump policies have been widely criticized by Washington experts as unworkable or unrealistic. And Clovis said he expects some higher education leaders to react the same way as Trump outlines these ideas in the fall campaign. He said the campaign remains open to ideas as long as they put the emphasis on student success in ways that have more impact than efforts of past administrations. First off, Clovis made clear that the Trump campaign will fight and not endorse Hillary Clinton's proposal for debt-free public higher education or the Bernie Sanders plan for free public higher education. The response on those ideas will be 'unequivocally no,' Clovis said. 'How do you pay for that? It's absurd on its surface.' Further, Trump will also reject President Obama's proposals for a state-federal partnership to make community college free for new high school graduates. Community colleges are 'damn near free' now, and 'almost anyone can afford community college,' he said."

*         Trump Campaign Co-Chair, Sam Clovis, Said Trump Rejected Obama's Proposal For Free Community College Because "Almost Anyone Can Afford Community College" Already.

The Trump Campaign Planned A Complete Overhaul Of The Federal Student Loan System To Make It "Market Driven" And Increase Colleges' "Skin In The Game." "Many of the ideas on which the Trump campaign is working involve a complete overhaul of the federal student loan system, moving the government out of lending and restoring that role to private banks, as was the case before President Clinton partially and President Obama fully shifted loan origination from private lenders to the government. 'We think it should be marketplace and market driven,' he said. Local banks should be lending to local students, he said, but colleges should be playing a role in determining loan worthiness on factors that go beyond family income. Further, he said that all colleges should have 'skin in the game' and share the risk associated with student loans. Many in Congress (and not just Republicans) have voiced support for that idea. But many Democrats have argued that some institutions -- historically black colleges or community colleges, for example -- should be exempt, given their histories of educating many students from low-income families who may not have the financial resources of others. But Clovis said that the principle of colleges sharing risk must apply to all institutions." [Inside Higher Ed, 5/13/16<https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/13/trumps-campaign-co-chair-describes-higher-education-policies-being-developed?utm_source=slate&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=partner>]

The Trump Campaign Planned Student Loan Reforms To Allow Colleges And Banks To Make Loan Decisions Based On Students' Majors And Likely Future Earnings. "Many of the ideas on which the Trump campaign is working involve a complete overhaul of the federal student loan system, moving the government out of lending and restoring that role to private banks, as was the case before President Clinton partially and President Obama fully shifted loan origination from private lenders to the government... Further, he said that the risk needs to be substantial enough to change the way colleges decide whether to admit students, and which programs they offer. Clovis said he hoped many colleges would continue to provide remediation for those unprepared for college-level work, although he said that he preferred the term 'student success programs' to remediation. But he said that colleges should not be admitting students that they aren't confident can graduate in a reasonable time frame and find jobs. That means a shift in who is involved in deciding on student loans, with less emphasis on parent contributions and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and more of 'a partnership' between the student, the bank and the college. 'We think if the college has real skin in the game, it will change its model.' And these reforms would make it legitimate for colleges and banks to make decisions in part on students' prospective majors and their likely earnings after graduation, he said. 'If you are going to study 16th-century French art, more power to you. I support the arts,' Clovis said. 'But you are not going to get a job.' A college should factor that in when deciding on a student's loan eligibility, and the requirement that colleges share the risk would be a powerful incentive to do so, Clovis added. 'If you get into the esoteric aspects of a particular art field, you have to know that those are the circumstances,' he said. And Clovis said this does not mean the Trump campaign is against the liberal arts. 'The liberal arts education is the absolute foundation to success in life,' Clovis said, adding that he hoped business and engineering and health professions and education students would include liberal arts courses in their college educations. But it is a different thing altogether, Clovis said, to focus on such fields. 'If you choose to major in the liberal arts, there are issues associated with that.'" [Inside Higher Ed, 5/13/16<https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/13/trumps-campaign-co-chair-describes-higher-education-policies-being-developed?utm_source=slate&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=partner>]

The Trump Campaign's Planned Education Reforms Would Make It More Difficult For Students Pursing Liberal Arts Degrees To Secure Student Loans. "And these reforms would make it legitimate for colleges and banks to make decisions in part on students' prospective majors and their likely earnings after graduation, he said.

But it is a different thing altogether, Clovis said, to focus on such fields. 'If you choose to major in the liberal arts, there are issues associated with that.' There may be colleges that decide they are comfortable backing loans for students who study the liberal arts. A prestigious college could legitimately decide that anyone it graduates -- regardless of major -- will do well in life, and so go ahead with approving the borrowing. 'If you go to Harvard, you can major in anything you want, and once you get in the door, you'll be OK,' Clovis said, so such a college might be fine with its students borrowing to study the liberal arts. 'But not all colleges are in the same system,' he said." [Inside Higher Ed, 5/13/16<https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/13/trumps-campaign-co-chair-describes-higher-education-policies-being-developed?utm_source=slate&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=partner>]

Trump Planned To Look Into Removing Functions From The Department Of Education, Including Potentially Moving Its Office For Civil Rights Into The Department Of Justice. "The Obama administration has also been notable for overseeing many more investigations of colleges on how they handle sex assaults and for guidance that has encouraged colleges to take tougher stances in investigating alleged assaults. Clovis did not comment on those investigations per se, but said that one idea the campaign might propose would be to move the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights to join the civil rights division of the Department of Justice. 'Once we get into office, we're going to take a hard look at the Department of Education,' he said. 'There are lots of things that serve people well, but there are many operations that do not. Civil rights is an important aspect of everything,' but students and colleges might get 'better guidance and effectiveness' if we put it all 'under one tent' at the Justice Department.'"

Campaign Staff

Paul Manafort Was Named Trump Campaign Chairman And Chief Strategist. "Donald Trump will change the role for one of his campaign's top advisors, ABC News has learned. Sources within the campaign said that Trump will name Paul Manafort to the new role of Campaign Chairman and Chief Strategist. Manafort, who was brought on board early last month as a convention manager, was originally tasked with trying to secure Trump the necessary delegates to avoid a fight at the Republican convention. With Trump now the likely presumptive nominee for the GOP, Manafort's new role is a natural growth of the campaign as they begin to build a team ready for the general election, according to the sources. The role is an obvious promotion for Manafort, but sources stressed it should not be seen as a demotion for campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks confirmed the move, adding that Lewandowski will, 'continue overseeing day to day operations and will work with Manafort on political strategy and communications, among other things, through the general election.'"

Trump Supported A Bill To Allow The Families Of 9/11 Victims To Sue Saudi Arabia. HANNITY: "All right, so there's a bill that passed unanimously because we have these 28 redacted pages from the Commission report on 9/11. And it appears that the Saudis had connections to and may have financially assisted those people that attacked our country. Now, they said they passed a vote unanimously. The president won't sign it. Shouldn't America have the right to see those pages, and should those families have the right to sue? And what would you do if you were president?" TRUMP: "The answer is yes, they should. And, you know, we got into a war in Iraq that I was totally opposed to. But Iraq did not knock down the World Trade Center, Sean. So we fought -- and they didn't have weapons of mass destruction either, by the way. And you look at what's happened since then and it's been a disaster. And the way Obama got out was a total catastrophe. And just look at what's happening. But the answer is yes, we have to get to the bottom of it. And everybody wants to keep it quiet. Everybody wants to keep it secret. I don't -- I think most people know pretty much what's on those papers, but people do have the right to sue and they should have the right to sue.

HEADLINE: "Six Reasons Why Trump Meeting With Kim Jong Un Is A Very Bad Idea." [Foreign Policy, 5/18/16<http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/18/six-reasons-why-trump-meeting-with-kim-jong-un-is-a-very-bad-idea/?wp_login_redirect=0>]

Trump's Plan To Meet With Kim Jung Un Would Legitimize North Korea's Nuclear Status, Harm Allies' Confidence In Deterrence, And Set Back The Growing Criticism Of North Korea's Human Rights Record. "A presidential summit would legitimize the North's nuclear status. Pyongyang has declared that it would be prepared to enter into arms control negotiations with the United States as a fellow nuclear weapons state. The United States would have to acknowledge Pyongyang's nuclear weapons status, cease sanctions, end the nuclear umbrella over Japan and South Korea, end criticism of the North's human rights abuses, and have the president personally guarantee these commitments in an agreement with the North Korean leader. These have been the North's demands since at least 2002, when I was with our delegation as we confronted the regime with evidence of its cheating on the previous Agreed Framework. Our allies would lose confidence in extended deterrence. If the plan is to get Tokyo and Seoul to go nuclear, this would be an effective shortcut. In the past, Trump said he would be open to this, but I doubt he really meant it. Kim would control the reality show. Kim Jong Un does not do summits outside of North Korea, even with erstwhile ally China. And as Madeleine Albright, Jimmy Carter, and numerous other leaders have found, Kim will stage-manage the show to ensure maximum propaganda advantage for his regime. The narrative would be that of a tribute mission to the Great Marshall. This is not like holding the Miss Universe contest in Moscow. The summit would cause despair for millions of suffering North Koreans. North Korea's horrific human rights record has finally seen a growing crescendo of criticism, including a damning report by a United Nations commission of inquiry, U.S. legislation, and greater pressure from Asia and Europe. The North would use a U.S. presidential summit to dissipate that momentum and to deflate the meager hope growing in the hearts of the North Korean people."

They worry that the New York real-estate mogul may not have the temperament or experience to handle sensitive security information with discretion... 'I'd use the word vanilla' to describe the information given to the candidates, said Riedel, who briefed President George H.W. Bush.

Trump Claimed When He Said There "Has To Be Some Form Of Punishment" For Women Who Have Abortions, He Really Meant "Women Punish Themselves." "Trump told The New York Times magazine in an interview published Wednesday that when he said in March that there 'has to be some form of punishment' for women who have abortions if the procedure were to be made illegal, he meant 'women punish themselves' if they have a termination.

Miss New Hampshire 2000 Likened Trump To A "Creepy Uncle" And Recalled A "Time That He Walked Through The Dressing Rooms Was Really Shocking. We Were All Naked." "The pageant world, a heady mixture of business and beauty, was one place where Trump dealt with women, many of whom desperately wanted to win a crown. This winter, we spoke to more than a dozen former contestants and several former staffers, and we read hundreds of pages of legal documents. That dive into the pageant world didn't produce the sort of clear picture that either Trump or his enemies would like to project. Many women, including several who say they are disgusted with Trump's campaign rhetoric, said their experiences were positive; they said they were treated professionally and with respect... Bridget Sullivan, 35, mother and model, Miss New Hampshire 2000, first runner-up Miss USA. She said that while the staff of Miss Universe was great overall, she found Donald Trump unsettling. When she first met him at a party in New York held to promote the contest, 'he'd hug you just a little low on your back,' she said, and give you 'a squeeze that your creepy uncle would.' While preparing for the national broadcast in 2000, Trump came backstage to wish the contestants good luck, even though many of the women weren't dressed. 'The time that he walked through the dressing rooms was really shocking. We were all naked,' Sullivan said. We spoke with four other contestants from that year, none of whom remembered Trump walking through the dressing room when contestants were naked."

Trump Tapped A.B. Culvahouse Jr. To Run His Vice Presidential Vetting Process. "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has tapped lawyer A.B. Culvahouse Jr., a longtime Washington fixture, to help vet his vice presidential picks, according to people familiar with the campaign. The role for Culvahouse, who visited Trump Tower in Manhattan earlier Wednesday for a meeting with Trump's aides, is a familiar one. He ran the vetting process for Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008 that ultimately selected Sarah Palin. Trump has said publicly that he's relying on multiple people to recommend vice presidential picks, including campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and one-time rival Ben Carson, though neither has the legal qualifications that are essential to the vetting process.  Trump, who is expected to announce a running mate at the GOP convention in July, has narrowed his shortlist to five or six candidates with 'deep political resumes,' he told the Associated Press last week. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, is being considered, people close to the campaign said. Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey has not been ruled out, Trump has said, though a poll today showed that such a ticket would be deeply unpopular in the state. From 1987 to 1989, Culvahouse served as White House counsel to President Ronald Reagan, helping to handle the failed Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork.

Donald Trump Refused Suggestions From Political Advisers To Hire A Professional To Investigate Trump's Past. "For most major presidential campaigns, it is a routine act: you conduct opposition research on your own candidate. The reason is obvious; campaign officials and candidates want to know what they might have to contend with once the you-know-what starts flying. But not Donald Trump. At least not at the start of the campaign that would lead to him becoming the presumptive GOP nominee. According to a source with direct knowledge, when Trump was considering entering the presidential race early last year, his political advisers, including Corey Lewandowski, who would become his campaign manager, suggested that Trump hire a professional to investigate his past. But the celebrity mogul said no and refused to pay for it. Marital infidelity, connections to mob-related persons, bankruptcies, the hiring of undocumented workers, policy flip-flops, deals gone bad, legal troubles-Trump's life is an opposition researcher's dream. That was no secret to his political lieutenants, who prior to his announcement discussed the need to conduct a deep dive into the tycoon's background. The point was to go beyond Googling and perusing the many books written on Trump-and mount a full forensic examination of everything Donald. Especially before anyone else did. (Trump's aides had heard a rumor that wealthy conservative donors, perhaps including the Koch Brothers, were underwriting a private opposition research effort aimed at the former reality TV star.)"

The Trump Campaign Wrote Memos Preparing Responses To Trump's Potential Vulnerabilities Including His 1999 Proposal For A Net Worth Tax, Past Donations To Democrats, Outsourcing  His Clothing Line To China, Avoiding The Vietnam War Draft, His Businesses' Bankruptcies, And His Lack Of A Plan To Defeat ISIS. "Though Trump would not authorize an extensive research effort to identify what oppo might be most harmful to his candidacy, his campaign did prepare responses to obvious lines of attack against the billionaire. Mother Jones reviewed one campaign memo outlining possible replies to expected assaults, but most of these topics were policy and political matters already in the public realm. What about Trump's 1999 proposal to raise taxes on the well-to-do? Trump merely had proposed a one-time fix designed to erase the national debt, a move that showed that Trump possessed the foresight to see that deficits would become a major problem. What about his past donations to Democrats? Trump was supporting incumbents of both parties as an act of civic participation, and since 2011 he has only contributed to Republicans. What about Trump manufacturing his clothing line in China? He had played no role in the decision to out-source, and China was picked because US regulation and red tape made it too expensive to manufacture goods in the United States. What about his failure to serve in the military? Trump had received student deferments, and as a graduate of a military academy he has been a strong proponent of the US military and veterans. This memo covered numerous issues. What about the bankruptcies filed by his companies? Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy. What about Trump's previous support for universal healthcare? Trump has always called for a market-based system and has been an ardent opponent of Obamacare. What about Trump saying he has a plan to defeat ISIS but refusing to provide details? Trump does not want to tell ISIS in advance how he will defeat it; that would put US soldiers at risk. What about Trump's support for the TARP bailout of the big banks? Trump believed TARP was necessary to stabilize the global financial system but came to conclude the program was poorly administered. What about Trump's previous support for Jeb Bush, whom he once called the kind of political leader the United States needs? The Bush presidencies have been failures, Jeb Bush governed Florida as a typical politician who bowed to lobbyists and special interests, and it's time to make America great again."

Trump Was Friends With Finance Mogul Jeffrey Epstein, Who Was Arrested In 2006 For Soliciting Paid Sex With A Minor. "One subject on the mind of Trump's advisers was Jeffrey Epstein, the finance mogul who was arrested in 2006 and subsequently pled guilty to having solicited paid sex with a minor. He ultimately served 13 months in prison and had to register as a sex offender. (Several years ago, alleged Epstein victims filed a lawsuit against the US government claiming Epstein received too sweet a plea bargain.) Trump's advisers didn't know of anything in particular to worry about. But they knew that Trump had been linked to his fellow Palm Beach resident. In 2002, Trump had said of Epstein, 'I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it-Jeffrey enjoys his social life.' Epstein had occasionally visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump's estate and club down the road from Epstein's mansion. Trump also had flown on Epstein's plane and had dined at his house. And Virginia Roberts, an alleged Epstein victim who tried to join the civil lawsuit, maintaining that Epstein kept her as a sex slave for several years when she was a teenager, was working at Mar-a-Lago as a changing room assistant when she was recruited, at age 15, to be a masseuse for Epstein. (A judge recently denied Roberts' bid to become a plaintiff in the case.) Trump has downplayed his association with Epstein. But these connections would be enough to cause any senior campaign staffer to want a full examination. 'This vetting process was not for the purpose of looking at Epstein specifically,' a Trump insider says. 'It was to be an audit to see what could be found on anything.' (Conservatives have pointed to Bill Clinton's friendship with Epstein-he often was a passenger on Epstein's private plane-as possible ammunition to be used in the 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton.)"

National Foundation For American Policy Study: Trump's Proposed Tariff's Would Cost The Average Household 4% Of Their After-Tax Income. "Trump has repeatedly said America has been on the losing end of trade deals for years. In his view, the tariffs would level the playing field by making imports more expensive. That, in turn, would prompt American companies to produce more domestically and bring back jobs. Experts, however, say boosting tariffs would be a bad deal for Americans, particularly for the poor. The tariffs would cost the average household $2,200 a year, or 4% of their after-tax income, according to a new study from the non-profit National Foundation for American Policy conducted by David Tuerck, Paul Bachman and Frank Conte, all of Suffolk University. This is largely because imports under Trump's policy would become more expensive, sending the price of competing American-made goods higher as well. That would effectively levy a consumption tax on purchases and cut into the incomes of shoppers." [CNN Money, 5/19/16<http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/19/news/economy/trump-tariffs-cost/index.html>]

Trump's Plan To Mass Deport 11 Million Undocumented Immigrants Lacked Specifics, And Experts Said It Would Have Astronomical Costs. "Donald J. Trump's vow to restore what he says is America's lost luster, while perhaps not as flowery, comes with campaign promises that are equally grandiose. But Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has typically provided scant details on how he might make good on his promises - and ambitious ideas, even the concrete kind, do not always add up. Central to Mr. Trump's campaign, and to his national security strategy, is his intent to clamp down on illegal immigration, using a vast deportation 'force' to relocate people to the other side of a wall, funded by Mexico, that would stretch nearly the length of the southern border. Mr. Trump has suggested he will flesh out his ideas in a forthcoming speech. But experts across many fields who have analyzed his plans so far warn that they would come at astronomical costs - whoever paid - and would in many ways defy the logic of science, engineering and law. Mass deportations: Adding chaos to dysfunction. Mr. Trump has a simple plan to reduce the population of 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States: Deport them. How? He says he would follow the example of the military-style roundups authorized by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954. The initiative, known as Operation Wetback, expelled hundreds of thousands of Mexicans. Mr. Trump contends that the start of deportations would show immigrants he meant business and prompt many to leave on their own, and that it would take about two years to finish the job. There, the specifics end." [New York Times, 5/19/16<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/us/politics/donald-trump-immigration.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share&_r=1>]

Former Bush Administration Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff: "I Can't Even Begin To Picture How We Would Deport 11 Million People In A Few Years Where We Don't Have A Police State, Where The Police Can't Break Down Your Door At Will And Take You Away Without A Warrant." "Former senior immigration and border officials are skeptical, to put it mildly. Deportations have peaked recently at about 400,000 a year, so the increase in scale to reach Mr. Trump's goal would be exponential. And many legal procedures and constitutional constraints on the police did not exist in the Eisenhower era. 'I can't even begin to picture how we would deport 11 million people in a few years where we don't have a police state, where the police can't break down your door at will and take you away without a warrant,' said Michael Chertoff, who led a significant increase in immigration enforcement as the secretary of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush." [New York Times, 5/19/16<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/us/politics/donald-trump-immigration.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share&_r=1>]

Trump Claimed His Planned Border Wall With Mexico Would Cost Around $10 Billion. "Mr. Trump has promised that the wall will be big, beautiful, tall and strong. Spanning 1,000 miles along the southern border, it will stem the flow of immigrants bringing drugs and crime. And, yes, Mexico will pay for the Great Wall of Trump, as he has called it. But the wall - symbolic of an iron-fisted immigration policy and providing a rallying cry for his supporters - has proved to be as divisive in theory as it would be in practice. And experts in domestic security, immigration policy and civil engineering say that building it would be a daunting task and cause more problems than it would solve. Mr. Trump has shared few details. He has said that the wall would be built from precast concrete and steel and that it could be 50 feet tall, if not higher. After calling for it to extend across the entire 2,000-mile southern border, he more recently said half that length could be sufficient because of natural barriers. He has pegged the cost at $4 billion to $12 billion, most recently settling on around $10 billion." [New York Times, 5/19/16<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/us/politics/donald-trump-immigration.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share&_r=1>]

Wall-Building Experts Said Trump's Cost Estimate Was Far Too Low, With One Estimating The Cost Would Be At Least $26 Billion. "After calling for it to extend across the entire 2,000-mile southern border, he more recently said half that length could be sufficient because of natural barriers. He has pegged the cost at $4 billion to $12 billion, most recently settling on around $10 billion. Some see that as low. 'There's a lot of logistics involved in this, and I don't know how thoroughly they've thought it out,' said Todd Sternfeld, chief executive of Superior Concrete, a Texas-based builder of walls. 'The resources alone would be astronomical.' Mr. Sternfeld, who has led major wall projects across the country and approached the Trump family last summer, suggested that Mr. Trump was overly optimistic about the cost and was underestimating the complexity of the undertaking. Running the numbers, Mr. Sternfeld said a 40-foot-tall concrete wall using a 'post and panel' system that went 10 feet below the ground - to minimize tunneling - would cost at least $26 billion. The logistics would be nightmarish, including multiple concrete casting sites and temporary housing for a crew of 1,000 workers if the job were to be completed within Mr. Trump's first four-year term."

Trump's Proposed Border Wall Would Violate A 50-Year-Old Treaty With Mexico If It Obstructed Or Diverted The Flow Of Waterways. "Billions of gallons flow between the United States and Mexico, funneling lifeblood to farms and communities on both sides of the border. The Colorado River sends water south; the Rio Grande, a natural boundary for hundreds of miles, delivers precious water from Mexico, through dozens of canals, to much of South Texas. Water experts in the Southwest question how Mr. Trump's border wall could accommodate those crucial flows and still provide the barrier he wants. Another complication is that a nearly 50-year-old treaty between Mexico and the United States prevents any construction that obstructs or diverts the flow of the waterways. The wall, in other words, could not interfere in any way with the flow of water in either direction."

Should we allow private contractors to do what TSA apparently is not up to doing?" TRUMP: "In my opinion you probably should, because--  You have to be very strong with them though. You have to watch them very carefully, but you probably should, because what I'm hearing is the level of security or the level of checking is not what it should be. Despite that, how does the government run something so big? If you think about it, if you had an airline and they had three booths and they had people coming in, it would be I think a much more efficient system--  It should be a much better system.

5/10/16: Trump Campaign Manager, Corey Lewandowski, And Communications Director, Hope Hicks, Met With Officials From The White House Correspondents Association (WHCA) Last Tuesday To Discuss Creating A Protective Press Pool. "Journalists and Donald Trump's campaign have begun discussions about setting up a more traditional method of covering his candidacy now that he is the presumptive Republican nominee. According to a source familiar with the meeting, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and communications director Hope Hicks met with officials from the White House Correspondents Association (WHCA) last Tuesday to discuss the mechanics of creating what is known as a protective pool - a rotating group of journalists who follow the candidate's every move and report on his or her activities even on days with no public events. The selected journalists, or 'poolers,' circulate to a wide group of outlets regular reports with up-to-the-minute information on the candidate's movements and interactions similar to how the press covers the president. Poolers travel with the candidate wherever he or she goes in the candidate's motorcade and aboard the campaign's plane."

Forming A Press Pool For Trump Could Be Made Difficult By His Unconventional Campaign Style And Tight Control Over Press Covering Him. "Historically, a protective pool is formed at some point after a candidate becomes a presumptive nominee. Mitt Romney agreed to protective pool coverage in August 2012. During the 2008 campaign, a protective pool was formed around Barack Obama in June and around John McCain in July. Once a candidate has a protective pool, his or her every movement can be dissected by the press. As it stands, Trump has favored an unconventional campaigning style with large scheduled rallies - instead of fundraising or retail-style events with voters - that wouldn't normally be pooled... Forming a protective pool to cover Trump could prove to be difficult given the candidate's and his campaign's treatment of the press covering him thus far. The campaign has severely limited the access reporters have at Trump's events, confining journalists to a pen during his speeches and barring them from approaching the rope line as he exits. Trump's tightly controlled press operation differs from many campaigns - a small group of aides, and Trump himself, reportedly handle many inquiries. The campaign has also refused to credential several outlets (including BuzzFeed News)."

Potential Tax Cheating And Fraud Would Be More Clearly Manifest In What Trump Left Off His Tax Returns Than What Was Contained In The Returns. "There is an adage among longtime prosecutors and criminal defense attorneys that says, 'A prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich.' What the adage doesn't mention is that often the easiest-to-indict, juiciest ham sandwiches are wealthy real estate developers-the ones with overinflated egos and enduring senses of entitlement-people exactly like Donald J. Trump. As a former 27-year defense attorney, I can tell you the opportunities for tax abuse in this crowd are as predictable as they are inviting. Trump has been waffling recently on whether he'll release his tax returns, which has prompted much speculation about what he might be hiding in them. People have mentioned potential crooked real estate deals, an embarrassingly low tax rate and foreign investments. But their searches will lead nowhere. If you want to discover fraud, don't bother plumbing the depths of his real estate deals. The thousands of pages of mumbo jumbo associated with one hotel deal or another probably don't reveal anything. These finances are handled by attorneys and accountants on both sides and are pretty routine. And you cannot embarrass Trump by pointing to his likely next-to-zero tax rate. As a real estate developer, Trump undoubtedly uses every lawful financial tool available to bring his taxes as close as possible to zero. More power to him; that is the American way. Foreign investments? Plainly, he will just blame those on the Democrats. No, none of these areas is likely to bear any fruit. That's because, to expose a wrong-hearted real estate developer as a tax cheat, it is often more important to focus not on what the developer reports on his returns, but on what he leaves off." [Politico Magazine, 5/18/16<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-tax-returns-2016-213901#ixzz496oUOc8U>]



Trump's Tax Returns Would Potentially Show Avoiding Personal Expenses By Having His Companies Pick Up The Tab. "No, none of these areas is likely to bear any fruit. That's because, to expose a wrong-hearted real estate developer as a tax cheat, it is often more important to focus not on what the developer reports on his returns, but on what he leaves off. You see, the goal of tax cheats is usually not to save money for some corporation, but to avoid using their own shekels to pay for personal expenses. Why pay for their own homes, food, golf rounds, cars or flights-or the taxes thereon-when their companies can pick up the tab? But personal expenses charged to a company counts as compensation, and failing to report such perks as taxable income is illegal. This kind of personal and professional line-blurring is a hallmark of the real estate tax cheat-those people who control whole construction firms, golf courses and hotel crews and who don't get 1099s and W-2s for all the work they order and the perks they get. Perhaps the most famous example of this kind of fraud comes from New York real estate billionaire Leona Helmsley, who, in 1989 was convicted of having her real estate company pay for personal improvements, including a new dance floor, at her 21-room weekend home in Connecticut, without paying taxes on such benefits. (Helmsley, by the way, is famous for saying, 'We don't pay taxes. Only little guys pay taxes.')" [Politico Magazine, 5/18/16<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-tax-returns-2016-213901#ixzz496oUOc8U>]



Trump's Tax Returns Would Reveal Whether He Personally Paid For Mar-A-Lago In 1985, And Whether He Paid For Improvements To His "Private Quarters" At The Resort. "Any scrutiny should focus first on Mar-A-Largo, Trump's weekend and vacation oasis in Palm Beach, Florida, and former estate of Marjorie Merriweather Post. As the East Coast financial elite will attest, having a second home for leisure in Palm Beach is a pretty expensive luxury. Trump explains the financial status of Mar-A-Largo on the home page of the Mar-A-Largo website: 'Since purchasing this landmark in 1985, I spend many weekends and holidays at this home away from home. When I made it a club in 1995, (126 rooms made it a very big house), I kept private quarters and designed the club to provide the best amenities possible for our members.' The relevant questions are few and should be quite easy for Trump to answer and to prove: Did Trump pay personally when he bought Mar-A-Largo in 1985? During the time that it was his personal vacation residence from 1985-1995, did his company deduct any of the acquisition costs, real estate taxes, insurance or utilities as a corporate expense? In other words, did he and his family alone live in this vacation home for 10 years while having the government and the rest of us pay for all or some as a business expense? Or, if a corporation bought Mar-A-Largo and provided it as a corporate perk, did Trump pay taxes on the benefit? For the past 20 years since Mar-A-Largo has functioned as a club, how much has Trump personally paid for his 'private quarters,' his 'home away from home,' any improvements thereto, and for his staff, food and golf in Palm Beach? Once again, were these amenities provided as a corporate perk? If so, did Trump pay the millions of dollars that would be owed in taxes on this income?"

Trump's Tax Returns Would Show Whether He Or His Company Paid For His Condo In Trump Tower. "Second, his primary residence at Trump Tower: Did Trump personally pay for his condo, and does he pay for the condo fees, utilities, improvements and expenses? If not-if the company pays-does he report that on his tax return?"

Trump's Tax Returns Would Show Whether He Personally Paid For His Air Travel And Paid Taxes On It. "Third, everyone pays for his or her own car or must pay taxes on the personal use of a company car. Tom Daschle, a good and honest man, withdrew himself from consideration as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services when a friend and client claimed that he allowed Daschle part-time use of an extra car, and Daschle hadn't paid taxes on such 'benefit.' Has Trump, like the rest of us, paid for his personal travel? And then, of course, there's personal air travel, which we know Trump does often. Is Trump's plane a personal or corporate jet? If personal, did he pay for the plane and for all of the expenses out of his own pocket? If corporate, has he reimbursed the owner for personal travel or paid the taxes on the perk? The plane records could be gathered in an hour." [Politico Magazine, 5/18/16<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-tax-returns-2016-213901#ixzz496oUOc8U>]



The "Income" Trump Reported In His Personal Financial Disclosure Was Actually Revenue, Rather Than His Businesses Revenues Less Expenses. "On May 18, the Trump campaign filed its second annual Personal Financial Disclosure form (PFD) with the Federal Election Commission. The press statement that accompanied the filing appears, and I really mean appears, to unwrap the enigma by acknowledging what I had suspected all along: That what the Donald's been calling his 'income' is actually revenue. I'll tell you why this matters, but first, a little history. When the Trump campaign the filed the candidate's first (PFD) last July, the press release stated that 'Mr. Trump's income for the year 2014 is $362 million dollars (which does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties).' On the form titled 'Filer's Employment Assets and Income,' Trump fills 35 pages with what's clearly gross receipts from such items as 'condo sales,' 'golf related revenue,' 'commissions,' 'management fees,' and 'sales.' It's the these items that totals $362 million, which Trump claimed as 'income.' That definition conforms to the FEC's requirements. Keep in mind that for almost all other candidates, even the super-rich, 'income' mainly consists of their salaries plus capital gains, dividends, and the like from personal investments. But Trump is essentially reporting as a giant holding company that owns golf courses; rental, office, and condo buildings; brokerage and construction management enterprises. For businesses, 'income' always means revenues less expenses, though different income measures subtract different costs."

Trump Earned Thousands Of Dollars In Bond Interest From Companies He Repeatedly Attacked On The Campaign Trail For Outsourcing, Including Carrier Air Conditioning And The Holding Company For Oreo Cookies. "The 104-page financial disclosure that Donald Trump filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Tuesday offered a rare window into the presumptive Republican nominee's financial holdings - including bonds in companies he has attacked on the campaign trail. Trump has steadfastly refused to release any of his tax returns, claiming that he is undergoing an IRS audit. Doing so is voluntary, although every presidential nominee has since 1976. In contrast, the FEC's financial disclosure is required by law. Trump heralded his disclosure - which covers the last 17 months - by stating that his income was $557m, his business revenues had increased by $190m and that 'Mr Trump's net worth is in excess of $10 billion dollars.' The form, however, does not provide many specific details on Trump's income and liabilities. Instead, they are put in a variety of categories ranging from a 2015 loan for more than $50m to less than $201 in income from his 2007 book Think Big and Kick Ass. But the filing demonstrates a number of interesting investments by Trump. Despite his frequent tirades against Oreo cookies for moving some production to Mexico and his pledge to boycott the popular cookie, Trump earned between $5,000 and $15,000 in interest on bonds in Mondelez, the holding company which owns Oreo. Trump also earned between $2,500 and $5,000 in interest in bonds in United Technologies Corporation, the owner of Carrier Air Conditioning. On the campaign trail in Indiana, Trump repeatedly attacked Carrier for moving manufacturing jobs overseas and out of the state."

Donald Trump's Businesses Have Been Involved In Over 100 Tax-Related Lawsuits And Disputes. "While Donald J. Trump refuses to release his federal tax returns, saying his tax rate is 'none of your business,' a USA TODAY analysis found Trump's businesses have been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and other disputes related to unpaid taxes or how much tax his businesses owe. Trump's companies have been engaged in battles over taxes almost every year from the late 1980s until as recently as March, the analysis of court cases, property records, and other documents across the country shows.

This spring, as Trump flew to campaign rallies around the country aboard his trademark private jet, the state of New York filed a tax warrant to try to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes from the Trump-owned company that owns the Boeing 757. The company has since paid that tax bill." [USA Today, 5/19/16<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/05/19/trumps-tax-troubles/84543538/>]

Donald Trump's Personal Financial Disclosure Showed The Potential For Trump To Benefit Financially From His Presidential Run, As His Income From Branded Merchandise And Book Royalties Rose During His Campaign. "Business has boomed in Donald Trump's financial empire during the time he has run for president, according to an analysis of his federal disclosure forms. The documents, including a lengthy filing released Wednesday and one from last July, show that revenue has increased by what Trump campaign statements say is almost $190 million, with gains coming from golf courses to branded merchandise to book royalties. At his tony Florida resort Mar-a-Lago, revenue nearly doubled, climbing from about $16 million in 2014 and the first half of 2015 to about $30 million since the start of his campaign, according to the forms... The flood of cash highlights one of the most unusual aspects of Trump's candidacy - the potential that a private businessman can benefit financially from a run for the White House. And it shows how his fortunes have evolved since last year, when his controversial comments about immigration and Muslims threatened to tarnish his business brand even if they boosted his political campaign."

8/21/15: Trump Incorporated Four Companies Related To A Potential Hotel Project In Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. "Aug. 21, 2015 was a big day for Donald Trump's emerging presidential campaign. He drew his biggest crowd up to that point - 30,000 fans - to a rally in Mobile, Alabama, promising to repeal Obamacare and end birthright citizenship. Yet Trump wasn't just politicking: On that same day, he incorporated four companies that seem related to a possible hotel project in Jeddah, the second biggest city in Saudi Arabia. He was president and owner of THC Jeddah Hotel Advisor and DT Jeddah Technical Services Advisor. The disclosures do not detail the purpose of those companies, and Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, Trump has named other hotel companies after the cities in which the projects were located. One example: THC Baku Hotel Manager LLC, used while trying to build a hotel in Baku, Azerbaijan. The Jeddah companies came to light in Trump's latest financial disclosure filings with the Federal Election Commission. Those filings also reveal a raft of other projects Trump appears to have pursued during his presidential run - among them a tower in India and two resorts in Indonesia that paid him up to $10 million just to license his name. The revelations highlight the potential challenges Trump may face as he seeks to disentangle his business dealings from his possible future as the head of the U.S. government. Since he announced his candidacy June 16, 2015, Trump has formed at least 46 companies that he controls. Some of the companies are designed merely to hold other entities, sometimes so that another legal entity - not Trump himself - technically has control over the holdings. The companies tied to the apparent project in Saudi Arabia may be the most puzzling: They were incorporated in August but dissolved within months, without any public disclosure about their purpose. Trump's apparent business efforts in Saudi Arabia could raise eyebrows, especially because he said in February that the nation 'blew up the World Trade Center,' an apparent reference to the 9/11 attacks."

Obamacare



Trump Said Obamacare "Almost Worked Out" Because Legislators Almost Allowed Competition Across State Lines. TRUMP: "Everyone knows. You know on Nov. 1, they're going to announce new - the numbers are going to come out for Obamacare. They are going to be catastrophic... It's beyond terrible healthcare. And Obamacare in '17 collapses. Don't forget, Obama pushed everything to '17 because he'll be out on the golf course. He'll be playing a nice round of golf someplace. Obamacare is part of the bubble problem. Now, we're going to terminate Obamacare, and we're going to replace it with something much better and much less expensive... Well, the lines are very important. The lines meaning the state borders. These people are protected from competition. And you go to these states and they have - it's almost like a monopoly in many of the states. You have to get rid of the lines. And they almost did it with Obamacare. It almost worked out."

And in fact, on November 1st, new numbers are coming out, right before the election. They're trying to change the date. They want to make it after the election. And it's going to show the increase necessary to sustain 'Obamacare.' And it's going to be massive. Everyone's talking about it." [Hannity, Fox News, 5/18/16]


Clinton

Trump Said The New York Times' Allegations Against Him About His Conduct Around Women Were "Minor Stuff" And Were Not Comparable To What Bill Clinton Had Done. TRUMP: "But the good thing about this, this sets the table. You know, this sort of sets the stage. People have seen this. People have seen Carrie. They've seen Rowanne. They've seen others now that are coming forward that were mentioned in that story, which, frankly, wasn't even that bad, if you want to know the truth. It's not like I -- I hope that people that haven't read it--  No, no, but I mean -- in one case -- I don't know -- it's, like, minor stuff. I said to one of the women, I said, don't eat -- you shouldn't have a piece of candy, OK?" HANNITY: "I tell my kid that all the time."

Are they going to interview Kathleen Willey? In one case, it's about exposure. In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will." TRUMP: "And rape." HANNITY: "And rape." TRUMP: "And big settlements, massive settlements." HANNITY: "Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars for Paula Jones." TRUMP: "And lots of other things.

Trump Accused The Clintons Of Returning Favors To Companies And Countries For Donations To The Clinton Foundation And Paid Speeches. HANNITY: "The Clinton Foundation, beyond funneling money to a friend labeled by the Secret Service 'Energizer,' a special friend of Bill's, but a more important issue. You talk about abuse of women. You talked about their personal lives. You talked about the smears, slander, besmirchment. Here's a bigger question. The Clinton Foundation took all this money from Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia doesn't let women drive. They can't vote. They can't go out in public without a male relative. They have to get permission to go to school or work, and women are told what to wear. Now, I've never been able to find a quote of Hillary -- the Clinton Foundation took millions from the Saudis -- of her criticizing the mistreatment of women there." TRUMP: "But you have other cases and you have many other cases in there. And, you know, they talk about women and the abuse of women and forget about abuse by him directly. Look at what's going on and look at who gave them a lot of their money. So -- and what did all of these --  What did all of these places where they give millions of dollars for speeches, what did they get? And they got a lot. And you know that and everybody knows that."

I -- I know what you're probably going to see is really, really negative statements having to do with who's she's running against right now, Bernie, because I would imagine she made very positive statements toward Goldman Sachs and all the people that paid her all this money." HANNITY: "She wanted their money." TRUMP: "She wants their money. I mean, she wants this money. And she doesn't want people to see those speeches because if you listen to her, you know, she's going to protect everybody from the big bad banks and the investment bankers.

I'm talking about the whole -- and honestly, she can't negotiate with the Chinese. She can't negotiate with Japan, she can't negotiate with Vietnam. It's not her thing. It's not her thing.

Joan Larsen Was On The Michigan Supreme Court And Served As Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney General During The Bush Administration. "In a press conference today, Governor Rick Snyder officially announced his appointment of University of Michigan legal professor Joan Larsen to the Michigan Supreme Court. From January 2002 through May 2003, Larsen served as deputy assistant U.S. attorney general in the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel. During her tenure, the OLC weakened the rule of law by issuing several legal opinions authorizing torture, indefinite detention, warrantless wiretapping, and other abuses of power.

&#8220;The tariffs would cost the average household $2,200 a year, or 4% of their after-tax income, according to a new study from the non-profit National Foundation for American Policy conducted by David Tuerck, Paul Bachman and Frank Conte, all of Suffolk University.
 This is largely because imports under Trump's policy would become more expensive, sending the price of competing American-made goods higher as well. That would effectively levy a consumption tax on purchases and cut into the incomes of shoppers.&#8221; [CNN,

 work, although he said that he preferred the term &#8216;student success programs&#8217; to remediation. But he said that colleges should not be admitting students that they aren't confident can graduate in a reasonable time frame and find jobs. That means a shift in
 who is involved in deciding on student loans, with less emphasis on parent contributions and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and more of &#8216;a partnership&#8217; between the student, the bank and the college. &#8216;We think if the college has real skin in the

 the North&#8217;s nuclear status. Pyongyang has declared that it would be prepared to enter into arms control negotiations with the United States as a fellow nuclear weapons state. The United States would have to acknowledge Pyongyang&#8217;s nuclear weapons status, cease
 sanctions, end the nuclear umbrella over Japan and South Korea, end criticism of the North&#8217;s human rights abuses, and have the president personally guarantee these commitments in an agreement with the North Korean leader. These have been the North&#8217;s demands
 since at least 2002, when I was with our delegation as we confronted the regime with evidence of its cheating on the previous Agreed Framework. Our allies would lose confidence in extended deterrence. If the plan is to get Tokyo and Seoul to go nuclear, this
 would be an effective shortcut. In the past, Trump said he would be open to this, but I doubt he really meant it. Kim would control the reality show. Kim Jong Un does not do summits outside of North Korea, even with erstwhile ally China. And as Madeleine Albright,
 Jimmy Carter, and numerous other leaders have found, Kim will stage-manage the show to ensure maximum propaganda advantage for his regime. The narrative would be that of a tribute mission to the Great Marshall. This is not like holding the Miss Universe contest
 in Moscow. The summit would cause despair for millions of suffering North Koreans. North Korea&#8217;s horrific human rights record has finally seen a growing crescendo of criticism, including a damning report by a United Nations commission of inquiry, U.S. legislation,
 and greater pressure from Asia and Europe. The North would use a U.S. presidential summit to dissipate that momentum and to deflate the meager hope growing in the hearts of the North Korean people.&#8221; [Foreign Policy,

 some of whom once provided similar briefings, told CNN that the qualities that have propelled Trump to the top of the Republican ticket -- a swaggering stream-of-consciousness speaking style peppered with off-the-cuff zingers -- are exactly the traits raising
 alarm. They worry that the New York real-estate mogul may not have the temperament or experience to handle sensitive security information with discretion&#8230; &#8216;I'd use the word vanilla&#8217; to describe the information given to the candidates, said Riedel, who briefed
 President George H.W. Bush. They are broad overviews, with &#8216;a lot of 'here's what the situation in Syria is, here's how ISIS is doing.' &#8216;&quot; [CNN,

 flying. But not Donald Trump. At least not at the start of the campaign that would lead to him becoming the presumptive GOP nominee. According to a source with direct knowledge, when Trump was considering entering the presidential race early last year, his
 political advisers, including Corey Lewandowski, who would become his campaign manager, suggested that Trump hire a professional to investigate his past. But the celebrity mogul said no and refused to pay for it. Marital infidelity, connections to mob-related
 persons, bankruptcies, the hiring of undocumented workers, policy flip-flops, deals gone bad, legal troubles&#8212;Trump's life is an opposition researcher's dream. That was no secret to his political lieutenants, who prior to his announcement discussed the need
 to conduct a deep dive into the tycoon's background. The point was to go beyond Googling and perusing the many books written on Trump&#8212;and mount a full forensic examination of everything Donald. Especially before anyone else did. (Trump's aides had heard a
 rumor that wealthy conservative donors, perhaps including the Koch Brothers, were underwriting a private opposition research effort aimed at the former reality TV star.)&#8221; [Mother Jones,

 well-to-do? Trump merely had proposed a one-time fix designed to erase the national debt, a move that showed that Trump possessed the foresight to see that deficits would become a major problem. What about his past donations to Democrats? Trump was supporting
 incumbents of both parties as an act of civic participation, and since 2011 he has only contributed to Republicans. What about Trump manufacturing his clothing line in China? He had played no role in the decision to out-source, and China was picked because
 US regulation and red tape made it too expensive to manufacture goods in the United States. What about his failure to serve in the military? Trump had received student deferments, and as a graduate of a military academy he has been a strong proponent of the
 US military and veterans. This memo covered numerous issues. What about the bankruptcies filed by his companies? Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy. What about Trump's previous support for universal healthcare? Trump has always called for a market-based
 system and has been an ardent opponent of Obamacare. What about Trump saying he has a plan to defeat ISIS but refusing to provide details? Trump does not want to tell ISIS in advance how he will defeat it; that would put US soldiers at risk. What about Trump's
 support for the TARP bailout of the big banks? Trump believed TARP was necessary to stabilize the global financial system but came to conclude the program was poorly administered. What about Trump's previous support for Jeb Bush, whom he once called the kind
 of political leader the United States needs? The Bush presidencies have been failures, Jeb Bush governed Florida as a typical politician who bowed to lobbyists and special interests, and it's time to make America great again.&#8221; [Mother Jones,

</b>&#8220;One subject on the mind of Trump's advisers was Jeffrey Epstein, the finance mogul who was arrested in 2006 and subsequently pled guilty to having solicited paid sex with a minor. He ultimately served 13 months in prison and had to register as a sex offender.
 (Several years ago, alleged Epstein victims filed a lawsuit against the US government claiming Epstein received too sweet a plea bargain.) Trump's advisers didn't know of anything in particular to worry about. But they knew that Trump had been linked to his
 fellow Palm Beach resident. In 2002, Trump had said of Epstein, &#8216;I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt
 about it&#8212;Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&#8217; Epstein had occasionally visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump's estate and club down the road from Epstein's mansion. Trump also had flown on Epstein's plane and had dined at his house. And Virginia Roberts, an alleged Epstein
 victim who tried to join the civil lawsuit, maintaining that Epstein kept her as a sex slave for several years when she was a teenager, was working at Mar-a-Lago as a changing room assistant when she was recruited, at age 15, to be a masseuse for Epstein.
 (A judge recently denied Roberts' bid to become a plaintiff in the case.) Trump has downplayed his association with Epstein. But these connections would be enough to cause any senior campaign staffer to want a full examination. &#8216;This vetting process was not
 for the purpose of looking at Epstein specifically,&#8217; a Trump insider says. &#8216;It was to be an audit to see what could be found on anything.&#8217; (Conservatives have pointed to Bill Clinton's friendship with Epstein&#8212;he often was a passenger on Epstein's private plane&#8212;as
 possible ammunition to be used in the 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton.)&#8221; [Mother Jones,

</b>&#8220;Trump has repeatedly said America has been on the losing end of trade deals for years. In his view, the tariffs would level the playing field by making imports more expensive. That, in turn, would prompt American companies to produce more domestically
 and bring back jobs. Experts, however, say boosting tariffs would be a bad deal for Americans, particularly for the poor. The tariffs would cost the average household $2,200 a year, or 4% of their after-tax income, according to a new study from the non-profit
 National Foundation for American Policy conducted by David Tuerck, Paul Bachman and Frank Conte, all of Suffolk University. This is largely because imports under Trump's policy would become more expensive, sending the price of competing American-made goods
 higher as well. That would effectively levy a consumption tax on purchases and cut into the incomes of shoppers.&#8221; [CNN Money,

 comes with campaign promises that are equally grandiose. But Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has typically provided scant details on how he might make good on his promises &#8212; and ambitious ideas, even the concrete kind, do not always add up.
 Central to Mr. Trump&#8217;s campaign, and to his national security strategy, is his intent to clamp down on illegal immigration, using a vast deportation &#8216;force&#8217; to relocate people to the other side of a wall, funded by Mexico, that would stretch nearly the length
 of the southern border. Mr. Trump has suggested he will flesh out his ideas in a forthcoming speech. But experts across many fields who have analyzed his plans so far warn that they would come at astronomical costs &#8212; whoever paid &#8212; and would in many ways defy
 the logic of science, engineering and law. Mass deportations: Adding chaos to dysfunction. Mr. Trump has a simple plan to reduce the population of 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States: Deport them. How? He says he would follow the example
 of the military-style roundups authorized by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954. The initiative, known as Operation Wetback, expelled hundreds of thousands of Mexicans. Mr. Trump contends that the start of deportations would show immigrants he meant business
 and prompt many to leave on their own, and that it would take about two years to finish the job. There, the specifics end.&#8221; [New York Times,

 the ground &#8212; to minimize tunneling &#8212; would cost at least $26 billion. The logistics would be nightmarish, including multiple concrete casting sites and temporary housing for a crew of 1,000 workers if the job were to be completed within Mr. Trump&#8217;s first four-year

 be dissected by the press. As it stands, Trump has favored an unconventional campaigning style with large scheduled rallies &#8212; instead of fundraising or retail-style events with voters &#8212; that wouldn&#8217;t normally be pooled&#8230; Forming a protective pool to cover Trump
 could prove to be difficult given the candidate&#8217;s and his campaign&#8217;s treatment of the press covering him thus far. The campaign has severely limited the access reporters have at Trump&#8217;s events, confining journalists to a pen during his speeches and barring
 them from approaching the rope line as he exits. Trump&#8217;s tightly controlled press operation differs from many campaigns &#8212; a small group of aides, and Trump himself, reportedly handle many inquiries. The campaign has also refused to credential several outlets
 (including BuzzFeed News).&#8221; [BuzzFeed, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/initial-talks-begin-to-form-trump-press-pool?utm_term=.brG6xK6GwM#.rljWoGWzQk">

<p class="DNCBullet"><b>Potential Tax Cheating And Fraud Would Be More Clearly Manifest In What Trump Left Off His Tax Returns Than What Was Contained In The Returns.</b> &#8220;There is an adage among longtime prosecutors and criminal defense attorneys that says,
 &#8216;A prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich.&#8217; What the adage doesn&#8217;t mention is that often the easiest-to-indict, juiciest ham sandwiches are wealthy real estate developers&#8212;the ones with overinflated egos and enduring senses of entitlement&#8212;people exactly like
 Donald J. Trump. As a former 27-year defense attorney, I can tell you the opportunities for tax abuse in this crowd are as predictable as they are inviting. Trump has been waffling recently on whether he&#8217;ll release his tax returns, which has prompted much
 speculation about what he might be hiding in them. People have mentioned potential crooked real estate deals, an embarrassingly low tax rate and foreign investments. But their searches will lead nowhere. If you want to discover fraud, don&#8217;t bother plumbing
 the depths of his real estate deals. The thousands of pages of mumbo jumbo associated with one hotel deal or another probably don't reveal anything. These finances are handled by attorneys and accountants on both sides and are pretty routine. And you cannot
 embarrass Trump by pointing to his likely next-to-zero tax rate. As a real estate developer, Trump undoubtedly uses every lawful financial tool available to bring his taxes as close as possible to zero. More power to him; that is the American way. Foreign
 investments? Plainly, he will just blame those on the Democrats. No, none of these areas is likely to bear any fruit. That&#8217;s because, to expose a wrong-hearted real estate developer as a tax cheat, it is often more important to focus not on what the developer
 reports on his returns, but on what he leaves off.&#8221; [Politico Magazine, <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-tax-returns-2016-213901#ixzz496oUOc8U">

<p class="DNCBullet"><b>Trump&#8217;s Tax Returns Would Potentially Show Avoiding Personal Expenses By Having His Companies Pick Up The Tab.</b> &#8220;No, none of these areas is likely to bear any fruit. That&#8217;s because, to expose a wrong-hearted real estate developer
 as a tax cheat, it is often more important to focus not on what the developer reports on his returns, but on what he leaves off. You see, the goal of tax cheats is usually not to save money for some corporation, but to avoid using their own shekels to pay
 for personal expenses. Why pay for their own homes, food, golf rounds, cars or flights&#8212;or the taxes thereon&#8212;when their companies can pick up the tab? But personal expenses charged to a company counts as compensation, and failing to report such perks as taxable
 income is illegal. This kind of personal and professional line-blurring is a hallmark of the real estate tax cheat&#8212;those people who control whole construction firms, golf courses and hotel crews and who don&#8217;t get 1099s and W-2s for all the work they order
 and the perks they get. Perhaps the most famous example of this kind of fraud comes from New York real estate billionaire Leona Helmsley, who, in 1989 was convicted of having her real estate company pay for personal improvements, including a new dance floor,
 at her 21-room weekend home in Connecticut, without paying taxes on such benefits. (Helmsley, by the way, is famous for saying, &#8216;We don&#8217;t pay taxes. Only little guys pay taxes.&#8217;)&#8221; [Politico Magazine,

 vacation oasis in Palm Beach, Florida, and former estate of Marjorie Merriweather Post. As the East Coast financial elite will attest, having a second home for leisure in Palm Beach is a pretty expensive luxury. Trump explains the financial status of Mar-A-Largo
 on the home page of the Mar-A-Largo website: &#8216;Since purchasing this landmark in 1985, I spend many weekends and holidays at this home away from home. When I made it a club in 1995, (126 rooms made it a very big house), I kept private quarters and designed
 the club to provide the best amenities possible for our members.&#8217; The relevant questions are few and should be quite easy for Trump to answer and to prove: Did Trump pay personally when he bought Mar-A-Largo in 1985? During the time that it was his personal
 vacation residence from 1985-1995, did his company deduct any of the acquisition costs, real estate taxes, insurance or utilities as a corporate expense? In other words, did he and his family alone live in this vacation home for 10 years while having the government
 and the rest of us pay for all or some as a business expense? Or, if a corporation bought Mar-A-Largo and provided it as a corporate perk, did Trump pay taxes on the benefit? For the past 20 years since Mar-A-Largo has functioned as a club, how much has Trump
 personally paid for his &#8216;private quarters,&#8217; his &#8216;home away from home,&#8217; any improvements thereto, and for his staff, food and golf in Palm Beach? Once again, were these amenities provided as a corporate perk? If so, did Trump pay the millions of dollars that
 would be owed in taxes on this income?&#8221; [Politico Magazine, <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-tax-returns-2016-213901#ixzz496oUOc8U">

 Is Trump&#8217;s plane a personal or corporate jet? If personal, did he pay for the plane and for all of the expenses out of his own pocket? If corporate, has he reimbursed the owner for personal travel or paid the taxes on the perk? The plane records could be gathered

<p class="DNCBullet"><b>The &#8220;Income&#8221; Trump Reported In His Personal Financial Disclosure Was Actually Revenue, Rather Than His Businesses Revenues Less Expenses.</b> &#8220;On May 18, the Trump campaign filed its second annual Personal Financial Disclosure form (PFD)
 with the Federal Election Commission. The press statement that accompanied the filing appears, and I really mean appears, to unwrap the enigma by acknowledging what I had suspected all along: That what the Donald&#8217;s been calling his &#8216;income&#8217; is actually revenue.
 I&#8217;ll tell you why this matters, but first, a little history. When the Trump campaign the filed the candidate&#8217;s first (PFD) last July, the press release stated that &#8216;Mr. Trump&#8217;s income for the year 2014 is $362 million dollars (which does not include dividends,
 interest, capital gains, rents and royalties).&#8217; On the form titled &#8216;Filer&#8217;s Employment Assets and Income,&#8217; Trump fills 35 pages with what&#8217;s clearly gross receipts from such items as &#8216;condo sales,&#8217; &#8216;golf related revenue,&#8217; &#8216;commissions,&#8217; &#8216;management fees,&#8217; and
 &#8216;sales.&#8217; It&#8217;s the these items that totals $362 million, which Trump claimed as &#8216;income.&#8217; That definition conforms to the FEC&#8217;s requirements. Keep in mind that for almost all other candidates, even the super-rich, &#8216;income&#8217; mainly consists of their salaries
 plus capital gains, dividends, and the like from personal investments. But Trump is essentially reporting as a giant holding company that owns golf courses; rental, office, and condo buildings; brokerage and construction management enterprises. For businesses,
 &#8216;income&#8217; always means revenues less expenses, though different income measures subtract different costs.&#8221; [Fortune,

<p class="DNCBullet"><b>Trump Earned Thousands Of Dollars In Bond Interest From Companies He Repeatedly Attacked On The Campaign Trail For Outsourcing, Including Carrier Air Conditioning And The Holding Company For Oreo Cookies.</b> &#8220;The 104-page financial
 disclosure that Donald Trump filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Tuesday offered a rare window into the presumptive Republican nominee&#8217;s financial holdings &#8211; including bonds in companies he has attacked on the campaign trail. Trump has steadfastly
 refused to release any of his tax returns, claiming that he is undergoing an IRS audit. Doing so is voluntary, although every presidential nominee has since 1976. In contrast, the FEC&#8217;s financial disclosure is required by law. Trump heralded his disclosure
 &#8211; which covers the last 17 months &#8211; by stating that his income was $557m, his business revenues had increased by $190m and that &#8216;Mr Trump&#8217;s net worth is in excess of $10 billion dollars.&#8217; The form, however, does not provide many specific details on Trump&#8217;s
 income and liabilities. Instead, they are put in a variety of categories ranging from a 2015 loan for more than $50m to less than $201 in income from his 2007 book Think Big and Kick Ass. But the filing demonstrates a number of interesting investments by Trump.
 Despite his frequent tirades against Oreo cookies for moving some production to Mexico and his pledge to boycott the popular cookie, Trump earned between $5,000 and $15,000 in interest on bonds in Mondelez, the holding company which owns Oreo. Trump also earned
 between $2,500 and $5,000 in interest in bonds in United Technologies Corporation, the owner of Carrier Air Conditioning. On the campaign trail in Indiana, Trump repeatedly attacked Carrier for moving manufacturing jobs overseas and out of the state.&#8221; [The

 of 2015 to about $30 million since the start of his campaign, according to the forms&#8230; The flood of cash highlights one of the most unusual aspects of Trump&#8217;s candidacy &#8212; the potential that a private businessman can benefit financially from a run for the White
 House. And it shows how his fortunes have evolved since last year, when his controversial comments about immigration and Muslims threatened to tarnish his business brand even if they boosted his political campaign.&#8221; [Washington Post,

 30,000 fans &#8212; to a rally in Mobile, Alabama, promising to repeal Obamacare and end birthright citizenship. Yet Trump wasn&#8217;t just politicking: On that same day, he incorporated four companies that seem related to a possible hotel project in Jeddah, the second
 biggest city in Saudi Arabia. He was president and owner of THC Jeddah Hotel Advisor and DT Jeddah Technical Services Advisor. The disclosures do not detail the purpose of those companies, and Trump&#8217;s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 In the past, Trump has named other hotel companies after the cities in which the projects were located. One example: THC Baku Hotel Manager LLC, used while trying to build a hotel in Baku, Azerbaijan. The Jeddah companies came to light in Trump&#8217;s latest financial
 disclosure filings with the Federal Election Commission. Those filings also reveal a raft of other projects Trump appears to have pursued during his presidential run &#8212; among them a tower in India and two resorts in Indonesia that paid him up to $10 million
 just to license his name. The revelations highlight the potential challenges Trump may face as he seeks to disentangle his business dealings from his possible future as the head of the U.S. government. Since he announced his candidacy June 16, 2015, Trump
 has formed at least 46 companies that he controls. Some of the companies are designed merely to hold other entities, sometimes so that another legal entity &#8212; not Trump himself &#8212; technically has control over the holdings. The companies tied to the apparent
 project in Saudi Arabia may be the most puzzling: They were incorporated in August but dissolved within months, without any public disclosure about their purpose. Trump&#8217;s apparent business efforts in Saudi Arabia could raise eyebrows, especially because he
 said in February that the nation &#8216;blew up the World Trade Center,&#8217; an apparent reference to the 9/11 attacks.&#8221; [BuzzFeed,
