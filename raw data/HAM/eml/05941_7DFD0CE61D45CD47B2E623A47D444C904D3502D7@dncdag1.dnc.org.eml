Donald Trump Hires C.O.O. for Growing Campaign Finance Operation<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/11/donald-trump-hires-c-o-o-for-growing-campaign-finance-operation/?_r=1http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/11/donald-trump-hires-c-o-o-for-growing-campaign-finance-operation/>



Donald J. Trump has hired Eli H. Miller, deputy finance director for Senator Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential bid, as the chief operating officer for his growing finance operation.

Mr. Miller's hiring, confirmed by three Republicans with knowledge of the decision, comes as the Trump operation is moving its focus to a general election campaign<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html>, and working to quickly raise the as much as $1.5 billion Mr. Trump has said he may need for the fall.

Though Mr. Trump has so far largely self-funded his campaign, pouring in around $40 billion of his own money for the primaries, he and his team have signaled that the New York billionaire will begin fund-raising for himself, as well as for the Republican Party, as he heads into what is likely to be a general election matchup against Hillary Clinton.

Mr. Miller<https://twitter.com/elihmiller>, who worked as a lead advance man for Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, joined Americans For Prosperity as its Ohio state director after Mr. Romney's loss, where he became close to Corey Lewandowski, who now manages the Trump campaign.

Mr. Miller was spotted leaving the Republican National Committee with Mr. Lewandowski on Monday, after a day of briefings, and on Tuesday joined Steven Mnuchin<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html>, the campaign's national finance chairman, in New York at Trump Tower for a meeting with Mr. Trump himself, according to someone briefed on the discussions.

Mr. Trump is still viewed skeptically by many Republican donors, and Mr. Miller's pedigree, having worked for Mr. Romney and Mr. Rubio - two party leaders - could help the New York real estate magnate gain credibility in the donor community.

Neither the Trump campaign, nor Mr. Miller, responded to repeated emails and phone calls about Mr. Miller's new role.
