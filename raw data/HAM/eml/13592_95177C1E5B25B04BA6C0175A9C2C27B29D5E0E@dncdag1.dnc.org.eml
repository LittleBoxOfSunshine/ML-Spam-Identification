Donald Trump says the American public doesn't have a right to see his tax r=
eturns =96 but his Personal Financial Disclosures don=92t really tell us an=
ything about Trump or how much he is actually worth. His refusal to release=
 his returns breaks the precedent of every major-party presidential nominee=
 releasing their returns dating back to 1976 =96 because, he claims, it=92s=
 =93none of your business<https://www.google.com/url?sa=3Dt&rct=3Dj&q=3D&es=

But it=92s not only that Donald Trump doesn=92t want to prove to us his wea=
lth or his tax rate; Trump has been involved in more than 100 lawsuits and =
he=92s profited off of Chinese and Mexican labor =96 which begs the questio=
n, what else does Donald Trump have to hide?

The American people ought to know whether Trump has been paying his fair sh=
are and how much he would benefit from his own reckless tax plan. If Trump =
has nothing to hide, he should release his tax returns immediately.

See what people are reading:

Details on Donald Trump=92s Finances Are Released, but Net Worth Is Unclear=
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/us/politics/donald-trump-money.html>
NEW YORK TIMES // STEVE EDER AND KITTY BENNETT
=85
The document offered new details on the enterprises and the financial pictu=
re of Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. The limitations of the=
 form, however, made it impossible to calculate his specific net worth or t=
o verify his claim that he is worth more than $10 billion.
=85

By contrast, Mr. Trump has been unwilling to publicize his recent tax retur=
ns, a traditional disclosure by major party candidates that is not required=
 by law. His tax returns could provide a more precise figure than the finan=
cial disclosures of how much he actually earns each year, as well as how mu=
ch he pays in taxes. Mr. Trump has cited Internal Revenue Service audits as=
 a reason for not releasing his returns, and has pointed to his personal fi=
nancial disclosures =97 which provide dollar figure ranges, but not actual =
amounts =97 as giving an alternate view of his wealth and income.

Disclosure Form Details Donald Trump=92s Income Sources<http://www.wsj.com/=
articles/disclosure-form-details-donald-trumps-income-sources-1463614927>
WALL STREET JOURNAL // PETER GRANT AND ANDREA FULLER
Donald Trump=92s income from licensing his name to overseas companies has c=
ontinued to rise since he announced his candidacy for president, his latest=
 federal financial-disclosure form shows.
=85
Mr. Trump=92s ready cash may have declined, according to the form, which wa=
s made public Wednesday. He has between about $61 million and $173 million =
in stocks, bonds, cash and other relatively liquid holdings. Last July, he =
reported he had between $78 million and $232 million in such assets. This d=
ecline might help explain why Mr. Trump decided to start raising large camp=
aign donations after emphasizing throughout the primary season that he was =
self-financing and, therefore, he said, not beholden to special interests l=
ike other candidates.
=85
Overall, the disclosure form doesn=92t answer the question of how much Mr. =
Trump is worth because it was designed by the Office of Government Ethics t=
o guard against conflicts of interest and not precisely state a candidate=
=92s income or wealth.

Trump Invests In The Same Companies He Bashes<http://www.usatoday.com/story=
/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/05/18/trump-invests-same-companies-he-bashes=
/84558700/>
USA TODAY // ELIZA COLLINS
Maybe Donald Trump never learned the phrase =93put your money where your mo=
uth is.=94 Upon review of his Personal Financial Disclosure it turns out th=
at presumed Republican nominee has invested and profited from multiple comp=
anies he=92s slammed on the trail.

Trump invested in the parent company of Nabisco, which he has has brought u=
p a lot for outsourcing jobs to Mexico.
=85
Trump has put money into General Electric. But while campaigning in Connect=
icut, he called General Electric=92s move of jobs outside the state =93deva=
stating.=94
=85
Trump also invested in the parent company to Carrier Corp., an Indiana-base=
d air-conditioning manufacturer that is in the process of outsourcing thous=
ands of jobs to Mexico. In an interview with Breitbart News after Carrier's=
 announcement, Trump spoke broadly about the need to lower taxes.

Donald Trump releases financial info, but still no tax returns<http://www.m=
snbc.com/msnbc/donald-trump-releases-financial-info-still-no-tax-returns>
MSNBC // BENJY SARLIN
Donald Trump released new information about his finances this week =97 but =
not the information his critics on the right and left are demanding.
=85
What the disclosure doesn=92t do, though, is shine the kind of light on his=
 finances that Trump=92s tax returns would provide. Trump has refused to re=
lease his most recent returns =97 which every major party nominee since 197=
6 has made public =97 citing an ongoing audit by the IRS. The IRS, for thei=
r part, confirmed months ago that there is nothing legally preventing Trump=
 from making them public in the interim.
=85
This question of Trump=92s income and taxes are also loaded politically, be=
cause Trump is running on an estimated $9.5 trillion tax cut that would dra=
matically reduce rates for ultra-wealthy filers. If he released his taxes, =
voters would not only know his tax rate =97 and how it compares to that of =
average Americans =97 but how much he would save under his proposed changes=
.
=85
But tax returns are another story. The motive is to show that one=92s incom=
e is as small as possible in order to pay the least amount to the governmen=
t. The more successful Trump is at arranging his finances to this effect =
=97 and he said he tries to =93fight like hell to pay as little as possible=
=94 =97 the less impressive his business prowess will look.

Trump's tax trouble: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes, tied to companies<ht=
tp://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/05/19/trumps-tax-troubles/84543538/>
USA TODAY // NICK PENZENSTADLER AND DAVID MCKAY WILSON
While Donald J. Trump refuses to release his federal tax returns, saying hi=
s tax rate is =93none of your business,=94 a USA TODAY analysis found Trump=
=92s businesses have been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and other dispu=
tes related to unpaid taxes or how much tax his businesses owe.
=85
As recently as last week, Trump said he was =93willing to pay more=94 taxes=
 personally and that =93taxes for the rich will go up somewhat=94 if he bec=
omes president. But the lawsuits and other tax-related disputes show a diff=
erent reality for his businesses. They illustrate a pattern of systematical=
ly disputing tax bills, arguing for lower property assessments, and in some=
 cases not paying taxes until the government takes additional action. At le=
ast three dozen times, Trump companies=92 unpaid tax bills have forced the =
New York State Department of Taxation and Finance to go to local courts to =
get liens against his properties to try to collect overdue bills. New Jerse=
y also had to go to court for a lien to collect a Trump company=92s unpaid =
tax bill. Eventually, those disputes were resolved, and his companies paid =
some amount of taxes.
=85
Trump has acknowledged that he tries to pay as little taxes as possible, an=
d the public records across the country shed light on how he does it. In do=
cuments rarely seen by the public, Trump's businesses regularly minimize th=
e value of his properties for tax purposes. Publicly, including in his pres=
idential financial disclosure report, Trump=92s team declares many of those=
 same properties are worth tens of millions of dollars more.

Trump=92s new line: Tax returns from thee, not from me<http://www.msnbc.com=
/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-new-line-tax-returns-thee-not-me>
MSNBC // STEVE BENEN
=85
=93NBC=92s Katy Tur reported Wednesday that all vice presidential hopefuls =
would be required to submit their returns as a standard part of the vetting=
 process.=94

When NBC=92s Katy Tur asked a Trump campaign source about the apparent hypo=
crisy, the source responded, =93Trump=92s not running for vice president.=
=94

That=92s cute, I suppose, but it only reinforces the absurdity of the candi=
date=92s posture. The idea that disclosure and transparency requirements sh=
ould be tougher for a vice presidential candidate than a presidential candi=
date is tough to defend.

Making matters worse, with each passing day, new questions arise about Trum=
p=92s finances. USA Today reported this morning that a fresh analysis found=
 Trump=92s businesses =93have been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and ot=
her disputes related to unpaid taxes or how much tax his businesses owe.=94

It makes it that much more difficult for the candidate and his team to sugg=
est his tax documents are a meaningless distraction.

clined, according to the form, which was made public Wednesday. He has betw=
een about $61 million and $173 million in stocks, bonds, cash
 and other relatively liquid holdings. Last July, he reported he had betwee=
n $78 million and $232 million in such assets. This decline might help expl=
ain why Mr. Trump decided to start raising large campaign donations after e=
mphasizing throughout the primary
 season that he was self-financing and, therefore, he said, not beholden to=
 special interests like other candidates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Donald Trump released new information about his finances this week =97 but =
not the information his critics on the right and left are demanding.

mes New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">What the disclosure doesn=92t do, th=
ough, is shine the kind of light on his finances that Trump=92s tax returns=
 would provide. Trump has refused to release his most recent
 returns =97 which every major party nominee since 1976 has made public =97=
 citing an ongoing audit by the IRS. The IRS, for their part, confirmed mon=
ths ago that there is nothing legally preventing Trump from making them pub=
lic in the interim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Ti=
mes New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">This question of Trump=92s income an=
d taxes are also loaded politically, because Trump is running on an estimat=
ed $9.5 trillion tax cut that would dramatically reduce rates
 for ultra-wealthy filers. If he released his taxes, voters would not only =
know his tax rate =97 and how it compares to that of average Americans =97 =
but how much he would save under his proposed changes.<o:p></o:p></span></p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Ti=

he motive is to show that one=92s income is as small as possible in order t=
o pay the least amount to the government. The more successful
 Trump is at arranging his finances to this effect =97 and he said he tries=
 to =93fight like hell to pay as little as possible=94 =97 the less impress=

 have been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and other disputes related to =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Ti=
mes New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">As recently as last week, Trump said=
 he was =93willing to pay more=94 taxes personally and that =93taxes for th=
e rich will go up somewhat=94 if he becomes president. But the lawsuits
 and other tax-related disputes show a different reality for his businesses=
. They illustrate a pattern of systematically disputing tax bills, arguing =
for lower property assessments, and in some cases not paying taxes until th=
e government takes additional action.
 At least three dozen times, Trump companies=92 unpaid tax bills have force=
d the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance to go to local cour=
ts to get liens against his properties to try to collect overdue bills. New=
 Jersey also had to go to court for
 a lien to collect a Trump company=92s unpaid tax bill. Eventually, those d=
isputes were resolved, and his companies paid some amount of taxes.<o:p></o=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Ti=
mes New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Trump has acknowledged that he tries=
 to pay as little taxes as possible, and the public records across the coun=
try shed light on how he does it. In documents rarely seen
 by the public, Trump's businesses regularly minimize the value of his prop=
erties for tax purposes. Publicly, including in his presidential financial =
disclosure report, Trump=92s team declares many of those same properties ar=
e worth tens of millions of dollars
 more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
