Scott Walker Expected To Sign Budget Eliminating Living Wage, Cutting Unive=
rsity Funding, Loosening Restrictions On Payday Lenders<http://www.ibtimes.=

ing-living-2002396>
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TIMES // CLARK MINDOCK

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has one last thing to do before launching his e=
xpected presidential campaign: sign the state budget. The state Assembly ap=
proved the budget early Thursday morning, sending the bill to Walker's desk=
 and paving the way for a host of provisions added late last week to become=
 law.

Walker, who is expected to announce his presidential campaign on Monday, sa=
id in the past that he wouldn't make a campaign announcement before the bud=
get work is finished. Included in the finalized version of the budget are p=
rovisions that would eliminate the state's "living wage" law, loosen restri=
ctions on payday lenders and cut workers' right to a day off from work a we=
ek. (Currently, employers are required to offer one day off of work a week;=
 the provision would allow workers to opt out of having that day off.)

The governor is expected to quickly sign the budget.

Conflict has accompanied the budget negotiations. Last week, Walker and his=
 allies in the Republican legislature backtracked on a measure that would h=
ave imposed new restrictions on the state's open records laws after conside=
rable outrage. Walker's office helped write the open records provision.

After the open records provision was removed, opponents of the Republican a=
dditions to the budget focused their consternation on a different provision=
 that would replace the term "living wage" in state laws with "minimum wage=
." The minimum wage in the state is $7.25 an hour, which Walker's administr=
ation has said is an adequate rate. Last year it was discovered that the ra=
tionale for determining that the state minimum wage is enough was based on =
studies provided by the restaurant industry, which includes fast-food resta=
urants.

The budget, which is for $73 billion, cuts the University of Wisconsin budg=
et by $250 million, less than the $300 million Walker had proposed, and fre=
ezes tuition for two years. Republicans also refused a provision encouraged=
 by Walker that would have freed UW from state laws and oversight.

Walker is entering a very crowded Republican primary field, but he is start=
ing with high poll numbers. In an average of national polls by Real Clear P=
olitics, Walker is in second place among Republicans, behind former Florida=
 Gov. Jeb Bush.
