Great. Will take a look and get back to you with some thoughts tomorrow.

Are we coordinating with HFA on these as well? I think it would be helpful =
to know what they are going to say.

Also, let's reach out to Amalgamated and make sure they don't say something=
 dumb. Do you have a contact there or would you like me to reach out to Sam=
 Brown who I know?

Subject: Hi Graham / Politico

Hi Graham,

Ken Vogel at Politico is doing a follow up story on the Hillary Victory Fun=
d and wants us to get back to him by Sunday. Bolded and underlined below ar=
e his questions. I've inserted draft answers to some but have left others b=
lank. Appreciate in advance your feedback.

Best,
Mark


______________________________________________________________

We're finally revisiting this subject, and I was hoping you could give me a=
n on-the-record statement about why this is a good deal for state parties a=
nd help me answer the following specific questions (I'm also emailing the q=
uestions to the Clinton campaign and, in the case of #6, Amalgamated Bank):


1.) Of the $3.8 million that HVF has transferred to the state parties throu=
gh 3/31/16, $3.3 million has been transferred almost immediately to the DNC=
. That means that through 3/31 the state parties have kept $500k - or less =
than 1 percent - of the $61 million raised by the HVF. Why so little?

2.) Based on these numbers, are Hillary Clinton and her allies overstating =
their support for state parties?

1+2: (on background/please paraphrase) The money from the JFAs is used for =
critical investments in infrastructure, maintaining the DNC's national vote=
r file, and bolstering our research, communications and digital capabilitie=
s, all of which will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Novembe=
r and help strengthen state parties across the country. You can find some o=
f our efforts in the overview of our Democratic Victory Task Force report<h=
ttps://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=3Dhttps-3A__www.democrats.org_Pos=
t_dnc-2Dunveils-2D2016-2Ddemocratic-2Dvictory-2Dtask-2Dforce-2Dreport-2Dand=
-2Daction-2Dplan&d=3DCwMFAg&c=3DXRWvQHnpdBDRh-yzrHjqLpXuHNC_9nanQc6pPG_SpT0=
&r=3Dztfeb3sYMwYJc4m6DQzcZ1EDxKmQmE8pe5TrXm4gdCU&m=3DdVU2_6qyyDHwqjEhlA5O2I=
aa6HRPP-1vXY_n7IFKpw0&s=3DOjfy8yXJ2u9ixkqJGSwqpfrQM11AKlgtZk2TlozDpNg&e=3D>=
 that came out in November 2015.


3.) Will the HVF allow them to keep more of the overall cash raised going f=
orward?

(off the record) For these questions re strategic considerations, I would d=
irect you to the Clinton campaign. Again, the JFAs help strengthen state pa=
rties across the country.

4.) We understand that the DNC has provided the state parties with talking =
points on how to respond to media inquiries about the joint fundraising com=
mittee. Why is that?


5.) Some state party sources have expressed concern that the arrangement co=
uld actually hurt participating state parties by keeping them from acceptin=
g cash from donors whose checks to the HVF counted towards their $10,000 li=
mit to participating state parties that never got to spend the cash because=
 it was transferred to the DNC. Does that concern you?

(possible off-the-record answer) At this giving level, these are sophistica=
ted donors; they know what they are doing.  If they don't want to give to a=
 state party through HVF and would rather give direct they certainly can.  =
They are allowed under the JFA agreement to omit any state they want to.  M=
ost state parties do not have access to the level of donors who are writing=
 huge checks.

6.) Sources also tell us that some participating state parties didn't even =
know the money had been transferred into and out of their accounts until af=
ter the fact, despite the fact that some of those parties had actually stip=
ulated in the banking documents that their affirmative consent was required=
 before such transfers could be made from their accounts (using the space o=
n the signature card that asks for "Number of signatures required for withd=
rawal"). Have any state parties complained to you or the HVF about this and=
 have you taken steps to make sure that they're kept apprised in real time =
of transfers?


7.) Among the online ads paid for by the HVF, many urge readers to "Stop Tr=
ump" or to support Clinton. Are those electioneering?
