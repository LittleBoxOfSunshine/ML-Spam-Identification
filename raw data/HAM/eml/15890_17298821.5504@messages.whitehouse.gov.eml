REMARKS BY THE FIRST LADY

AT 2016 OLYMPICS 100 DAYS OUT COUNTDOWN=20



Times Square

New York, New York=20





12:18 P.M. EDT





 MRS. OBAMA: Hi, everybody. Good morning -- or afternoon -- or wherever w=
e are. (Laughter.) Hello. Thank you so much for joining us as we start th=
e 100 Day Countdown to the thrilling moment when we let the games begin. =
I'm really honored to be here today.



I want to start by thanking Jordan -- where did Jordan go? Hey, Jordan. W=
hats going on? -- for that really kind introduction. We're so proud of hi=
m. We're excited to have him compete in this Summer Olympic Games. I also=
 want to thank the outstanding leaders from the U.S. Olympic Committee wh=
o are joining me on this stage. You guys, thank you so much for all your =
great work -- as well as The Band Perry, who is one of our favorites. I w=
ant to thank them for being here. Coach Auriemma, thank you all so much f=
or everything you're doing.



And, of course, most of all, I want to thank these incredible athletes wh=
o are here today. I have to turn around and look at them because I just g=
ot here. (Laughter.) They look so good! (Laughter.) I want to recognize t=
hem for the extraordinary work that theyve been doing. I'm proud, I'm hon=
ored to be in the presence of these Olympians and Paralympians.=20



In fact, this is kind of a dream come true for me, because I'm here today=
 not just as the First Lady, but as a real, lifelong, die-hard Olympics f=
an. To this day, I still remember the excitement that I felt as a little =
girl growing up on the South Side of Chicago when Olympic season would ro=
ll around. My family and all the kids in our neighborhood, we would gathe=
r around somebodys TV somewhere in the neighborhood, and we would watch f=
or hours as our Olympic favorites would compete -- whether it was Mary Lo=
u Retton, or Carl Lewis. I mean, I could go on. I mean, these times meant=
 the world to kids in neighborhoods all over the country.



We would all have our favorite sports. My dad, who happened to have MS, w=
as an Olympic fan because he was one of those guys, because he couldn't w=
alk, those games meant the world to him to be able to watch. So we all ha=
d our favorite athletes. We had our favorite sports. And then once the ga=
mes were over, we would all run outside and set up some makeshift hurdle =
or some balance beam, and wed try to imitate our heroes.



And that's really what the Olympic Games are all about. One of the reason=
s I wanted to be here today to kick this off, to be a part of the 100 Day=
 sort of celebration is that we're not just talking about bringing home t=
he gold -- which we will, right? (Applause.) Okay, we're going to do that=
. It's not that we're just proudly representing the United States to the =
rest of the world -- which I know these Olympians will do so well. But th=
e Olympics are also about inspiring young people here at home, truly, to =
get them active, and to live up to the example that our Olympic and Paral=
ympic athletes have always set with their dedication, their determination=
, their unyielding commitment to excellence.



And we want to bring that Olympic spirit all across this country and into=
 big cities and tiny towns, and to kids and families like mine, like I wa=
s at that age -- wherever they may be watching the Olympics these days, w=
hether it's around the TV or a smartphone -- I don't know what people do =
today -- but to cheer on our U.S. team, but to bring that spirit into com=
munities.



We also want our young people to be inspired by the amazing stories of th=
ese athletes -- the endless hours that theyve devoted to get to this day,=
 the countless sacrifices that these men and women make to do the sport t=
hat they love. All the hardship that theyve overcome to get to this day -=
- we want our kids to know about that. Because we want to show our young =
people that if they work hard enough, and if they dream big enough, they =
can achieve what they want.=20



And these men and women are really the best role models for our kids. So =
we don't just want our young people to watch them, we want them to try th=
ese sports themselves. I mean, I know so many of these folks up here prob=
ably got started because they were watching some hero and they tried some=
thing new. And we want more and more of our kids to develop into that nex=
t generation of athletes and fans and sports enthusiasts.=20



So that's why I'm really thrilled to announce that the USOC and 16 of its=
 national governing bodies will be providing opportunities for nearly 2 m=
illion kids across this country to participate in Olympic sports in their=
 own communities. Theyre going to have access to everything from basketba=
ll and tennis to things like fencing and judo -- maybe things that kids u=
sually don't have access to. Because so many of these kids in our country=
, they never have access to these kind of opportunities.=20



They won't just be learning athletic skills; the cool thing is theyre goi=
ng to be learning life skills as well -- like discipline, team work, and =
of course, the importance of giving 100 percent to everything that they d=
o.



Theyre also going to be learning what I always talk about are life habits=
 -- the habits that we've been emphasizing through the past six years thr=
ough the Lets Move! initiative -- habits like staying active, fueling you=
r body with good food so that you can actually compete in the way that yo=
u need to.



So that's why I'm here. I am a fan. I'm ready for this. I want the countr=
y to start gearing up for the Olympics like we used to when we were littl=
e. I want everybody glued to the TV, trying out sports, thinking about ge=
tting up off that couch, competing with your neighbor, but most important=
ly, cheering these men and women on.=20



So I want to thank the USOC, as well as the Partnership for a Healthier A=
merica for making these opportunities available to kids across the countr=
y. I also want to thank the folks at NBC who are going to be promoting th=
ese opportunities through the Gold Map initiative that they just talked a=
bout this morning, and other efforts that theyre going to be using to exp=
ose young people to Olympic sports and encouraging them to get active.



And finally, I want to thank our Olympic and Paralympic athletes for repr=
esenting our country in Brazil. We wish them all the luck in the world --=
 although they don't need it because theyre super bad! (Laughter.) Theyre=
 already awesome. Theyre already going to kick butt. (Laughter.) But we w=
ant them to continue to make us proud as athletes, of course, more import=
antly, as role models and as the outstanding ambassadors to this country =
that we know they will be.



And with that, I'm going to actually stop talking -- and they told me I h=
ave to actually try some things. So wish me luck. You all be easy on me, =
all right? (Laughter.)=20



So thank you all so much. God bless. And, of course, go, Team USA! (Appla=
use.)=20



 END 12:25 P.M. EDT

 Coach Auriemma, thank you all so much for everything you're doing.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And, of course, most of a=
ll, I want to thank these incredible athletes who are here today.&nbsp; I h=
ave to turn around and look at them because I just got here.&nbsp; (Laughte=
r.)&nbsp; They look so good!&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I want to
 recognize them for the extraordinary work that they&#8217;ve been doing.&n=
bsp; I'm proud, I'm honored to be in the presence of these Olympians and Pa=
ralympians.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In fact, this is kind of =
a dream come true for me, because I'm here today not just as the First Lady=
, but as a real, lifelong, die-hard Olympics fan.&nbsp; To this day, I stil=
l remember the excitement that I felt as
 a little girl growing up on the South Side of Chicago when Olympic season =
would roll around.&nbsp; My family and all the kids in our neighborhood, we=
 would gather around somebody&#8217;s TV somewhere in the neighborhood, and=
 we would watch for hours as our Olympic favorites
 would compete -- whether it was Mary Lou Retton, or Carl Lewis.&nbsp; I me=
an, I could go on.&nbsp; I mean, these times meant the world to kids in nei=
ghborhoods all over the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We would all have our fav=
orite sports.&nbsp; My dad, who happened to have MS, was an Olympic fan bec=
ause he was one of those guys, because he couldn't walk, those games meant =
the world to him to be able to watch.&nbsp; So
 we all had our favorite athletes.&nbsp; We had our favorite sports.&nbsp; =
And then once the games were over, we would all run outside and set up some=
 makeshift hurdle or some balance beam, and we&#8217;d try to imitate our h=
eroes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And that's really what th=
e Olympic Games are all about.&nbsp; One of the reasons I wanted to be here=
 today to kick this off, to be a part of the 100 Day sort of celebration is=
 that we're not just talking about bringing
 home the gold -- which we will, right?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Okay, we're=
 going to do that.&nbsp; It's not that we're just proudly representing the =
United States to the rest of the world -- which I know these Olympians will=
 do so well.&nbsp; But the Olympics are also about inspiring
 young people here at home, truly, to get them active, and to live up to th=
e example that our Olympic and Paralympic athletes have always set with the=
ir dedication, their determination, their unyielding commitment to excellen=
ce.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And we want to bring that=
 Olympic spirit all across this country and into big cities and tiny towns,=
 and to kids and families like mine, like I was at that age -- wherever the=
y may be watching the Olympics these
 days, whether it's around the TV or a smartphone -- I don't know what peop=
le do today -- but to cheer on our U.S. team, but to bring that spirit into=
 communities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">We also want our young pe=
ople to be inspired by the amazing stories of these athletes -- the endless=
 hours that they&#8217;ve devoted to get to this day, the countless sacrifi=
ces that these men and women make to do the
 sport that they love.&nbsp; All the hardship that they&#8217;ve overcome t=
o get to this day -- we want our kids to know about that.&nbsp; Because we =
want to show our young people that if they work hard enough, and if they dr=
eam big enough, they can achieve what they want.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And these men and women a=
re really the best role models for our kids.&nbsp; So we don't just want ou=
r young people to watch them, we want them to try these sports themselves.&=
nbsp; I mean, I know so many of these folks up
 here probably got started because they were watching some hero and they tr=
ied something new.&nbsp; And we want more and more of our kids to develop i=
nto that next generation of athletes and fans and sports enthusiasts.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that's why I'm really =
thrilled to announce that the USOC and 16 of its national governing bodies =
will be providing opportunities for nearly 2 million kids across this count=
ry to participate in Olympic sports
 in their own communities.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to have access to ever=
ything from basketball and tennis to things like fencing and judo -- maybe =
things that kids usually don't have access to.&nbsp; Because so many of the=
se kids in our country, they never have access to
 these kind of opportunities.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">They won't just be learni=
ng athletic skills; the cool thing is they&#8217;re going to be learning li=
fe skills as well -- like discipline, team work, and of course, the importa=
nce of giving 100 percent to everything that
 they do.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">They&#8217;re also going =
to be learning what I always talk about are life habits -- the habits that =
we've been emphasizing through the past six years through the Let&#8217;s M=
ove! initiative -- habits like staying active, fueling
 your body with good food so that you can actually compete in the way that =
you need to.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that's why I'm here.&n=
bsp; I am a fan.&nbsp; I'm ready for this.&nbsp; I want the country to star=
t gearing up for the Olympics like we used to when we were little.&nbsp; I =
want everybody glued to the TV, trying out sports, thinking
 about getting up off that couch, competing with your neighbor, but most im=
portantly, cheering these men and women on.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I want to thank the US=
OC, as well as the Partnership for a Healthier America for making these opp=
ortunities available to kids across the country.&nbsp; I also want to thank=
 the folks at NBC who are going to be promoting
 these opportunities through the Gold Map initiative that they just talked =
about this morning, and other efforts that they&#8217;re going to be using =
to expose young people to Olympic sports and encouraging them to get active=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And finally, I want to th=
ank our Olympic and Paralympic athletes for representing our country in Bra=
zil.&nbsp; We wish them all the luck in the world -- although they don't ne=
ed it because they&#8217;re super bad!&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
 They&#8217;re already awesome.&nbsp; They&#8217;re already going to kick b=
utt.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But we want them to continue to make us proud =
as athletes, of course, more importantly, as role models and as the outstan=
ding ambassadors to this country that we know they will be.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And with that, I'm going =
to actually stop talking -- and they told me I have to actually try some th=
ings.&nbsp; So wish me luck.&nbsp; You all be easy on me, all right?&nbsp; =
(Laughter.)&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So thank you all so much.=
&nbsp; God bless.&nbsp; And, of course, go, Team USA!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbs=
