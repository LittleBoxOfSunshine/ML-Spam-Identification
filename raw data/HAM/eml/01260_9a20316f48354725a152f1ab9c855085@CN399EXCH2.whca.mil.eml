NGP NOTES: Summary

=20

George Lindemann Jr. was a highly-ranked rider, Olympic hopeful, and heir t=
o an $800 million fortune.  In 1990 he hired Tommy "The Sandman" Burns to e=
lectrocute his horse, Charisma, in order to collect on a $250,000 insurance=
 policy.=20

=20

Lindemann was convicted of three counts of wire fraud in 1995 and was sente=
nced to a 33-month term in federal prison with two years probation after hi=
s release.  He was sentenced to pay a $500,000 fine, $250,000 in restitutio=
n to the insurance company, and the cost of his prison stay.  He was expell=
ed from the American Horse Shows Association ("AHSA"), and upon his release=
, filed a $100 million antitrust suit against the AHSA for refusing to allo=
w him to compete.

=20

Federal investigators believe that over 50 horses were killed between the m=
id-1970s and mid-1990s in acts of insurance fraud. Lindemann was one of 23 =
people indicted for charges related to the scandal, which received national=
 media attention at the time and rocked the world of equestrian sports.

=20

During the Lindemann investigation, Tommy Burns identified James Druck, who=
 he claimed taught him how to electrocute a horse to collect on an insuranc=
e policy.   Coincidentally, James Druck was the father of Lisa Druck, now k=
nown as Rielle Hunter.  Burns further claimed that Druck paid him to kill D=
ruck/Hunter's horse when she was 18, a point that press of John Edwards/ Ri=
elle Hunter did cover.

=20

Since his release following a 21-month prison stay, Lindemann has attempted=
 to rehabilitate his image with philanthropic activity and now runs a real =
estate development company.  He has made sizable contributions to Democrati=
c and Republican candidates, committees and PACs.   A few of these contribu=
tions have been returned. =20

=20

Recently, in June 2009, Lindemann received press coverage when Florida gube=
rnatorial candidate Alex Sink removed Lindemann as a host of a fundraising =
event.   Similarly, Chuck Schumer returned contributions from Lindemann in =
2004.=20

But some onlookers said they were sickened after realizing that Hulick is t=

"I guarantee that if Michael Vick walked into the Westminster Dog Show, he =
would be chased out. And yet, there's somebody famous for killing horses an=
d everybody is smiling and clapping," said a former local groom, referring =
to NFL star Vick, who did time for running a dogfighting club.=20

=20

Witnesses at Hulick's trial said she met with the killer, Tommy Burns, offe=
ring him a $35,000 cut of the $250,000 insurance money to kill the show ani=
mal, Charisma, on Dec. 15, 1990. She led Burns to the horse's stall, one wi=
tness recalled.=20

=20

Burns then attached a metal clip to the horse's ear and another to his hind=
quarters and plugged a wire from them to an outlet, electrocuting him.=20

=20

Hulick landed a 21-month sentence for her role. She served six months in fe=
deral prison. Burns and Lindemann also were convicted and served time,=20

=20

Last night at the dog show, she called the whole ordeal "a mistake of a you=
ng person I was working for."=20

"It doesn't have anything to do with how I conduct my life. I love my dogs,=
" said Hulick, who lives with her husband in Massachusetts, where she has a=
 dozen French bulldogs - and about a dozen retired show horses. [New York P=

*         SINK STEPS BACK FROM 3 SUPPORTERS "In politics, you are defined b=
y the company you keep -- especially when that company is bearing checks.

=20

Alex Sink learned this the hard way when an invitation for her Monday fundr=
aiser in Miami Beach listed two donors with checkered pasts. The leading De=
mocratic contender for governor, a buttoned-down former banker, decided to =
dump both donors for fear they would be used to smear her.

The first casualty was former Miami City Commissioner Johnny Winton, who wa=
s booted from office in 2006 after a drunken and profane run-in with police=
.

=20

Sink removed him as a co-host of the fundraiser on Wednesday. Some strategi=
sts saw that as a no-brainer for a campaign that made a rookie mistake by f=
ailing to background big donors. Others said Sink would have created less f=
uss had she stood by Winton. And wasn't she was boxing herself in so every =
donor with a less-than perfect profile would be questioned?

=20

(...) On Friday, they did. Turns out that one of the event's co-chairs, Geo=
rge Lindemann, wealthy chairman of the Bass Art Musem's board of trustees, =
served time for ordering a hit on his show horse and collecting $250,000 in=
 insurance money. He was sentenced in 1996 to 33 months in prison.

=20

''We make decisions on a case-by-case basis, and Lindemann was convicted of=
 insurance fraud,'' said Sink spokeswoman Tara Klimek. ``This particular ci=
rcumstance is over the line.''

=20

Sink's rejection of Winton and Lindemann raises questions about where candi=
dates should draw the line when vetting donors. Is a pending investigation =
cause for concern, or only a conviction? Is slugging a cop as bad as arrang=
ing the killing of a horse? And what's the statute of limitations on these =
matters?

Another co-chair of the Sink reception, publicist Seth Gordon, was removed =
as a volunteer campaign advisor to Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fern=
andez Rundlein 2000 after police told her he was a suspect in the 1975 deat=
h of his first wife. Gordon has denied murdering her and never been charged=
.

=20

Gordon, who recruited Lindemann to help Sink, defended his friend and noted=
 his involvement in civic causes.

=20

''George doesn't deserve to continue to be a punching bag. He has contribut=
ed to every Democratic presidential candidate, and no one has ever suggeste=
d that they didn't want his money,'' Gordon said.

Indeed, Lindemann has donated generously to a slew of candidates, including=
 U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek,U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and former presidential cont=
ender Hillary Clinton. So it's okay to cash his checks but not to give him =
top billing on a fundraising invite?

=20

Even Florida's master politician, Gov. Charlie Crist, has struggled with th=
is issue. At first he stood by a top fundraiser in 2006, developer Sergio P=
ino, whose relationship with a county commissioner was under federal invest=
igation. Pino also had been tied to potential election law violations while=
 raising money for former Gov. Jeb Bush.

=20

''We're happy to have his support,'' a Crist spokeswoman said.

Five days later, Pino stepped down. Crist said of his decision: ``I think i=
t was the right thing to do.'' [The Miami Herald, 6/27/2009]

*         THE RIELLE DEAL; HOW LOCAL SCANDAL BEGETS NATIONAL SCANDAL IN THE=
 CHARGED WORLD OF FORT LAUDERDALE POLITICS AND BUSINESS

Rielle Hunter, who was born in Fort Lauderdale 44 years ago, has had an ala=
rmingly eventful life.

As a teenager, she was an accomplished equestrienne who rode a champion jum=
ping horse until the animal was electrocuted in its stable by a hit man fro=
m Chicago, part of one of the biggest scandals to ever hit Florida's bluebl=
ood horse set.

=20

As a blond and pretty young woman, her voracious appetite for cocaine and m=
en caught the attention of novelist Jay McInerney, who based a lead charact=
er on her in a bestselling book about the excesses of the 1980s.

=20

Now in middle-age, she's become a notorious national media celebrity as the=
 femme fatale in the scandal that has all but destroyed the political caree=
r of former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards.

It's been a wild, wandering, and wanton life for Hunter, who spent her chil=
dhood in Tamarac as Lisa Jo Druck, her given name. And to understand Hunter=
 (she married, divorced, and kept her ex-husband's name), it's instructive =
to look back at those years in Fort Lauderdale, specifically at the untold =
story of her father, James Druck, who was a powerful attorney in downtown F=
ort Lauderdale for nearly two decades.

=20

[...]  Once the family was transplanted to Ocala, things only got worse. In=
 a particularly nasty turn of events, Druck hired an assassin named Tommy "=
The Sandman" Burns to kill his daughter's horse, Henry the Hawk, for the in=
surance money. The event deeply traumatized his daughter, who was near the =
stable when the horse was electrocuted.

=20

Burns later admitted to federal investigators that he had killed about 20 h=
orses. One of those sentenced to prison in the case was George Lindemann Jr=
., a Palm Beach scion to a billion-dollar fortune. Like Druck, he also had =
Burns kill a show horse for the insurance money.

=20

[...] Hunter, who was with a boyfriend when Burns killed the animal, saw th=
e horse dead on the stable floor. McInerney fictionalized the account in hi=
s 1988 book, The Story Of My Life. The character based on Hunter, named All=
ison Poole, recounts that she was so distraught by the killing of the horse=
 (named "Dangerous Dan" in the book) that she had to be kept on tranquilize=
rs for a week.

=20

[...] The book was published before the Edwards scandal broke (and the Pool=
e character would also be included in American Psycho, a bestselling novel =
by Bret Easton Ellis). James Druck died in 1990 of lung cancer before he co=
uld be brought to justice on the insurance fraud charge.

The rest of the story, quite literally, is history. [New Times Broward-Palm=
 Beach, 8/28/2008]

*         CONVICT CONTRIBUTIONS "Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has accepted=
 thousands of dollars in campaign donations from convicted criminals. After=
 being informed of the source of the donations, the Schumer campaign said i=
t would give $17,000 in questionable contributions to charity.=20

=20

(...)  He accepted $2,000 from George Lindemann Jr., who was convicted in 1=
996 of ordering the killing of a show horse to collect insurance money [The=
 National Journal, 6/10/2004]

=20

*         3-YEAR TERM IN '90 KILLLING OF PRIZE HORSE "A champion horseman a=
nd son of one of the richest men in the United States was sentenced yesterd=
ay in Chicago to almost three years in prison for his role in the killing o=
f a show horse for insurance money.=20

=20

The defendant, George Lindemann Jr., son of a cellular phone magnate and th=
e operator of a horse farm near Greenwich, Conn., was ordered to report to =
Federal prison within 30 days to begin a 33-month term for three counts of =
wire fraud. He was also sentenced to pay a $500,000 fine, $250,000 in resti=
tution to the insurance company he bilked, as well as the cost of his priso=
n stay.=20

=20

After being released, he will be on probation for two years under the sente=
nce handed down by Judge George Marovich of Federal District Court.=20

=20

Marion Hulick, a trainer at the Lindemann family farm, Cellular Farms, was =
sentenced to 21 months in prison on the same charges. She was not ordered t=
o pay a fine or restitution.=20

The pair were convicted last September after an admitted horse "hit man" te=
stified that he had killed the show horse Charisma so Mr. Lindemann could c=
ollect insurance money. The insurance company, Generali-U.S., paid $250,000=
 after the horse's death in 1990.=20

=20

The trial was the culmination of a four-year Federal investigation into cri=
mes in the show-horse business. Of the 23 people indicted in Chicago in Jul=
y 1994, 20 pleaded guilty. The remaining defendant, Barney Ward, owner of C=
astle Hill Farm in Brewster, N.Y., is scheduled to go to trial on March 4.=
=20

=20

Those convicted in the investigation included people who had killed horses =
to collect insurance money and others who had defrauded elderly widows in h=
orse deals. One, Richard Bailey, was sentenced to 30 years in prison after =
a Federal judge concluded he had also solicited the murder of Helen Vorhees=
 Brach, the candy heiress and an investor in horses.=20

=20

Mr. Lindemann, 31, made no comment as he was sentenced. But Mrs. Hulick, 60=
, sobbed and told the judge that she was sorry.=20

=20

Judge Marovich called the pair's acts "despicable and reprehensible" and sa=
id he wanted the sentences to send a message to the country club and "horsy=
 set." [The New York Times, 1/19/1996]
