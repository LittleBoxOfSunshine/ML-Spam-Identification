DNC Chair Statement on Tonight=E2=80=99s Primary Results
=20
WASHINGTON - DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following stateme=
nt on tonight=E2=80=99s Indiana primary results:=20
=20
=E2=80=9CTonight=E2=80=99s results in Indiana are the culmination of what ca=
n only be described as a disastrous week for the Republican Party. Clearly t=
he GOP=E2=80=99s problems go well beyond their convention.
=20
=E2=80=9CIn just seven days, Republicans saw their former House Speaker call=
 one of their candidates =E2=80=98Lucifer in the flesh,=E2=80=99 watched a d=
esperate, mathematically-eliminated campaign announce a Vice Presidential pi=
ck and get ridiculed for it, and then kicked off the Indiana primaries this m=
orning with accusations that Ted Cruz=E2=80=99s father was tied to Lee Harve=
y Oswald. The absurdity of that last allegation was compounded by the fact t=
hat Dangerous Donald Trump, who is just a hair=E2=80=99s-breadth away from s=
ecuring the Republican nomination, based it on a tabloid story he saw in the=
 National Enquirer.
=20
=E2=80=9CNo wonder the Republican Party is less popular than it=E2=80=99s be=
en in more than two decades. Just today, exit polls in Indiana showed that 5=
3 percent of Indiana Republican primary voters say they feel betrayed by the=
 Republican Party. And in recent weeks, exit polls in primary after primary h=
ave shown that a majority of Republican voters believe their primary has bee=
n divisive, with as much as a third preferring to either stay home or vote f=
or an alternative, rather than voting for their eventual nominee.
=20
=E2=80=9CMeanwhile, Democratic voters are proud of their candidates and it s=
hows each time they go to the polls. Last week, in Connecticut and Pennsylva=
nia respectively, 67% and 71% of Democrats reported feeling energized by our=
 primary. Today in Indiana it was three-quarters of Democratic voters who sa=
id our primary has energized our party, and a majority of Democrats who vote=
d today expressed support for either one of our candidates.
=20
=E2=80=9CToday it=E2=80=99s clearer than ever that none of the Republican ca=
ndidates has the judgment or temperament to serve as our Commander in Chief.=
 The next President of the United States will be nominated at our Democratic=
 convention in Philadelphia.=E2=80=9D

 get ridiculed for it, and then kicked off the Indiana primaries this morni=

 Republican Party. And in recent weeks, exit polls in primary after primary=
 have shown that a majority of Republican voters believe their primary has =
been divisive, with as much as a third preferring to either stay home or vo=
te for an alternative, rather than
 voting for their eventual nominee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
