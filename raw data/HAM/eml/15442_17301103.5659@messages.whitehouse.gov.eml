THE WHITE HOUSE



Office of the First Lady

_________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release May 3, 2016





REMARKS BY THE FIRST LADY=20

AND LEVAR BURTON

IN ADDRESSING CHILDREN ON BASE

AS PART OF THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY

OF JOINING FORCES



Thayer Elementary School

Fort Leonard Wood Army Base, Missouri





3:38 P.M. CDT





 MRS. OBAMA: Well, look at you guys! Whats going on?



CHILDREN: Nothing.



MRS. OBAMA: Nothing? Have you been sitting in this gym for a long time? (=
Laughter.) My goodness. Well, blame the grown-ups. (Laughter.) We are not=
 the grown-ups. Why didnt you let them out? (Laughter.) Are you guys havi=
ng fun, though?=20



CHILDREN: Yes!



MRS. OBAMA: We are so excited to be here, to be able to read to you guys.=
 Reading is -- to kids is one of my favorite things. My kids are grown no=
w -- theyre not grown, but they dont want me to read to them. So thank yo=
u for letting me read to you.



MR. BURTON: So who would like to hear a story? This one is called The Rhi=
no Who Swallowed a Storm. And I always like to give an authors name -- in=
 this case, the author is LeVar Burton, one of my favorite authors. (Laug=
hter.) And my co-writer was Susan Schaefer Bernardo. And the illustration=
s, which I think are beautiful, are by Courtenay Fletcher. Are you ready?=
=20

CHILDREN: Yes!



MR. BURTON: Are you ready?



CHILDREN: Yes!



MRS. OBAMA: Here we go:=20



In the middle of the morning, Mica Mouse trembled under her blanket. A st=
orm boomed outside her window. Rain crashed against the glass. Wind rattl=
ed the shutters. More than anything else, Mica was afraid of storms. A ye=
ar before, a powerful hurricane had destroyed her home. Im scared, Papa, =
she said.=20



MR. BURTON: We are safe, Mica. This storm will pass soon, said Papa. Woul=
d you like me to read you a story? I know just the one to help you feel b=
etter. Mica loved books, and Papas gentle voice soothed in a way that mad=
e her forget all about the thunder. Papa opened the book and began.



Long, long ago, before there were words, animals roamed in bountiful herd=
s. Little Rhinoceros live happy and free, exploring mountains and meadows=
, rivers and trees. His world was delightful and chock full of magic, unt=
il, out of the blue, that magic turned tragic.



MRS. OBAMA: A storm swept through the valley turning bright sky to black.=
 A flash flood came raging, no time to react. Lost in the thundering, no =
time for wondering, chaos and lightning, fury so frightening, earth quaki=
ng, him shaking, water rumbling, him tumbling, raggedy, jaggedly, sensele=
ss calamity, the storm crashed through his world and tore it apart, and t=
ook away everything dear to his heart.



MR. BURTON: Rhino was stunned by the terrible scene. Death and destructio=
n all through the ravine enraged by the pain of such a great loss, Rhino =
acted without a thought to the cost. Rhino looked at his world, all tatte=
red and torn, stood out on the ledge, and swallowed the storm.



MRS. OBAMA: Inside his belly, he felt the storm growing. Inside his head,=
 he heard howling and blowing. Like a tornado, he spun as the storm raged=
 inside, growing bigger and bigger and wider than wide. When he finally s=
topped, when he regained control, he was at the very bottom of a very dee=
p hole.



MR. BURTON: What to do? Rhino worried, as rain dripped down his face. Im =
lost and Im lonely, and in such a dark place. At just the right moment to=
 comfort and guide him, a spider dropped down and dangled beside him. The=
 world up above is shattered and gray, but its where you belong so you mu=
st find a way to let that storm out and move through your sorrow. Youll f=
ind many helpers on your road to tomorrow.



MRS. OBAMA: Oh, but that hole was dreadfully deep. And the walls all arou=
nd him were slippery steep. Rhino tried to climb out but was losing all h=
ope, when Kangaroo heard him and threw down a rope. Though Rhino was heav=
y from the weight of the storm, they towed him right up, got him safe, dr=
y and warm.=20



MR. BURTON: Were strong and steady, and always ready. When danger strikes=
, we hop to it. Fire or flood, snow or mud, when help is needed, well pul=
l you through it. Well, watching those heroes do what they did best gave =
Rhino the strength to set off on his quest.=20



MRS. OBAMA: That storm he was clutching made him buzzy and blurry. It kep=
t his brain foggy and filled him with worry. Where do I go, what do I do?=
 How will I ever make it through?



MR. BURTON: After every dark night, there comes a new day. Be kind, do yo=
ur best, and youll find a way. Up comes the sun. There are steps to compl=
ete. There isnt a map, just follow your feet.



MRS. OBAMA: Rhino followed his feet to a wallowing spot where he plopped =
on a rock and had a deep thought. Im tired of caging the wind and the rai=
n, exhausted from holding this anger and pain. Were all on this earth to =
learn and grow, a wise, old tortoise chimed in from below. Allowing yours=
elf to start feeling your feelings is the very first step on the journey =
toward healing.



MR. BURTON: It doesnt much matter if youre fast or youre slow, if you wan=
t to move forward, just trust and let go. Well, Rhino shook and he shimmi=
ed, and he stomped in the muck, and just as hed hoped, that storm came un=
stuck. At first, one little raindrop leaked out of his eye, then Rhino le=
t go and had a good cry.



MRS. OBAMA: His tears formed a river that flowed to the sea, where a pod =
of whales swam happy and free. I do feel better, Rhino thought as he drif=
ted. Then up swam a whale and Rhino was lifted.



MRS. OBAMA: If you ever feel blue, the whale said with a spout, remember =
to breathe, breathe in and breathe out. Sing your own song, and take it d=
eep, deep, deep. Then rise above, with a joyful leap.



MRS. OBAMA: As he floated home on a gentle wave, Rhino felt calm and stro=
ng and brave. His vision was clear, like the sky above, and he looked at =
his world through eyes filled with love.



MR. BURTON: He thanked the kind spider and the brave kangaroo, and all of=
 the other who had helped him through. He was glad to know that if he eve=
r lost hope, theyd lend him a hand, or throw him a rope.



MRS. OBAMA: He had journeyed his journey a very long way to find the ligh=
t in a world turned gray. Hed swallowed a storm with no thought to the co=
st, hed felt alone, hed felt tumbled and tossed.



MR. BURTON: Life would bring changes, beginnings and ends, but he had fai=
th in himself and faith in his friends. And as they curled up together he=
 felt loved and protected. And he dreamed of a world that was safe and co=
ntented. He understood now. It was love that mattered. Love could never b=
e lost. Love could never be shattered.



MRS. OBAMA: Papa closed the book and gave Mica a hug. I know it was scary=
 when our home was destroyed last winter, said Papa, but bad things happe=
n sometimes and we cant always control that. But we had lots of helpers, =
said Mica, just like Rhino did. Thats right, little one, Papa said in his=
 gentle way. Youre never really alone when bad things happen. There are f=
amily and friends, even people we dont know, who are always there to help=
 us through tough times.



MR. BURTON: And, like every story with a storm, this one ends in a rainbo=
w.



MRS. OBAMA: In a rainbow. (Applause.) Thats a beautiful book. (Applause.)=
 Do you guys have questions for Mr. Burton, who wrote this amazing book?



MR. BURTON: Or the First Lady, who is amazing -- itself. Yes, sir, you in=
 the front row in the lovely vest and tie.



MRS. OBAMA: And glasses. What did you say?=20



CHILD: I said Im the only one with glasses.



MRS. OBAMA: You are.



MR. BURTON: You are the only one with glasses in the first row.



MRS. OBAMA: So its clearly your turn.



MR. BURTON: What is your question, sir?



CHILD: (Inaudible.)



MR. BURTON: Do rhinos really eat storms. In real life, no. But heres the =
thing -- Rhino as the hero of this book -- I chose a rhino because in lif=
e, if -- a rhino is one of the strongest animals on the planet. And if a =
rhino can be taken down by the storm of his emotions inside, then all of =
us can use a little help sometimes, do you know what Im saying? Now you g=
et it. Now you get it.



MRS. OBAMA: Now it all makes sense. Its a good thing hes here. (Laughter.=
) All right, lets see, weve got -- lets do a little girl. In the back, yo=
u have an orange-pinkish -- yes, you. Yeah, you, way in the -- you, yes. =
Right here.



CHILD: (Inaudible.)=20



MRS. OBAMA: Say that again.



CHILD: Where do mice live?



MRS. OBAMA: Where do mice live? Oh, mice live many, many places.=20



MR. BURTON: I think this is a throw-back to Mousetronaut.



MRS. OBAMA: Were going back to -- you want to -- well, we can take a stab=
 at it. You know, mice are small, so they live anywhere where its dark an=
d cozy and where no one will find them. So it could be anywhere, right?



MR. BURTON: I think theyre most happy in fields, but sometimes they like =
to come inside and live in houses.



MRS. OBAMA: And live in homes and in schools, and theyve got to be where =
theres some food. So if you dont want mice in your house, you want to pic=
k up the food -- unless you do want mice. Okay, thats good. Well, make su=
re you throw out the food.



MR. BURTON: Shall we do one last question?=20



MRS. OBAMA: Lets do one last question. You pick, LeVar.



MR. BURTON: One last question. Yes, you, young lady with the black sweate=
r and the white blouse. Yes, you have a -- yes, you. What is your name?



CHILD: (Inaudible.)



MR. BURTON: Im sorry?



CHILD: Grace.=20



MR. BURTON: Grace. What is your question, Grace?



CHILD: Mrs. Obama, how is it -- like to be in the White House?



MRS. OBAMA: Whats it like living in the White House? The White House is a=
 lot of fun, but its sort of like living in a museum, if you can imagine =
that. Theres a part of the house thats a museum -- its called the State F=
loor -- and thats where you see most of the activity. If you see the Whit=
e House on TV from the inside, thats the State Floor. There are beautiful=
 rooms -- theres the Blue Room and the Red Room and the State Room. Thats=
 where we host important guests. Thats where visitors come to tour.=20



But then you go up a floor, and its our home. And thats like a regular ho=
me. Its like living in an apartment building. Because the President and I=
, if -- you werent alive to remember this, but when we first came to the =
White House, our two little girls, who are now 17 and 14, were very young=
. They were just in second and fifth grade. So we wanted to make sure tha=
t the White House felt like a real home and not like a museum, right? So =
they have their own rooms and they have a place to play and have friends =
over. And we have a kitchen and a dining room.



So no matter whats going on downstairs, all the hectic-ness and all the v=
isitors, we just come up the elevator and we open the door to our home. A=
nd its a home just like yours, where theres a lot of love and theres a lo=
t of -- theres discipline. There are rules. People have to make their bed=
s and brush their teeth, do their homework and read a lot. And listen to =
their parents -- just like at your house, okay? So the White House, in th=
e end, isnt all that exciting. (Laughter.)=20



All right, guys, you were amazing. Let me just say this -- you know why w=
e decided to come here?



CHILDREN: Why?



MRS. OBAMA: Because we are so proud of you and your families. You know, a=
 lot of people dont realize what military families go through. They just =
see big, burly soldiers going off to fight, but they dont know that behin=
d every one of those servicemembers there are husbands and wives and brav=
e kids who miss their parents if theyre deployed; who feel kind of bad wh=
en they have to move schools every couple of times; who get lonely; who d=
eal with things that make you guys heroes to us. And we want the world to=
 know about you all -- how brave you are, how courageous, how much you sa=
crifice.=20



And the President and the Vice President and the First Lady and the Secon=
d Lady, we are so proud of you all. Were proud of every inch of you. And =
we want to come and celebrate with you. So we picked this place with all =
of you here.



So I want you guys to work hard in school and be proud of who you are and=
 what youre doing, even when its hard. Because were proud of you, okay? W=
e couldnt do what we do without you in this country, do you know that? No=
, you dont even know how important you are, do you? You just think youre =
kids!=20



CHILD: I did.



MRS. OBAMA: You did. He did. (Laughter.) And were proud of your teachers,=
 too, okay? So make sure you thank them, okay? All right. We love you guy=
s.



MR. BURTON: Thayer Elementary, give yourselves a big hand. (Applause.)=20=

You know, mice are small, so they live anywhere where it&#8217;s dark and c=

 right?<o:p></o:p></p>

how is it -- like to be in the White House?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; What&#8=
217;s it like living in the White House?&nbsp; The White House is a lot of =
fun, but it&#8217;s sort of like living in a museum, if you can imagine tha=
t.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a part of the house that&#8217;s a museum -- it&#821=
7;s called
 the State Floor -- and that&#8217;s where you see most of the activity.&nb=
sp; If you see the White House on TV from the inside, that&#8217;s the Stat=
e Floor.&nbsp; There are beautiful rooms -- there&#8217;s the Blue Room and=
 the Red Room and the State Room.&nbsp; That&#8217;s where we host importan=
t
 guests.&nbsp; That&#8217;s where visitors come to tour.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But then you go up a floo=
r, and it&#8217;s our home.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s like a regular home.&nbs=
p; It&#8217;s like living in an apartment building.&nbsp; Because the Presi=
dent and I, if -- you weren&#8217;t alive to remember this, but when we fir=
st
 came to the White House, our two little girls, who are now 17 and 14, were=
 very young.&nbsp; They were just in second and fifth grade.&nbsp; So we wa=
nted to make sure that the White House felt like a real home and not like a=
 museum, right?&nbsp; So they have their own rooms
 and they have a place to play and have friends over.&nbsp; And we have a k=
itchen and a dining room.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So no matter what&#8217;s=
 going on downstairs, all the hectic-ness and all the visitors, we just com=
e up the elevator and we open the door to our home.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s a =
home just like yours, where there&#8217;s a lot of love and
 there&#8217;s a lot of -- there&#8217;s discipline.&nbsp; There are rules.=
&nbsp; People have to make their beds and brush their teeth, do their homew=
ork and read a lot.&nbsp; And listen to their parents -- just like at your =
house, okay?&nbsp; So the White House, in the end, isn&#8217;t all that
 exciting.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All right, guys, you were=
 amazing.&nbsp; Let me just say this -- you know why we decided to come her=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Because=
 we are so proud of you and your families.&nbsp; You know, a lot of people =
don&#8217;t realize what military families go through.&nbsp; They just see =
big, burly soldiers going off to fight, but they don&#8217;t know
 that behind every one of those servicemembers there are husbands and wives=
 and brave kids who miss their parents if they&#8217;re deployed; who feel =
kind of bad when they have to move schools every couple of times; who get l=
onely; who deal with things that make
 you guys heroes to us.&nbsp; And we want the world to know about you all -=
