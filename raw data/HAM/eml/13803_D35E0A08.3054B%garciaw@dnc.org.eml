Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz lat=
e Saturday said Democrats need to treat Donald Trump<http://thehill.com/peo=
ple/donald-trump>=92s candidacy as a =93real threat.=94

=93At the DNC we are not going to make the same mistake his Republican oppo=
nents made,=94 she said at the Alaska State Convention, according to prepar=
ed remarks.

=93We=92re ready for Trump.=94

The Florida congresswoman said Democrats will hold the presumptive Republic=
an presidential nominee accountable =93for the damage he=92s doing as a can=
didate and the damage he=92s promising he would do as president.=94

Wasserman Shultz said Trump, Speaker Paul Ryan<http://thehill.com/people/pa=
ul-ryan> (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell<http://thehill=
.com/people/mitch-mcconnell> (R-Ky.) are =93getting ready to sing =91kumbay=
a=92 and give us everything they=92ve got=94 after a =93nasty, mud-slinging=
 primary.=94

She said Trump =93isn=92t something new,=94 adding that the billionaire is =
=93just the old Republican brand, but with a little extra bronzer on =97 he=
=92s that much more dangerous.=94

Wasserman Shultz attacked Trump=92s temperament and judgment, lack of forei=
gn policy experience, and his =93decades-long record of denigrating women.=
=94

=93He exploits racial anxieties and cultural fears,=94 she added.

Wasserman also said she believes Democrats can eventually turn Alaska blue,=
 pointing to statistics that show the percentage of Alaskans casting their =
vote for the Democrat has increased in every presidential election since 20=
00.

=93Don=92t believe for a second that just because the pundits like to paint=
 Alaska red and say it isn=92t a battleground state means you=92re sideline=
d,=94 she said.

=93This has already been an exciting election year nationally. Working toge=
ther, I know we can [beat] Dump Trump."
