THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 24, 2016

=A0

*FACT SHEET: Trade and Investment with Vietnam

*

=A0

The United States is continuing to strengthen its commercial relationship=
 with Vietnam, a rapidly-growing country that offers U.S. businesses and =
workers substantial opportunities for expanded trade and investment, prom=
oting economic growth and development, and supporting jobs. =A0U.S.-Vietn=
am goods trade totaled $451 million in 1995, the year the United States a=
nd Vietnam normalized diplomatic relations, and since then has increased =
nearly a hundredfold to $45 billion. =A0

=A0

Our relationship is fast-growing: =A0In 2015, U.S. exports to Vietnam gre=
w by 23 percent, the largest year-on-year increase of exports to any of A=
merica=92s top 50 export markets. =A0Over the period 2010 to 2015, Vietna=
m was the second fastest growing of America=92s top 50 export markets.=A0=


=A0

Our relationship is diversifying: =A0U.S. export growth is high in sector=
s ranging from integrated circuits to civil aircraft, and cotton, dairy, =
tree/fruit nuts, and other agricultural products. =A0In the last five yea=
rs Vietnam has developed an important role as a supplier of high-tech con=
sumer products to the United States. =A0

=A0

Our relationship is inclusive: =A0Trade included small and family busines=
ses in both countries as well as large firms. =A0As of 2014, 6,031 small-=
 and medium-sized American firms exported to Vietnam while 5,895 small- a=
nd medium-sized U.S. businesses imported Vietnamese goods.=A0

=A0

We are now taking the next step. =A0In addition to witnessing over $16 bi=
llion in deal signings to advance aviation and energy sector development =
in Vietnam and support tens of thousands of U.S. jobs, President Obama=92=
s visit highlights our commitment in the following areas:

=A0

*Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)

*

=A0

TPP is central to our goal of deepening the U.S.-Vietnamese economic rela=
tionship. =A0The Administration has made securing ratification of TPP a t=
op priority and is working with Vietnam and other TPP partners to help th=
em ensure timely and complete implementation of their TPP commitments. =A0=
TPP will create new opportunities for American and Vietnamese workers and=
 businesses, including small businesses; promote innovation and the digit=
al economy; foster fair competition, transparency, and good governance; a=
nd promote workers=92 rights, conservation, and sustainable growth. =A0It=
 also is a critical step toward our strategic goal of revitalizing the op=
en, rules-based economic system that the United States has led since Worl=
d War II. =A0

=A0

The U.S. government will commit resources and technical expertise to supp=
ort Vietnam and our other TPP partners to implement and effectively enfor=
ce the obligations of the agreement. =A0To support Vietnam, the United St=
ates is providing more than $30 million in capacity building assistance, =
which will include work to ensure freedom of association, including indep=
endent unions, and other internationally recognized labor rights; protect=
ion and enforcement of intellectual property; and environmental protectio=
n and sustainable growth.

=A0

*U.S. Corporate Social Responsibility

*

=A0

U.S. foreign direct investment in Vietnam grew to $1.5 billion in 2014 an=
d has been complemented by U.S. corporate citizenship investments in Viet=
nam=92s communities and environment. =A0U.S. firms in Vietnam uphold high=
 standards of corporate citizenship by investing in the communities and e=
nvironment in which they do business. =A0For example, U.S. companies in V=
ietnam have trained hundreds of engineers on environmental protection and=
 sustainable development, donated over $12 million in software and servic=
es to support hundreds of non-governmental organizations, and enhanced th=
e skillset of tens of thousands of teachers and students in the use of in=
formation and communication technology. The U.S. government is committed =
to supporting public-private partnerships that encourage corporate social=
 responsibility by U.S. firms:

=A0

A USAID partnership with Arizona State University and several U.S. compan=
ies is enabling university-private sector collaboration, and developing c=
urriculum partnerships, mentorships, and industry-sponsored practical opp=
ortunities.

=A0

Numerous U.S. companies are collaborating on a new USAID alliance with Ha=
rvard Medical School and two Boston-area hospitals to improve the quality=
 and effectiveness of medical education in Vietnam, including in areas re=
levant to the Global Health Security Agenda.

=A0

In 2016, Cargill Vietnam won the U.S. Secretary of State=92s Award for Co=
rporate Excellence for its long-term commitment to investing in its farme=
r-partners, supporting community health, and training over 12,000 farmers=
 in sustainable production techniques. =A0Cargill Vietnam=92s Cargill Car=
es school building program has built and delivered 76 schools across rura=
l communities, benefiting more than 13,000 children per year.

=A0
