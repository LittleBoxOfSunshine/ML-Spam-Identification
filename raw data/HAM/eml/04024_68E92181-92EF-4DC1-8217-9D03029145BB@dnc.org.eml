What do you think? He's not an incredibly aggressive reporter so I think th=
e interview will be okay and I think a "no comment" would look bad.

He kinda gave us an out with the: "Sanders' success shows the Democratic Pa=
rty is as healthy as ever" line. We can talk about how we have disagreement=
s under the big tent but we come together in the end - Dems won popular vot=
e in 5/6 elections. Polling showing we have energized party while Rs are di=
vided, etc.

Also FYI he left NY observer over trump endorsement so he's more on our sid=
e than theirs.

Great to see you too a few weeks back. I had fun. As for Reuters I'm doing =
freelance. Basically I'm looking at how on the GOP side and the Democrats t=
o an extent you're seeing some disaffection with the major parties. Trump i=
s blowing up the Republican establishment. Sanders is a lifelong independen=
t who calls himself a socialist. I'm examining how some voters have express=
ed their dissatisfaction with party power structures. I'd be interested in =
getting DWS' take, especially if she wants to rebut it. Does she feel Sande=
rs' success shows the Democratic Party is as healthy as ever?

Hey Eric,

I'm working on a big story for Reuters for an election magazine they're run=
ning later this spring. I'm examining the state of the two party system in =
2016, examining how it's held up under this unique Trumpian stress. I'd lov=
e to speak with Debbie Wasserman Schultz for a few minutes if possible. My =
hard deadline is next Wednesday, May 4. If I could get her sometime before =
then, that would be awesome.

Best,

Ross
