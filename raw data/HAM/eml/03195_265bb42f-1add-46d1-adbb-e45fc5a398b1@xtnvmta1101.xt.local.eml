MAY THE 4TH BE WITH YOU. Welcome to the general. Tips and pitches to iarnsdorf@politico.com.

VROOM: Bockorny Group is lobbying for General Motors on connected cars, autonomous vehicles and cybersecurity privacy. The team includes Hayden Rogers [former chief of staff for Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.)] and Jed Bhuta [former legislative director for former Rep. Heath Shuler (D-N.C.)]. In January, the Department of Transportation set a timeline of six months for guidelines on driverless cars. GM also pays Eddie Fritts, Roberti Global, S-3, the Duberstein Group and Washington Tax & Public Policy Group, and recently dropped the Nickles Group, CGCN, Holland & Knight, the Normandy Group, and Bob Moss Associates.

DAILY BISTRO BIS: Sam DePoy of ARDA-ROC PAC and Kirk Freeman of REITPAC are hosting a lunch fundraiser this month for Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.), with special guest Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.).

LANDRIEU OUT: The FutureGen Industrial Alliance, a coalition that had been working on a now failed carbon capture project in Illinois, has ended its lobbying deals, including its contract with Van Ness Feldman, Pro Energy's Alex Guill&eacute;n reports. Mary Landrieu, who lost her Louisiana senate seat in 2014, had signed the project as her first client with Van Ness Feldman last August. The group has also ended its deal with former House majority leader Dick Gephardt, hired in 2007. Check out the latest Energy Influence for more: http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=04d84008d51d6ae72d65c42fca342f7b6d81879c30c2f6261621d810265bf195

TALKER: The National Review's Myra Adams writes that former House speaker Newt Gingrich, already acting as Trump's emissary to K Street, Congress and the press, may be his best choice for a running mate. Both Roger Stone, a top Trump adviser, and Mark McKinnon, former chief media adviser to the presidential campaigns of President George Bush and Sen. John McCain, hinted that Gingrich would be an strong choice. Gingrich could be a viable foil to Trump's bombastic, outsider persona - he's an establishment figure, though Adams points out he maintains a level of "outsideriness," and adds legitimacy to Trump's campaign with his extensive legislative experience. Other pros? He's a fundraising
 asset, a good campaigner and has solid conservative support. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=04d84008d51d6ae7a247970231cb3274fae332b42b4baddce2f6e5018c225268

PUERTO RICO WATCH: Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, also a leading candidate for governor in the territory's November election, is under investigation from both the FEC and Puerto Rico's Office of Electoral Comptroller, reports POLITICO's John Bresnahan, Anna Palmer and Manuela Tobias. The FEC wants Pierluisi to return more than $91,000 in donations to his federal campaign, and the Comptroller office in San Juan, which oversees campaign fundraising, is investigating whether he failed to report extra funds raised from Wall Street groups, including Morgan Stanley, which had helped the territory issue bonds. The FEC argues that Pierluisi does not need the money for his
 federal campaign, since he is retiring from that post to run for governor. Puerto Rico's electoral comptroller Torres Nieves is also investigating whether Pierluisi was allowed to raise money for his gubernatorial campaign while also accepting donations for his federal committee for resident commissioner. Pierluisi has been a major figure in the congressional talks on Puerto Rico's debt crisis, and faces a June 5 gubernatorial primary. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=04d84008d51d6ae7bcbe84fce69d4f4b3290149efe5324057dad7a9085e837f2

IMMIGRATION CONFRONTATION: POLITICO's Seung Min Kim reports a fight is looming in Congress on the H-2B visa program, which allows low-skilled foreign workers to come to the U.S. to work for up to 10 months as landscapers, housekeepers or seafood processors. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle whose home states rely on immigrant labor to support local industries, like Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Republican North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, both from states with robust seafood production, want to include language in this year's spending bills that renews a provision in last year's omnibus quadrupling the number of H-2B visas available. Additionally, hundreds of groups
 representing varied professions, like florists, concrete pavement producers and ski resort operators, have been lobbying Congress to increase the visa limit, with more than 1,000 groups sending a letter to congressional committees in March. The visas face pushback from labor groups, like the AFL-CIO, which argue the program takes jobs away from Americans and puts workers in unfavorable conditions. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=04d84008d51d6ae71e0595c60fb2337554c851432efa49411296e29d77153e0c

POP: The American Beverage Association spent $1.5 million in its fight against Philadelphia mayor Jim Kenney's proposed tax on sugary drinks in the month since the measure's introduction in March, The Philadelphia Inquirer's Tricia L. Nadolny and Julia Terruso report. The organization has largely helped fund the No Philly Grocery Tax Coalition, which has spent $2.6 million on advertising against the proposal. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=04d84008d51d6ae7af0f84c551cc18c6d2d80f23c9c7278eb02fc53bbae29407
