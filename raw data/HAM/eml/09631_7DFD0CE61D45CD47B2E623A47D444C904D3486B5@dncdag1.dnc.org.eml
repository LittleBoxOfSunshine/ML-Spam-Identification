ABC News --- Nicki Rossoll

Donald Trump says he thinks he can win the general election, even if the Re=
publican Party does not unify to support his candidacy.

"Does it have to be unified? I'm very different than everybody else, perhap=
s, that's ever run for office. I actually don't think so," Trump told Georg=
e Stephanopoulos in an interview that will air Sunday on ABC News' "This We=
ek."

A growing list of Republicans have come out and said they will not vote for=
 their party's presumptive presidential nominee in November, including form=
er Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, and the Repub=
lican Party's 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney. But none of that is r=
attling Trump.

"I think it would be better if it were unified, I think it would be -- ther=
e would be something good about it. But I don't think it actually has to be=
 unified in the traditional sense," Trump said.

Trump added that he thinks he'll appeal to voters across the aisle, and gai=
n the support of Democrats to win the general election.

"I'm going to go out and I'm going to get millions of people from the Democ=
rats," Trump said. "I'm going to get Bernie [Sanders] people to vote, becau=
se they like me on trade."
