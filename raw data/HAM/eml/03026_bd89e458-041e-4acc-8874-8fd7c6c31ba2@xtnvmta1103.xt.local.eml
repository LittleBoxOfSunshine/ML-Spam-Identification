BREAKING - "Afghan government confirms Taliban leader's death" - Reuters: "The death of Mullah Akhtar Mansour could trigger a battle for succession and deepen fractures that emerged in the insurgent movement after the death of its founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, ... more than two years after he died. Saturday's strike, which U.S. officials said was authorised by President Obama and included multiple drones, showed the United States was prepared to go after the Taliban leadership in Pakistan." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=8c968b60cf7838d0ce2cb90228370ce0ea027b1c0b05ced4826b05e4102a9fd7

DRIVING THE DAY -- AP: "Obama arrives Hanoi 1:10 p.m. EDT."

--"Obama's 'apology' complex: Why this president sees himself as a force for confronting complicated truths about the past," by Politico's Isaac Dovere in Hanoi: "Seven years after kicking off his presidency with a famous outreach to the Arab world speech in Cairo, skipping Israel, Barack Obama is about to bookend it with one of his last big trips on Air Force One, landing first here in Vietnam and then on to Hiroshima. ... He and his White House aides call it 'reckoning with history.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=8c968b60cf7838d0b5bbdcd68e19071c96045578c1e55fbcdda313f6688dc8a8

SIREN: Off embargo at 9 a.m. - NBC's Mark Murray: "Clinton's advantage over Donald Trump has narrowed to just three points [46%-43% among registered voters, with margin of +/- 3.1 points], resulting in a dead-heat general-election contest with more than five months to go until November, according to ... a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. ... In April, Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, and had led him consistently by double digits since December. ... 

"Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent. ...

"Clinton holds the edge among African Americans (88 percent to 9 percent), Latinos (68 percent to 20 percent), women (51 percent to 38 percent) and those ages 18 to 34 (55 percent to 32 percent). Trump ... is ahead among whites (52 percent to 36 percent), seniors (52 percent to 41 percent), men (49 percent to 40 percent) and independents (42 percent to 37 percent)." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=8c968b60cf7838d040b47480ce319114e447470ae95797378fa8e855568ea419

--ABC's GARY LANGER, on ABC-WashPost out at midnight: "Clinton's 6-point lead among all adults, 48-42 percent in a general election matchup, switches to essentially a dead heat among registered voters, 46 percent for Trump, 44 percent for Clinton. ... [T]he contest has tightened considerably since March, when Clinton led among registered voters by 9 points. ... 

"[Trump is seen unfavorably by 60% of Americans and Clinton by 53%], making this a matchup between the two most unpopular likely presidential candidates in the history of ABC/Post election polls, dating back to 1984." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=8c968b60cf7838d0a097c5f1c1642eb50245a3c94962db5bc71cc8b5100e1c68 

"STRONGER TOGETHER" -- HILLARY CLINTON to Chuck Todd on "Meet the Press," when he asked "the big idea of your candidacy": "Look, we are stronger together. We are stronger together, in facing our internal challenges and our external ones. We are stronger together if we work to improve the economy. ... We are stronger together when we have a bipartisan, even nonpartisan foreign policy that protects our country. And that provides a kind of steady, strong, smart leadership that the rest of the world expects from us. ...

"I know that ... slogans come and go ... But when I look at where we are in our country together, we need to unify the country. We are stronger together, when we act on a set of plans and priorities that will ... benefit ... the American people."

MAUREEN DOWD, "Weakened At Bernie's": "I've talked to several former Clinton and Obama White House aides who don't enjoy checking in with the joyless Clinton campaign in Brooklyn. 'It's the Bataan Death March,' one says. Hopeful acceptance of Hillary has shifted to amazed disbelief that she can't put away Bernie. ... Hillary's Bataan Death March is making Republicans reconsider their own suicide mission with Trump. More are looking at Clinton's inability to get the flashing lights going like her husband, and thinking: Huh, maybe we're not dead here. Maybe Teflon Don could pull this off. ... 

"Hillary can't generate excitement on her own so she is relying on fear of Trump to get her into the White House. And Trump is relying on fear of everything to get him into the White House. So voters are stuck in the muck of the negative: What are you most afraid of?" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2db3805de4b0e78d435da413c96f3dace03b565f12cbbbd3dcff2d1bdb46e3f4

SUNDAY BEST -- Sen. Sanders, in Las Cruses, N.M., to Jake Tapper on "State of the Union," re primary challenge for House seat of DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, by law professor Tim Canova: "Well, clearly I favor her opponent. His views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman-Schultz's. And let me also say this: with all due respect to the current chairperson, if elected president, she would not be reappointed to be chair of the DNC."

EPIC "SNL" COLD OPEN - "Larry David's Bernie Sanders Has Beers With SNL's Hillary": "Hillary," played by Kate McKinnon: "Well bartender, I've done it! I've won the nomination. Well, no, I haven't: I keep losing states. But mathematically, I've done it! To math!" ... Bartender: "I'm actually closing up the bar. That means you too, sir." 

"Sanders": "No freaking way! I'm not going anywhere. I can stay here as long as I want." Bartender: "Senator Sanders, I'm sorry. The night is over." Sanders: "No, no, it's not over! It's not over til I say it's over." "Hillary": "Oh, hello, Senator Sanders. I didn't see you behind me -- so far behind me you couldn't catch up." 6-min. video, with great final scene http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2db3805de4b0e78dae8bb28ceb11c968210d8f447325b2b99c736d916f021e99

Jared Polis at the vegan hot spot "by Chloe" in NYC's Greenwich Village, enjoying a late afternoon lunch with his partner ... The former and current Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Army, Generals Ray Odierno (retired) and Mark Milley, chatting after West Point graduation yesterday. Both are also West Point grads.

COMING ATTRACTIONS - "Trump, Clinton gird for epic battle over guns ... already tearing into each other over the Second Amendment," by Sarah Wheaton in Louisville: "[H]er full-throated advocacy for gun control is unprecedented for a Democratic presidential candidate (and for her, for that matter), and Democrats down ballot are increasingly following her lead. While she has not called for abolishing the Second Amendment, as Trump has charged, she's pushed hard for ... expanded background checks. She has made exposing the gun industry to liability a central plank of her Democratic primary campaign against Sanders ... 

"It's a clear shift in tone and emphasis from 2008, when she described herself as a pro-gun churchgoer after Barack Obama was caught on tape criticizing working-class people who 'cling to their guns and religion.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2db3805de4b0e78d82ca3f5f8cdc8740ead9c2eda98f5ef58a2ab1cd7a377f42

--"Cameron: I'd meet Trump, but his Muslim comments are wrong" - London/AP: "Prime Minister David Cameron said ... it was 'a very dangerous thing to say' because it makes no distinction between the peaceful Muslim majority and a minority of extremists. ... Cameron's office said no formal invitation has been made, but it's customary for prime ministers to meet both ... presidential nominees if they visit Britain." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2db3805de4b0e78d65c06db0d8d1cc17423e368c8e1f36c5754ced865107bcbc 

DAVID IGNATIUS column from Baghdad, on WashPost op-ed page, "How the U.S. fights the Islamic State": "The military power that the United States can mobilize is daunting: We visited a warehouse packed with 37,000 sets of body armor and 32,000 M-16 rifles that will be airlifted to the Iraqis. We saw command centers that fuse intelligence from scores of drones ...

"America's military strength remains overwhelming, even after the tests of the past decade, and the emerging campaign almost surely will gradually disable the Islamic State. The problem, as nearly every commander here will acknowledge, is that U.S. military might cannot make a broken Iraq work as a nation." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2db3805de4b0e78d52f1f9a3af7a66dddfb087ce7236696be1abf5048b9b428d

AP FOR MONDAY PAPERS - "Acapulco Under Siege: Police, soldiers swarm Mexico's Acapulco, killings continue," by Mark Stevenson: "The upsurge in killings has made Acapulco one of Mexico's most violent places, scaring away what international tourism remained and recently prompting the U.S. government to bar its employees from traveling here for any reason. In response, Mexico has lined the city's coastal boulevard with heavily armed police and soldiers, turning Acapulco into a high-profile test case for a security strategy that the government has used elsewhere: When homicides spike, flood the area with troops." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2db3805de4b0e78d451221241a467f29ee55c2e70dee0968be9c530de9913fdd

In these sectors, what competition exists is oligopolistic, not the 'pure' competition depicted in textbooks." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=567ea344a5f952b4fc78af4e5244b78b41242469caaad81411e1fc95a58423ca (h/t TheBrowser.com)
