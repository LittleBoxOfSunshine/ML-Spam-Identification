THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate ReleaseMay 5, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20





**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.



1:00 P.M. EDT



 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. We've got a=
 couple of quick comments at the top before we get to your questions.



 As we've discussed in here many times, Americas economy continues to com=
e back strong, creating 14.4 million private sector jobs, over the longes=
t streak of job growth on record -- 73 consecutive months. But too many A=
mericans still aren't sharing in the benefits of that economic progress a=
s much as they should be.



 One reason for that is that too often large corporations are stifling fa=
ir competition and stacking the deck against workers, entrepreneurs and c=
onsumers. I want to highlight important pieces of progress today toward a=
ddressing these kinds of unfair practices. First, mandatory arbitration c=
lauses and the improper use of what are called non-compete agreements.=20=




 First, the independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau today put ou=
t a new proposal that is designed to crack down on the use of mandatory a=
rbitration clauses. In recent years, many financial products -- from bank=
 accounts to credit cards -- have found a way to avoid accountability by =
burying mandatory arbitration clauses deep in the fine print of hundreds =
of millions of contracts. These clauses force consumers to, basically on =
their own, take on large, well-resourced companies when their rights are =
violated. Mandatory arbitration clauses deny consumers the ability to joi=
n their resources, band together with others who have been harmed and get=
 their day in court. That's just not fair.



 Todays action is yet another example of the important work that's being =
done every day at the CFPB. You will recall that the CFPB was created by =
the Wall Street reform legislation that the President aggressively pushed=
 and happily signed into law back in 2010. In addition to writing stronge=
r rules of the road for mortgages, credit cards, and student loans throug=
h enforcement actions, the Bureau has put nearly $11 billion -- with a B =
-- $11 billion back in the pockets of more than 25 million consumers whov=
e been harmed by illegal practices.



 That's why the President fought so hard to create a strong CFPB, and tha=
t's why it's so appalling that Republicans in Congress have proposed to r=
epeal the CFPB in their budget -- while appalling, if not particularly su=
rprising where Republicans get a significant portion of their campaign co=
ntributions.



 Also today, the White House released a report underscoring the need to r=
eform the use of non-compete agreements, which deny workers the ability t=
o leave a company and go work for another company in the same industry --=
 something that all of you, I assume, might take a little notice of. (Lau=
ghter.) Far too often -- just try to --=20



Q There's that.



MR. EARNEST: I know my audience, Kevin. (Laughter.)=20



Q Yes, you do.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Far too often, these agreements aren't credibly protecting =
trade secrets. Instead theyre unnecessary roadblocks for workers trying t=
o get a raise, move up by joining another employer, or even start their o=
wn company. Nearly one in five workers, including 14 percent of low-wage =
workers, are subject to them. That holds down their bargaining power and =
their wages.=20



 In the coming months, we will build on examples of states that have take=
n actions highlighted in the report and put forward options for reform. W=
e'll certainly encourage more states to take action and to make sure empl=
oyers are treating their employees fairly. The President knows that the b=
est way to make sure everyone shares in our economic success is through h=
ealthy competition and stronger protections that guarantee consumers are =
treated fairly. That's what todays actions to combat both of these unfair=
 practices are all about.=20



 So with that, Kathleen, lets go to your questions.



 Q Okay. I'm going to go back to something you said yesterday, if I could=
. Your reaction to the elections on Tuesday. You said that you didnt thin=
k that the Democratic primary would go to a contested convention, and I j=
ust wanted to sort of put a finer point on it, if I could. Does that mean=
 that you think that Hillary is going to win the necessary delegates befo=
re the convention? Is that what you're saying?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I was alluding to is that theres been a =
lot of analysis that's been conducted about the trajectory of the campaig=
ns, and that was merely a commentary on the reporting out there that's co=
nducted an analysis. I haven't conducted an analysis. The White House has=
nt conducted that analysis. I'm just pointing out that most people whove =
taken a close look at this do not expect there to be a contested Democrat=
ic convention.=20



 Q So is the White House -- the White House has no opinion on whether or =
not Bernie Sanders remains in the race?



 MR. EARNEST: As I've said many times, it's the responsibility of individ=
ual candidates to make decisions about how to conduct their campaigns. An=
d ultimately, that's what theyll do.



 Q So if we take Senator Sanders at his word and hes going to stay until =
the very end, it looks like, at least for the next, maybe six weeks, Hill=
ary Clinton will be hit by Donald Trump on one side and by Senator Sander=
s on the other. And I'm wondering what the President thinks about that si=
tuation. Is that good for the Democratic Party, as he has often said? And=
 if anyone in the White House is interested in trying to mitigate the dam=
age that that might do to her candidacy.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I can say is that the President certainl=
y does envision a scenario where he will be strongly advocating for the D=
emocratic nominee for President. And part of the case that he will make w=
ill be the importance of Democrats coming together behind our nominee.=20=




 But the Presidents interest in this is primarily rooted in his desire to=
 see a successor who is committed to building on the progress that we've =
made over the last eight years. That progress has been notable, and the P=
resident will have a strong case to make when he begins making that case.=
 But we haven't reached the general election yet, but the President will =
not be shy about making that argument when we do.



 Q And privately, is anyone in the White House working to talk to the cam=
paigns about how the next six weeks are going to go?



 MR. EARNEST: I don't have any private conversations to discuss from here=
 today.



 Q And then I want to turn to the Justice Department letter to officials =
in North Carolina on the law there. Is it accurate to assume that that's =
a sign that a lawsuit is coming? It sounds like officials in North Caroli=
na aren't backing down in any way. And was it also meant to send a signal=
 to other states that have passed similar pieces of legislation -- possib=
ly Mississippi?=20



 MR. EARNEST: The decision to pursue that enforcement action and to notif=
y the state of North Carolina that the Justice Department intended to pur=
sue that enforcement action was a decision that was made at the Justice D=
epartment. These kinds of enforcement actions are made independent of any=
 sort of political interference or direction from the White House.=20



 So as we have discussed before, the White House as a matter of policy ha=
s been in discussions with a number of federal agencies, including the De=
partment of Justice, about what potential impact this law could have on p=
rograms that are funded in individual states by the federal government.



 But when it comes to enforcement actions, those are decisions that are m=
ade entirely by attorneys at the Department of Justice.



 Q So has the White House been updated on this agency review process that=
 you just mentioned? And should we expect similar announcements?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldnt expect any announcements any time soon -- a=
t least that Im aware of. But, yes, the White House does continue to coor=
dinate among the agencies that are taking a look at this. And look, the a=
gencies themselves have acknowledged that the passage of this law does ra=
ise questions about certain programs that are funded by the federal gover=
nment through these individual agencies.



 And there are a range of legal questions and policy questions that have =
emerged. They're being carefully considered by individual agencies. The D=
epartment of Justice, given the legal questions that are raised, has been=
 involved in that review. And given the need to coordinate the policy que=
stions that have been raised across agencies, the White House has been in=
volved, too. But Im not aware of any impending decisions.



 And all of that, of course, is separate from the enforcement decision th=
at was made by the Department of Justice and announced just yesterday.=20=




 Q Okay, and then just last one. On the ceasefire in Aleppo, can you give=
 us the White House assessment of how that appears to be holding? And the=
re was some discrepancy about exactly when it started and the need to set=
tle that --=20



 MR. EARNEST: My understanding is that this was -- the refreshing of cess=
ation of hostilities in and around Aleppo was slated to take effect yeste=
rday at midnight Damascus time.=20



 Since then we have seen a reduction in the frequency and intensity of vi=
olence in that area of the country. But we do continue to be concerned ab=
out some violations, even in that area, that continue. But there are also=
 other places in the country where we have not seen the steadfast commitm=
ent to the cessation of hostilities that both the regime and opposition h=
ave signed on to.



 So we continue to make a strong case that all sides benefit from the con=
scientious implementation of a cessation of hostilities. One obvious bene=
fit is that it creates an opening for international aid workers to provid=
e much needed humanitarian relief to civilians who have been caught in th=
e crossfire.=20



 And I don't know that there has been enough of an opening created in Ale=
ppo thus far to deliver that humanitarian relief. But certainly there is =
widespread interest in the international community in that taking place. =
And that certainly is part of what motivates our interest in making the i=
mplementation of cessation of hostilities a top priority.



 Q So is there an effort to extend this one so that these rescue and othe=
r -- can get through?=20



 MR. EARNEST: We certainly are interested in continuing to refresh the ce=
ssation of hostilities in those areas where its started to fray.



 And look, the agreement that was reached 36 hours ago did result in -- o=
r I should say the agreement that was implemented 36 hours ago did result=
 in a reduction in violence in and around Aleppo. But theres still too ma=
ny violations in and around Aleppo and in other parts of the country that=
 are a source of significant concern.



 Jeff.



 Q Josh, whats the White Houses reaction to the resignation of Turkeys Pr=
ime Minister today? And broadly speaking, are you concerned, or is the Pr=
esident concerned that President Erdoan is becoming too powerful?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, we have seen the news that Prime Minister Davut=
olu is planning to step down later this month. The Prime Minister has bee=
n a good partner with the United States, and we have appreciated his lead=
ership.=20



 Obviously, he and the Vice President have been in frequent communication=
 on a range of issues that are important to our two countries.=20



 I do not anticipate -- just anticipating another line of questioning, I =
do not anticipate that this is going to have any impact on the ability of=
 the United States and Turkey to work together, to continue to implement =
our strategy to degrade and destroy ISIL.=20



 There are a number of important steps that we have seen the Turks undert=
ake in the last several months that have been important to that effort. W=
e've seen Turkey do a more effective job at shutting down their border wi=
th Syria. Theres more that we believe that they can do, but they've made =
important progress that has reduced the flow of foreign fighters to ISIL =
in Syria.=20



 Turkey has granted the United States and some of our coalition partners =
access to air bases in Turkey that have made our military air operations =
more efficient, and in some cases even more effective. We've also seen Tu=
rkey play a constructive role in working with our European allies to addr=
ess a very difficult immigrant situation.=20



 And even before that agreement with the Europeans, Turkey was bearing a =
significant burden in terms of providing for the basic humanitarian needs=
 of more than a million Syrians who had fled to Turkey trying to escape v=
iolence in their home country. So there is no denying that Turkey has bee=
n an important partner and made a valuable contribution to our broader co=
unter-ISIL effort.



 But as we often do, we regularly remind Turkish authorities to ensure th=
at their actions uphold the universal, democratic values that are enshrin=
ed in Turkeys constitution. Those values are not just enshrined in Turkey=
s constitution, they're enshrined in the United States Constitution, as w=
ell. And these are the kinds of values that we advocate for around the wo=
rld. And particularly when it comes to questions like freedom of speech a=
nd freedom of the press, we've had specific concerns that we have raised =
with the Turks. We won't hesitate to do so in the future, but it has not =
affected our ability to work together with our NATO Allies and Turkey to =
implement a strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.



 Q Are you concerned -- and that last piece sort of addresses this -- but=
 more specifically, are you concerned that the concentration of power in =
the office of the presidency in Turkey, specifically President Erdogan, h=
as gone too far?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, as this point, I wouldnt render a judgment about what=
 potential political impact the Prime Minister's resignation may have. Wh=
at we're focused on is continuing to effectively cooperate with our Ally =
to degrade and destroy ISIL. And that's not going to prevent us from rais=
ing concerns or, in some cases, even outright objections about the way th=
e government observes the universal and democratic values that are enshri=
ned in their constitution.



 Q Okay. And then moving south, what is the White House's reaction to the=
 latest development in Brazil, where a Supreme Court justice suspended th=
e Speaker of the House -- or Speaker of the Lower House in Congress, who =
is one of the main rivals of President Rousseff?



 MR. EARNEST: I was not aware of that latest development. I think what is=
 clear from the coverage that we've seen over the last several months in =
Brazil, that there is a very challenging political environment that that =
country's leaders are trying to navigate. And it certainly comes at a dif=
ficult time for Brazil, given the economic challenges facing the country =
and giving the international spotlight on the country during this summer'=
s Olympics.=20



But as the President said in Argentina, six weeks ago, Brazil has a devel=
oped democracy. They've got sturdy, democratic institutions that should b=
e able to effectively deal with these challenges and ensure that the conc=
erns that have been raised are properly adjudicated.



 As with any democracy, that will take some time. There will be some bump=
s along the road. But the democratic institutions in Brazil are sturdy an=
d should be up to the test of weathering this difficult political situati=
on.



 Kenneth.

=20

 Q Thank you, Josh. Once a presidential candidate receives his or her par=
ty's nomination, it's tradition for them to receive classified intelligen=
ce briefings, as I'm sure you know. So Donald Trump has promoted numerous=
 conspiracy theories. He has quoted the National Enquirer. He's gone to T=
witter to make what some would see as unfiltered statements. So is this W=
hite House concerned about Donald Trump getting those classified briefing=
s? And also, is he hesitant to approve that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Kenneth, I know that Director Clapper, the Director o=
f the Office of National Intelligence, has spoken to this a little bit al=
ready. What Director Clapper has indicated is that the intelligence commu=
nity typically begins providing those briefings after the party nominatio=
n conventions have occurred. And I would expect that that would take plac=
e in this instance this year, as well. The decisions about how and whethe=
r and when and what to brief to the presidential nominees is something th=
at will be made -- is a decision that will be made by our intelligence pr=
ofessionals. They are committed to fulfilling the spirit of this bipartis=
an, or even nonpartisan, cooperation when it comes to sensitive national =
security issues.=20

 At the same time, they also will carry out those activities consistent w=
ith their understanding about treating this information sensitively. And =
the President has full confidence in the ability to Director Clapper and =
the professionals in his office to carry out these responsibilities appro=
priately.



 Q But no comment on whether the President would be confident or feel com=
fortable with Donald Trump getting intelligence briefings?



 MR. EARNEST: Those are assessments that will have to be made by the inte=
lligence community. And the President has full confidence in the ability =
of our professionals in the intelligence community to make those assessme=
nts.



 Q Josh, on Merrick Garland, now that there are some GOP senators who cam=
e out and said, we will not support Donald Trump, is the White House now =
trying to approach those senators to push Merrick Garland through a littl=
e faster, to maybe give him a hearing, maybe get them on your side?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly have made the case to all 100 senators t=
hat they have a basic responsibility that's dictated by the Constitution =
whether they're on our side or not. And right now, we've seen too many Re=
publican senators indicate that they're not prepared to do their job, tha=
t they're not prepared to fulfill their basic constitutional responsibili=
ty. That's a tough position for them to be in, particularly because their=
 explanation is not that they have legitimate, substantive concerns with =
Chief Judge Merrick Garland. After all, Chief Judge Garland has served fo=
r 19 years on the second-highest court in the land. He's got more federal=
 judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in American his=
tory.=20



And just yesterday, the Congressional Research Service issued a report th=
at confirms what you've heard me say many times. The Research Service wro=
te that, "Judge Garland has been widely viewed as a meticulous and cautio=
us jurist, writing with his precision and an eye toward ensuring that the=
 Court does not overreach in any particular case." It's that approach to =
doing his job that has prompted even Republican senators to describe Chie=
f Judge Garland as a consensus nominee. I suspect it's also part of what =
prompted the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to acknowledge that by n=
ot doing their job, Republicans in the Senate were taking "a gamble."=20



Republicans are rolling the dice with the Supreme Court, because they hav=
e an opportunity to carefully consider a nominee that the President has p=
ut forward that Republicans themselves acknowledge is a consensus nominee=
; that he has an approach to the law that is entirely consistent with wha=
t Democrats and Republicans would like to see in a Supreme Court justice.=
 That's not just my opinion; that actually is the opinion that's articula=
ted by Ted Olson, who was appointed President George W. Bush to represent=
 the United States before the Supreme Court. He's a conservative, he's a =
lawyer who knows a lot about the Supreme Court, and even he has described=
 Chief Judge Garland as somebody who is exactly what Americans need on th=
e Supreme Court.=20



But ultimately, I dont think the American people are comfortable with Rep=
ublicans rolling the dice with the Supreme Court. They're not comfortable=
 with this gamble. What they would like Republicans in the Senate to do i=
s simply their job to fulfill their basic constitutional responsibility. =
As long as they're picking up a paycheck, they might as well do what thei=
r constituents sent them to Washington to do. And unfortunately, too many=
 Republicans are saying, well, I'm not going to do what my constituents s=
ent me to do; I'm just going to follow the instructions of the Republican=
 Leader in the United States Senate. That may be their explanation, but I=
'm not sure it's one that's going to fly with their constituents.



Cheryl.



Q Thanks, Josh. This morning, the FDA released a rule to regulate more to=
bacco products, and I'm wondering if the President would veto any bill or=
 rider that would exempt the e-cigarettes from that.



MR. EARNEST: Well, the FDA did make an important announcement today. And =
obviously, while we have made important progress over the last 50 years i=
n reducing smoking rates, the fact is that smoking continues to be a lead=
ing cause of preventable death in the United States. About one in every f=
ive deaths each year can be traced back to tobacco products.=20



So that's why the scientists at the FDA have taken steps to further regul=
ate tobacco products, particularly as it relates to the ability of kids u=
nder the age of 18 getting their hands on them. So this is a common-sense=
 proposal carefully considered by the FDA. I know many critics of this ru=
le have suggested that this rule took too long to implement. I actually t=
hink it underscores the care and caution and concern that our scientists =
took in implementing this rule effectively and fairly.=20



So obviously this is something that our scientists believe would have a t=
angible impact on the basic public health and safety of the American peop=
le, particularly Americas children.=20



 So that's obviously a good thing. I havent seen any proposed riders. We =
have made clear -- the President takes a very dim view of attaching ideol=
ogical riders to appropriations bills. We've certainly indicated our stro=
ng opposition to those kinds of proposals in the past. But Im not aware o=
f anything that's been put together at this point.



 April.



 Q Josh, a couple questions on a couple different subjects. One, what is =
the concern from this White House about the party not coming together lik=
e it had in the past around convention time? Because there is a differenc=
e in the politics between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. And many of=
 Bernie Sanders followers may not be the traditional Democratic supporter=
.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think I would say that theres concern at this=
 point for a variety of reasons. I think most important of which is that =
you've heard the President say on many occasions that the differences bet=
ween the Democratic nominees -- or Democratic candidates are not nearly a=
s significant as the difference between the Democratic candidates and the=
 presumptive Republican nominee.



 The President has said that on many occasions. And I suspect hell have m=
any opportunities in the future to make that case.



 But look, the Presidents view is that hes going to advocate strongly for=
 a successor who is committed to building on the progress that our countr=
y has made under his leadership. And obviously, the President has got a l=
ot personally invested in those policies and in that progress. And hes go=
ing to certainly spend a decent portion of the fall here making a strong =
case that his successor should look to build on that progress.



 Q Does the White House look at this potential fight leading up to the co=
nvention, or this separation still leading up to the convention a problem=
 in relation to fighting against the presumptive nominee who is already t=
he presumptive nominee for the Republican Party? Is this an impediment to=
 possibly gaining ground on Donald Trump?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think -- again, based on what the President =
has said before I think he feels quite confident that Democrats will come=
 together around a set of values that he himself has been advocating for,=
 for the last seven years.=20



 There is a reason that the President is the most popular politician in A=
merica, particularly among Democrats, that his approval rating is higher =
and his unfavorable rating is lower than -- among Democrats than anybody =
else in the country. That is a strong endorsement of the work that this P=
resident has done over the last eight years or so. And that certainly is =
going to enhance the Presidents ability to make an argument to those very=
 voters about the stakes in the election, about the need to elect somebod=
y who will look to build on that progress.



 Q Now -- looking at the next subject, now looking forward to the weekend=
, Howard University, how does this administration view Howard as it relat=
es to the President speaking this weekend?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, look, Howard University is one of the finest institut=
ions of higher education in the country. And it certainly is a distinguis=
hed institution of higher learning that is -- among HBCUs. And so the Pre=
sident is looking forward to visiting the university and speaking to the =
graduates.=20



 It will be an opportunity for him to discuss the responsibility that the=
 graduates have, not just to the African American community, but to the A=
merican people to use their skills and their gifts to form a more perfect=
 union. And there are a variety of ways that those distinguished graduate=
s will be able to do that -- whether thats serving in their community; wh=
ether that is serving in our military; or whether that is pursuing a prof=
ession and starting a new business; or being part of a remarkable scienti=
fic breakthrough that could have consequences for the health of millions =
of Americans or the convenience of Americans through the use for new tech=
nology. So the future is quite bright for those graduates.



 And the President will talk about the sense of optimism that he has abou=
t their future and the countrys future. But he certainly will not skim ov=
er the important responsibility that they have, as well.



 Q So the President is very well aware of the financial troubles that man=
y HBCUs have been undergoing at this time. Is that one of the reasons why=
 he chose Howard? Its the nations first federally funded HBCU, and its ha=
ving some financial problems. Is that one of the reasons why he chose How=
ard as his last HBCU commencement address as President?=20



 MR. EARNEST: No, I don't think that's why he chose Howard. This is a dis=
tinguished class of graduates, and the President has got an important mes=
sage to deliver to them.



 Q And when you look back over the eight years and HBCUs, what would you =
say the President has been able to contribute to the HBCUs, and the HBCU =
community, which is vast in this nation?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, obviously the President has had an opportunity on at =
least a couple of occasions to speak at -- to deliver the commencement ad=
dress as HBCUs. The President has enjoyed that opportunity in the past, a=
nd he certainly is looking forward to Saturdays festivities.=20



 But as a policy matter, this administration has worked hard to significa=
ntly increase funding for students who attend HBCUs, but also to support =
HBCUs as institutions. The President believes those institutions have an =
important role to play in educating future generations of Americans. And =
this administration has been strongly supportive of it. I can provide you=
 some more details here. I don't have them in front of me. Well follow up=
 with you.



 Michelle.



 Q Now that a lot more of the detail has come out surrounding the death o=
f a Navy SEAL in Iraq -- that Special Forces were overwhelmed, that they =
had to call in more Navy SEALs, that they finally had to leave when they =
ran out of ammunition; the Peshmerga then had to take over. Its kind of a=
 different line of questioning than -- now that we know those details and=
 just kind of how overwhelmed these guys were, even after they called in =
their own backups, does that raise concerns for you about the positioning=
 of these Special Forces, given what their role is supposed to be, and ho=
w prepared they are? Or in this case, how prepared they werent for someth=
ing like this happening?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, I think for the most direct answer to this =
question, given the operational details that are included in it, Id encou=
rage you to check with the Department of Defense.



 Let me just say Im not aware of any policy changes that are prompted as =
a result of this particular situation and the tragic death that resulted.=
 The individuals -- the servicemembers who were in this situation were hi=
ghly trained. They were well armed. And they were backed up by overwhelmi=
ng military airpower that did succeed in exacting many more casualties on=
 ISIL targets -- both fighters and equipment -- than was sustained by Ame=
rican forces to be sure.=20



 But there has been a recognition from the beginning that American servic=
emembers serving our country in Iraq, in an advise-and-assist mission are=
 taking a significant risk. They are putting themselves in harms way to p=
rotect our country. And we owe them a debt of gratitude. And is it at tim=
es like these when we're mourning the death of a brave American serviceme=
mber that we're reminded in rather vivid terms of their significant sacri=
fice.



 That certainly is not lost on the President. And I don't think its lost =
on any American who has read the news coverage of this incident over the =
last couple of days.=20



 These individuals are going to great lengths and assuming great personal=
 risk for our freedom and for our safety. They do that so that we don't h=
ave to. And we owe them a debt of gratitude. And the Commander-in-Chief c=
ertainly does not take lightly the commitment and patriotism of those bra=
ve Americans who are serving our country over in Iraq and Syria right now=
.



 Q Knowing what happened, does these details bother you?



 MR. EARNEST: What is clear is that its a dangerous situation. And whats =
also clear is that these are servicemembers. These are Americans. These a=
re patriots who are well-trained. This is some of the best -- these men a=
nd women are some of the best that our country has to offer. And they're =
preforming a great service to our country.=20



 Q I guess the concern is, though, that you could say that this is a fluk=
e situation where nobody really predicated what exactly would happen. Eve=
ry situation is obviously different. But now that they're in those positi=
ons where they are closer to the battle -- okay, this was two miles away.=
 But where they were and what they're doing now, and the fact that more S=
pecial Forces are going over there, I feel like this may have been asked =
before, but Im sort of asking it now in the context of what happened, tha=
t can we expect these kinds of firefights and unpredictable situations to=
 happen more often now that more Americans are over there?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I would say a couple things about that. The first is =
that any sort of military conflict like this is going to include a lot of=
 unpredictability. For example, that's precisely why these individuals wh=
o are not in a combat mission are equipped for combat, so that if an unpr=
edictable situation arises, they have the equipment and training and reso=
urces to defend themselves.=20



 The Department of Defense has described the circumstances of the service=
member who was killed. He was actually part of the quick reaction force t=
hat was summoned to defend and help expedite the departure of Americans w=
ho were advising Peshmerga forces. I think that -- just the circumstances=
 of the situation should illustrate the capabilities of the individuals w=
ho are involved. They're tremendous. These are well-trained, well-equippe=
d American servicemembers who are prepared to fight for their country, an=
d to keep us safe, and to keep their fellow servicemembers safe.



 Whats also true is they have an enormous advantage in terms of being bac=
ked up by American military airpower. And there were a number of United S=
tates military aircraft that responded to this situation, carried out a s=
eries of airstrikes that took some 50 ISIL fighters off the battlefield, =
destroyed a number of other vehicles, and took out other fighting positio=
ns that were maintained by ISIL terrorists.



 So as tragic as this one particular death is, there were no other casual=
ties that were reported by the Department of Defense. So this is I think =
a good illustration of just how dangerous the situation is. Its a reminde=
r of how significant a debt of gratitude we owe our servicemembers in Ira=
q and in Syrian.



 But its also a testament to our military planners that even in a situati=
on as unpredictable as this one, the United States and our coalition part=
ners were able to quickly mobilize the resources necessary to respond to =
a dangerous situation.=20



 Q And just before the President went to Flint you were asked here in the=
 briefing and kind of drew some laughs as to whether the President would =
drink the Flint water.=20



 And you -- just in the words you chose and your tone, you seemed kind of=
 dismissive. And you called that a photo-op. And you didn't know then tha=
t the President would take part in that kind of a photo-op. But then he d=
id it three times yesterday. And that seems like the kind of thing that t=
he President doesn't usually like to do, that it really did seem like it =
was some kind of photo op. Why did the President feel like he wanted to d=
rink the water three times and kind of make this big deal out of that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I actually think that, for those of you who were at t=
he pool spray yesterday in the briefing with federal officials, the Presi=
dent spoke for about 15 minutes or so and indicated that he was finished =
talking and that the pool could move on so we could move on to the next e=
vent. And it was actually reporters in the pool who said, Mr. President, =
will you drink the water? And so he did, acknowledging that he doesnt usu=
ally indulge them in these kinds of stunts, but in this case, he did in r=
esponse to a specific request from a journalist.



 Q And then he did it two more times. And he called it a stunt, and said =
it wasnt a stunt, and then he -- calling for the water, and saying, I'm t=
hirsty, and wheres the water?



 MR. EARNEST: There typically is a glass of water or tea underneath his p=
odium when hes delivering a speech. It was not there yesterday when he wa=
s giving the speech. And I think everybody, again, who was listening care=
fully noticed that 20 or 30 minutes into his remarks he started coughing =
and asked for something to drink.=20



 Q That wasnt from the water, was it?=20



 MR. EARNEST: No, this was before the water was provided.



 Q But it was after the pool spray where he drank the water the first tim=
e. Was that what he was coughing from?



 MR. EARNEST: I think he was coughing from having spoken for 20 or 25 min=
utes in a row without having anything to drink.



 So I guess what I would say is this. I would acknowledge that the Presid=
ent was indulging the photographers in which he consumed water from Flint=
 after the briefing with federal officials. But at the speech, the man wa=
s just thirsty. (Laughter.)=20



 Q Well, yeah, but he made it a point to say, I don't want a bottle, I wa=
nt a glass of water -- like somebody bring me a glass of water. And he as=
ked for it twice. And then at the end, he also drank some. So I guess wha=
t I'm saying is, if you guys were kind of like calling this a photo-op fr=
om the start, why did the President feel it was so important to keep on d=
rinking the water while --



 MR. EARNEST: Again, the President was speaking publicly for an hour, and=
 so I think most people get thirsty when they talk for a long time. The P=
resident had spoken for a long time and got thirsty.



 Q The stories that he told saying how he, others had eaten lead when the=
y were kids. He said he felt sure that he had eaten paint chips when he w=
as a kid. Is that true? Is he sure that at some point he had eaten paint =
chips as a child?



 MR. EARNEST: I think the President is making the point that the effort t=
o remove lead from gasoline and from paint is a relatively recent phenome=
non; that before 1980, it was actually common for even young children to =
be exposed to lead. And it's only as we've come to understand the impact =
of that exposure have we taken significant steps to try to prevent that e=
xposure from occurring because it has a negative impact on cognitive and =
emotional development.



 I think the message that the President was trying to deliver was a criti=
cally important one, which is people in Flint have been concerned and wer=
e concerned to learn that children in their household, their own children=
 had been exposed to lead through the water supply, and that they had bee=
n misled by *federal[state] authorities. And they were scared, they were =
anxious, and justifiably anger, in the Presidents own description. But at=
 the same time, the President did not want them to despair about the futu=
re opportunities for their kids to succeed. They should feel confident th=
at despite this failure of government, that the children of Flint continu=
e to have a future, and a future that is bound only by the limits of thei=
r own imagination.=20



 And that's why it's important for the parents of those kids to understan=
d that even though they were exposed to lead, that's not going to limit t=
he future opportunities of their kids. Yes, they need to get the health c=
are that they need. Yes, they need medical attention. Yes, they should ge=
t the proper follow-up. Yes, they should be conscientious about making su=
re that follow-up occurs, that there are specific things that our medical=
 professionals recommend that can counteract the impact of lead -- of ele=
vated levels of lead in the bloodstream, even for kids. And parents shoul=
d follow that advice. But they shouldnt further restrain the ambitions of=
 their kids because of this situation.



 And I think the President is a good example. The President is making cle=
ar that even when the President himself was a kid, he was exposed to lead=
. And I don't know whether that was from the lead paint in his house when=
 he was growing up, or whether that was from lead that was in gasoline or=
 lead that was in the pipes. The President was exposed to that lead as a =
kid, and he had a very bright future that allowed him to attend Harvard L=
aw School and be elected President of the United States.



 Q This is what I'm saying. We're not comparing apples to apples here. Do=
esnt it seem like an odd comparison that I may have had some environmenta=
l exposure to lead as a kid, versus these people who have been drinking l=
ead-tainted water for about a year, and some of these kids had elevated l=
ead levels that are eight times what is considered the minimum level of e=
levation by the federal government? I mean --



 MR. EARNEST: I guess the Presidents point is he wasnt even tested for le=
ad when he was a kid, so we don't know exactly what his elevated level wa=
s. The point of this is -- but in some ways, that is beside the point. Th=
e point here is that being exposed to lead is not going to limit the pote=
ntial of these kids. The kids in Flint still have an opportunity to succe=
ed. They should get medical attention. That's why we've expanded access t=
o Medicaid. Thats why the Department of Health and Human Services announc=
ed yesterday a million-dollar grant to health care workers in Flint to ex=
pand their capacity to try to meet the needs of these kids. If kids get t=
hat medical attention, if they get the follow-up, if they follow the inst=
ructions of medical professionals, there is no reason that this governmen=
t failure should have any impact on their long-term ability to grow up an=
d fulfill their dreams.



 Q And the President has made the point that government is us and you can=
 trust government, it's just a bunch of people just like us. But these pe=
ople for more than a year have been failed by literally every level of go=
vernment, so why should they put any store in what the President was sayi=
ng to them?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, I dont think that's exactly the argument th=
e President was making. The argument the President was making is that too=
 often we find Republicans who denigrate the institution of government wi=
thout recognizing that government reflects their citizens and that govern=
ment, as described by Abraham Lincoln -- the first Republican President -=
- is that government is formed to do the kinds of things that we can't do=
 for ourselves. Nobody should have an expectation that they're going to h=
ire their own police force or hire their own fire department, or hire the=
ir own water department. But rather, we're going to work together, we're =
going to pool our resources, and we're going to be dedicated to the pursu=
it of the common good. And a tax on government failed to acknowledge that=
 fact, as cleanly articulated by Abraham Lincoln.



 What is also true is that when government makes mistakes, as in this ins=
tance, we should own up to it, and government should mobilize an effectiv=
e response to deal with the fallout. And that's exactly what's happened i=
n this situation. But that's not an attempt to downplay the significance =
of the failures in Flint. It's an attempt to underscore the need to inves=
t in the things that we know are critical to the health, safety, and well=
being of the American people.



 I used this example yesterday: There's an acknowledgement that environme=
ntal regulators at the state level are principally responsible for this f=
ailure. That does not mean we should eliminate the Michigan Department of=
 Environmental Quality. How exactly is eliminating the role of environmen=
tal regulators going to make our water safer or our air cleaner? It's not=
. It's going to make it worse. What we need is we need effective governme=
nt, a competent government. And that's what the President spent a lot of =
the last seven or eight years working on. And I think we've got significa=
nt, positive results to enjoy because of that attention.



 David.



 Q On a couple different topics. One, I wanted just to follow up to I thi=
nk something Kathleen asked about the DOJ letter to North Carolina. Given=
 that you're saying that the White House did not weigh in directly on tha=
t letter -- it was sort of a legal decision, a legal matter -- and given =
the fact that I think the administration has an ongoing review of whether=
 maybe to withhold some federal funding from different agencies to the st=
ate based on that law, in the meantime, is the administration or the Whit=
e House doing anything, taking any direct steps to try to discourage publ=
ic officials in other states to not pass similar kinds of laws?



 And then also, I'm wondering, is there any concern out of the White Hous=
e, given the DOJ letter, of the issue becoming politicized in North Carol=
ina and having sort of a counterproductive effect of legislators digging =
in their heels, when you could maybe wait to see if public pressure in th=
e state might have the same effect?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think, on the second part, I'd refer you to the Dep=
artment of Justice about their strategy. They were the ones who made the =
decision to write the letter based on their own interpretation of the law=
 and the need to enforce it. So they can sort of walk you through their t=
hinking when it comes to whether or not that was the right approach.



 More generally, in terms of other states considering these kinds of laws=
, I'm not aware of any specific message that's been directed by the White=
 House with regard to discouraging other states from pursuing these kinds=
 of rules. But I think any other state that has observed the economic imp=
act on the state of North Carolina would draw their own conclusions about=
 the wisdom of pursuing laws like this.=20



 There are a number of large business interests that have come forward an=
d made clear that this law that makes discrimination against their custom=
ers and their employees more likely makes it less it likely that they're =
going to do business in North Carolina. That's true of athletic organizat=
ions like the NBA and the NCAA, but there are other businesses that have =
come forward and indicated that they're reconsidering expanding their bus=
iness in North Carolina because of the law.



 So particularly in an economy where we see states aggressively competing=
 to land business opportunities, there's no denying that passing discrimi=
natory laws like this one is counterproductive.



 Q On another topic, if I could. On trade -- the President had an op-ed i=
n the Post, promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I'm wondering if -- =
I know that the administration would like Congress to begin to take this =
up, maybe pave the way for a vote. Just curious whether you could say whe=
ther the administration thinks that having on a vote on the Trans-Pacific=
 Partnership in the lame duck session is legitimate strategy that you wou=
ld be okay with if it came to that.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, David, what I can tell you is that we've been in conv=
ersations with Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate, and D=
emocrats who have been supportive of our efforts thus far, about the best=
 way to get TPP passed through the Congress. And the political calculatio=
n I would acknowledge is complicated. It doesnt fall cleanly along party =
lines. So we're going to have to work in bipartisan fashion to develop a =
strategy that will lead to success. And those are conversations that are =
ongoing with --



 Q Is the lame duck session a part of the conversation? Is that a legitim=
ate strategy? Does that delegitimize it in any way if a new President has=
 been elected and is coming in and may have qualms about the deal -- does=
 that legitimize it in any way? Or do you feel like it is legitimate as p=
art of your conversations that you're talking about?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not going to get into the details of the substanc=
e of those conversations. I will just stay that there's no reason we need=
 to wait that long, particularly when you consider that ratifying the Tra=
ns-Pacific Partnership would hasten the end to 18,000 taxes that other co=
untries impose on American goods. So American businesses certainly dont w=
ant to wait until the end of this year, before Congress acts on the TPP. =
So it's not just the White House that's making the case that Congress sho=
uld act on this; it's organizations like the Chamber of Commerce, the Ame=
rican Farm Bureau and the National Organization of Manufacturers who dont=
 typically agree with the White House but are joining us in the effort to=
 encourage prompt congressional action.



 Q And the final thing on that is just, if the remaining three major cand=
idates in the race total, on each side, have come out as they have with c=
oncerns and said they do not support TPP is it currently exists, and they=
 do not necessarily support a vote in the lame duck session, does that ma=
ke it more difficult, do you think, for the White House to go forward on =
lame duck with a vote?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, David, I think you have just articulated a political =
dynamic that should be rather compelling to supporters of TPP wondering w=
hether or not Congress should act this year. Again, supporters of TPP are=
 not likely to have a more enthusiastic President for the Trans-Pacific P=
artnership in 2017.=20



 Q One more. Just following up on April's question about Howard Universit=
y. The President is giving three addresses to -- or commencements this ye=
ar, three very different types of universities. One is a sort of historic=
ally black college, another is a big state university, and one is a milit=
ary academy. Is he tailoring his message to each of those? You mentioned =
-- talking about encouraging the young people to use their skills to form=
 a more perfect union. That's pretty general I think. Could you talk a li=
ttle bit about if theres a specific message at Howard?



 MR. EARNEST: Ill be prepared to do that tomorrow.=20



 Q Okay.



 Q Why not today? (Laughter.)=20



 MR. EARNEST: Christi.



 Q Josh, thank you. You said a minute ago that the President will spend a=
 decent portion of the fall advocating for the Democratic nominee to succ=
eed him. Can you envision a scenario in which he does that for a specific=
 person prior to the convention?



 MR. EARNEST: At this point I would hesitate to predict exactly what the =
timeframe will be. But I guess the other thing I would point out is its -=
- there are other important races on the ballot other than -- in addition=
 to the presidential race. There are important races for the United State=
s Senate, for the United States Congress, and for some governors offices =
where I would expect the President would also be involved.



 And well sort of see how things play out over the next couple of months.=
 But as we start to make those decisions, well let you know.=20



 Q Well, as he was speaking yesterday, at one point it really looked -- a=
ctually not at one point, but pretty much through the whole address in Fl=
int yesterday, he was making the case for a Democratic Congress and a Dem=
ocratic White House and a Democratic point of view in general. Could he c=
onceivably continue to do that through July and be as effective as he wou=
ld be if he were advocating for a particular person?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President was making less of a partisan a=
rgument yesterday, and more of a philosophical one. The philosophical arg=
ument that he was making is that for our nation and our communities to su=
cceed, we need an effective government. And too often every answer that i=
s put forward by Republicans is one that is focused on tearing down gover=
nment, or shrinking government, or undermining government.=20



 Again tearing down institutions that are responsible for keeping our air=
 clean and our water clean are not going to make it safer for our kids to=
 drink. There are a variety of ways to sort of draw this analogy. It cert=
ainly applies to local governments who are responsible for administering =
elections. It certainly is true when it comes to public safety.=20



 So theres a basic question here about what our approach to governing is =
going to be. And the President believes that Flint actually illustrates t=
hose differing -- the consequences of those differing philosophies in rat=
her stark terms. And I don't know if the President is going to make that =
same argument around the country. But it certainly is an argument that fe=
els pretty resonant in Flint, Michigan right now.



 Q I think -- I guess my question is if hes worried about the lost time a=
dvocating for a particular nominee. But I don't feel like you're going to=
 answer it. So I don't want to waste --=20



 MR. EARNEST: No. (Laughter.)=20



 Q I don't want to hear that speech again. I heard it yesterday. (Laughte=
r.)=20



 MR. EARNEST: Fair enough.=20



 Q That was a good summary.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Im not offended. Im happy to admit the President is better =
at giving that speech than I am.



 Q Now if you drink some water right now, that would just be --



 MR. EARNEST: Okay, Ill do that. (Laughter.)=20



 Q Can I ask you about something else? The President and his staff lately=
 seem to be doing a lot of explaining, a lot of interviews explaining his=
 record and setting the record straight. Is there a feeling in the White =
House that some basic things about the Presidents record in office are mi=
sunderstood by the American people?=20



 MR. EARNEST: I think there is a sense in the White House that its import=
ant for the American people to understand exactly what the President has =
prioritized over the last seven years. The President entered the White Ho=
use with a very specific strategy to prevent a second Great Depression, b=
ut also to strengthen the middle class. The President entered with a very=
 specific strategy to fight climate change. The President entered with a =
very specific strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. T=
he President entered with a very specific strategy to responsibly get our=
 men and women out of harms way in Iraq and Afghanistan. The President en=
tered with a very specific strategy to ensure that the next generation of=
 Americans would be trained and educated to compete and win in a 21st cen=
tury global economy. The President entered the White House with a very sp=
ecific strategy to reduce the deficit, and the deficit has been cut by th=
ree-fourths since he took office.=20



 So I think just as a factual matter its important for people to understa=
nd that. I think its particularly important for people to understand, as =
they consider whether or not they should elect someone who will build on =
that progress, or scrap it.=20



 I think its also important as people evaluate what kind of policies the =
United States Congress should pursue. Many of the things that I just desc=
ribed were either things that were accomplished as a result of strong Dem=
ocratic support in Congress, or were accomplished in spite of Republican =
opposition in Congress.=20



 So people understanding exactly what the Presidents strategy was and wha=
t the results have been is relevant as they consider the broader impact o=
f the Obama presidency. And I would actually make the case this is someth=
ing that we've been talking about for quite a while. And I would anticipa=
te that it will continue over the course of the year.



 Q Why do you think people -- well, you mentioned the deficit just now. A=
nd that's a thing that the President in recent days has said is misunders=
tood by people. Why do you think people don't know that -- since we're ta=
lking about factual things, why people don't know that, havent registered=
 that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, some of it is certainly that there are Republicans wh=
o go to great lengths to lie about the Presidents record. That happens wi=
th some regularity. And there are some Republican interests that have spe=
nt hundreds of millions of dollars to do that, particularly in the contex=
t of the 2012 reelection campaign. So that certainly would be a part of i=
t.



 I think the President has also acknowledged that in the very earliest da=
ys of his presidency when there was a raging economic crisis, there wasnt=
 ample time to spend a week or two describing to the American people the =
steps that the government was taking to address the crisis because the tr=
uth is, after implementing a strategy to address one crisis, the Presiden=
t and his team had to move on to addressing the next one.=20



 So immediately after -- I think the best example of this is that immedia=
tely after passing the Recovery Act, that included billions of dollars in=
 tax cuts for middle-class families, numerous tax cuts for small business=
es, and critically important investments in infrastructure and clean ener=
gy, the administration also had to figure out how to rescue the American =
auto industry.=20



 And that was something that was announced at the end of March, just a co=
uple of weeks after the Recovery Act was passed by Congress. So that's an=
 indication of the rapid pace of crisis-driven decisions that this admini=
stration had to engage in.=20



 And look, those are two isolated decisions that are still the subject of=
 extensive political debate. But there is no denying the tremendous posit=
ive impact that both of those decisions had on our economy. They were unp=
opular at the time. Some of them are unpopular now. But the results speak=
 for themselves. And so its important for people to understand the contex=
t of those results so that the next time that our country is facing an im=
portant economic decision, its important for the American people to have =
the facts about what worked so that we can make smart decisions about wis=
e investments in the future.



 Margaret.



 Q Josh, at the top of the briefing you said something about the ceasefir=
e in Syria, and a reduction has been noted in terms of the frequency and =
intensity of the violence. Theres been an airstrike in a refugee camp in =
Syria near the Turkish border that has reportedly killed dozens. There ar=
e images all over social media right now. Were you aware of that when you=
 said that you had seen this reduction in violence?



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, the reduction in violence is specifically around Alepp=
o, and that is a reduction in violence that we have seen. Yes, I was also=
 notified of this specific report shortly before walking out here.



 There is no justifiable excuse for carrying out an airstrike against inn=
ocent civilians who have already once fled their homes to escape violence=
. These individuals are in the most desperate situation imaginable. And t=
here is no justification for carrying military action that's targeting th=
em.



 The other thing that you should confirm with the Department of Defense, =
but I believe this to be true, there were no U.S. or coalition aircraft t=
hat were operating in the region primarily because our efforts are focuse=
d on ISIL. And theres little intelligence to substantiate the presence of=
 significant ISIL forces in that region of the country. But obviously rep=
orts like this are heartbreaking and indefensible.=20



 Q Well, given that Russia has an air force, and the Assad regime has som=
e aircraft, though not a full air force, is it safe to assume that that's=
 who you believe carried out this strike?



 MR. EARNEST: I wouldn't hazard a guess at this point about who carried o=
ut this particular strike. We have seen a willingness on the part of the =
Assad regime to use what military aircraft they have to carry out attacks=
 against innocent civilians. The dropping of barrel bombs is the best exa=
mple of that.=20



Again, I don't know enough about the details of this particular situation=
 to say whether or not the tactics that were used in this particular stri=
ke are the same as the tactics that the Assad regime has used in other pa=
rts of the country. But if it does turn out that the Assad regime is resp=
onsible for this particular strike it would not at all be the first time =
that the Assad regime has used its military force against innocent civili=
ans in a desperate situation.



Q And to very little consequence, as some would say, particularly when it=
 comes to this ceasefire, cessation of hostilities, that there are no rep=
ercussions for these violations, however flagrant they are, that the U.S.=
 just keeps going back to the negotiating table, saying we're dealing wit=
h malicious actors but we're hopeful that theyre going to show some honor=
 here. Is there any repercussions to a strike like this, killing, as you =
said, dozens of innocent civilians?



MR. EARNEST: I think as a result of the behavior that we've seen from the=
 Assad regime thus far, there is no hope that theyre going to show much h=
onor. What is true is that the only way to solve this situation effective=
ly, consistent with our national security interests, is for a political t=
ransition that results in Assads departure. And the United States has mob=
ilized the international community, worked closely with the United Nation=
s to try to facilitate those political talks. President Putin has acknowl=
edged himself that that kind of political transition needs to happen. And=
 we continue to impress upon President Putin the need to use his influenc=
e with the Assad regime to get them to abide by the ceasefire, the cessat=
ion of hostilities, and to participate constructively in the ongoing poli=
tical talks.=20



And there was a point where we did see an important reduction in violence=
 as a result of the initial implementation of the cessation of hostilitie=
s. That initial implementation went more smoothly than expected, and in t=
he last few weeks we've seen that agreement start to fray. And the improv=
ement in the situation around Aleppo is notable, but as I pointed out, th=
ere are other areas of the country where the cessation of hostilities is =
not implemented in the way that it should. And we're going to continue to=
 work closely with the rest of the international community to impress upo=
n all parties the need to live up to their commitments.



Q The White House, the President has talked at great length about how con=
cerned he is about the refugee issue and internally displaced people. Amo=
ng many of the proposals put forward for some version of a safe zone, som=
e not requiring ground forces, the argument has been to protect against s=
ituations exactly like this, hitting people who are already fleeing and i=
n camps. You're still saying the White House does not support any kind of=
 safe zone to protect these situations, these areas, refugee camps near t=
he border of Turkey?



MR. EARNEST: Well, Margaret, this situation is tragic and there is no dow=
nplaying that. But I think it also underscores the difficulty of establis=
hing a safe zone. It certainly underscores the tremendous commitment of m=
ilitary firepower that would be required to enforce a safe zone.=20



In the past, those who advocate a safe zone have suggested that, well, it=
 would not necessarily need to be treated as a no-fly zone. But based on =
the circumstance that youve just raised, that's not true, and to say noth=
ing of the significant commitment of ground forces that would be required=
 to prevent ISIL or anyone else from infiltrating the camp, to monitor pe=
ople as they move in and out, and frankly, if necessary, to root out extr=
emist forces that are able to get access to the camp. That is a significa=
nt commitment of firepower and manpower. It also puts American troops in =
a very dangerous place. Lots of them.



So our view continues to be that a political transition is the only solut=
ion that is consistent with our national security interests in that regio=
n of the world.



Q Can I ask on North Carolina -- when we were in London, the President sa=
id that he thought the law there and in Mississippi wrong and it should b=
e repealed. He went on to say the next day that he lacked the authority e=
ssentially to be able to do just that. So lawmakers in North Carolina are=
 saying they feel bullied by this DOJ action. How do you respond to the a=
ccusation that this is just another way of achieving the aim of getting t=
hat law repealed?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what this is, it's an independent enforcement =
decision that's made by attorneys at the Department of Justice. And there=
 certainly is a legal mechanism for evaluating the concerns that have bee=
n raised by the Department of Justice. Hopefully it won't come to that. H=
opefully the state of North Carolina and the lawmakers in North Carolina =
will make some decisions that are consistent with the law, consistent wit=
h our values, and consistent with the economic interests of their own sta=
te.



Thus far, the actions that they have taken have been inconsistent with al=
l of those things. And the President has spoken out quite forcefully agai=
nst it because in his view this is something that goes to a core principl=
e of fairness and equality and justice, and treating people the same and =
not discriminating against them because of who they love or because of wh=
o they are.



So it's a pretty simple calculation when it comes to values. The Departme=
nt of Justice has reached their own conclusions about what the law requir=
es, and theyve notified the state of North Carolina of their conclusion.



Q You said there had been no political interference in the DOJ process. B=
ut the President has clearly made his views very public.



MR. EARNEST: Yes, the President has been asked by certain insightful, dem=
anding journalists for his view. I'm looking for a way to get -- (laughte=
r.)



Q Okay. But again, though, at that town hall the next day. I mean, this i=
s an issue that's drawn a lot of attention.



MR. EARNEST: I would acknowledge the President has not pulled any punches=
 when it comes to making clear his view that this law is wrong. And that =
is a value judgment that he is offering, and he believes those values tha=
t have been called into question aren't just worth defending, theyre wort=
h advocating. And he'll do that.=20



But when it comes to enforcing the law, that's somebody elses responsibil=
ity. That's the responsibility of the lawyers at the Department of Justic=
e, and theyre carrying out those responsibilities consistent with the req=
uirements of the law and without interference from the White House.



Q You're saying there was no influence in the President stating his views=
 and the actions that DOJ took.



MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess youd have to talk to the Department of Justice=
 about that. There certainly was no attempt either publicly or privately =
to influence what is an independent enforcement decision carried out by D=
epartment of Justice attorneys.=20



Olivier.



Q Thanks, Josh. A U.S. Army intelligence officer based in Kuwait, a capta=
in, has brought a lawsuit, challenging the Presidents assertions that the=
 war against the Islamic State is legal under existing law. Youve been as=
ked a lot about that in this briefing room. Does it give you pause, thoug=
h, to hear some of these questions come from someone who is deployed in a=
ctive duty?



MR. EARNEST: No, it doesnt. I think these are legitimate questions for ev=
ery American to be asking. The truth is that 449 days ago, the President =
of the United States sent a detailed ISIL-specific AUMF proposal to Congr=
ess. That proposal included a recommendation to Congress that they not ju=
st pass this ISIL-specific AUMF but they repeal the 2002 AUMF and take st=
eps to more narrowly tailor the 2001 AUMF.=20



The President feels strongly about this. The day after the election, the =
President held a news conference with all of you in the East Room of the =
White House and was blunt about the need for Congress to take action on t=
his. That was the first time that hed discussed it in really blunt terms =
publicly, but certainly not the first time that he has advocated in other=
 settings for congressional action on this.=20



And unfortunately, we've not seen Congress take much action on this. The =
President sent up senior members of his national security team. His Secre=
tary of State, John Kerry, his then Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel bot=
h testified under oath before Congress. But we haven't seen congressional=
 action on one of Congresss most critically important responsibilities. A=
nd I'm not really sure why.



Maybe it's because they were spending a bunch of time considering the Pre=
sidents nominee to the Supreme Court. No, it wasnt that. Maybe it's becau=
se they are busy dealing with responding to a public health emergency to =
make sure our public health professionals they need to respond to the Zik=
a crisis. Well, no, it wasnt that. Maybe it was because Congress was hold=
ing intensive meetings with the Presidents Budget Director to consider th=
e Presidents budget proposal on a range of important issues, including cy=
bersecurity. No, they didnt do that either. They cancelled those hearings=
. Maybe it was because Congress was considering how important it was to e=
nsure that the Puerto Rican government had the restructuring authority th=
at they need so they can deal with the financial crisis that's affecting =
3 million Americans in Puerto. No, it wasnt that either.=20



I dont really know what Congress was doing. But this is yet another examp=
le of Congress dropping the ball when it comes to a core American priorit=
y.



 Q And I want to draw your attention to an anecdote in The New York Times=
, a profile of Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes. You remember,=
 right around the time of the State of the Union, when the Iranians captu=
red a number of American sailors?



 MR. EARNEST: I do remember that.



 Q Here's what the Times says: "Rhodes found out about the Iranian action=
 earlier that morning" -- meaning that State of the Union -- "but was try=
ing to keep it out of the news until after the President's speech. 'They =
can't keep a secret for two hours,' Rhodes says with a tone of mild exasp=
eration at the break in message discipline." That sounds like he was putt=
ing pressure on the military to withhold that information to avoid a poli=
tical headache. Is that what happened? And how often does it happen?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to -- well, I'll acknowledge I have not=
 read the story about Ben in the Times magazine. I do remember vividly th=
at day, and I dont think there is any expectation that -- well, let me sa=
y it this way, because I think there are a couple of factors here.



 The first is, Olivier, we've often found that it is easier to resolve si=
tuations like this when they arent subject to intense media scrutiny. We =
often will decline to discuss specific cases of Americans that are being =
held hostage around the world because we conclude that discussing them pu=
blicly before they are freed is not conducive to their prompt and safe re=
lease. I'm sure that was a factor in this situation.=20



 At the same time, I think anybody who took a look at the situation recog=
nized that it was not going to stay secret for long, and that that certai=
nly was true in this instance. And I think it is a good example, once aga=
in, of President Obama demonstrating his ability to effectively handle a =
crisis situation. You will recall that despite the pleas of some Republic=
ans in Congress, the President did deliver the speech on time, as planned=
. And those American servicemembers were released unharmed, with their eq=
uipment, the next day. That was an agreement that we had reached with the=
 Iranians.=20



 So I think the outcome of this situation and the way that it was handled=
 during that busy day I think is a strong endorsement as any of this Pres=
ident's ability to manage the affairs of the country.



 Q So you can't say one way or another, though, whether the Times' charac=
terization is accurate -- that it was to avoid an embarrassing piece of n=
ews that might overshadow the speech?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Again, I havent read the piece. I would be surprised if any=
body thought that a situation that volatile was going to be secret for th=
at long. I also would say that the way that it is covered publicly has a =
direct impact on the ability to resolve these situations. And when we're =
talking about the lives of 10 U.S. servicemembers, their safe return is t=
he top priority, and certainly much more important than any political cal=
culation.



 Byron.



 Q Thanks, Josh. If I can follow on candidates getting the classified bri=
efings. You said the White House was confident that the intelligence comm=
unity can make the proper assessments on what presidential candidates rec=
eive in terms of classified briefings and information. That seems to leav=
e open the possibility that there are concerns about either one of these =
candidates and that there are worries about either Trump, or whichever ca=
ndidate has access to classified information. Is that the impression you =
meant to leave?



 MR. EARNEST: I meant to leave you with the impression that the decision =
about what information to provide is a decision that will be made by the =
intelligence community. That's what I meant to convey.



 Q The CIA, believe it or not, has a book on the history of presidential =
candidates getting briefed. True fact. (Laughter.) And there is actually =
precedent for the White House asking to withhold certain information from=
 candidates. In fact, National Security Advisor Sandy Berger asked that G=
eorge W. Bush not be given anything sensitive. Can you commit that both c=
andidates will received the same amount of information in this administra=
tion?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I can commit to you is that the White Ho=
use will not be interfering in the decisions that are made by the intelli=
gence community to provide information to the presidential candidates. Wh=
at information they provide, how often they provide it, whether or not it=
's the same information for the two candidates -- those are questions tha=
t I would direct to Mr. Clapper's office.



 Q One more on the same topic. The potential Democratic nominee, Hillary =
Clinton, is actually under investigation for potential loss or mishandlin=
g of classified information. Does the administration have confidence that=
 Secretary Clinton can properly maintain and store and receive classified=
 information, given this ongoing investigation?



 MR. EARNEST: Yes, we do.



 Q Would you say the same about Donald Trump?



 MR. EARNEST: Again, we'll have to see what decision the Director of Nati=
onal Intelligence makes. I guess I can't -- off my own assessment, Secret=
ary Clinton has obviously served this administration with distinction. An=
d she's got a lot of experience in understanding the need to protect clas=
sified information.=20



 But look, this decision to provide that classified information will be m=
ade by the intelligence community. It will be made by the professionals t=
here. And they'll do the right thing for the country, and they'll do that=
 without any political interference from the White House.



 Kevin.



 Q Thanks, Josh. If I could follow up on Michelle's question for just a s=
econd.=20



 MR. EARNEST: She asked a lot of them. I'm not sure which one you may hav=
e in mind. Not that there's anything wrong with that.

=20

 Q Not that there's anything wrong with that. Exactly.



 MR. EARNEST: I'm here to take them all.



 Q Actually, you know what, let me start off with something simple and we=
'll sort of back into it. Has the President reached out to the family of =
Charles Keating IV? And if so, has he made contact with the family thus f=
ar?



 MR. EARNEST: I think, Kevin, what the President often will do -- and I t=
hink this is what previous Presidents did as well -- is to write letters =
to the families of those servicemembers who have given their life for the=
ir country. And I would anticipate the President will do that in this sit=
uation too.



 Q Thank you. E-cigarettes not for sale for folks under 21. What's the Pr=
esident perspective on that? And what's behind the push?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, this is actually a decision that was put forward by t=
he FDA. And what they indicated is that, based on their analysis of publi=
c health trends, we've made a lot of progress in reducing smoking rates. =
Smoking rates are now at an all-time low in this country. But we have see=
n an alarming increase in the use of e-cigarettes and even cigars, partic=
ularly by kids. And so the FDA regulation that was announced today is foc=
used on making it harder for kids to get their hands on these products th=
at we know have a very negative impact on their health. And so as an agen=
cy that's focused on the public health of the American people, for an age=
ncy that has conducted studies that indicate that smoking continues to be=
 the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, this is a p=
rudent step that is driven by scientific evidence that's focused on keepi=
ng our kids safe. And this is, in that regard, is a carefully considered =
regulation that I think makes a lot of common sense.



 Q Does the President believe that the ability to acquire cigarettes shou=
ld be limited to all Americans who are only 21 and up?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think as it relates to this proposal, its 18=
 and under. And Im not aware of the President weighing in on raising the =
age limit.



 Q To sort of follow up on what Michelle was asking, can you say with 100=
 percent certainty that there was no conversation or coordination or coll=
aboration in any way between the White House Counsels Office and the DOJ =
as it relates to North Carolina?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, this is an important thing for you to understand here=
. We've talked before for a couple of weeks now about how the White House=
 has worked with a range of federal agencies, including the Department of=
 Justice, about the variety of policy questions that have been raised by =
HB2, this controversial North Carolina law.=20



 The policy questions raised are things like what impact that law could h=
ave on programs in the state of North Carolina that are funded by the fed=
eral government. So this raises questions for everybody from the Departme=
nt of Transportation, to the Department of Education. And there will be a=
 careful review of what policy impact that law has on policy decisions ma=
de at a range of federal agencies.



 What the Department of Justice announced today is an intent -- they anno=
unced it yesterday -- what the Department of Justice announced is an inte=
nt to pursue an enforcement action. Those enforcement decisions are made =
by Department of Justice attorneys, and they are not subject to influence=
 by the White House.=20



 Q Not subject to influence. But if they've had conversations about some =
of the actions that might be legal, some of the actions that might be rel=
evant in a particular area, can you not see how folks in North Carolina m=
ight feel like that's the White House directing -- sorting winking and no=
d, tap the side of the nose -- saying, hey, listen, DOJ, if you want to p=
ursue this, maybe this is an area that you can pursue? Or if you think of=
 it this way, this is a possible remedy to sort of take a shot at a law t=
hat we think is a negative law? Can you understand how people in North Ca=
rolina might feel that way?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I can understand how the people in North Carolina mig=
ht think that passing this law ended up being a really bad idea. It certa=
inly has not yielded a lot of positive headlines for the state of North C=
arolina, and it certainly has not yielded a positive economic impact for =
the state of North Carolina.



 In fact, concerns about the NBAs decision with regard to the All-Star Ga=
me, decisions that could be made by the NCAA about locating college athle=
tic competitions in the state of North Carolina --=20



 Q Concerts --



 MR. EARNEST: Concerts. Even other businesses that suspended their intent=
 to expand their footprint in North Carolina. All of that is going to hav=
e a negative impact on the economy in North Carolina. So I think thats th=
e biggest impact. And I think that is probably the concern that the vast =
majority of North Carolinians have about the bad decision that the legisl=
ature and the governor made to pass and sign this law.



 Q So you reject the notion that this is some sort of a government overre=
ach, the Feds coming in and telling us how to --=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are some people who have a pretty persu=
asive case that this is a government overreach on the part of state offic=
ials in North Carolina that's had a negative impact on the public percept=
ion of their state and on the economic climate in their state.



 This is unfortunate because the state of North Carolina is a state that =
has traditionally -- certainly over the last generation or two -- worked =
really hard to diversify their economy; and that there are young adults -=
- not just across the South but across the country that have been attract=
ed to the state of North Carolina because of their positive business clim=
ate, business you have a hub of innovation there, like the Research Trian=
gle, that has drawn young, educated people and their families to come and=
 pursues some interesting economic opportunities in that state.



 And that is a testament to the innovation and ingenuity of the people of=
 North Carolina and to previous governors and previous state legislators.=
 Unfortunately, its this current governor and the current legislator that=
 have dealt a pretty big setback here. And it is something that -- it is =
not true to the culture and values and beliefs of the vast majority of Am=
ericans who live in that great state.



 Q Just a couple more. I want to ask you about AUMF if you have a second.=
 Has the President -- maybe by way of the Counsels Office -- given the on=
going actions in Iraq, opened the door for future Presidents to be able t=
o wage war in perpetuity based on the way that currently this Counsels Of=
fice is interpreting the AUMF as it stands? Has this now made it possible=
 for future Presidents to point to this President and say, well, if Congr=
ess doesn't act and give me a new AUMF, I can continue to use this footpr=
int, or this blueprint to continue to wage actions around the globe?



 MR. EARNEST: The fact of the matter is, Kevin, the 2001 AUMF didn't have=
 a time limit on it. And one of the things that we have discussed with Co=
ngress is how and whether to force Congress to review at some regular int=
erval an authorization to use military force that they previously passed.=




 There have been some proposals that have been put forward, including by =
some members of Congress, that have suggested that an authorization to us=
e military force should have to be renewed by Congress every three years,=
 otherwise it goes away. It sunsets.



 So there are a variety of creative legislative proposals on this. But lo=
ok, the fact of the matter is the 2001 AUMF that was passed by Congress d=
idn't include a time limit. It just didn't. So that is precisely why -- o=
r that's among the reasons why the President believes that the 2001 AUMF =
should be more narrowly targeted. And that's what our proposal included a=
n ISIL-specific authorization to use military force. We've put forward le=
gislative language describing what we believe that should be.=20



 That was the source of some criticism by Democrats and Republicans in Co=
ngress. And we said, fine, negotiate with us. Tell us what else youd like=
 to see in there. And we havent seen much action on that. We also propose=
d eliminating the 2002 AUMF that allowed President Bush to order the inva=
sion of Iraq. And we suggested that Congress take action to more narrowly=
 tailor to the 2001 AUMF.=20



 I think all of that is a pretty clear indication that this President of =
the United States is quite eager for Congress to actually step up to the =
plate and fulfill one of the most basic functions that they have. But thi=
s Congress has unfortunately abdicated that responsibility in the same wa=
y they've abdicated their responsibility to address other urgent needs of=
 the American people like the situation in Puerto Rico, or the situation =
with respect to the Zika virus, or even filling a vacancy in the Supreme =
Court.



 Q Last one and this is your favorite topic, Donald Trump.=20



 MR. EARNEST: So many favorite topics. (Laughter.)=20



 Q The Intercept and The Washington Post over the last couple of days hav=
e put out a number of different quotes from pundits who dismissed complet=
ely or outright the ascendency of Donald Trump. And yet he continues to r=
ise. Hes now on the verge of capturing the GOP nomination. And Im just wo=
ndering, as you look at that, what does that say about the mood of the co=
untry? And does the President view that with amusement? Or does he view t=
hat through the prism of it speaks to a frustration and hes not surprised=
 by the ascendency of a Donald Trump?=20



 MR. EARNEST: I think mostly what it tells me is that I don't get paid en=
ough to be a pundit, so that's why I try to avoid doing that from here. (=
Laughter.)=20



 So with respect to the Presidents view, I think the President has had on=
 a number of occasions the opportunity to discuss this, primarily when as=
ked by one of you.



 Q But so many missed it so badly. Even Nate Silver missed this.



 MR. EARNEST: But there -- again --=20



 Q That's amazing.



 MR. EARNEST: That's why Ive gone to great lengths to avoid playing pundi=
t up here. I also suspect that there will be a robust market for books ab=
out the 2016 election chronicling this phenomenon. So I think one of the =
reasons that its interesting is that there are no clear obvious answers t=
o exactly whats happening. But that will only be one other factor will co=
mbine with several others to make for a rather interesting fall 2016.



 Q But it must say something about the mood of the country, no?



 MR. EARNEST: The President has talked about this. The President has talk=
ed about how justified people are in being frustrated that all of the ben=
efits of the tremendous economic recovery that weve made since the Great =
Recession have not been enjoyed evenly across the country; that too many =
of those benefits flow to those at the top. And that exacerbation of an a=
lready yawning gap, wealth gap, is something that a lot of Americans are =
justifiably frustrated by.



 And the President sought to take this head on. Thats why the President a=
dvocated for raising the minimum wage and making permanent tax cuts for m=
iddle-class families, and raising taxes for those at the top, and closing=
 tax loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and the well-connected. Unfo=
rtunately, Republicans have blocked those attempts time and time again. S=
ome of them we actually achieved over Republican obstruction -- raising t=
axes on the top 1 percent, for example. But look, this is something that =
I anticipate will be the subject of ongoing debate leading up to the next=
 election as well.



 Jared, go ahead.



 Q Two of your favorite topics wrapped up into one question -- classified=
 presidential directives and also press access. For the DNC and RNC in Ju=
ly, the United States Secret Service is justifying a drastic change on co=
nvention background checks on a 2013 still classified national security d=
irective from President Obama. Is the President aware of the extent of th=
e changes that the DNC and RNC will undergo because of his directive? And=
 is he concerned by that?



 MR. EARNEST: Jared, I feel confident in telling you the President is not=
 aware of the press access plans for either the Democratic or Republican =
conventions that are planned for July. So I have to admit that I know ver=
y little about them as well.



 Q This was a directive signed by the President in 2013. It is classified=
, its Presidential Directive 22 -- PPD 22 -- and its something that is go=
ing to require for the first time -- the Presidents conventions where he =
was nominated as the Democratic candidate in 2008 and 2012 did not have S=
ecret Service background checks the way we will now have in 2016. So not =
as something he should be aware of except maybe as the person who swore t=
o protect the First Amendment rights of everybody in the country. Is that=
 something that hes concerned about? These changes are drastic.



 MR. EARNEST: Jared, I dont know that they are. The pass youre wearing ar=
ound your neck right now required you to submit to a background check con=
ducted by the Secret Service.



 Q Sure, but there are no delegates in this room who didnt have to go thr=
ough a background check.



 MR. EARNEST: Okay. Everybody thats -- actually everyone thats in this ro=
om did have to go through a background check in order to enter this build=
ing and stand here right now. Thats a fact. Thats true of me and my staff=
, and thats true of all the journalists here, too. So, again, I dont know=
 that much about the details, but I suspect that the Secret Service can d=
o a better job of helping you understand exactly what security precaution=
s theyre taking to ensure the safety of everybody who participates in the=
 conventions this summer.



 Q Can you take the question? Because I feel like theres more. And I know=
 that this is a classified directive, but I feel like there --=20



 MR. EARNEST: I think you should take the question to the Secret Service =
if you have questions about why you need to undergo a background check in=
 order to attend the convention. I think most reasonable people would ack=
nowledge that that kind of safety is required for everybodys protection.



 Mark.



 Q Josh, can you say whether President Obama has given up on the idea of =
making any recess appointments?



 MR. EARNEST: No, I cant speak to that. I dont know of any that are plann=
ed at this point.



 Q Is he stopped by considering them by when the Senate -- like this week=
, when theyre out, they hold pro forma sessions a couple of times during =
the week to keep him from making a recess appointment -- even though you =
might say theyre on recess, but they say theyre not because they have the=
 pro forma sessions that last about 30 seconds.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think even many of them will talk rather freely abo=
ut the fact that theyre on recess. But, look, the Supreme Court has weigh=
ed on this just recently in the last year or two. So I think this is larg=
ely a settled matter.



 Q In what way?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, in that the Supreme Court has had an opportunity to w=
eigh in on at least part of this question.



 Q So does he think he is unable to make recess appointments because of t=
he Senate sessions?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly is limited, but again, Im not an attorne=
y and I havent gotten the legal briefing on this. But I dont know that th=
ats necessarily been eliminated.



 Q None in the pipeline, youre saying?



 MR. EARNEST: Im sorry?



 Q Youre saying there are none in the pipeline?



 MR. EARNEST: Not that Im aware of. Not that Im aware of.



 John in the back, Ill give you the last one.



 Q Thanks, Josh. Back on TPP and the ongoing discussions with congression=
al leaders. Can you say if those talks now include Senator McConnell?



 MR. EARNEST: Senator McConnell is somebody that has, in the past, talked=
 about how important the Trans-Pacific Partnership is for our country. An=
d he is somebody who did work effectively with the administration to pass=
 Trade Promotion Authority last year, and we certainly would need to work=
 closely with Leader McConnell to succeed in passing the Trans-Pacific Pa=
rtnership this year as well.



 Its not just the administration thats making this case. Our friends at t=
he Chamber of Commerce just across the street here Im sure are in regular=
 touch with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. The same is true of the A=
merican Farm Bureau and the National Association of Manufacturers.



 Q And House Republicans are proposing for war funding to expire next Apr=
il. Given the fact that President Obama would be out of office, would he =
veto, say, an omnibus or any legislation, even a defense authorization bi=
ll, that came over with that plan? Or does he -- would he feel the next P=
resident, the next Commander-in-Chief should negotiate the war funding?



 MR. EARNEST: John, Id actually refer you to Secretary Carters comments o=
n this. President Obama believes that funding our war effort a few months=
 at a time is grossly irresponsible and not the way that we should be dem=
onstrating our clear commitment to our men and women in uniform who are r=
isking so much to protect our country. Again, Congresss responsibility he=
re to provide for the basics when it comes to ensuring that our men and w=
omen have the resources that they need to go and degrade and ultimately d=
estroy ISIL is critically important. And Secretary Carter had some very u=
ncharacteristically direct language about this, and its fair for you to a=
ssume that the views that he expressed are consistent with the views of t=
he Commander-in-Chief.



 Thanks, everybody. Well see you tomorrow.

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp;&nbsp; Go=
od afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; Nice to see you all.&nbsp; We've got a coupl=
e of quick comments at the top before we get to your questions.<o:p></o:p><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we've discussed in here =
many times, America=E2=80=99s economy continues to come back strong, creati=
ng 14.4 million private sector jobs, over the longest streak of job growth =
on record -- 73 consecutive months.&nbsp; But too many Americans still
 aren't sharing in the benefits of that economic progress as much as they s=
hould be.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason for that is that=
 too often large corporations are stifling fair competition and stacking th=
e deck against workers, entrepreneurs and consumers.&nbsp; I want to highli=
ght important pieces of progress today toward addressing these
 kinds of unfair practices.&nbsp; First, mandatory arbitration clauses and =
the improper use of what are called non-compete agreements.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the independent Cons=
umer Financial Protection Bureau today put out a new proposal that is desig=
ned to crack down on the use of mandatory arbitration clauses.&nbsp; In rec=
ent years, many financial products -- from bank accounts to
 credit cards -- have found a way to avoid accountability by burying mandat=
ory arbitration clauses deep in the fine print of hundreds of millions of c=
ontracts.&nbsp; These clauses force consumers to, basically on their own, t=
ake on large, well-resourced companies
 when their rights are violated.&nbsp; Mandatory arbitration clauses deny c=
onsumers the ability to join their resources, band together with others who=
 have been harmed and get their day in court.&nbsp; That's just not fair.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today=E2=80=99s action is y=
et another example of the important work that's being done every day at the=
 CFPB.&nbsp; You will recall that the CFPB was created by the Wall Street r=
eform legislation that the President aggressively pushed and happily
 signed into law back in 2010.&nbsp; In addition to writing stronger rules =
of the road for mortgages, credit cards, and student loans through enforcem=
ent actions, the Bureau has put nearly $11 billion -- with a B -- $11 billi=
on back in the pockets of more than 25
 million consumers who=E2=80=99ve been harmed by illegal practices.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why the President fo=
ught so hard to create a strong CFPB, and that's why it's so appalling that=
 Republicans in Congress have proposed to repeal the CFPB in their budget -=
- while appalling, if not particularly surprising where
 Republicans get a significant portion of their campaign contributions.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also today, the White House=
 released a report underscoring the need to reform the use of non-compete a=
greements, which deny workers the ability to leave a company and go work fo=
r another company in the same industry -- something that
 all of you, I assume, might take a little notice of.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbs=
p; Far too often -- just try to --

's that.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Far too =
often, these agreements aren't credibly protecting trade secrets.&nbsp; Ins=
tead they=E2=80=99re unnecessary roadblocks for workers trying to get a rai=
se, move up by joining another employer, or even start their own company.&n=
bsp;
 Nearly one in five workers, including 14 percent of low-wage workers, are =
subject to them.&nbsp; That holds down their bargaining power and their wag=
es.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the coming months, we wi=
ll build on examples of states that have taken actions highlighted in the r=
eport and put forward options for reform.&nbsp; We'll certainly encourage m=
ore states to take action and to make sure employers are treating
 their employees fairly.&nbsp; The President knows that the best way to mak=
e sure everyone shares in our economic success is through healthy competiti=
on and stronger protections that guarantee consumers are treated fairly.&nb=
sp; That's what today=E2=80=99s actions to combat
 both of these unfair practices are all about.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with that, Kathleen, let=
=E2=80=99s go to your questions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&n=
bsp; I'm going to go back to something you said yesterday, if I could.&nbsp=
; Your reaction to the elections on Tuesday.&nbsp; You said that you didn=
=E2=80=99t think that the Democratic primary would go to a contested conven=
tion, and I just wanted
 to sort of put a finer point on it, if I could.&nbsp; Does that mean that =
you think that Hillary is going to win the necessary delegates before the c=
onvention?&nbsp; Is that what you're saying?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think what I was alluding to is that there=E2=80=99s been a lot of analysis=
 that's been conducted about the trajectory of the campaigns, and that was =
merely a commentary on the reporting out there that's conducted an
 analysis.&nbsp; I haven't conducted an analysis.&nbsp; The White House has=
n=E2=80=99t conducted that analysis.&nbsp; I'm just pointing out that most =
people who=E2=80=99ve taken a close look at this do not expect there to be =
a contested Democratic convention.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is t=
he White House -- the White House has no opinion on whether or not Bernie S=
anders remains in the race?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; As I've =
said many times, it's the responsibility of individual candidates to make d=
ecisions about how to conduct their campaigns. &nbsp;And ultimately, that's=
 what they=E2=80=99ll do.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if w=
e take Senator Sanders at his word and he=E2=80=99s going to stay until the=
 very end, it looks like, at least for the next, maybe six weeks, Hillary C=
linton will be hit by Donald Trump on one side and by Senator Sanders on th=
e
 other.&nbsp; And I'm wondering what the President thinks about that situat=
ion.&nbsp; Is that good for the Democratic Party, as he has often said?&nbs=
p; And if anyone in the White House is interested in trying to mitigate the=
 damage that that might do to her candidacy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think what I can say is that the President certainly does envision a scenar=
io where he will be strongly advocating for the Democratic nominee for Pres=
ident.&nbsp; And part of the case that he will make will be the
 importance of Democrats coming together behind our nominee.&nbsp; <o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the President=E2=80=99s=
 interest in this is primarily rooted in his desire to see a successor who =
is committed to building on the progress that we've made over the last eigh=
t years.&nbsp; That progress has been notable, and the President will
 have a strong case to make when he begins making that case.&nbsp; But we h=
aven't reached the general election yet, but the President will not be shy =
about making that argument when we do.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And pri=
vately, is anyone in the White House working to talk to the campaigns about=
 how the next six weeks are going to go?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don't =
have any private conversations to discuss from here today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the=
n I want to turn to the Justice Department letter to officials in North Car=
olina on the law there.&nbsp; Is it accurate to assume that that's a sign t=
hat a lawsuit is coming?&nbsp; It sounds like officials in North Carolina a=
ren't
 backing down in any way.&nbsp; And was it also meant to send a signal to o=
ther states that have passed similar pieces of legislation -- possibly Miss=
issippi?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The deci=
sion to pursue that enforcement action and to notify the state of North Car=
olina that the Justice Department intended to pursue that enforcement actio=
n was a decision that was made at the Justice Department.&nbsp;
 These kinds of enforcement actions are made independent of any sort of pol=
itical interference or direction from the White House.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So as we have discussed bef=
ore, the White House as a matter of policy has been in discussions with a n=
umber of federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, about what =
potential impact this law could have on programs that
 are funded in individual states by the federal government.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when it comes to enforc=
ement actions, those are decisions that are made entirely by attorneys at t=
he Department of Justice.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So has =
the White House been updated on this agency review process that you just me=
ntioned?&nbsp; And should we expect similar announcements?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
wouldn=E2=80=99t expect any announcements any time soon -- at least that I=
=E2=80=99m aware of.&nbsp; But, yes, the White House does continue to coord=
inate among the agencies that are taking a look at this.&nbsp; And look, th=
e agencies
 themselves have acknowledged that the passage of this law does raise quest=
ions about certain programs that are funded by the federal government throu=
gh these individual agencies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there are a range of le=
gal questions and policy questions that have emerged.&nbsp; They're being c=
arefully considered by individual agencies.&nbsp; The Department of Justice=
, given the legal questions that are raised, has been involved in
 that review.&nbsp; And given the need to coordinate the policy questions t=
hat have been raised across agencies, the White House has been involved, to=
o.&nbsp; But I=E2=80=99m not aware of any impending decisions.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all of that, of course,=
 is separate from the enforcement decision that was made by the Department =
of Justice and announced just yesterday.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, a=
nd then just last one.&nbsp; On the ceasefire in Aleppo, can you give us th=
e White House assessment of how that appears to be holding?&nbsp; And there=
 was some discrepancy about exactly when it started and the need to settle =
that
 -- <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; My under=
standing is that this was -- the refreshing of cessation of hostilities in =
and around Aleppo was slated to take effect yesterday at midnight Damascus =
time.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then we have seen a r=
eduction in the frequency and intensity of violence in that area of the cou=
ntry.&nbsp; But we do continue to be concerned about some violations, even =
in that area, that continue.&nbsp; But there are also other places
 in the country where we have not seen the steadfast commitment to the cess=
ation of hostilities that both the regime and opposition have signed on to.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we continue to make a st=
rong case that all sides benefit from the conscientious implementation of a=
 cessation of hostilities.&nbsp; One obvious benefit is that it creates an =
opening for international aid workers to provide much needed
 humanitarian relief to civilians who have been caught in the crossfire.&nb=
sp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I don't know that there=
 has been enough of an opening created in Aleppo thus far to deliver that h=
umanitarian relief.&nbsp; But certainly there is widespread interest in the=
 international community in that taking place.&nbsp; And that certainly
 is part of what motivates our interest in making the implementation of ces=
sation of hostilities a top priority.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is t=
here an effort to extend this one so that these rescue and other -- can get=
 through?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; We certa=
inly are interested in continuing to refresh the cessation of hostilities i=
n those areas where it=E2=80=99s started to fray.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And look, the agreement tha=
t was reached 36 hours ago did result in -- or I should say the agreement t=
hat was implemented 36 hours ago did result in a reduction in violence in a=
nd around Aleppo.&nbsp; But there=E2=80=99s still too many violations
 in and around Aleppo and in other parts of the country that are a source o=
f significant concern.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeff.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, w=
hat=E2=80=99s the White House=E2=80=99s reaction to the resignation of Turk=
ey=E2=80=99s Prime Minister today?&nbsp; And broadly speaking, are you conc=
erned, or is the President concerned that President Erdo=C4=9Fan is becomin=
g too powerful?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Je=
ff, we have seen the news that Prime Minister Davuto=C4=9Flu is planning to=
 step down later this month.&nbsp; The Prime Minister has been a good partn=
er with the United States, and we have appreciated his leadership.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, he and the Vice =
President have been in frequent communication on a range of issues that are=
 important to our two countries.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not anticipate -- just=
 anticipating another line of questioning, I do not anticipate that this is=
 going to have any impact on the ability of the United States and Turkey to=
 work together, to continue to implement our strategy
 to degrade and destroy ISIL.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of impor=
tant steps that we have seen the Turks undertake in the last several months=
 that have been important to that effort.&nbsp; We've seen Turkey do a more=
 effective job at shutting down their border with Syria.&nbsp; There=E2=80=
=99s
 more that we believe that they can do, but they've made important progress=
 that has reduced the flow of foreign fighters to ISIL in Syria.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turkey has granted the Unit=
ed States and some of our coalition partners access to air bases in Turkey =
that have made our military air operations more efficient, and in some case=
s even more effective.&nbsp; We've also seen Turkey play a
 constructive role in working with our European allies to address a very di=
fficult immigrant situation.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And even before that agreem=
ent with the Europeans, Turkey was bearing a significant burden in terms of=
 providing for the basic humanitarian needs of more than a million Syrians =
who had fled to Turkey trying to escape violence in their
 home country.&nbsp; So there is no denying that Turkey has been an importa=
nt partner and made a valuable contribution to our broader counter-ISIL eff=
ort.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as we often do, we regu=
larly remind Turkish authorities to ensure that their actions uphold the un=
iversal, democratic values that are enshrined in Turkey=E2=80=99s constitut=
ion.&nbsp; Those values are not just enshrined in Turkey=E2=80=99s constitu=
tion,
 they're enshrined in the United States=E2=80=99 Constitution, as well.&nbs=
p; And these are the kinds of values that we advocate for around the world.=
&nbsp; And particularly when it comes to questions like freedom of speech a=
nd freedom of the press, we've had specific concerns
 that we have raised with the Turks.&nbsp; We won't hesitate to do so in th=
e future, but it has not affected our ability to work together with our NAT=
O Allies and Turkey to implement a strategy to degrade and ultimately destr=
oy ISIL.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you=
 concerned -- and that last piece sort of addresses this -- but more specif=
ically, are you concerned that the concentration of power in the office of =
the presidency in Turkey, specifically President Erdogan, has gone too
 far?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, as=
 this point, I wouldn=E2=80=99t render a judgment about what potential poli=
tical impact the Prime Minister's resignation may have.&nbsp; What we're fo=
cused on is continuing to effectively cooperate with our Ally to degrade
 and destroy ISIL.&nbsp; And that's not going to prevent us from raising co=
ncerns or, in some cases, even outright objections about the way the govern=
ment observes the universal and democratic values that are enshrined in the=
ir constitution.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&n=
bsp; And then moving south, what is the White House's reaction to the lates=
t development in Brazil, where a Supreme Court justice suspended the Speake=
r of the House -- or Speaker of the Lower House in Congress, who is one of
 the main rivals of President Rousseff?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I was no=
t aware of that latest development.&nbsp; I think what is clear from the co=
verage that we've seen over the last several months in Brazil, that there i=
s a very challenging political environment that that country's leaders
 are trying to navigate.&nbsp; And it certainly comes at a difficult time f=
or Brazil, given the economic challenges facing the country and giving the =
international spotlight on the country during this summer's Olympics.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But as the President said=
 in Argentina, six weeks ago, Brazil has a developed democracy.&nbsp; They'=
ve got sturdy, democratic institutions that should be able to effectively d=
eal with these challenges and ensure that
 the concerns that have been raised are properly adjudicated.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with any democracy, that=
 will take some time.&nbsp; There will be some bumps along the road.&nbsp; =
But the democratic institutions in Brazil are sturdy and should be up to th=
e test of weathering this difficult political situation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kenneth.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou, Josh.&nbsp; Once a presidential candidate receives his or her party's n=
omination, it's tradition for them to receive classified intelligence brief=
ings, as I'm sure you know.&nbsp; So Donald Trump has promoted numerous con=
spiracy
 theories.&nbsp; He has quoted the National Enquirer.&nbsp; He's gone to Tw=
itter to make what some would see as unfiltered statements.&nbsp; So is thi=
s White House concerned about Donald Trump getting those classified briefin=
gs?&nbsp; And also, is he hesitant to approve that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-bottom:12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=
sp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Kenneth, I know that Director Clapper, the Dir=
ector of the Office of National Intelligence, has spoken to this a little b=
it already.&nbsp; What Director Clapper has indicated is that the
 intelligence community typically begins providing those briefings after th=
e party nomination conventions have occurred.&nbsp; And I would expect that=
 that would take place in this instance this year, as well.&nbsp; The decis=
ions about how and whether and when and what
 to brief to the presidential nominees is something that will be made -- is=
 a decision that will be made by our intelligence professionals.&nbsp; They=
 are committed to fulfilling the spirit of this bipartisan, or even nonpart=
isan, cooperation when it comes to sensitive
 national security issues.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, they also=
 will carry out those activities consistent with their understanding about =
treating this information sensitively.&nbsp; And the President has full con=
fidence in the ability to Director Clapper and the professionals
 in his office to carry out these responsibilities appropriately.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no =
comment on whether the President would be confident or feel comfortable wit=
h Donald Trump getting intelligence briefings?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Those ar=
e assessments that will have to be made by the intelligence community.&nbsp=
; And the President has full confidence in the ability of our professionals=
 in the intelligence community to make those assessments.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, o=
n Merrick Garland, now that there are some GOP senators who came out and sa=
id, we will not support Donald Trump, is the White House now trying to appr=
oach those senators to push Merrick Garland through a little faster,
 to maybe give him a hearing, maybe get them on your side?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 certainly have made the case to all 100 senators that they have a basic re=
sponsibility that's dictated by the Constitution whether they're on our sid=
e or not. And right now, we've seen too many Republican senators
 indicate that they're not prepared to do their job, that they're not prepa=
red to fulfill their basic constitutional responsibility.&nbsp; That's a to=
ugh position for them to be in, particularly because their explanation is n=
ot that they have legitimate, substantive
 concerns with Chief Judge Merrick Garland.&nbsp; After all, Chief Judge Ga=
rland has served for 19 years on the second-highest court in the land.&nbsp=
; He's got more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court no=
minee in American history.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And just yesterday, the C=
ongressional Research Service issued a report that confirms what you've hea=
rd me say many times.&nbsp; The Research Service wrote that, &quot;Judge Ga=
rland has been widely viewed as a meticulous and
 cautious jurist, writing with his precision and an eye toward ensuring tha=
t the Court does not overreach in any particular case.&quot;&nbsp; It's tha=
t approach to doing his job that has prompted even Republican senators to d=
escribe Chief Judge Garland as a consensus
 nominee.&nbsp; I suspect it's also part of what prompted the chairman of t=
he Judiciary Committee to acknowledge that by not doing their job, Republic=
ans in the Senate were taking &quot;a gamble.&quot;&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Republicans are rolling t=
he dice with the Supreme Court, because they have an opportunity to careful=
ly consider a nominee that the President has put forward that Republicans t=
hemselves acknowledge is a consensus
 nominee; that he has an approach to the law that is entirely consistent wi=
th what Democrats and Republicans would like to see in a Supreme Court just=
ice.&nbsp; That's not just my opinion; that actually is the opinion that's =
articulated by Ted Olson, who was appointed
 President George W. Bush to represent the United States before the Supreme=
 Court.&nbsp; He's a conservative, he's a lawyer who knows a lot about the =
Supreme Court, and even he has described Chief Judge Garland as somebody wh=
o is exactly what Americans need on the
 Supreme Court. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But ultimately, I don=E2=
=80=99t think the American people are comfortable with Republicans rolling =
the dice with the Supreme Court.&nbsp; They're not comfortable with this ga=
mble.&nbsp; What they would like Republicans in the Senate
 to do is simply their job to fulfill their basic constitutional responsibi=
lity.&nbsp; As long as they're picking up a paycheck, they might as well do=
 what their constituents sent them to Washington to do.&nbsp; And unfortuna=
tely, too many Republicans are saying, well,
 I'm not going to do what my constituents sent me to do; I'm just going to =
follow the instructions of the Republican Leader in the United States Senat=
e.&nbsp; That may be their explanation, but I'm not sure it's one that's go=
ing to fly with their constituents.<o:p></o:p></p>

co products, and I'm wondering if the President would veto any bill or ride=
r that would exempt the e-cigarettes from that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
the FDA did make an important announcement today.&nbsp; And obviously, whil=
e we have made important progress over the last 50 years in reducing smokin=
g rates, the fact is that smoking continues to
 be a leading cause of preventable death in the United States.&nbsp; About =
one in every five deaths each year can be traced back to tobacco products.&=
nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So that's why the scienti=
sts at the FDA have taken steps to further regulate tobacco products, parti=
cularly as it relates to the ability of kids under the age of 18 getting th=
eir hands on them.&nbsp; So this is a common-sense
 proposal carefully considered by the FDA.&nbsp; I know many critics of thi=
s rule have suggested that this rule took too long to implement.&nbsp; I ac=
tually think it underscores the care and caution and concern that our scien=
tists took in implementing this rule effectively
 and fairly. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So obviously this is some=
thing that our scientists believe would have a tangible impact on the basic=
 public health and safety of the American people, particularly America=E2=
=80=99s children.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's obviously a good =
thing.&nbsp; I haven=E2=80=99t seen any proposed riders.&nbsp; We have made=
 clear -- the President takes a very dim view of attaching ideological ride=
rs to appropriations bills.&nbsp; We've certainly indicated our strong oppo=
sition
 to those kinds of proposals in the past. &nbsp;But I=E2=80=99m not aware o=
f anything that's been put together at this point.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, a=
 couple questions on a couple different subjects.&nbsp; One, what is the co=
ncern from this White House about the party not coming together like it had=
 in the past around convention time?&nbsp; Because there is a difference in=
 the
 politics between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.&nbsp; And many of Ber=
nie Sanders followers may not be the traditional Democratic supporter.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
don't think I would say that there=E2=80=99s concern at this point for a va=
riety of reasons.&nbsp; I think most important of which is that you've hear=
d the President say on many occasions that the differences between the Demo=
cratic
 nominees -- or Democratic candidates are not nearly as significant as the =
difference between the Democratic candidates and the presumptive Republican=
 nominee.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President has said that=
 on many occasions.&nbsp; And I suspect he=E2=80=99ll have many opportuniti=
es in the future to make that case.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But look, the President=E2=
=80=99s view is that he=E2=80=99s going to advocate strongly for a successo=
r who is committed to building on the progress that our country has made un=
der his leadership.&nbsp; And obviously, the President has got a lot person=
ally
 invested in those policies and in that progress.&nbsp; And he=E2=80=99s go=
ing to certainly spend a decent portion of the fall here making a strong ca=
se that his successor should look to build on that progress.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does th=
e White House look at this potential fight leading up to the convention, or=
 this separation still leading up to the convention a problem in relation t=
o fighting against the presumptive nominee who is already the presumptive
 nominee for the Republican Party?&nbsp; Is this an impediment to possibly =
gaining ground on Donald Trump?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I think -- again, based on what the President has said before I think =
he feels quite confident that Democrats will come together around a set of =
values that he himself has been advocating for, for the last
 seven years.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a reason that the =
President is the most popular politician in America, particularly among Dem=
ocrats, that his approval rating is higher and his unfavorable rating is lo=
wer than -- among Democrats than anybody else in the country.&nbsp;
 That is a strong endorsement of the work that this President has done over=
 the last eight years or so.&nbsp; And that certainly is going to enhance t=
he President=E2=80=99s ability to make an argument to those very voters abo=
ut the stakes in the election, about the need
 to elect somebody who will look to build on that progress.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now -- =
looking at the next subject, now looking forward to the weekend, Howard Uni=
versity, how does this administration view Howard as it relates to the Pres=
ident speaking this weekend?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, lo=
ok, Howard University is one of the finest institutions of higher education=
 in the country.&nbsp; And it certainly is a distinguished institution of h=
igher learning that is -- among HBCUs.&nbsp; And so the President is
 looking forward to visiting the university and speaking to the graduates.&=
nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be an opportunity f=
or him to discuss the responsibility that the graduates have, not just to t=
he African American community, but to the American people to use their skil=
ls and their gifts to form a more perfect union.&nbsp; And
 there are a variety of ways that those distinguished graduates will be abl=
e to do that -- whether that=E2=80=99s serving in their community; whether =
that is serving in our military; or whether that is pursuing a profession a=
nd starting a new business; or being part
 of a remarkable scientific breakthrough that could have consequences for t=
he health of millions of Americans or the convenience of Americans through =
the use for new technology.&nbsp; So the future is quite bright for those g=
raduates.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the President will talk=
 about the sense of optimism that he has about their future and the country=
=E2=80=99s future.&nbsp; But he certainly will not skim over the important =
responsibility that they have, as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the =
President is very well aware of the financial troubles that many HBCUs have=
 been undergoing at this time.&nbsp; Is that one of the reasons why he chos=
e Howard?&nbsp; It=E2=80=99s the nation=E2=80=99s first federally funded HB=
CU, and it=E2=80=99s having
 some financial problems.&nbsp; Is that one of the reasons why he chose How=
ard as his last HBCU commencement address as President?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, I do=
n't think that's why he chose Howard.&nbsp; This is a distinguished class o=
f graduates, and the President has got an important message to deliver to t=
hem.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whe=
n you look back over the eight years and HBCUs, what would you say the Pres=
ident has been able to contribute to the HBCUs, and the HBCU community, whi=
ch is vast in this nation?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ob=
viously the President has had an opportunity on at least a couple of occasi=
ons to speak at -- to deliver the commencement address as HBCUs.&nbsp; The =
President has enjoyed that opportunity in the past, and he certainly
 is looking forward to Saturday=E2=80=99s festivities.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as a policy matter, thi=
s administration has worked hard to significantly increase funding for stud=
ents who attend HBCUs, but also to support HBCUs as institutions.&nbsp; The=
 President believes those institutions have an important role
 to play in educating future generations of Americans.&nbsp; And this admin=
istration has been strongly supportive of it.&nbsp; I can provide you some =
more details here.&nbsp; I don't have them in front of me.&nbsp; We=E2=80=
=99ll follow up with you.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now tha=
t a lot more of the detail has come out surrounding the death of a Navy SEA=
L in Iraq -- that Special Forces were overwhelmed, that they had to call in=
 more Navy SEALs, that they finally had to leave when they ran out of
 ammunition; the Peshmerga then had to take over.&nbsp; It=E2=80=99s kind o=
f a different line of questioning than -- now that we know those details an=
d just kind of how overwhelmed these guys were, even after they called in t=
heir own backups, does that raise concerns for
 you about the positioning of these Special Forces, given what their role i=
s supposed to be, and how prepared they are?&nbsp; Or in this case, how pre=
pared they weren=E2=80=99t for something like this happening?<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Mi=
chelle, I think for the most direct answer to this question, given the oper=
ational details that are included in it, I=E2=80=99d encourage you to check=
 with the Department of Defense.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just say I=E2=80=99m=
 not aware of any policy changes that are prompted as a result of this part=
icular situation and the tragic death that resulted.&nbsp; The individuals =
-- the servicemembers who were in this situation were highly trained.&nbsp;
 They were well armed.&nbsp; And they were backed up by overwhelming milita=
ry airpower that did succeed in exacting many more casualties on ISIL targe=
ts -- both fighters and equipment -- than was sustained by American forces =
to be sure.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there has been a recogn=
ition from the beginning that American servicemembers serving our country i=
n Iraq, in an advise-and-assist mission are taking a significant risk.&nbsp=
; They are putting themselves in harm=E2=80=99s way to protect our
 country.&nbsp; And we owe them a debt of gratitude.&nbsp; And is it at tim=
es like these when we're mourning the death of a brave American servicememb=
er that we're reminded in rather vivid terms of their significant sacrifice=
.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That certainly is not lost =
on the President.&nbsp; And I don't think it=E2=80=99s lost on any American=
 who has read the news coverage of this incident over the last couple of da=
ys.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These individuals are going=
 to great lengths and assuming great personal risk for our freedom and for =
our safety.&nbsp; They do that so that we don't have to.&nbsp; And we owe t=
hem a debt of gratitude.&nbsp; And the Commander-in-Chief certainly does
 not take lightly the commitment and patriotism of those brave Americans wh=
o are serving our country over in Iraq and Syria right now.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing=
 what happened, does these details bother you?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; What is =
clear is that it=E2=80=99s a dangerous situation.&nbsp; And what=E2=80=99s =
also clear is that these are servicemembers.&nbsp; These are Americans.&nbs=
p; These are patriots who are well-trained.&nbsp; This is some of the best =
-- these men and women
 are some of the best that our country has to offer.&nbsp; And they're pref=
orming a great service to our country.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess=
 the concern is, though, that you could say that this is a fluke situation =
where nobody really predicated what exactly would happen.&nbsp; Every situa=
tion is obviously different.&nbsp; But now that they're in those positions =
where
 they are closer to the battle -- okay, this was two miles away.&nbsp; But =
where they were and what they're doing now, and the fact that more Special =
Forces are going over there, I feel like this may have been asked before, b=
ut I=E2=80=99m sort of asking it now in the context
 of what happened, that can we expect these kinds of firefights and unpredi=
ctable situations to happen more often now that more Americans are over the=
re?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
would say a couple things about that.&nbsp; The first is that any sort of m=
ilitary conflict like this is going to include a lot of unpredictability.&n=
bsp; For example, that's precisely why these individuals who are not
 in a combat mission are equipped for combat, so that if an unpredictable s=
ituation arises, they have the equipment and training and resources to defe=
nd themselves.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Defense h=
as described the circumstances of the servicemember who was killed.&nbsp; H=
e was actually part of the quick reaction force that was summoned to defend=
 and help expedite the departure of Americans who were advising
 Peshmerga forces.&nbsp; I think that -- just the circumstances of the situ=
ation should illustrate the capabilities of the individuals who are involve=
d.&nbsp; They're tremendous.&nbsp; These are well-trained, well-equipped Am=
erican servicemembers who are prepared to fight
 for their country, and to keep us safe, and to keep their fellow serviceme=
mbers safe.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What=E2=80=99s also true is=
 they have an enormous advantage in terms of being backed up by American mi=
litary airpower.&nbsp; And there were a number of United States military ai=
rcraft that responded to this situation, carried out a series of airstrikes
 that took some 50 ISIL fighters off the battlefield, destroyed a number of=
 other vehicles, and took out other fighting positions that were maintained=
 by ISIL terrorists.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So as tragic as this one pa=
rticular death is, there were no other casualties that were reported by the=
 Department of Defense.&nbsp; So this is I think a good illustration of jus=
t how dangerous the situation is.&nbsp; It=E2=80=99s a reminder of how sign=
ificant
 a debt of gratitude we owe our servicemembers in Iraq and in Syrian.<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it=E2=80=99s also a tes=
tament to our military planners that even in a situation as unpredictable a=
s this one, the United States and our coalition partners were able to quick=
ly mobilize the resources necessary to respond to a dangerous
 situation. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And jus=
t before the President went to Flint you were asked here in the briefing an=
d kind of drew some laughs as to whether the President would drink the Flin=
t water.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you -- just in the word=
s you chose and your tone, you seemed kind of dismissive.&nbsp; And you cal=
led that a photo-op.&nbsp; And you didn't know then that the President woul=
d take part in that kind of a photo-op.&nbsp; But then he did it three
 times yesterday.&nbsp; And that seems like the kind of thing that the Pres=
ident doesn't usually like to do, that it really did seem like it was some =
kind of photo op.&nbsp; Why did the President feel like he wanted to drink =
the water three times and kind of make this
 big deal out of that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
actually think that, for those of you who were at the pool spray yesterday =
in the briefing with federal officials, the President spoke for about 15 mi=
nutes or so and indicated that he was finished talking and
 that the pool could move on so we could move on to the next event.&nbsp; A=
nd it was actually reporters in the pool who said, Mr. President, will you =
drink the water?&nbsp; And so he did, acknowledging that he doesn=E2=80=99t=
 usually indulge them in these kinds of stunts, but
 in this case, he did in response to a specific request from a journalist.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the=
n he did it two more times.&nbsp; And he called it a stunt, and said it was=
n=E2=80=99t a stunt, and then he -- calling for the water, and saying, I'm =
thirsty, and where=E2=80=99s the water?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; There ty=
pically is a glass of water or tea underneath his podium when he=E2=80=99s =
delivering a speech.&nbsp; It was not there yesterday when he was giving th=
e speech.&nbsp; And I think everybody, again, who was listening carefully n=
oticed
 that 20 or 30 minutes into his remarks he started coughing and asked for s=
omething to drink.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That wa=
sn=E2=80=99t from the water, was it?&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, this=
 was before the water was provided.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it =
was after the pool spray where he drank the water the first time.&nbsp; Was=
 that what he was coughing from?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
he was coughing from having spoken for 20 or 25 minutes in a row without ha=
ving anything to drink.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I guess what I would say=
 is this.&nbsp; I would acknowledge that the President was indulging the ph=
otographers in which he consumed water from Flint after the briefing with f=
ederal officials.&nbsp; But at the speech, the man was just thirsty.&nbsp;
 (Laughter.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, y=
eah, but he made it a point to say, I don't want a bottle, I want a glass o=
f water -- like somebody bring me a glass of water.&nbsp; And he asked for =
it twice.&nbsp; And then at the end, he also drank some.&nbsp; So I guess w=
hat I'm saying
 is, if you guys were kind of like calling this a photo-op from the start, =
why did the President feel it was so important to keep on drinking the wate=
r while --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Again, t=
he President was speaking publicly for an hour, and so I think most people =
get thirsty when they talk for a long time.&nbsp; The President had spoken =
for a long time and got thirsty.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sto=
ries that he told saying how he, others had eaten lead when they were kids.=
&nbsp; He said he felt sure that he had eaten paint chips when he was a kid=
.&nbsp; Is that true?&nbsp; Is he sure that at some point he had eaten pain=
t chips as
 a child?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
the President is making the point that the effort to remove lead from gasol=
ine and from paint is a relatively recent phenomenon; that before 1980, it =
was actually common for even young children to be exposed to
 lead.&nbsp; And it's only as we've come to understand the impact of that e=
xposure have we taken significant steps to try to prevent that exposure fro=
m occurring because it has a negative impact on cognitive and emotional dev=
elopment.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the message that th=
e President was trying to deliver was a critically important one, which is =
people in Flint have been concerned and were concerned to learn that childr=
en in their household, their own children had been exposed
 to lead through the water supply, and that they had been misled by *<s>fed=
eral</s>[state] authorities.&nbsp; And they were scared, they were anxious,=
 and justifiably anger, in the President=E2=80=99s own description.&nbsp; B=
ut at the same time, the President did not want them
 to despair about the future opportunities for their kids to succeed.&nbsp;=
 They should feel confident that despite this failure of government, that t=
he children of Flint continue to have a future, and a future that is bound =
only by the limits of their own imagination.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's why it's importa=
nt for the parents of those kids to understand that even though they were e=
xposed to lead, that's not going to limit the future opportunities of their=
 kids.&nbsp; Yes, they need to get the health care that they
 need.&nbsp; Yes, they need medical attention.&nbsp; Yes, they should get t=
he proper follow-up.&nbsp; Yes, they should be conscientious about making s=
ure that follow-up occurs, that there are specific things that our medical =
professionals recommend that can counteract the
 impact of lead -- of elevated levels of lead in the bloodstream, even for =
kids.&nbsp; And parents should follow that advice.&nbsp; But they shouldn=
=E2=80=99t further restrain the ambitions of their kids because of this sit=
uation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think the President i=
s a good example.&nbsp; The President is making clear that even when the Pr=
esident himself was a kid, he was exposed to lead.&nbsp; And I don't know w=
hether that was from the lead paint in his house when he was growing
 up, or whether that was from lead that was in gasoline or lead that was in=
 the pipes.&nbsp; The President was exposed to that lead as a kid, and he h=
ad a very bright future that allowed him to attend Harvard Law School and b=
e elected President of the United States.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is=
 what I'm saying.&nbsp; We're not comparing apples to apples here.&nbsp; Do=
esn=E2=80=99t it seem like an odd comparison that I may have had some envir=
onmental exposure to lead as a kid, versus these people who have been drink=
ing lead-tainted
 water for about a year, and some of these kids had elevated lead levels th=
at are eight times what is considered the minimum level of elevation by the=
 federal government?&nbsp; I mean --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I guess =
the President=E2=80=99s point is he wasn=E2=80=99t even tested for lead whe=
n he was a kid, so we don't know exactly what his elevated level was.&nbsp;=
 The point of this is -- but in some ways, that is beside the point.&nbsp; =
The point
 here is that being exposed to lead is not going to limit the potential of =
these kids.&nbsp; The kids in Flint still have an opportunity to succeed.&n=
bsp; They should get medical attention.&nbsp; That's why we've expanded acc=
ess to Medicaid.&nbsp; That=E2=80=99s why the Department of
 Health and Human Services announced yesterday a million-dollar grant to he=
alth care workers in Flint to expand their capacity to try to meet the need=
s of these kids.&nbsp; If kids get that medical attention, if they get the =
follow-up, if they follow the instructions
 of medical professionals, there is no reason that this government failure =
should have any impact on their long-term ability to grow up and fulfill th=
eir dreams.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the=
 President has made the point that government is =E2=80=9Cus=E2=80=9D and y=
ou can trust government, it's just a bunch of people just like us.&nbsp; Bu=
t these people for more than a year have been failed by literally every lev=
el of government,
 so why should they put any store in what the President was saying to them?=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Mi=
chelle, I don=E2=80=99t think that's exactly the argument the President was=
 making.&nbsp; The argument the President was making is that too often we f=
ind Republicans who denigrate the institution of government without recogni=
zing
 that government reflects their citizens and that government, as described =
by Abraham Lincoln -- the first Republican President -- is that government =
is formed to do the kinds of things that we can't do for ourselves.&nbsp; N=
obody should have an expectation that
 they're going to hire their own police force or hire their own fire depart=
ment, or hire their own water department.&nbsp; But rather, we're going to =
work together, we're going to pool our resources, and we're going to be ded=
icated to the pursuit of the common good.&nbsp;
 And a tax on government failed to acknowledge that fact, as cleanly articu=
lated by Abraham Lincoln.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is also true is that w=
hen government makes mistakes, as in this instance, we should own up to it,=
 and government should mobilize an effective response to deal with the fall=
out. And that's exactly what's happened in this situation.&nbsp;
 But that's not an attempt to downplay the significance of the failures in =
Flint.&nbsp; It's an attempt to underscore the need to invest in the things=
 that we know are critical to the health, safety, and wellbeing of the Amer=
ican people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used this example yesterd=
ay:&nbsp; There's an acknowledgement that environmental regulators at the s=
tate level are principally responsible for this failure.&nbsp; That does no=
t mean we should eliminate the Michigan Department of Environmental
 Quality.&nbsp; How exactly is eliminating the role of environmental regula=
tors going to make our water safer or our air cleaner?&nbsp; It's not.&nbsp=
; It's going to make it worse.&nbsp; What we need is we need effective gove=
rnment, a competent government. &nbsp;And that's what the
 President spent a lot of the last seven or eight years working on.&nbsp; A=
nd I think we've got significant, positive results to enjoy because of that=
 attention.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a co=
uple different topics.&nbsp; One, I wanted just to follow up to I think som=
ething Kathleen asked about the DOJ letter to North Carolina.&nbsp; Given t=
hat you're saying that the White House did not weigh in directly on that le=
tter
 -- it was sort of a legal decision, a legal matter -- and given the fact t=
hat I think the administration has an ongoing review of whether maybe to wi=
thhold some federal funding from different agencies to the state based on t=
hat law, in the meantime, is the
 administration or the White House doing anything, taking any direct steps =
to try to discourage public officials in other states to not pass similar k=
inds of laws?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then also, I'm wonderin=
g, is there any concern out of the White House, given the DOJ letter, of th=
e issue becoming politicized in North Carolina and having sort of a counter=
productive effect of legislators digging in their heels,
 when you could maybe wait to see if public pressure in the state might hav=
e the same effect?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think, on the second part, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice about=
 their strategy.&nbsp; They were the ones who made the decision to write th=
e letter based on their own interpretation of the law and the need
 to enforce it.&nbsp; So they can sort of walk you through their thinking w=
hen it comes to whether or not that was the right approach.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More generally, in terms of=
 other states considering these kinds of laws, I'm not aware of any specifi=
c message that's been directed by the White House with regard to discouragi=
ng other states from pursuing these kinds of rules.&nbsp; But
 I think any other state that has observed the economic impact on the state=
 of North Carolina would draw their own conclusions about the wisdom of pur=
suing laws like this.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of large=
 business interests that have come forward and made clear that this law tha=
t makes discrimination against their customers and their employees more lik=
ely makes it less it likely that they're going to do business
 in North Carolina.&nbsp; That's true of athletic organizations like the NB=
A and the NCAA, but there are other businesses that have come forward and i=
ndicated that they're reconsidering expanding their business in North Carol=
ina because of the law.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So particularly in an econo=
my where we see states aggressively competing to land business opportunitie=
s, there's no denying that passing discriminatory laws like this one is cou=
nterproductive.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On anot=
her topic, if I could.&nbsp; On trade -- the President had an op-ed in the =
Post, promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership.&nbsp; I'm wondering if -- I =
know that the administration would like Congress to begin to take this up, =
maybe
 pave the way for a vote.&nbsp; Just curious whether you could say whether =
the administration thinks that having on a vote on the Trans-Pacific Partne=
rship in the lame duck session is legitimate strategy that you would be oka=
y with if it came to that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Da=
vid, what I can tell you is that we've been in conversations with Republica=
n leaders in both the House and the Senate, and Democrats who have been sup=
portive of our efforts thus far, about the best way to get
 TPP passed through the Congress.&nbsp; And the political calculation I wou=
ld acknowledge is complicated.&nbsp; It doesn=E2=80=99t fall cleanly along =
party lines.&nbsp; So we're going to have to work in bipartisan fashion to =
develop a strategy that will lead to success.&nbsp; And those
 are conversations that are ongoing with --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the =
lame duck session a part of the conversation?&nbsp; Is that a legitimate st=
rategy?&nbsp; Does that delegitimize it in any way if a new President has b=
een elected and is coming in and may have qualms about the deal -- does tha=
t legitimize
 it in any way?&nbsp; Or do you feel like it is legitimate as part of your =
conversations that you're talking about?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I'=
m not going to get into the details of the substance of those conversations=
.&nbsp; I will just stay that there's no reason we need to wait that long, =
particularly when you consider that ratifying the Trans-Pacific
 Partnership would hasten the end to 18,000 taxes that other countries impo=
se on American goods.&nbsp; So American businesses certainly don=E2=80=99t =
want to wait until the end of this year, before Congress acts on the TPP. S=
o it's not just the White House that's making
 the case that Congress should act on this; it's organizations like the Cha=
mber of Commerce, the American Farm Bureau and the National Organization of=
 Manufacturers who don=E2=80=99t typically agree with the White House but a=
re joining us in the effort to encourage
 prompt congressional action.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the=
 final thing on that is just, if the remaining three major candidates in th=
e race total, on each side, have come out as they have with concerns and sa=
id they do not support TPP is it currently exists, and they do not necessar=
ily
 support a vote in the lame duck session, does that make it more difficult,=
 do you think, for the White House to go forward on lame duck with a vote?<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Da=
vid, I think you have just articulated a political dynamic that should be r=
ather compelling to supporters of TPP wondering whether or not Congress sho=
uld act this year.&nbsp; Again, supporters of TPP are not likely
 to have a more enthusiastic President for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in=
 2017.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One mor=
e.&nbsp; Just following up on April's question about Howard University.&nbs=
p; The President is giving three addresses to -- or commencements this year=
, three very different types of universities.&nbsp; One is a sort of histor=
ically black
 college, another is a big state university, and one is a military academy.=
&nbsp; Is he tailoring his message to each of those?&nbsp; You mentioned --=
 talking about encouraging the young people to use their skills to form a m=
ore perfect union.&nbsp; That's pretty general
 I think.&nbsp; Could you talk a little bit about if there=E2=80=99s a spec=
ific message at Howard?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I=E2=80=
=99ll be prepared to do that tomorrow. <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not=
 today?&nbsp; (Laughter.) <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Christi.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, t=
hank you.&nbsp; You said a minute ago that the President will spend a decen=
t portion of the fall advocating for the Democratic nominee to succeed him.=
&nbsp; Can you envision a scenario in which he does that for a specific per=
son
 prior to the convention?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; At this =
point I would hesitate to predict exactly what the timeframe will be.&nbsp;=
 But I guess the other thing I would point out is it=E2=80=99s -- there are=
 other important races on the ballot other than -- in addition to the presi=
dential
 race.&nbsp; There are important races for the United States Senate, for th=
e United States Congress, and for some governor=E2=80=99s offices where I w=
ould expect the President would also be involved.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we=E2=80=99ll sort of s=
ee how things play out over the next couple of months.&nbsp; But as we star=
t to make those decisions, we=E2=80=99ll let you know.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, a=
s he was speaking yesterday, at one point it really looked -- actually not =
at one point, but pretty much through the whole address in Flint yesterday,=
 he was making the case for a Democratic Congress and a Democratic White
 House and a Democratic point of view in general.&nbsp; Could he conceivabl=
y continue to do that through July and be as effective as he would be if he=
 were advocating for a particular person?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think the President was making less of a partisan argument yesterday, and m=
ore of a philosophical one.&nbsp; The philosophical argument that he was ma=
king is that for our nation and our communities to succeed, we need
 an effective government.&nbsp; And too often every answer that is put forw=
ard by Republicans is one that is focused on tearing down government, or sh=
rinking government, or undermining government.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again tearing down institut=
ions that are responsible for keeping our air clean and our water clean are=
 not going to make it safer for our kids to drink.&nbsp; There are a variet=
y of ways to sort of draw this analogy.&nbsp; It certainly applies
 to local governments who are responsible for administering elections.&nbsp=
; It certainly is true when it comes to public safety.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there=E2=80=99s a basic =
question here about what our approach to governing is going to be.&nbsp; An=
d the President believes that Flint actually illustrates those differing --=
 the consequences of those differing philosophies in rather stark terms.&nb=
sp;
 And I don't know if the President is going to make that same argument arou=
nd the country.&nbsp; But it certainly is an argument that feels pretty res=
onant in Flint, Michigan right now.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think=
 -- I guess my question is if he=E2=80=99s worried about the lost time advo=
cating for a particular nominee.&nbsp; But I don't feel like you're going t=
o answer it.&nbsp; So I don't want to waste --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nbsp=
; (Laughter.) <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't=
 want to hear that speech again.&nbsp; I heard it yesterday.&nbsp; (Laughte=
r.)
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST: &nbsp;Fair eno=
ugh.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That wa=
s a good summary.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I=E2=80=
=99m not offended.&nbsp; I=E2=80=99m happy to admit the President is better=
 at giving that speech than I am.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if =
you drink some water right now, that would just be --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Okay, I=
=E2=80=99ll do that.&nbsp; (Laughter.) <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I a=
sk you about something else?&nbsp; The President and his staff lately seem =
to be doing a lot of explaining, a lot of interviews explaining his record =
and setting the record straight.&nbsp; Is there a feeling in the White Hous=
e that
 some basic things about the President=E2=80=99s record in office are misun=
derstood by the American people?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
there is a sense in the White House that it=E2=80=99s important for the Ame=
rican people to understand exactly what the President has prioritized over =
the last seven years.&nbsp; The President entered the White House with a
 very specific strategy to prevent a second Great Depression, but also to s=
trengthen the middle class.&nbsp; The President entered with a very specifi=
c strategy to fight climate change.&nbsp; The President entered with a very=
 specific strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining
 a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; The President entered with a very specific strateg=
y to responsibly get our men and women out of harm=E2=80=99s way in Iraq an=
d Afghanistan.&nbsp; The President entered with a very specific strategy to=
 ensure that the next generation of Americans would
 be trained and educated to compete and win in a 21st century global econom=
y.&nbsp; The President entered the White House with a very specific strateg=
y to reduce the deficit, and the deficit has been cut by three-fourths sinc=
e he took office.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think just as a factua=
l matter it=E2=80=99s important for people to understand that.&nbsp; I thin=
k it=E2=80=99s particularly important for people to understand, as they con=
sider whether or not they should elect someone who will build on that progr=
ess,
 or scrap it. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it=E2=80=99s also i=
mportant as people evaluate what kind of policies the United States Congres=
s should pursue.&nbsp; Many of the things that I just described were either=
 things that were accomplished as a result of strong Democratic support
 in Congress, or were accomplished in spite of Republican opposition in Con=
gress.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So people understanding exa=
ctly what the President=E2=80=99s strategy was and what the results have be=
en is relevant as they consider the broader impact of the Obama presidency.=
&nbsp; And I would actually make the case this is something that we've
 been talking about for quite a while.&nbsp; And I would anticipate that it=
 will continue over the course of the year.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do =
you think people -- well, you mentioned the deficit just now.&nbsp; And tha=
t's a thing that the President in recent days has said is misunderstood by =
people.&nbsp; Why do you think people don't know that -- since we're talkin=
g about
 factual things, why people don't know that, haven=E2=80=99t registered tha=
t?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, so=
me of it is certainly that there are Republicans who go to great lengths to=
 lie about the President=E2=80=99s record.&nbsp; That happens with some reg=
ularity.&nbsp; And there are some Republican interests that have spent hund=
reds
 of millions of dollars to do that, particularly in the context of the 2012=
 reelection campaign.&nbsp; So that certainly would be a part of it.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the President has a=
lso acknowledged that in the very earliest days of his presidency when ther=
e was a raging economic crisis, there wasn=E2=80=99t ample time to spend a =
week or two describing to the American people the steps that the
 government was taking to address the crisis because the truth is, after im=
plementing a strategy to address one crisis, the President and his team had=
 to move on to addressing the next one.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So immediately after -- I t=
hink the best example of this is that immediately after passing the Recover=
y Act, that included billions of dollars in tax cuts for middle-class famil=
ies, numerous tax cuts for small businesses, and critically
 important investments in infrastructure and clean energy, the administrati=
on also had to figure out how to rescue the American auto industry.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that was something that=
 was announced at the end of March, just a couple of weeks after the Recove=
ry Act was passed by Congress.&nbsp; So that's an indication of the rapid p=
ace of crisis-driven decisions that this administration had
 to engage in.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And look, those are two iso=
lated decisions that are still the subject of extensive political debate.&n=
bsp; But there is no denying the tremendous positive impact that both of th=
ose decisions had on our economy.&nbsp; They were unpopular at the
 time.&nbsp; Some of them are unpopular now.&nbsp; But the results speak fo=
r themselves.&nbsp; And so it=E2=80=99s important for people to understand =
the context of those results so that the next time that our country is faci=
ng an important economic decision, it=E2=80=99s important for the
 American people to have the facts about what worked so that we can make sm=
art decisions about wise investments in the future.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, a=
t the top of the briefing you said something about the ceasefire in Syria, =
and a reduction has been noted in terms of the frequency and intensity of t=
he violence.&nbsp; There=E2=80=99s been an airstrike in a refugee camp in S=
yria near
 the Turkish border that has reportedly killed dozens.&nbsp; There are imag=
es all over social media right now.&nbsp; Were you aware of that when you s=
aid that you had seen this reduction in violence?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, the=
 reduction in violence is specifically around Aleppo, and that is a reducti=
on in violence that we have seen.&nbsp; Yes, I was also notified of this sp=
ecific report shortly before walking out here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no justifiable exc=
use for carrying out an airstrike against innocent civilians who have alrea=
dy once fled their homes to escape violence.&nbsp; These individuals are in=
 the most desperate situation imaginable.&nbsp; And there is no
 justification for carrying military action that's targeting them.<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing that you sh=
ould confirm with the Department of Defense, but I believe this to be true,=
 there were no U.S. or coalition aircraft that were operating in the region=
 primarily because our efforts are focused on ISIL.&nbsp; And
 there=E2=80=99s little intelligence to substantiate the presence of signif=
icant ISIL forces in that region of the country.&nbsp; But obviously report=
s like this are heartbreaking and indefensible.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, g=
iven that Russia has an air force, and the Assad regime has some aircraft, =
though not a full air force, is it safe to assume that that's who you belie=
ve carried out this strike?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I wouldn=
't hazard a guess at this point about who carried out this particular strik=
e.&nbsp; We have seen a willingness on the part of the Assad regime to use =
what military aircraft they have to carry out attacks against innocent
 civilians.&nbsp; The dropping of barrel bombs is the best example of that.=
&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Again, I don't know enoug=
h about the details of this particular situation to say whether or not the =
tactics that were used in this particular strike are the same as the tactic=
s that the Assad regime has used in
 other parts of the country.&nbsp; But if it does turn out that the Assad r=
egime is responsible for this particular strike it would not at all be the =
first time that the Assad regime has used its military force against innoce=
nt civilians in a desperate situation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And t=
o very little consequence, as some would say, particularly when it comes to=
 this ceasefire, cessation of hostilities, that there are no repercussions =
for these violations, however flagrant they are, that
 the U.S. just keeps going back to the negotiating table, saying we're deal=
ing with malicious actors but we're hopeful that they=E2=80=99re going to s=
how some honor here.&nbsp; Is there any repercussions to a strike like this=
, killing, as you said, dozens of innocent civilians?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I thin=
k as a result of the behavior that we've seen from the Assad regime thus fa=
r, there is no hope that they=E2=80=99re going to show much honor.&nbsp; Wh=
at is true is that the only way to solve this situation
 effectively, consistent with our national security interests, is for a pol=
itical transition that results in Assad=E2=80=99s departure.&nbsp; And the =
United States has mobilized the international community, worked closely wit=
h the United Nations to try to facilitate those
 political talks.&nbsp; President Putin has acknowledged himself that that =
kind of political transition needs to happen.&nbsp; And we continue to impr=
ess upon President Putin the need to use his influence with the Assad regim=
e to get them to abide by the ceasefire, the
 cessation of hostilities, and to participate constructively in the ongoing=
 political talks.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And there was a point whe=
re we did see an important reduction in violence as a result of the initial=
 implementation of the cessation of hostilities.&nbsp; That initial impleme=
ntation went more smoothly than expected,
 and in the last few weeks we've seen that agreement start to fray.&nbsp; A=
nd the improvement in the situation around Aleppo is notable, but as I poin=
ted out, there are other areas of the country where the cessation of hostil=
ities is not implemented in the way that
 it should.&nbsp; And we're going to continue to work closely with the rest=
 of the international community to impress upon all parties the need to liv=
e up to their commitments.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The W=
hite House, the President has talked at great length about how concerned he=
 is about the refugee issue and internally displaced people.&nbsp; Among ma=
ny of the proposals put forward for some version of a safe
 zone, some not requiring ground forces, the argument has been to protect a=
gainst situations exactly like this, hitting people who are already fleeing=
 and in camps.&nbsp; You're still saying the White House does not support a=
ny kind of safe zone to protect these
 situations, these areas, refugee camps near the border of Turkey?<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
Margaret, this situation is tragic and there is no downplaying that.&nbsp; =
But I think it also underscores the difficulty of establishing a safe zone.=
&nbsp; It certainly underscores the tremendous commitment
 of military firepower that would be required to enforce a safe zone.&nbsp;=
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">In the past, those who ad=
vocate a safe zone have suggested that, well, it would not necessarily need=
 to be treated as a no-fly zone.&nbsp; But based on the circumstance that y=
ou=E2=80=99ve just raised, that's not true, and to
 say nothing of the significant commitment of ground forces that would be r=
equired to prevent ISIL or anyone else from infiltrating the camp, to monit=
or people as they move in and out, and frankly, if necessary, to root out e=
xtremist forces that are able to
 get access to the camp.&nbsp; That is a significant commitment of firepowe=
r and manpower.&nbsp; It also puts American troops in a very dangerous plac=
e.&nbsp; Lots of them.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So our view continues to =
be that a political transition is the only solution that is consistent with=
 our national security interests in that region of the world.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I=
 ask on North Carolina -- when we were in London, the President said that h=
e thought the law there and in Mississippi wrong and it should be repealed.=
&nbsp; He went on to say the next day that he lacked the
 authority essentially to be able to do just that.&nbsp; So lawmakers in No=
rth Carolina are saying they feel bullied by this DOJ action.&nbsp; How do =
you respond to the accusation that this is just another way of achieving th=
e aim of getting that law repealed?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think what this is, it's an independent enforcement decision that's made =
by attorneys at the Department of Justice.&nbsp; And there certainly is a l=
egal mechanism for evaluating the concerns that
 have been raised by the Department of Justice.&nbsp; Hopefully it won't co=
me to that.&nbsp; Hopefully the state of North Carolina and the lawmakers i=
n North Carolina will make some decisions that are consistent with the law,=
 consistent with our values, and consistent
 with the economic interests of their own state.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Thus far, the actions tha=
t they have taken have been inconsistent with all of those things.&nbsp; An=
d the President has spoken out quite forcefully against it because in his v=
iew this is something that goes to a core
 principle of fairness and equality and justice, and treating people the sa=
me and not discriminating against them because of who they love or because =
of who they are.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So it's a pretty simple c=
alculation when it comes to values. The Department of Justice has reached t=
heir own conclusions about what the law requires, and they=E2=80=99ve notif=
ied the state of North Carolina of their conclusion.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You s=
aid there had been no political interference in the DOJ process.&nbsp; But =
the President has clearly made his views very public.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, t=
he President has been asked by certain insightful, demanding journalists fo=
r his view.&nbsp; I'm looking for a way to get -- (laughter.)<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.=
&nbsp; But again, though, at that town hall the next day.&nbsp; I mean, thi=
s is an issue that's drawn a lot of attention.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I woul=
d acknowledge the President has not pulled any punches when it comes to mak=
ing clear his view that this law is wrong.&nbsp; And that is a value judgme=
nt that he is offering, and he believes those
 values that have been called into question aren't just worth defending, th=
ey=E2=80=99re worth advocating.&nbsp; And he'll do that.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But when it comes to enfo=
rcing the law, that's somebody else=E2=80=99s responsibility.&nbsp; That's =
the responsibility of the lawyers at the Department of Justice, and they=E2=
=80=99re carrying out those responsibilities consistent with
 the requirements of the law and without interference from the White House.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'r=

actions that DOJ took.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I guess you=E2=80=99d have to talk to the Department of Justice about that.=
&nbsp; There certainly was no attempt either publicly or privately to influ=
ence what is an independent enforcement decision carried
 out by Department of Justice attorneys.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
s, Josh.&nbsp; A U.S. Army intelligence officer based in Kuwait, a captain,=
 has brought a lawsuit, challenging the President=E2=80=99s assertions that=
 the war against the Islamic State is legal under existing law.
 &nbsp;You=E2=80=99ve been asked a lot about that in this briefing room.&nb=
sp; Does it give you pause, though, to hear some of these questions come fr=
om someone who is deployed in active duty?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, it=
 doesn=E2=80=99t.&nbsp; I think these are legitimate questions for every Am=
erican to be asking.&nbsp; The truth is that 449 days ago, the President of=
 the United States sent a detailed ISIL-specific AUMF proposal
 to Congress.&nbsp; That proposal included a recommendation to Congress tha=
t they not just pass this ISIL-specific AUMF but they repeal the 2002 AUMF =
and take steps to more narrowly tailor the 2001 AUMF.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">The President feels stron=
gly about this.&nbsp; The day after the election, the President held a news=
 conference with all of you in the East Room of the White House and was blu=
nt about the need for Congress to take action
 on this.&nbsp; That was the first time that he=E2=80=99d discussed it in r=
eally blunt terms publicly, but certainly not the first time that he has ad=
vocated in other settings for congressional action on this.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And unfortunately, we've =
not seen Congress take much action on this.&nbsp; The President sent up sen=
ior members of his national security team.&nbsp; His Secretary of State, Jo=
hn Kerry, his then Secretary of Defense, Chuck
 Hagel both testified under oath before Congress.&nbsp; But we haven't seen=
 congressional action on one of Congress=E2=80=99s most critically importan=
t responsibilities.&nbsp; And I'm not really sure why.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Maybe it's because they w=
ere spending a bunch of time considering the President=E2=80=99s nominee to=
 the Supreme Court.&nbsp; No, it wasn=E2=80=99t that.&nbsp; Maybe it's beca=
use they are busy dealing with responding to a public health emergency
 to make sure our public health professionals they need to respond to the Z=
ika crisis.&nbsp; Well, no, it wasn=E2=80=99t that.&nbsp; Maybe it was beca=
use Congress was holding intensive meetings with the President=E2=80=99s Bu=
dget Director to consider the President=E2=80=99s budget proposal
 on a range of important issues, including cybersecurity.&nbsp; No, they di=
dn=E2=80=99t do that either.&nbsp; They cancelled those hearings.&nbsp; May=
be it was because Congress was considering how important it was to ensure t=
hat the Puerto Rican government had the restructuring authority
 that they need so they can deal with the financial crisis that's affecting=
 3 million Americans in Puerto.&nbsp; No, it wasn=E2=80=99t that either.&nb=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I don=E2=80=99t really kn=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I w=
ant to draw your attention to an anecdote in The New York Times, a profile =
of Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes.&nbsp; You remember, right a=
round the time of the State of the Union, when the Iranians captured a numb=
er
 of American sailors?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I do rem=
ember that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's =
what the Times says:&nbsp; &quot;Rhodes found out about the Iranian action =
earlier that morning&quot; -- meaning that State of the Union -- &quot;but =
was trying to keep it out of the news until after the President's speech.&n=
bsp; 'They can't keep
 a secret for two hours,' Rhodes says with a tone of mild exasperation at t=
he break in message discipline.&quot;&nbsp; That sounds like he was putting=
 pressure on the military to withhold that information to avoid a political=
 headache.&nbsp; Is that what happened?&nbsp; And how
 often does it happen?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
can't speak to -- well, I'll acknowledge I have not read the story about Be=
n in the Times magazine.&nbsp; I do remember vividly that day, and I don=E2=
=80=99t think there is any expectation that -- well, let me say it this
 way, because I think there are a couple of factors here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is, Olivier, we'v=
e often found that it is easier to resolve situations like this when they a=
ren=E2=80=99t subject to intense media scrutiny.&nbsp; We often will declin=
e to discuss specific cases of Americans that are being held hostage
 around the world because we conclude that discussing them publicly before =
they are freed is not conducive to their prompt and safe release.&nbsp; I'm=
 sure that was a factor in this situation.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, I think a=
nybody who took a look at the situation recognized that it was not going to=
 stay secret for long, and that that certainly was true in this instance.&n=
bsp; And I think it is a good example, once again, of President
 Obama demonstrating his ability to effectively handle a crisis situation.&=
nbsp; You will recall that despite the pleas of some Republicans in Congres=
s, the President did deliver the speech on time, as planned.&nbsp; And thos=
e American servicemembers were released unharmed,
 with their equipment, the next day.&nbsp; That was an agreement that we ha=
d reached with the Iranians.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think the outcome of t=
his situation and the way that it was handled during that busy day I think =
is a strong endorsement as any of this President's ability to manage the af=
fairs of the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you =
can't say one way or another, though, whether the Times' characterization i=
s accurate -- that it was to avoid an embarrassing piece of news that might=
 overshadow the speech?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Again, I=
 haven=E2=80=99t read the piece.&nbsp; I would be surprised if anybody thou=
ght that a situation that volatile was going to be secret for that long.&nb=
sp; I also would say that the way that it is covered publicly has a direct =
impact
 on the ability to resolve these situations.&nbsp; And when we're talking a=
bout the lives of 10 U.S. servicemembers, their safe return is the top prio=
rity, and certainly much more important than any political calculation.<o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; If I can follow on candidates getting the classified briefings=
.&nbsp; You said the White House was confident that the intelligence commun=
ity can make the proper assessments on what presidential candidates receive=
 in
 terms of classified briefings and information.&nbsp; That seems to leave o=
pen the possibility that there are concerns about either one of these candi=
dates and that there are worries about either Trump, or whichever candidate=
 has access to classified information.&nbsp;
 Is that the impression you meant to leave?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I meant =
to leave you with the impression that the decision about what information t=
o provide is a decision that will be made by the intelligence community.&nb=
sp; That's what I meant to convey.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CIA=
, believe it or not, has a book on the history of presidential candidates g=
etting briefed.&nbsp; True fact.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And there is actua=
lly precedent for the White House asking to withhold certain information fr=
om candidates.&nbsp;
 In fact, National Security Advisor Sandy Berger asked that George W. Bush =
not be given anything sensitive.&nbsp; Can you commit that both candidates =
will received the same amount of information in this administration?<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think what I can commit to you is that the White House will not be interfer=
ing in the decisions that are made by the intelligence community to provide=
 information to the presidential candidates.&nbsp; What information
 they provide, how often they provide it, whether or not it's the same info=
rmation for the two candidates -- those are questions that I would direct t=
o Mr. Clapper's office.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One mor=
e on the same topic.&nbsp; The potential Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinto=
n, is actually under investigation for potential loss or mishandling of cla=
ssified information.&nbsp; Does the administration have confidence that Sec=
retary
 Clinton can properly maintain and store and receive classified information=
, given this ongoing investigation?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yes, we =
do.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would y=
ou say the same about Donald Trump?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Again, w=
e'll have to see what decision the Director of National Intelligence makes.=
&nbsp; I guess I can't -- off my own assessment, Secretary Clinton has obvi=
ously served this administration with distinction.&nbsp; And she's got
 a lot of experience in understanding the need to protect classified inform=
ation.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But look, this decision to =
provide that classified information will be made by the intelligence commun=
ity.&nbsp; It will be made by the professionals there.&nbsp; And they'll do=
 the right thing for the country, and they'll do that without any
 political interference from the White House.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; If I could follow up on Michelle's question for just a second.=
&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; She aske=
d a lot of them.&nbsp; I'm not sure which one you may have in mind.&nbsp; N=
ot that there's anything wrong with that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not tha=
t there's anything wrong with that.&nbsp; Exactly.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm here=
 to take them all.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actuall=
y, you know what, let me start off with something simple and we'll sort of =
back into it.&nbsp; Has the President reached out to the family of Charles =
Keating IV?&nbsp; And if so, has he made contact with the family thus far?<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think,=
 Kevin, what the President often will do -- and I think this is what previo=
us Presidents did as well -- is to write letters to the families of those s=
ervicemembers who have given their life for their country.&nbsp;
 And I would anticipate the President will do that in this situation too.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou.&nbsp; E-cigarettes not for sale for folks under 21.&nbsp; What's the Pr=
esident perspective on that?&nbsp; And what's behind the push?<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
is is actually a decision that was put forward by the FDA.&nbsp; And what t=
hey indicated is that, based on their analysis of public health trends, we'=
ve made a lot of progress in reducing smoking rates.&nbsp; Smoking rates
 are now at an all-time low in this country.&nbsp; But we have seen an alar=
ming increase in the use of e-cigarettes and even cigars, particularly by k=
ids.&nbsp; And so the FDA regulation that was announced today is focused on=
 making it harder for kids to get their hands
 on these products that we know have a very negative impact on their health=
.&nbsp; And so as an agency that's focused on the public health of the Amer=
ican people, for an agency that has conducted studies that indicate that sm=
oking continues to be the leading cause
 of preventable death in the United States, this is a prudent step that is =
driven by scientific evidence that's focused on keeping our kids safe.&nbsp=
; And this is, in that regard, is a carefully considered regulation that I =
think makes a lot of common sense.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does th=
e President believe that the ability to acquire cigarettes should be limite=
d to all Americans who are only 21 and up?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, ag=
ain, I think as it relates to this proposal, it=E2=80=99s 18 and under.&nbs=
p;&nbsp; And I=E2=80=99m not aware of the President weighing in on raising =
the age limit.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sort=
 of follow up on what Michelle was asking, can you say with 100 percent cer=
tainty that there was no conversation or coordination or collaboration in a=
ny way between the White House Counsel=E2=80=99s Office and the DOJ as it r=
elates
 to North Carolina? <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
is is an important thing for you to understand here.&nbsp; We've talked bef=
ore for a couple of weeks now about how the White House has worked with a r=
ange of federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, about
 the variety of policy questions that have been raised by HB2, this controv=
ersial North Carolina law.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The policy questions raised=
 are things like what impact that law could have on programs in the state o=
f North Carolina that are funded by the federal government.&nbsp; So this r=
aises questions for everybody from the Department of Transportation,
 to the Department of Education.&nbsp; And there will be a careful review o=
f what policy impact that law has on policy decisions made at a range of fe=
deral agencies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the Department of Just=
ice announced today is an intent -- they announced it yesterday -- what the=
 Department of Justice announced is an intent to pursue an enforcement acti=
on.&nbsp; Those enforcement decisions are made by Department
 of Justice attorneys, and they are not subject to influence by the White H=
ouse. <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not sub=
ject to influence.&nbsp; But if they've had conversations about some of the=
 actions that might be legal, some of the actions that might be relevant in=
 a particular area, can you not see how folks in North Carolina might feel
 like that's the White House directing -- sorting winking and nod, tap the =
side of the nose -- saying, hey, listen, DOJ, if you want to pursue this, m=
aybe this is an area that you can pursue?&nbsp; Or if you think of it this =
way, this is a possible remedy to sort
 of take a shot at a law that we think is a negative law?&nbsp; Can you und=
erstand how people in North Carolina might feel that way?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
can understand how the people in North Carolina might think that passing th=
is law ended up being a really bad idea.&nbsp; It certainly has not yielded=
 a lot of positive headlines for the state of North Carolina, and
 it certainly has not yielded a positive economic impact for the state of N=
orth Carolina.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, concerns about the=
 NBA=E2=80=99s decision with regard to the All-Star Game, decisions that co=
uld be made by the NCAA about locating college athletic competitions in the=
 state of North Carolina --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concert=
s --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Concerts=
.&nbsp; Even other businesses that suspended their intent to expand their f=
ootprint in North Carolina.&nbsp; All of that is going to have a negative i=
mpact on the economy in North Carolina.&nbsp; So I think that=E2=80=99s the=
 biggest
 impact.&nbsp; And I think that is probably the concern that the vast major=
ity of North Carolinians have about the bad decision that the legislature a=
nd the governor made to pass and sign this law.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you =
reject the notion that this is some sort of a government overreach, the Fed=
s coming in and telling us how to --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think there are some people who have a pretty persuasive case that this is =
a government overreach on the part of state officials in North Carolina tha=
t's had a negative impact on the public perception of their
 state and on the economic climate in their state.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is unfortunate because=
 the state of North Carolina is a state that has traditionally -- certainly=
 over the last generation or two -- worked really hard to diversify their e=
conomy; and that there are young adults -- not just across
 the South but across the country that have been attracted to the state of =
North Carolina because of their positive business climate, business you hav=
e a hub of innovation there, like the Research Triangle, that has drawn you=
ng, educated people and their families
 to come and pursues some interesting economic opportunities in that state.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is a testament to =
the innovation and ingenuity of the people of North Carolina and to previou=
s governors and previous state legislators.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it=E2=80=
=99s this current governor and the current legislator that have dealt
 a pretty big setback here.&nbsp; And it is something that -- it is not tru=
e to the culture and values and beliefs of the vast majority of Americans w=
ho live in that great state.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a =
couple more.&nbsp; I want to ask you about AUMF if you have a second.&nbsp;=
 Has the President -- maybe by way of the Counsel=E2=80=99s Office -- given=
 the ongoing actions in Iraq, opened the door for future Presidents to be a=
ble to wage
 war in perpetuity based on the way that currently this Counsel=E2=80=99s O=
ffice is interpreting the AUMF as it stands?&nbsp; Has this now made it pos=
sible for future Presidents to point to this President and say, well, if Co=
ngress doesn't act and give me a new AUMF, I
 can continue to use this footprint, or this blueprint to continue to wage =
actions around the globe?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The fact=
 of the matter is, Kevin, the 2001 AUMF didn't have a time limit on it.&nbs=
p; And one of the things that we have discussed with Congress is how and wh=
ether to force Congress to review at some regular interval an authorization
 to use military force that they previously passed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been some propos=
als that have been put forward, including by some members of Congress, that=
 have suggested that an authorization to use military force should have to =
be renewed by Congress every three years, otherwise it
 goes away.&nbsp; It sunsets.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there are a variety of c=
reative legislative proposals on this.&nbsp; But look, the fact of the matt=
er is the 2001 AUMF that was passed by Congress didn't include a time limit=
.&nbsp; It just didn't. So that is precisely why -- or that's among
 the reasons why the President believes that the 2001 AUMF should be more n=
arrowly targeted.&nbsp; And that's what our proposal included an ISIL-speci=
fic authorization to use military force.&nbsp; We've put forward legislativ=
e language describing what we believe that
 should be. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the source of some=
 criticism by Democrats and Republicans in Congress.&nbsp; And we said, fin=
e, negotiate with us.&nbsp; Tell us what else you=E2=80=99d like to see in =
there.&nbsp; And we haven=E2=80=99t seen much action on that.&nbsp; We also=
 proposed eliminating
 the 2002 AUMF that allowed President Bush to order the invasion of Iraq.&n=
bsp; And we suggested that Congress take action to more narrowly tailor to =
the 2001 AUMF.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think all of that is a pr=
etty clear indication that this President of the United States is quite eag=
er for Congress to actually step up to the plate and fulfill one of the mos=
t basic functions that they have.&nbsp; But this Congress has
 unfortunately abdicated that responsibility in the same way they've abdica=
ted their responsibility to address other urgent needs of the American peop=
le like the situation in Puerto Rico, or the situation with respect to the =
Zika virus, or even filling a vacancy
 in the Supreme Court.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last on=
e and this is your favorite topic, Donald Trump.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; So many =
favorite topics.&nbsp; (Laughter.) <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Int=
ercept and The Washington Post over the last couple of days have put out a =
number of different quotes from pundits who dismissed completely or outrigh=
t the ascendency of Donald Trump.&nbsp; And yet he continues to rise.&nbsp;=
 He=E2=80=99s
 now on the verge of capturing the GOP nomination.&nbsp; And I=E2=80=99m ju=
st wondering, as you look at that, what does that say about the mood of the=
 country?&nbsp; And does the President view that with amusement?&nbsp; Or d=
oes he view that through the prism of it speaks to a frustration
 and he=E2=80=99s not surprised by the ascendency of a Donald Trump? <o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
mostly what it tells me is that I don't get paid enough to be a pundit, so =
that's why I try to avoid doing that from here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with respect to the Pres=
ident=E2=80=99s view, I think the President has had on a number of occasion=
s the opportunity to discuss this, primarily when asked by one of you.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But so =
many missed it so badly.&nbsp; Even Nate Silver missed this.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; But ther=
e -- again -- <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's =
amazing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That's w=
hy I=E2=80=99ve gone to great lengths to avoid playing pundit up here.&nbsp=
; I also suspect that there will be a robust market for books about the 201=
6 election chronicling this phenomenon.&nbsp; So I think one of the reasons=
 that
 it=E2=80=99s interesting is that there are no clear obvious answers to exa=
ctly what=E2=80=99s happening.&nbsp; But that will only be one other factor=
 will combine with several others to make for a rather interesting fall 201=
6.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it =
must say something about the mood of the country, no?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The Pres=
ident has talked about this.&nbsp; The President has talked about how justi=
fied people are in being frustrated that all of the benefits of the tremend=
ous economic recovery that we=E2=80=99ve made since the Great Recession
 have not been enjoyed evenly across the country; that too many of those be=
nefits flow to those at the top.&nbsp; And that exacerbation of an already =
yawning gap, wealth gap, is something that a lot of Americans are justifiab=
ly frustrated by.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the President sought to=
 take this head on.&nbsp; That=E2=80=99s why the President advocated for ra=
ising the minimum wage and making permanent tax cuts for middle-class famil=
ies, and raising taxes for those at the top, and closing tax loopholes
 that only benefit the wealthy and the well-connected.&nbsp; Unfortunately,=
 Republicans have blocked those attempts time and time again.&nbsp; Some of=
 them we actually achieved over Republican obstruction -- raising taxes on =
the top 1 percent, for example.&nbsp; But look,
 this is something that I anticipate will be the subject of ongoing debate =
leading up to the next election as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jared, go ahead.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of =
your favorite topics wrapped up into one question -- classified presidentia=
l directives and also press access.&nbsp; For the DNC and RNC in July, the =
United States Secret Service is justifying a drastic change on convention
 background checks on a 2013 still classified national security directive f=
rom President Obama.&nbsp; Is the President aware of the extent of the chan=
ges that the DNC and RNC will undergo because of his directive?&nbsp; And i=
s he concerned by that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Jared, I=
 feel confident in telling you the President is not aware of the press acce=
ss plans for either the Democratic or Republican conventions that are plann=
ed for July.&nbsp; So I have to admit that I know very little about
 them as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This wa=
s a directive signed by the President in 2013.&nbsp; It is classified, it=
=E2=80=99s Presidential Directive 22 -- PPD 22 -- and it=E2=80=99s somethin=
g that is going to require for the first time -- the President=E2=80=99s co=
nventions where he was nominated
 as the Democratic candidate in 2008 and 2012 did not have Secret Service b=
ackground checks the way we will now have in 2016.&nbsp; So not as somethin=
g he should be aware of except maybe as the person who swore to protect the=
 First Amendment rights of everybody
 in the country.&nbsp; Is that something that he=E2=80=99s concerned about?=
&nbsp; These changes are drastic.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Jared, I=
 don=E2=80=99t know that they are.&nbsp; The pass you=E2=80=99re wearing ar=
ound your neck right now required you to submit to a background check condu=
cted by the Secret Service.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, b=
ut there are no delegates in this room who didn=E2=80=99t have to go throug=
h a background check.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Okay.&nb=
sp; Everybody that=E2=80=99s -- actually everyone that=E2=80=99s in this ro=
om did have to go through a background check in order to enter this buildin=
g and stand here right now.&nbsp; That=E2=80=99s a fact.&nbsp; That=E2=80=
=99s true of me and my staff, and
 that=E2=80=99s true of all the journalists here, too.&nbsp; So, again, I d=
on=E2=80=99t know that much about the details, but I suspect that the Secre=
t Service can do a better job of helping you understand exactly what securi=
ty precautions they=E2=80=99re taking to ensure the safety of
 everybody who participates in the conventions this summer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you=
 take the question?&nbsp; Because I feel like there=E2=80=99s more.&nbsp; A=
nd I know that this is a classified directive, but I feel like there --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I think =
you should take the question to the Secret Service if you have questions ab=
out why you need to undergo a background check in order to attend the conve=
ntion.&nbsp; I think most reasonable people would acknowledge that
 that kind of safety is required for everybody=E2=80=99s protection.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, c=
an you say whether President Obama has given up on the idea of making any r=
ecess appointments?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, I ca=
n=E2=80=99t speak to that.&nbsp; I don=E2=80=99t know of any that are plann=
ed at this point.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he s=
topped by considering them by when the Senate -- like this week, when they=
=E2=80=99re out, they hold pro forma sessions a couple of times during the =
week to keep him from making a recess appointment -- even though you might =
say
 they=E2=80=99re on recess, but they say they=E2=80=99re not because they h=
ave the pro forma sessions that last about 30 seconds.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think even many of them will talk rather freely about the fact that they=E2=
=80=99re on recess.&nbsp; But, look, the Supreme Court has weighed on this =
just recently in the last year or two.&nbsp; So I think this is largely a s=
ettled
 matter.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what=
 way?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, in=
 that the Supreme Court has had an opportunity to weigh in on at least part=
 of this question.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So does=
 he think he is unable to make recess appointments because of the Senate se=
ssions?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, it=
 certainly is limited, but again, I=E2=80=99m not an attorney and I haven=
=E2=80=99t gotten the legal briefing on this.&nbsp; But I don=E2=80=99t kno=
w that that=E2=80=99s necessarily been eliminated.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None in=
 the pipeline, you=E2=80=99re saying?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I=E2=80=
=99m sorry?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You=E2=
=80=99re saying there are none in the pipeline?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Not that=
 I=E2=80=99m aware of.&nbsp; Not that I=E2=80=99m aware of.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John in the back, I=E2=80=
=99ll give you the last one.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; Back on TPP and the ongoing discussions with congressional lea=
ders.&nbsp; Can you say if those talks now include Senator McConnell?<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Senator =
McConnell is somebody that has, in the past, talked about how important the=
 Trans-Pacific Partnership is for our country.&nbsp; And he is somebody who=
 did work effectively with the administration to pass Trade Promotion
 Authority last year, and we certainly would need to work closely with Lead=
er McConnell to succeed in passing the Trans-Pacific Partnership this year =
as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It=E2=80=99s not just the a=
dministration that=E2=80=99s making this case.&nbsp; Our friends at the Cha=
mber of Commerce just across the street here I=E2=80=99m sure are in regula=
r touch with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill.&nbsp; The same is true of =
the American
 Farm Bureau and the National Association of Manufacturers.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Hou=
se Republicans are proposing for war funding to expire next April.&nbsp; Gi=
ven the fact that President Obama would be out of office, would he veto, sa=
y, an omnibus or any legislation, even a defense authorization bill, that
 came over with that plan?&nbsp; Or does he -- would he feel the next Presi=
dent, the next Commander-in-Chief should negotiate the war funding?<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; John, I=
=E2=80=99d actually refer you to Secretary Carter=E2=80=99s comments on thi=
s.&nbsp; President Obama believes that funding our war effort a few months =
at a time is grossly irresponsible and not the way that we should be demons=
trating
 our clear commitment to our men and women in uniform who are risking so mu=
ch to protect our country.&nbsp; Again, Congress=E2=80=99s responsibility h=
ere to provide for the basics when it comes to ensuring that our men and wo=
men have the resources that they need to go and
 degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL is critically important.&nbsp; And Sec=
retary Carter had some very uncharacteristically direct language about this=
, and it=E2=80=99s fair for you to assume that the views that he expressed =
are consistent with the views of the Commander-in-Chief.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.&nbsp; We=
=E2=80=99ll see you tomorrow.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=
p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
