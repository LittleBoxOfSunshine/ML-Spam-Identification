Dear Andy,

Called for Carolyn late last week re our roundtable in DC this Wednesday.
She's not ready to give yet. She's not a Debbie Wasserman Schultz fan nor a
Hillary fan.  Not coming to roundtable. 

She knows we have to win but prefers Bernie to some extent, not because she
"feels the Bern", but because he's an alternative to Hillary and saw the
head-to-head poll numbers against Trump showing Bernie doing better. 

She doesn't think Debbie is a good spokesperson for the party. She's willing
to touch base again in a few weeks.  

Warren answered the phone. He told me he had open heart surgery a couple
weeks ago. Not a blockage but a heart flap that was not functioning
properly. He's home and on the mend. We are sending flowers from finance.
