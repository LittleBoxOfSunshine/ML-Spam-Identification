By all reports, it was a raucous event that descended into uncontrolled ang=

towards revered Democratic Party leaders like California Senator Barbara Bo=
xer when she showed up to give a speech on behalf of Secretary Clinton.

Apparently, Sanders supporters were none too happy with the outcome of the =
allocations of the delegates.  Even though Hillary Clinton won the state so=
me months ago during the Nevada caucuses, and should have been allotted mor=
e delegates, the Sanders campaign had planned to out-maneuver the Clinton c=
ampaign and emerge from the state convention with more delegates than the S=
ecretary.

In the end, the delegates were distributed according to the rules, which ha=
d been agreed upon early on by both campaigns and whose representatives wer=
e active in all phases of the convention process.  But not before vocal boo=
s, shows of violence, obscenities screamed at the stage, chairs thrown, and=
 threats of bodily harm.  So much so that security had to shut down the con=
vention because they could no longer guarantee public safety.

While there is still no comparison in division, rancor, and acrimony betwee=
n what is happening on the Democratic side of the aisle and the Republican =
side, Democrats have become increasingly concerned that what happened in Ne=
vada is a precursor of what could happen at the Democratic National Convent=
ion in Philadelphia over the summer.

In fact, in a letter of complaint<https://www.google.com/url?sa=3Dt&rct=3Dj=
&q=3D&esrc=3Ds&source=3Dweb&cd=3D1&cad=3Drja&uact=3D8&ved=3D0ahUKEwiEh46u5u=

a8huRrKR-CIduvqfqfmY7L5PPQ&bvm=3Dbv.122129774,d.cWw> sent to the Democratic=
 National Committee's Rules and By Laws Committee, the General Counsel of t=
he Nevada Democratic State Party outlined the events during the convention =
and strongly condemned the actions of the Sanders campaign operatives as we=
ll as that of his supporters.  The letter warned of similar unrest at the N=
ational convention.

This cannot and should not happen.

The Nevada debacle was the pinnacle of frustration and disillusionment on b=
ehalf of Sanders' supporters who wanted to give their candidate an advantag=
e in delegates even in the face of a win by Hillary Clinton.  While this go=
al is understandable, the tactics and methods reportedly used are inexcusab=
le.

This unrest needs to be quelled by party leaders and representatives from b=
oth camps, including Senator Sanders himself. Supporters and activists from=
 both campaigns need to respect the rules and be respected for their hard w=
ork and commitment.

Unfortunately, Senator Sanders' statement<https://www.google.com/url?sa=3Dt=
&rct=3Dj&q=3D&esrc=3Ds&source=3Dweb&cd=3D5&cad=3Drja&uact=3D8&sqi=3D2&ved=

 the wake of the Nevada fiasco was inadequate at best, and at worst, could =
be seen as stoking the fires of discontent among his supporters.  Important=
ly, he said he does not condone any violence.  But he did little to quell t=
he anger and in fact threw gasoline on the fire by accusing Nevada party le=
aders of cheating.

While it was heartening to hear Sanders' campaign manager state unequivocal=
ly there would be no violence at the National Convention,<https://www.googl=
e.com/url?sa=3Dt&rct=3Dj&q=3D&esrc=3Ds&source=3Dweb&cd=3D4&cad=3Drja&uact=

92l_7K3AHWHvNeDy9bKg4g&bvm=3Dbv.122129774,d.cWw> Senator Sanders should ste=
p up and disavow this behavior without qualification or pause.

Throughout this campaign, Democrats have been able to hold our heads high a=
nd inflate our chests with pride at how we were conducting our primary proc=
ess.  It has been robust, passionate, and emotional.  But it had not gotten=
 ugly, personal and vile.  Those attributes had been reserved for our count=
erparts on the other side of the aisle thanks to their now nominee and stan=
dard bearer Donald Trump, who proudly feeds the flames of hate, division, a=
nd blame.

Let's keep it that way.  We cannot devolve down that rabbit hole of conflic=
t and disunity.  If we do, we might as well give Donald Trump the keys to t=
he White House right now.

I understand the frustration of Sanders' supporters.  As a Hillary Clinton =
supporter, I was there in 2008.  You put your heart and soul into the belie=
f that your candidate is the best equipped to win and then the effort comes=
 up short.  It is nothing less than a heart wrenching experience.

But real leaders take that raw disillusionment in their supporters and chan=
nel it towards the greater good for the country and for the agenda they hav=
e been fighting so hard for up to now.

Senator Sanders has a choice to make.

He can guide his followers into more productive means of expressing their f=
rustrations and keep them from burning bridges that will help them achieve =
the progressive changes they had hoped to with Sanders at the helm.

He can tell them to dial it down, lay off the violent behavior and threats,=
 and help him see this through with dignity and enough leverage to see real=
 change in the Democratic Party in Philadelphia.

He can still lead his followers to the Promised Land, even if that does not=
 mean the White House.  Senator Sanders can claim he has already won.  He h=
as put key issues front and center and he changed the debate so that it mor=
e strongly represents the progressive values he has championed for so long.

He can take the high road, claim this win, stay in the race, continue fight=
ing for progressive change but focus his fire on Donald Trump.

Or he can continue going after Secretary Clinton, making his supporters bel=
ieve he can still win the nomination, and when he doesn't, make it that muc=
h harder for them to unite with other Democrats against our real common foe=
s - the Republicans and Donald Trump - and ensuring they do not step foot i=
n the White House.

This is our most important task at hand and I will bet on Bernie doing the =
right thing.
