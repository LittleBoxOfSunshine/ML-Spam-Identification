Subject: Vice President bilat with Prime Minister of Romania

Romanian Prime Minister Dacian Ciolos, arrived at 12:57 pm EST at the Wes=
t Wing entrance, exiting a black SUV and waving to reporters before enter=
ing the West Wing.

The press was brought in to the Roosevelt Room at 1:12 pm while Vice Pres=
ident Joseph Biden and Prime Minister Ciolos were seated at the table wit=
h members of their staff.

"They call this the Roosevelt Room because of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, =
but it's also named after Teddy Roosevelt," Biden remarked.

The Vice President described Teddy Roosevelt as "a remarkable politician"=
 and a "Republican" as the press was escorted out of the room after about=
 30 seconds.

Prime Minister Ciolos's departure was delayed while American leaders atte=
nding the Vice President's gun violence forum this afternoon delivered re=
marks to the press.

He exited the building at 2:23 pm and made remarks in Romanian before cli=
mbing into the SUV at 2:28 pm.

A number of American officials who were still speaking to the press in th=
e driveway made a hasty retreat to the side as the vehicle carrying the R=
omanian Prime Minister departed.
