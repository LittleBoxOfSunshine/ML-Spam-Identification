TOP TALKER - on A1 of tomorrow's N.Y. Times, "Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private," by Michael Barbaro and Megan Twohey: "The New York Times interviewed dozens of women who worked with or for Mr. Trump over the past four decades, in the worlds of real estate, modeling and pageants; women who dated him or interacted with him socially; and the women and men who have closely observed his conduct since his adolescence. ... Their stories ... reveal episodes of unwelcome romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, the shrewd reliance on ambitious women and, in some cases, uncomfortable physical aggression. ... He could be lewd one moment and
 gentlemanly the next." http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c976155ffa17536624a5fd8d97a58efbcdebd2a29c2f83760544c8c

SO THAT HAPPENED -- "Donald Trump masqueraded as publicist to brag about himself," by Marc Fisher and Will Hobson: Trump posed as his own spokesperson, "John Barron" or "John Miller," according to the Washington Post:

"In 1990, Trump testified in a court case that 'I believe on occasion I used that name.' ... In a phone call to NBC's "Today" program Friday morning after this article appeared online, Trump denied that he was John Miller. 'No, I don't think it - I don't know anything about it. You're telling me about it for the first time and it doesn't sound like my voice at all,' he said. ...

"Then, Friday afternoon, Washington Post reporters who were 44 minutes into a phone interview with Trump about his finances asked him a question about Miller: 'Did you ever employ someone named John Miller as a spokesperson?'

"The phone went silent, then dead. When the reporters called back and reached Trump's secretary, she said, 'I heard you got disconnected. He can't take the call now. I don't know what happened.'" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c976155cd0562478accea2742bfde58e064f38d45c73d045c2ba735

HuffPost banner: "TRUMP SPANKED BY PRANK SCANDAL"

PLAYBOOK's TAKE -- This one will leave a mark. Just ask Manti Te'o.

Good Saturday morning, and Happy Brunching. It's 65 days to Cleveland, 72 days to Philly, 178 days to election.

Mike Allen's still in an undisclosed location. But Florida Man has now wrested control of Playbook back from BuzzFeed's Ben Smith, who guest-hosted yesterday. So we're way down south today, with a little Miami flavor that you normally find only in POLITICO Florida Playbook...

FLORI-DUH, FLORI-DUH, FLORI-DUH -- It's already been a Florida-filled presidential cycle, considering it's the home of Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee and DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (facing her first PRIMARY in 24 years). Then there's Part-Time Florida Man Donald Trump, who owns Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach (Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter's town). Trump needs the nation's biggest swing state's 29 Electoral College votes. If he loses here, he loses his shot at the White House -- unless he gets the election equivalent of something like a Rust Belt Royal Flush from the Midwest to Pennsylvania. So here's a snapshot of the Sunshine State's political dynamics six months
 from Election Day....

NUNCA TRUMP -- Down south here in Latin America's capital city, Miami mayor Tom&aacute;s Regalado told The Miami Herald that Trump "mistreats people, speaks derisively of people." Trump reminds the Republican of being called "spic" after he fled Communist Cuba as a kid. Safe to count the mayor as officially part of the Hispanic-heavy "Never Trump" camp of Miami Republicans Jeb Bush and U.S. Reps Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Carlos Curbelo. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c976155372948579c1c300e23550f56e68e62387a25d20d87e21d6d

'LITTLE ORANGE MAN' -- The Latino Republican who really unloaded on Trump in Florida was Rosario Marin (former Treasurer under Jeb's bro George). She repeatedly called Trump a "little orange man" during an interview with WFTV in Orlando Friday. To use a Miami-ism: "!Co&ntilde;o!" http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c97615598209eb635b24d3044c49a42716ae67b9f833daae7c55b94

MAYBE TRUMP -- Then there's Marco Rubio. The Florida senator this week ducked and dodged over the timing and the degree to which he'll support Trump. Rubio said he won't "take shots" at the nominee and intends to still back him, as pledged. The fence-straddling isn't earning Rubio extra friends, but he's leaving office this year after losing Florida badly to Trump. And he doesn't really care what Acela thinks right now.

#UNSKEW!!! -- So Trump is losing Florida badly, right? Maybe not. A Quinnipiac University swing state poll released this week showed Clinton and Trump virtually tied 43-42 percent in Florida and Pennsylvania; Trump marginally led in Ohio, 43-39 percent. The reaction from many rank-and-file Democrats and liberals was that the Q-poll was crazy, the surveys too white. But Quinnipiac's internals (in Florida) aren't necessarily off, or significantly off. http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c97615580c8f5e6e6fd6f6c31040c2b49afd6917563cc5f26036bac

** A message from the Alzheimer's Association: Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. Every hour, Alzheimer's costs taxpayers $18.3 million dollars. Today, Alzheimer's costs the country $236 billion a year and that will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation. Funding for Alzheimer's research must increase. Learn more at alz.org/advocacy **

THE STONE ZONE CASE FOR TRUMP -- Leaving aside Ohio and Pennsylvania, ubiquitous political hitman and Trump World agent Roger Stone (who, yes, lives in South Florida) points out something many miss: "No Republican has ever gotten as many votes in a Florida presidential primary as Donald." Trump pulled in more than 1 million votes and won 66 of 67 counties. He only lost Rubio's Hispanic-heavy home county, Miami-Dade, which has more Republicans than any other in Florida. Trump won 303,711 more votes than Romney's 776,159 in the 2012 Florida primary against Newt Gingrich (who wouldn't mind being Trump's running mate now).

'TRUMP EFFECT' -- Prior to the March 15 primary, Florida elections officials reported a "Trump Effect" of new GOP registrants. GOP rolls grew 108,372 since the 2014 election; the bulk in 2016 (Rubio played a role in driving registration as did Jeb, albeit to a lesser degree following his Feb. 20 S.C. loss). Put another way: Republicans gained 2 points in net registration. And Florida Democrats lost 1 point between elections; Democrats accounted for less than 38 percent of the primary rolls and Republicans more than 35 percent. (We'll leave independents for another day.)

A RACE ABOUT RACE -- Will Trump be demolished among Hispanics and African Americans in Florida? Probably.

BUT, BUT, BUT...  Hispanics were 15 percent of the Florida primary electorate vs. 66 percent for non-Hispanic whites (or "Anglos" as they're called in Miami, even if you're Italian). In 2012, Hispanics were 14 percent of the rolls (but only cast 13 percent of the ballots) and Anglos were 67 percent of the rolls (but cast 69 percent of the ballots). Hispanic primary registrants increased a percentage point since the 2014 general election, while whites dropped a point. But it's not as if the Hispanic vote is going gangbusters (yet?). The Anglo vote is the most-reliable. The Trump hope: he can excite more white voters and offset losses with Hispanics, assuming it doesn't get worse (no more
 Trump Tower tacos)....

Then there's the black vote. African Americans were 13 percent of the primary vote, a slight decline since 2012. Then, they overperformed their registration numbers for Obama. Is it reasonable to assume Clinton will get as big an African-American turnout as the first black president did? When it came to blacks and Hispanics in Florida, Obama crushed Romney in 2012. But the president only won reelection in Florida by just 0.9 percentage points.

PROBABLY HILLARY -- "Are many Democrats complacent and think Trump will be easy to beat? Abso-freaking-lutely," Steve Schale, a top Florida strategist who worked for Obama's Florida campaign, tells Playbook. "Is the Clinton campaign taking Trump for granted? No ... They know the last time we thought that Republican division would lead to a Democrat we got Gov. Rick Scott. Twice." Still, Schale said, top Clinton advisers tell him they know demographics are on her side in the swing states, and especially Florida. And so is organization. "The Clinton campaign is confident that if they block and tackle properly, they'll win. They have a campaign. And Trump really doesn't. There's no
 organization."

MEXICO VS. DONALD -- "Mexico fights back against 'The Clown,'" by Nahal Toosi: "Mexican officials are pursuing a counteroffensive to Trump's incendiary rhetoric, reaching out to U.S. business leaders, looking at ways to better use social media, and even encouraging qualified Mexicans to get U.S. citizenship. But they're also trying to stay sensitive about taking more high-profile steps, such as running TV ads in an already overheated presidential race that promote Mexico as a friendly, vibrant neighbor and not a cesspool of criminals."  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c97615591bcb4f1d60008debe00347bd9ae332aa3434445b0f22ebc

TOP-ED -- STEVEN RATTNER in the NYT, "Donald Trump and the Art of the Tax Loophole": "In 2005, [Trump] got a $39.1 million tax deduction for donating a conservation easement on a New Jersey golf course ... [and] installed goats on two of his New Jersey golf courses as part of a plan to get them designated as agricultural properties, thereby vastly lowering his property taxes."  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c9761550a96de23f08fc29c2e6d1c0fb32f49e02422f28b2d6094ce

--"Trump Campaign Won't Rule Out Using New Donations to Pay Donald Trump $36 Million for Loan," by MSNBC's Ari Melber: "After running against a corrupt fundraising system in the Republican primaries, Donald Trump now says he will raise hundreds of millions of dollars to compete in the general election. But the new money Trump raises is available not only for future campaigning - it can also go directly into Trump's pocket, reimbursing him for his personal spending in the primaries."  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c976155ed7fe812e7fa12039dd5f6230e741470be2f0b119f14ad65

FIRST LOOK - "Democrats, Don't Fall Into the Anger Trap," by Third Way's Lanae Erickson Hatalsky on Medium: "Some strategists have posited that 2016 will be an anger election, and in order to combat the forces of nativist, protectionist, and anti-establishment rage ginned up by Trump, Democrats must produce their own anger. But that argument fundamentally misunderstands both the mood of the electorate ... If Democrats embrace it, they will start a fire they cannot contain-and they will end up burning their own house down."  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c9761551ace3fbc934e2eafb3afc45c3722fe103ba61397495cfef2

TV TONIGHT -- In an interview for Fox News' "Watters' World" tonight at 8 p.m., Eric Trump spoke with host Jesse Watters about his father and what it was like growing up as a member of the Trump family. On whether his father used to break up the fights between him and his brother Don: "He'd normally instigate the fight. I guess some things never change, right?"

On what Donald is like with his grandchildren: "The kids run into his office - they jump on him, he'll be on the phone, they'll jump on him, they'll pile on and he's been amazing with them." On what holidays are like at the Trump home: "Trump holidays, all we do is we laugh. Some of the comedy that comes out of those is just fantastic. ... There's a lot of type A at that table. ... We always ate a lot."

SNEAK PEEK - Killer New Yorker cover next week by Barry Blitt titled "Grand Illusion" shows a tux-wearing Trump sawing up an elephant in half, representing the GOP. Blitt: "This is the fourth time in less than a year that I've drawn Trump (or his hands). ... It seems like a lot, but the Trump-induced rift in the G.O.P. is the least depressing of the items on the current news cycle."  http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c9761558f873e83c7ada4ffe89d313202bff0e8bb0121c086bf7596

** A message from the Alzheimer's Association: Costing taxpayers $18.3 million every HOUR, Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's and more than 15 million unpaid caregivers are providing care for a loved one. Alzheimer's is a national issue, and now it's time we make it a national priority. Alzheimer's yearly cost of $236 billion will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation - an epidemic we cannot afford and shouldn't accept. While it is the only leading cause of death that can't be prevented, cured or even slowed, research and medical advancement can change that. That's why the Alzheimer's
 Association is fighting to eliminate the disease through the advancement of research and providing care and support for all affected. Learn more at www.alz.org/advocacy. **

<b>FLORI-DUH, FLORI-DUH, FLORI-DUH
</b> -- It's already been a Florida-filled presidential cycle, considering it's the home of Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee and DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (facing her first PRIMARY in 24 years). Then there's Part-Time Florida Man Donald Trump, who owns Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach (Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter's town). Trump needs the nation's biggest swing state's 29 Electoral College votes. If he loses here, he loses his shot at the White House -- unless he gets the election equivalent of something like a Rust Belt Royal Flush from the Midwest to Pennsylvania. So here's a snapshot of the Sunshine State's political dynamics six months from Election Day....</p>
<p><b>NUNCA TRUMP</b> -- Down south here in Latin America's capital city, Miami mayor Tom&aacute;s Regalado told The Miami Herald that Trump &quot;mistreats people, speaks derisively of people.&quot; Trump reminds the Republican of being called &quot;spic&quot; after he fled Communist Cuba as a kid. Safe to count the mayor as officially part of the Hispanic-heavy &quot;Never Trump&quot; camp of Miami Republicans Jeb Bush and U.S. Reps Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Carlos Curbelo. <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c976155372948579c1c300e23550f56e68e62387a25d20d87e21d6d" target="_blank">http://hrld.us/1sld6uH</a></p><p><b>'LITTLE ORANGE MAN' 
</b>-- The Latino Republican who really unloaded on Trump in Florida was Rosario Marin (former Treasurer under Jeb's bro George). She repeatedly called Trump a &quot;little orange man&quot; during an interview with WFTV in Orlando Friday. To use a Miami-ism: &quot;&iexcl;Co&ntilde;o!&quot; <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c97615598209eb635b24d3044c49a42716ae67b9f833daae7c55b94" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1TT95WG</a></p><p><b>MAYBE TRUMP 
</b>-- Then there's Marco Rubio. The Florida senator this week ducked and dodged over the timing and the degree to which he'll support Trump. Rubio said he won't &quot;take shots&quot; at the nominee and intends to still back him, as pledged. The fence-straddling isn't earning Rubio extra friends, but he's leaving office this year after losing Florida badly to Trump. And he doesn't really care what Acela thinks right now.</p><p><b>#UNSKEW!!!
</b> -- So Trump is losing Florida badly, right? Maybe not. A Quinnipiac University swing state poll released this week showed Clinton and Trump virtually tied 43-42 percent in Florida and Pennsylvania; Trump marginally led in Ohio, 43-39 percent. The reaction from many rank-and-file Democrats and liberals was that the Q-poll was crazy, the surveys too white. But Quinnipiac's internals (in Florida) aren't necessarily off, or significantly off. <a href="http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=1013111d9c97615580c8f5e6e6fd6f6c31040c2b49afd6917563cc5f26036bac" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1YrhOkn</a></p><p><b>** A message from the Alzheimer's Association:

</b> Leaving aside Ohio and Pennsylvania, ubiquitous political hitman and Trump World agent Roger Stone (who, yes, lives in South Florida) points out something many miss: &quot;No Republican has ever gotten as many votes in a Florida presidential primary as Donald.&quot; Trump pulled in more than 1 million votes and won 66 of 67 counties. He only lost Rubio's Hispanic-heavy home county, Miami-Dade, which has more Republicans than any other in Florida. Trump won 303,711 more votes than Romney's 776,159 in the 2012 Florida primary against Newt Gingrich (who wouldn't mind being Trump's running mate now).</p><p><b>'TRUMP EFFECT' 
</b>-- Prior to the March 15 primary, Florida elections officials reported a &quot;Trump Effect&quot; of new GOP registrants. GOP rolls grew 108,372 since the 2014 election; the bulk in 2016 (Rubio played a role in driving registration as did Jeb, albeit to a lesser degree following his Feb. 20 S.C. loss). Put another way: Republicans gained 2 points in net registration. And Florida Democrats lost 1 point between elections; Democrats accounted for less than 38 percent of the primary rolls and Republicans more than 35 percent. (We'll leave independents for another day.)</p><p><b>A RACE ABOUT RACE -- </b>Will Trump be demolished among Hispanics and African Americans in Florida? Probably.</p><p>
<b>BUT, BUT, BUT... 
</b> Hispanics were 15 percent of the Florida primary electorate vs. 66 percent for non-Hispanic whites (or &quot;Anglos&quot; as they're called in Miami, even if you're Italian). In 2012, Hispanics were 14 percent of the rolls (but only cast 13 percent of the ballots) and Anglos were 67 percent of the rolls (but cast 69 percent of the ballots). Hispanic primary registrants increased a percentage point since the 2014 general election, while whites dropped a point. But it's not as if the Hispanic vote is going gangbusters (yet?). The Anglo vote is the most-reliable. The Trump hope: he can excite more white voters and offset losses with Hispanics, assuming it doesn't get worse (no more Trump Tower
 tacos)....</p><p><b>Then there's the black vote. </b>African Americans were 13 percent of the primary vote, a slight decline since 2012. Then, they overperformed their registration numbers for Obama. Is it reasonable to assume Clinton will get as big an African-American turnout as the first black president did? When it came to blacks and Hispanics in Florida, Obama crushed Romney in 2012. But the president only won reelection in Florida by just 0.9 percentage points.</p><p><b>PROBABLY HILLARY -- 
</b>&quot;Are many Democrats complacent and think Trump will be easy to beat? Abso-freaking-lutely,&quot; Steve Schale, a top Florida strategist who worked for Obama's Florida campaign, tells Playbook. &quot;Is the Clinton campaign taking Trump for granted? No ... They know the last time we thought that Republican division would lead to a Democrat we got Gov. Rick Scott.

</b> Costing taxpayers $18.3 million every HOUR, Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in the country. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's and more than 15 million unpaid caregivers are providing care for a loved one. Alzheimer's is a national issue, and now it's time we make it a national priority. Alzheimer's yearly cost of $236 billion will quadruple to more than $1 trillion over the next generation - an epidemic we cannot afford and shouldn't accept. While it is the only leading cause of death that can't be prevented, cured or even slowed, research and medical advancement can change that. That's why the Alzheimer's Association is fighting to eliminate the
 disease through the advancement of research and providing care and support for all affected.
