Subject: Biden meets Cardinal Parolin, discusses bet, seeks absolution bu=
t not $10: pool 4

After meeting privately with Pope Francis, VPOTUS met with Cardinal Pietr=
o Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State. The two men shook hands in the=
 Treaty Room and then moved into a second room.

Here is a transcript of Mr. Biden's remarks, courtesy of Michael A. Memol=
i of the Los Angeles Times:

BIDEN: What an honor to see you again.
(SHAKE)
BIDEN: I don't know whether you know, your photograph is hanging in my of=
fice.
PAROLIN: Oh yeah?
BIDEN; Yes, from our meeting.
PAROLIN: You have already met with the Holy Father.
BIDEN: I have met with the Holy Father. And I've met with these guys, too=
.
(GESTURES TO POOL THEN GRIPS YOUR POOLER)
BIDEN: I had to pay this man $10. He's from the New York Times. We had a =
bet: which is the faster car, the newer Cadillac or the new Musk car. Whi=
ch?
POOLER: Tesla.
BIDEN: The Tesla. I bet the Cadillac.
POOLER: He went for the old technology. I went for the new.
PAROLIN: Oh yes?
BIDEN: The Tesla's two tenths of a second faster. But I lost. I paid my $=
10. (LOUDER TO ENTIRE POOL, ROOM AND PERHAPS CITY) I want the record to s=
how, I paid my $10.
MEMOLI (CATHOLIC REPRESENTATIVE IN POOL): Does that count as a confession=
, sir?
BIDEN: I'm seeking absolution!

Betting is not a sin but tends to be discouraged by religious authorities=
. Timothy 6:10 warns against a love of money, and Jesus's run-in with the=
 money-changers suggested a strong aversion.

Still, Biden's bet seems unlikely to generate the same consternation as h=
is support of abortion rights and gay marriage. Cardinal Parolin seemed u=
nconcerned.
