*Clinton on Priorities Like Curbing Child Care Costs: 'It Shouldn't Be
About Politics *=E2=80=93* It Should Be About Families'*

Today, Hillary Clinton continued her "Breaking Down Barriers" tour by
outlining her vision to help working families afford the rising costs of
child care and health care, saying in Kentucky that taking on these issues
is important whether you are Democrat or Republican.

Following events yesterday with young parents in Loudoun County, Virginia,
and earlier today with working moms in Lexington, Kentucky, she visited a
family health clinic in Louisville, Kentucky, where she committed to
capping family child care costs and expanding home-visiting programs for
parents of young children. She again reiterated her belief that we must
enact paid family leave, raise the minimum wage and guarantee equal pay. In
her remarks, Clinton said, "The parents I=E2=80=99ve met over the past few =
days and
parents that I=E2=80=99ve met over the past many years may come from differ=
ent
backgrounds, they may earn different incomes. They=E2=80=99re Democrats and
Republicans, but they=E2=80=99re facing the same challenges and they desper=
ately
want to give their kids a good life and they are needing help to deal with
the pressures... It shouldn=E2=80=99t be about politics.  It should be abou=
t
families."

Clinton's remarks in Louisville follow her campaign's announcement today of=
 a
new, comprehensive child care proposal
<https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/05/10/clinton%25e2=
%2580%258b-%25e2%2580%258bto%25e2%2580%258b-%25e2%2580%258bcommit-to-bold-n=

which would increase child care investments so no family pays more than 10
percent of their income for child care. The plan also would create a new
initiative to fund and support states and local communities that work to
increase the compensation of child care providers and early educators, as
well as provide home visiting services to more than two million parents and
children in the next decade by doubling our nation's investment in
evidenced-based home visiting initiatives like the MIECHV program.

*A transcript of Hillary Clinton's full remarks in Louisville is below:*

Well, I, for one, could listen to Bill for a long time.  His service along
with all of you who have supported this center is really heartening to me
because what you=E2=80=99ve done is what we all know needs to be done =E2=
=80=93 providing
comprehensive health care and making sure that people=E2=80=99s needs are a=
ddressed
across the full range of health.  And I am thrilled to be here.

I want to recognize former Lieutenant Governor Crit Luallen.  Thank you so
much for being here, Crit. I also want to recognize former Secretary Audrey
Haynes, former Secretary of Health and Human Services here in Kentucky.  I
am very grateful to them for their service, for being here, but also
because they were part of the Beshear administration that did an absolutely
world-class job. I don=E2=80=99t suppose you need me to say that Kentucky=
=E2=80=99s
expansion of Medicaid, the Connect program, was really held up as the best
example of any state=E2=80=99s efforts.  And I know that it was a real team
commitment =E2=80=93 the entire administration plus all in the health field=
 who
were working so hard to make it possible for more people in this beautiful
state to have the health insurance that they deserved.

And I want to thank everyone here at Family Health Centers, which serves
thousands and thousands of hardworking Kentucky families.  I just met some
of the people who work here.  I met some of the patients.  And they=E2=80=
=99re all
just beaming =E2=80=93 they=E2=80=99re so proud to be associated with such =
a special
place.  And I am determined to do what I can to help lift up and celebrate
organizations like this.  Nothing is more important than helping families,
particularly hardworking families who need the kind of support that they
get here at the Family Health Centers.

And I was thinking and several people as I was walking around were asking
me about my granddaughter or they were mentioning that they had met my
daughter, and it was just last Sunday that we were celebrating Mother=E2=80=
=99s Day
across our country, and a lot of moms were given homemade cards, maybe
breakfast in bed, maybe pictures were taken.  I=E2=80=99ve got a whole draw=
er of
gifts like that.  And they=E2=80=99ll be treasured forever, but it=E2=80=99=
s also important
that we recognize that our country should be celebrating families every
single day and doing everything we can to support families =E2=80=93 not ju=
st with
nice words but with real actions that can help parents, moms and dads, do
the vital work of raising their children, which is the most important work
any of us ever do.

And I=E2=80=99ve heard from thousands of families who are struggling who ar=
e trying
to figure out how to get from paycheck to paycheck.  They can=E2=80=99t fig=
ure out
how to pay for childcare and to put some money away for maybe college
someday.  They=E2=80=99re struggling to be there for their kids, trying to =
succeed
at home, succeed at work, and they=E2=80=99re finding how difficult that is=
 =E2=80=93 how
many stresses are part of it.  And for some families it=E2=80=99s even grea=
ter if
they are raising kids with special needs or with chronic illnesses or they
have mental health challenges in their families.  And in places that have
been devastated by job losses not far from here, where coal, steel and rail
jobs are disappearing, raising a family becomes even harder.

I was with some moms and dads yesterday in Northern Virginia talking about
the challenges that they all face =E2=80=93 how to balance work and family =
=E2=80=93 and a
few brought their children with them.  And we were impressed that all these
children were so patient and their moms were keeping them occupied and
happy.  But it was really important to hear from each of them what they
think they need to do the job and how they can get more help.

These moms and dads are running into the middle-class squeeze that many
families face.  Their relative incomes are the same or lower than they were
some years ago, but the cost of everything is higher, so even with two
incomes economic pressures are enormous.  And one mom said she=E2=80=99s pa=
ying
$16,000 a year for childcare, which means that there=E2=80=99s nothing to p=
ut away
for college, and they=E2=80=99re balancing their budget every week trying t=
o make
sure they=E2=80=99ve got the money they need for everything else.

Earlier, in Lexington today, I met with another group of moms and dads at
the Family Care Center near the university, and just about every single one
of them said how invaluable it was to have a place where they could come to
get help to meet the needs of their kids, including childcare,
home-visiting programs, medical checkups.  That was such a relief, and a
lot of them didn=E2=80=99t even know that such a program was available unti=
l they
really needed it and found their way to it.  That freed them up to focus on
work, knowing that their kids were in safe hands.

I hear this across the country, because so many families really don=E2=80=
=99t know
where to turn.  And the parents I=E2=80=99ve met over the past few days and=
 parents
that I=E2=80=99ve met over the past many years may come from different back=
grounds,
they may earn different incomes.  They=E2=80=99re Democrats and Republicans=
, but
they=E2=80=99re facing the same challenges and they desperately want to giv=
e their
kids a good life and they are needing help to deal with the pressures,
because they can=E2=80=99t figure out often how to solve all of this on the=
ir own.

So today, even, walking around with Bill, I met parents just very briefly
who come here to this center for all of their medical and health needs.  It
gives them peace of mind, not just services.  And that=E2=80=99s just somet=
hing
every parent can understand =E2=80=93 getting that peace of mind.  I know w=
hat it
was like so many years ago trying to balance family and work, when my
daughter would get sick as I was on the way out the door to work, how I
would find somebody to help me take care of her because, of course, if she
were sick, the babysitter was also sick.  And that=E2=80=99s the kind of ev=
eryday,
real challenge that families are facing.

And I want us to be really focused on what we=E2=80=99re going to do to mak=
e it
easier for families to get ahead and stay ahead.  And it=E2=80=99s going to=
 be one
of the major issues that I=E2=80=99m going to keep talking about because I =
don=E2=80=99t
think there is anything more important.  I know I was lucky all those years
ago that I had backup.  And I know a lot of parents are trying as hard as
they can.

So what can we do to get our economy and our workplaces that were, frankly,
built for a different time, when you had a stay-at-home parent,
predominately moms, and one income could support a family =E2=80=93 but tha=
t=E2=80=99s just
not the way it is for the vast majority of American families any more.  And
so what we=E2=80=99ve got to figure out is how to move our family policy in=
to the
21st century and to do more to help women and men find meaningful work, to
earn a good living, but to take care of their most important
responsibilities.

So I=E2=80=99ve been thinking a lot about what we can do.  How do we make
government policies more efficient?  How do we make them more responsive to
everything that people have to do, to raise their kids and look after the
home and be there to earn a living and build a career?  Because I don=E2=80=
=99t
think we can keep going on like this.  We can=E2=80=99t keep saying, famili=
es just
have to buckle down and tighten their belts and figure it out.  I think
belts are about as tight as they can get for the vast majority of families.

People are using every single hour of their day, and there=E2=80=99s still =
not
enough time to get everything done.  And too many parents are lying awake
at night trying to figure out how in the world they=E2=80=99re going to mak=
e it all
work.  So something=E2=80=99s got to change, and there isn=E2=80=99t one-si=
ze-fits-all.  We
need a menu of options in a country as diverse as ours.  And I think there
are a number of things we could do that would make real differences for
families.

Let=E2=80=99s create a national system of paid family leave. Too many new p=
arents
really don=E2=80=99t know how to handle the family responsibilities.  Too m=
any moms
have to go right back to work after their babies are born, or they try to
cobble together vacation days and sick days and unpaid leave, short-term
disability, anything to get more time with their babies.  Many don=E2=80=99=
t even
get a paid day off to give birth.  That=E2=80=99s just almost impossible fo=
r many
people in many workplaces to believe, but it happens to be true.  There is
no requirement that people get earned sick days, that they get the kind of
support that they need.  And too many dads and parents of adopted children
don=E2=80=99t get any paid leave at all, and neither do sons and daughters =
who are
struggling to take care of aging parents.  I just don=E2=80=99t think this =
is fair
to families, and that we can and should do better.

California=E2=80=99s had paid leave for a number of years.  They in fact ju=
st
expanded it to cover more of the pay needed and to cover more family
members.  And their economy=E2=80=99s doing just fine.  The arguments we al=
l hear,
like, =E2=80=9COh, my gosh, you can=E2=80=99t do that,=E2=80=9D we will str=
ucture a plan that will
be sensitive to small businesses with few employees.  But we=E2=80=99ve got=
 to move
with the rest of the world, the advanced economies in the world that
provide paid leave programs.

I also want to expand home visiting programs nationwide.  In some states,
nurses, social workers, volunteers who are trained go right into the home.
And we heard about a great program in Lexington.  They answer questions
about nursing or sleep training.  They screen for health and developmental
benchmarks so problems can be caught early.  They emphasize how important
it is to talk, read, and sing to your baby to build your baby=E2=80=99s bra=
in,
which will better prepare your child to succeed in school.  Every family
deserves that support, no matter where they live.  And the testimonials to
the home visiting program that I heard in Lexington were just so glowing
about what it meant.

I brought a home visiting program for toddlers to Arkansas called the Home
Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters, and it really works.  It
really helps =E2=80=93 not only prepare kids.  You know what else it does? =
 It
helps parents, predominately mothers and grandmothers, if they are caring
for children, feel competent and confident in being that educator in the
home that every child needs to have.

We also have to raise families=E2=80=99 incomes.  Start by raising the mini=
mum wage
at the national level, which would give =E2=80=93 that would give millions =
of
American families =E2=80=93 two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women.  =
So it
would give a lot of single-parent families a much-needed boost in their
income.

And then of course we have to guarantee equal pay for women=E2=80=99s work =
because
when =E2=80=93 when a woman is paid unfairly, that doesn=E2=80=99t just sho=
rtchange her.
It shortchanges the whole family.  And it hurts them down the road in the
form of lower Social Security contributions and retirement savings.  And I
want to do more to encourage employers to embrace family-friendly policies,
and here=E2=80=99s just one example.

There are these new sophisticated scheduling software programs that help
employers squeeze every last once of productivity out of their workforce.
But they also throw their workers=E2=80=99 families into chaos.  Too many w=
orkers
don=E2=80=99t even know what shift they=E2=80=99re working until the last m=
inute.  If they
have kids, that means they=E2=80=99re constantly scrambling to line up chil=
dcare.
And how can you even plan to take your child to the doctor or go to the
parent-teacher=E2=80=99s conference or sit down at the dinner table as a fa=
mily if
you are working until 1:00 a.m., and then you=E2=80=99re told you have to r=
eport
back at 4:00 a.m.?  And it just infuriates me because I have talked to
predominately women who are on these kinds of unpredictable, absolutely
back-breaking schedules.

That instability is not what families and kids need.  So I want to do more
to work with businesses and workers to help workers gain more control over
their schedules.  We cannot be sacrificing families and children for these
unpredictable scheduling choices that are really not necessarily.  You
cannot convince me that you can=E2=80=99t do a little better planning.  In =
fact, if
businesses can=E2=80=99t, then there=E2=80=99s something wrong.  They need =
to get some help
themselves because that=E2=80=99s not a very smart organizing or managerial
approach.

And then we=E2=80=99ve got to put quality childcare within the reach of eve=
ry
family.  Right now, in many states, childcare is more expensive than
college tuition.  That is just a shocking figure.  Now, we know that
college is too expensive, and that=E2=80=99s why I=E2=80=99m advocating for=
 debt-free
college.  But for many families, childcare costs are even more, and it puts
parents in an impossible position.  Either they put their kids in a
not-so-great place and spend the whole day worried and distracted, or they
do whatever it takes to pay for childcare, even if it means taking on debt;
or they decide they just can=E2=80=99t afford it, so one parent stays home =
or they
put their child in a setting they=E2=80=99re not enthusiastic about.

And I=E2=80=99ve been talking with so many parents that are just caught in =
this
childcare bind.  And if they leave the workforce =E2=80=93 predominately, a=
gain,
the mothers =E2=80=93 then it makes it harder to get back in the workforce =
and to
get paid what they should have been paid anyway.  And for single-parent
families, these choices are even more difficult.  So I think we=E2=80=99ve =
got a
lot to do to make quality childcare affordable for all working families and
to move us toward a much more family-friendly set of policies.

I looked it up, and here in Kentucky two parents earning the minimum wage
have to spend about 20 percent of their income on childcare.  For a single
parent, that number goes up to 40 percent.  Now, if we=E2=80=99re going to =
say we
are for family values, then we need to value families.  And no family
should have to pay more than 10 percent of their income on childcare.  And
under my plan, that would be what we would do.

And at the same time, we would work to give childcare workers a raise
because despite how high the price is for families, the people who actually
do the work aren=E2=80=99t paid well at all.  A lot of them are minimum wag=
e
workers, and a lot of them can=E2=80=99t stay in the profession because it =
just
doesn=E2=80=99t provide enough of a living.  In fact, in many places dog tr=
ainers
are paid more than childcare workers.  And I=E2=80=99ve talked to a lot of
childcare workers who can=E2=80=99t give their own children the care that t=
hey want
them to have.  And with the high turnover, it doesn=E2=80=99t lead to the q=
uality
that any family should expect.

So I want to make childcare a profession that attracts and retains
talented, qualified workers.  As president, I would support states and
cities that take steps to increase pay for childcare providers and early
educators while at the same time making childcare more affordable for
families by having a bigger government backstop.  What I learned today in
Lexington, they have a really great program, and they get subsidies from
the state.  They have a sliding scale of payment that is affordable.  And
that=E2=80=99s exactly what we need to be doing for everyone.

And I want to help students who are also parents.  That means getting more
childcare centers on or near college campuses, like the one I visited today
near UK.  It also means easing the financial burdens on student parents so
they don=E2=80=99t give up on school because they can=E2=80=99t afford it.

Back in Arkansas, I helped to start a scholarship for single parents,
called the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, to help defray some of
the costs that single parents ran into because if your childcare falls
apart, you can=E2=80=99t go to class.  If your old car that =E2=80=93 you=
=E2=80=99re living out in
the country and it=E2=80=99s the only way you can get to college dies, you =
can=E2=80=99t
get there because =E2=80=93 and lots of places in Arkansas, Kentucky, and
elsewhere, there=E2=80=99s not a lot of mass transit that=E2=80=99s going t=
o get you to
school.  Right?

So we=E2=80=99ve got to do more.  I=E2=80=99d like to do something similar =
to what I did in
Arkansas nationwide because parents who get their degrees =E2=80=93 their c=
ommunity
college degrees, their four-year degrees =E2=80=93 have better job options =
and
better incomes down the road.  So if we=E2=80=99re serious about helping an=
d
supporting families, we=E2=80=99ve got to do more to support parents who ar=
e in
school.

Now, every issue that I=E2=80=99ve mentioned, of course, matters to women. =
 But
let=E2=80=99s remember, they matter to men, too.  We need to help dads just=
 as much
as moms, and that goes for every kind of dad and every kind of mom.  It
shouldn=E2=80=99t be about politics.  It should be about families.

Now, having said that, we are in the middle of a presidential election
right now, and there are real differences between what I believe, what we
believe, and what the presumptive Republican nominee believes because at a
time when families are struggling to pay for childcare and so much else,
Donald Trump actually stood on a debate stage and argued that Americans are
being paid too much, not too little.  He=E2=80=99s even talking about getti=
ng rid
of the federal minimum wage, leaving it totally to the states, to the mercy
of Republican governors, who have already cut the minimum wage for state
workers.  And that=E2=80=99s happened right here in Kentucky.

And it=E2=80=99s troubling to me because if you=E2=80=99re going to grow th=
e economy, I
think it=E2=80=99s kind of obvious you want people to be making money so th=
at they
can actually spend it and put it back into the economy.  Donald Trump wants
to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.  Your governor is working hard to
undermine what Kentucky has accomplished.

So I think with somebody like Donald Trump, you would see a race to the
bottom across our country, with working families paying the price.  And I
don=E2=80=99t think that=E2=80=99s a risk we can afford.  So we have to rej=
ect that vision
and instead come up with a much more positive one for families and children=
.

I love being here at this center because I can see how patient-oriented and
family-oriented you are.  And I=E2=80=99ve fought for a very long time for
childcare and paid leave and early learning.  And I=E2=80=99ve done it beca=
use,
obviously, I believe in it, and I=E2=80=99ve lived the work-family balancin=
g act,
trying to be a good mom, trying to be a good person at work.  But I really
believe that healthy, secure families are the foundation of a strong
economy and a strong country.

So for me, this goes way beyond the specifics.  And I would be so proud to
be the champion of a center like this, or like the center I saw in
Lexington, to carry your mission into the White House, and try to move into
the 21st century with our family and health policies.  I am defending the
Affordable Care Act because it is working.  And if somebody has a better
idea, of course we will listen to it.  But Kentucky did a really good job
in getting people connected, and I met two people signing up just upstairs
a few minutes ago.  If it ain=E2=80=99t broke, don=E2=80=99t mess with it. =
 Right?

And so I=E2=80=99m going to continue to speak out on behalf of the Affordab=
le Care
Act.  And when people say they want to repeal it, they want to end it, they
really can=E2=80=99t tell you what they want to do because what they want t=
o do
will just send us back to where we were, where we had so many uninsured
people, so many people suffering, so many people left out of the health
care system.  I think we are so much better off now than we were.  And I
know it gives a lot of peace of mind to mothers because we are the
principal purchasers and motivators for health care.  All the studies show
that.  We=E2=80=99re the ones getting the checkups.  We=E2=80=99re the one =
urging people in
the family to go to the doctor for X, Y, and Z.  So we know that we need a
system we can rely on.

And in order to have that system, we need a country that really values what
you do here at the center, that is behind you all the way.  And I=E2=80=99v=
e always
believed, as some of you know, that it takes a village to raise a child,
that we have a responsibility to support each other and create the best
possible environment for kids to grow up so they, too, can thrive.  Because
when families are strong, America is strong.  I think it=E2=80=99s really a=
s simple
as that.

And so for me, I want to do everything I can, working with you, visionaries
who have created this great comprehensive health center, to do more on
behalf of all of our families.  So I=E2=80=99m really here to say thank you=
 for
leading the way.  Thank you very much.

 be done =E2=80=93 providing comprehensive health care and making sure that=
 people=E2=80=99s needs are addressed across the full range of health.&nbsp=
; And I am thrilled to be here.<br><br>I want to recognize former Lieutenan=
t Governor Crit Luallen.&nbsp; Thank you so much for being here, Crit. I al=
so want to recognize former Secretary Audrey Haynes, former Secretary of He=
alth and Human Services here in Kentucky.&nbsp; I am very grateful to them =
for their service, for being here, but also because they were part of the B=
eshear administration that did an absolutely world-class job. I don=E2=80=
=99t suppose you need me to say that Kentucky=E2=80=99s expansion of Medica=
id, the Connect program, was really held up as the best example of any stat=
e=E2=80=99s efforts.&nbsp; And I know that it was a real team commitment =
=E2=80=93 the entire administration plus all in the health field who were w=
orking so hard to make it possible for more people in this beautiful state =
to have the health insurance that they deserved. &nbsp;<br><br>And I want t=
o thank everyone here at Family Health Centers, which serves thousands and =
thousands of hardworking Kentucky families.&nbsp; I just met some of the pe=
ople who work here.&nbsp; I met some of the patients.&nbsp; And they=E2=80=
=99re all just beaming =E2=80=93 they=E2=80=99re so proud to be associated =
with such a special place.&nbsp; And I am determined to do what I can to he=
lp lift up and celebrate organizations like this.&nbsp; Nothing is more imp=
ortant than helping families, particularly hardworking families who need th=
e kind of support that they get here at the Family Health Centers.<br><br>A=
nd I was thinking and several people as I was walking around were asking me=
 about my granddaughter or they were mentioning that they had met my daught=
er, and it was just last Sunday that we were celebrating Mother=E2=80=99s D=
ay across our country, and a lot of moms were given homemade cards, maybe b=
reakfast in bed, maybe pictures were taken.&nbsp; I=E2=80=99ve got a whole =
drawer of gifts like that.&nbsp; And they=E2=80=99ll be treasured forever, =
but it=E2=80=99s also important that we recognize that our country should b=
e celebrating families every single day and doing everything we can to supp=
ort families =E2=80=93 not just with nice words but with real actions that =
can help parents, moms and dads, do the vital work of raising their childre=
n, which is the most important work any of us ever do. &nbsp;<br><br>And I=
=E2=80=99ve heard from thousands of families who are struggling who are try=
ing to figure out how to get from paycheck to paycheck.&nbsp; They can=E2=
=80=99t figure out how to pay for childcare and to put some money away for =
maybe college someday.&nbsp; They=E2=80=99re struggling to be there for the=
ir kids, trying to succeed at home, succeed at work, and they=E2=80=99re fi=
nding how difficult that is =E2=80=93 how many stresses are part of it.&nbs=
p; And for some families it=E2=80=99s even greater if they are raising kids=
 with special needs or with chronic illnesses or they have mental health ch=
allenges in their families.&nbsp; And in places that have been devastated b=
y job losses not far from here, where coal, steel and rail jobs are disappe=
aring, raising a family becomes even harder.<br><br>I was with some moms an=
d dads yesterday in Northern Virginia talking about the challenges that the=
y all face =E2=80=93 how to balance work and family =E2=80=93 and a few bro=
ught their children with them.&nbsp; And we were impressed that all these c=
hildren were so patient and their moms were keeping them occupied and happy=
.&nbsp; But it was really important to hear from each of them what they thi=
nk they need to do the job and how they can get more help. &nbsp;<br><br>Th=
ese moms and dads are running into the middle-class squeeze that many famil=
ies face.&nbsp; Their relative incomes are the same or lower than they were=
 some years ago, but the cost of everything is higher, so even with two inc=
omes economic pressures are enormous.&nbsp; And one mom said she=E2=80=99s =
paying $16,000 a year for childcare, which means that there=E2=80=99s nothi=
ng to put away for college, and they=E2=80=99re balancing their budget ever=
y week trying to make sure they=E2=80=99ve got the money they need for ever=
ything else.<br><br>Earlier, in Lexington today, I met with another group o=
f moms and dads at the Family Care Center near the university, and just abo=
ut every single one of them said how invaluable it was to have a place wher=
e they could come to get help to meet the needs of their kids, including ch=
ildcare, home-visiting programs, medical checkups.&nbsp; That was such a re=
lief, and a lot of them didn=E2=80=99t even know that such a program was av=
ailable until they really needed it and found their way to it.&nbsp; That f=
reed them up to focus on work, knowing that their kids were in safe hands.<=
br><br>I hear this across the country, because so many families really don=
=E2=80=99t know where to turn.&nbsp; And the parents I=E2=80=99ve met over =
the past few days and parents that I=E2=80=99ve met over the past many year=
s may come from different backgrounds, they may earn different incomes.&nbs=
p; They=E2=80=99re Democrats and Republicans, but they=E2=80=99re facing th=
e same challenges and they desperately want to give their kids a good life =
and they are needing help to deal with the pressures, because they can=E2=
=80=99t figure out often how to solve all of this on their own.<br><br>So t=
oday, even, walking around with Bill, I met parents just very briefly who c=
ome here to this center for all of their medical and health needs.&nbsp; It=
 gives them peace of mind, not just services.&nbsp; And that=E2=80=99s just=
 something every parent can understand =E2=80=93 getting that peace of mind=
.&nbsp; I know what it was like so many years ago trying to balance family =
and work, when my daughter would get sick as I was on the way out the door =
to work, how I would find somebody to help me take care of her because, of =
course, if she were sick, the babysitter was also sick.&nbsp; And that=E2=
=80=99s the kind of everyday, real challenge that families are facing.<br><=
br>And I want us to be really focused on what we=E2=80=99re going to do to =
make it easier for families to get ahead and stay ahead.&nbsp; And it=E2=80=
=99s going to be one of the major issues that I=E2=80=99m going to keep tal=
king about because I don=E2=80=99t think there is anything more important.&=
nbsp; I know I was lucky all those years ago that I had backup.&nbsp; And I=
 know a lot of parents are trying as hard as they can.<br><br>So what can w=
e do to get our economy and our workplaces that were, frankly, built for a =
different time, when you had a stay-at-home parent, predominately moms, and=
 one income could support a family =E2=80=93 but that=E2=80=99s just not th=
e way it is for the vast majority of American families any more.&nbsp; And =
so what we=E2=80=99ve got to figure out is how to move our family policy in=
to the 21st century and to do more to help women and men find meaningful wo=
rk, to earn a good living, but to take care of their most important respons=
ibilities.<br><br>So I=E2=80=99ve been thinking a lot about what we can do.=
&nbsp; How do we make government policies more efficient?&nbsp; How do we m=
ake them more responsive to everything that people have to do, to raise the=
ir kids and look after the home and be there to earn a living and build a c=
areer?&nbsp; Because I don=E2=80=99t think we can keep going on like this.&=
nbsp; We can=E2=80=99t keep saying, families just have to buckle down and t=
ighten their belts and figure it out.&nbsp; I think belts are about as tigh=
t as they can get for the vast majority of families.<br><br>People are usin=
g every single hour of their day, and there=E2=80=99s still not enough time=
 to get everything done.&nbsp; And too many parents are lying awake at nigh=
t trying to figure out how in the world they=E2=80=99re going to make it al=
l work.&nbsp; So something=E2=80=99s got to change, and there isn=E2=80=99t=
 one-size-fits-all.&nbsp; We need a menu of options in a country as diverse=
 as ours.&nbsp; And I think there are a number of things we could do that w=
ould make real differences for families.<br><br>Let=E2=80=99s create a nati=
onal system of paid family leave. Too many new parents really don=E2=80=99t=
 know how to handle the family responsibilities.&nbsp; Too many moms have t=
o go right back to work after their babies are born, or they try to cobble =
together vacation days and sick days and unpaid leave, short-term disabilit=
y, anything to get more time with their babies.&nbsp; Many don=E2=80=99t ev=
en get a paid day off to give birth.&nbsp; That=E2=80=99s just almost impos=
sible for many people in many workplaces to believe, but it happens to be t=
rue.&nbsp; There is no requirement that people get earned sick days, that t=
hey get the kind of support that they need.&nbsp; And too many dads and par=
ents of adopted children don=E2=80=99t get any paid leave at all, and neith=
er do sons and daughters who are struggling to take care of aging parents.&=
nbsp; I just don=E2=80=99t think this is fair to families, and that we can =
and should do better.<br><br>California=E2=80=99s had paid leave for a numb=
er of years.&nbsp; They in fact just expanded it to cover more of the pay n=
eeded and to cover more family members.&nbsp; And their economy=E2=80=99s d=
oing just fine.&nbsp; The arguments we all hear, like, =E2=80=9COh, my gosh=
, you can=E2=80=99t do that,=E2=80=9D we will structure a plan that will be=
 sensitive to small businesses with few employees.&nbsp; But we=E2=80=99ve =
got to move with the rest of the world, the advanced economies in the world=
 that provide paid leave programs.<br><br>I also want to expand home visiti=
ng programs nationwide.&nbsp; In some states, nurses, social workers, volun=
teers who are trained go right into the home.&nbsp; And we heard about a gr=
eat program in Lexington.&nbsp; They answer questions about nursing or slee=
p training.&nbsp; They screen for health and developmental benchmarks so pr=
oblems can be caught early.&nbsp; They emphasize how important it is to tal=
k, read, and sing to your baby to build your baby=E2=80=99s brain, which wi=
ll better prepare your child to succeed in school.&nbsp; Every family deser=
ves that support, no matter where they live.&nbsp; And the testimonials to =
the home visiting program that I heard in Lexington were just so glowing ab=
out what it meant.<br><br>I brought a home visiting program for toddlers to=
 Arkansas called the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters, and=
 it really works.&nbsp; It really helps =E2=80=93 not only prepare kids.&nb=
sp; You know what else it does?&nbsp; It helps parents, predominately mothe=
rs and grandmothers, if they are caring for children, feel competent and co=
nfident in being that educator in the home that every child needs to have.<=
br><br>We also have to raise families=E2=80=99 incomes.&nbsp; Start by rais=
ing the minimum wage at the national level, which would give =E2=80=93 that=
 would give millions of American families =E2=80=93 two-thirds of minimum w=
age workers are women.&nbsp; So it would give a lot of single-parent famili=
es a much-needed boost in their income.<br><br>And then of course we have t=
o guarantee equal pay for women=E2=80=99s work because when =E2=80=93 when =
a woman is paid unfairly, that doesn=E2=80=99t just shortchange her.&nbsp; =
It shortchanges the whole family.&nbsp; And it hurts them down the road in =
the form of lower Social Security contributions and retirement savings.&nbs=
p; And I want to do more to encourage employers to embrace family-friendly =
policies, and here=E2=80=99s just one example.<br><br>There are these new s=
ophisticated scheduling software programs that help employers squeeze every=
 last once of productivity out of their workforce.&nbsp; But they also thro=
w their workers=E2=80=99 families into chaos.&nbsp; Too many workers don=E2=
=80=99t even know what shift they=E2=80=99re working until the last minute.=
&nbsp; If they have kids, that means they=E2=80=99re constantly scrambling =
to line up childcare.&nbsp; And how can you even plan to take your child to=
 the doctor or go to the parent-teacher=E2=80=99s conference or sit down at=
 the dinner table as a family if you are working until 1:00 a.m., and then =
you=E2=80=99re told you have to report back at 4:00 a.m.?&nbsp; And it just=
 infuriates me because I have talked to predominately women who are on thes=
e kinds of unpredictable, absolutely back-breaking schedules.<br><br>That i=
nstability is not what families and kids need.&nbsp; So I want to do more t=
o work with businesses and workers to help workers gain more control over t=
heir schedules.&nbsp; We cannot be sacrificing families and children for th=
ese unpredictable scheduling choices that are really not necessarily.&nbsp;=
 You cannot convince me that you can=E2=80=99t do a little better planning.=
&nbsp; In fact, if businesses can=E2=80=99t, then there=E2=80=99s something=
 wrong.&nbsp; They need to get some help themselves because that=E2=80=99s =
not a very smart organizing or managerial approach.<br><br>And then we=E2=
=80=99ve got to put quality childcare within the reach of every family.&nbs=
p; Right now, in many states, childcare is more expensive than college tuit=
ion.&nbsp; That is just a shocking figure.&nbsp; Now, we know that college =
is too expensive, and that=E2=80=99s why I=E2=80=99m advocating for debt-fr=
ee college.&nbsp; But for many families, childcare costs are even more, and=
 it puts parents in an impossible position.&nbsp; Either they put their kid=
s in a not-so-great place and spend the whole day worried and distracted, o=
r they do whatever it takes to pay for childcare, even if it means taking o=
n debt; or they decide they just can=E2=80=99t afford it, so one parent sta=
ys home or they put their child in a setting they=E2=80=99re not enthusiast=
ic about.<br><br>And I=E2=80=99ve been talking with so many parents that ar=
e just caught in this childcare bind.&nbsp; And if they leave the workforce=
 =E2=80=93 predominately, again, the mothers =E2=80=93 then it makes it har=
der to get back in the workforce and to get paid what they should have been=
 paid anyway.&nbsp; And for single-parent families, these choices are even =
more difficult.&nbsp; So I think we=E2=80=99ve got a lot to do to make qual=
ity childcare affordable for all working families and to move us toward a m=
uch more family-friendly set of policies.<br><br>I looked it up, and here i=
n Kentucky two parents earning the minimum wage have to spend about 20 perc=
ent of their income on childcare.&nbsp; For a single parent, that number go=
es up to 40 percent.&nbsp; Now, if we=E2=80=99re going to say we are for fa=
mily values, then we need to value families.&nbsp; And no family should hav=
e to pay more than 10 percent of their income on childcare.&nbsp; And under=
 my plan, that would be what we would do.<br><br>And at the same time, we w=
ould work to give childcare workers a raise because despite how high the pr=
ice is for families, the people who actually do the work aren=E2=80=99t pai=
d well at all.&nbsp; A lot of them are minimum wage workers, and a lot of t=
hem can=E2=80=99t stay in the profession because it just doesn=E2=80=99t pr=
ovide enough of a living.&nbsp; In fact, in many places dog trainers are pa=
id more than childcare workers.&nbsp; And I=E2=80=99ve talked to a lot of c=
hildcare workers who can=E2=80=99t give their own children the care that th=
ey want them to have.&nbsp; And with the high turnover, it doesn=E2=80=99t =
lead to the quality that any family should expect.<br><br>So I want to make=
 childcare a profession that attracts and retains talented, qualified worke=
rs.&nbsp; As president, I would support states and cities that take steps t=
o increase pay for childcare providers and early educators while at the sam=
e time making childcare more affordable for families by having a bigger gov=
ernment backstop.&nbsp; What I learned today in Lexington, they have a real=
ly great program, and they get subsidies from the state.&nbsp; They have a =
sliding scale of payment that is affordable.&nbsp; And that=E2=80=99s exact=
ly what we need to be doing for everyone.<br><br>And I want to help student=
s who are also parents.&nbsp; That means getting more childcare centers on =
or near college campuses, like the one I visited today near UK.&nbsp; It al=
so means easing the financial burdens on student parents so they don=E2=80=
=99t give up on school because they can=E2=80=99t afford it.<br><br>Back in=
 Arkansas, I helped to start a scholarship for single parents, called the A=
rkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, to help defray some of the costs th=
at single parents ran into because if your childcare falls apart, you can=
=E2=80=99t go to class.&nbsp; If your old car that =E2=80=93 you=E2=80=99re=
 living out in the country and it=E2=80=99s the only way you can get to col=
lege dies, you can=E2=80=99t get there because =E2=80=93 and lots of places=
 in Arkansas, Kentucky, and elsewhere, there=E2=80=99s not a lot of mass tr=
ansit that=E2=80=99s going to get you to school.&nbsp; Right?<br><br>So we=
=E2=80=99ve got to do more.&nbsp; I=E2=80=99d like to do something similar =
to what I did in Arkansas nationwide because parents who get their degrees =
=E2=80=93 their community college degrees, their four-year degrees =E2=80=
=93 have better job options and better incomes down the road.&nbsp; So if w=
e=E2=80=99re serious about helping and supporting families, we=E2=80=99ve g=
ot to do more to support parents who are in school.<br><br>Now, every issue=
 that I=E2=80=99ve mentioned, of course, matters to women.&nbsp; But let=E2=
=80=99s remember, they matter to men, too.&nbsp; We need to help dads just =
as much as moms, and that goes for every kind of dad and every kind of mom.=
&nbsp; It shouldn=E2=80=99t be about politics.&nbsp; It should be about fam=
ilies.<br><br>Now, having said that, we are in the middle of a presidential=
 election right now, and there are real differences between what I believe,=
 what we believe, and what the presumptive Republican nominee believes beca=
use at a time when families are struggling to pay for childcare and so much=
 else, Donald Trump actually stood on a debate stage and argued that Americ=
ans are being paid too much, not too little.&nbsp; He=E2=80=99s even talkin=
g about getting rid of the federal minimum wage, leaving it totally to the =
states, to the mercy of Republican governors, who have already cut the mini=
mum wage for state workers.&nbsp; And that=E2=80=99s happened right here in=
 Kentucky.<br><br>And it=E2=80=99s troubling to me because if you=E2=80=99r=
e going to grow the economy, I think it=E2=80=99s kind of obvious you want =
people to be making money so that they can actually spend it and put it bac=
k into the economy.&nbsp; Donald Trump wants to get rid of the Affordable C=
are Act.&nbsp; Your governor is working hard to undermine what Kentucky has=
 accomplished.<br><br>So I think with somebody like Donald Trump, you would=
 see a race to the bottom across our country, with working families paying =
the price.&nbsp; And I don=E2=80=99t think that=E2=80=99s a risk we can aff=
ord.&nbsp; So we have to reject that vision and instead come up with a much=
 more positive one for families and children.<br><br>I love being here at t=
his center because I can see how patient-oriented and family-oriented you a=
re.&nbsp; And I=E2=80=99ve fought for a very long time for childcare and pa=
id leave and early learning.&nbsp; And I=E2=80=99ve done it because, obviou=
sly, I believe in it, and I=E2=80=99ve lived the work-family balancing act,=
 trying to be a good mom, trying to be a good person at work.&nbsp; But I r=
eally believe that healthy, secure families are the foundation of a strong =
economy and a strong country.<br><br>So for me, this goes way beyond the sp=
ecifics.&nbsp; And I would be so proud to be the champion of a center like =
this, or like the center I saw in Lexington, to carry your mission into the=
 White House, and try to move into the 21st century with our family and hea=
lth policies.&nbsp; I am defending the Affordable Care Act because it is wo=
rking.&nbsp; And if somebody has a better idea, of course we will listen to=
 it.&nbsp; But Kentucky did a really good job in getting people connected, =
and I met two people signing up just upstairs a few minutes ago.&nbsp; If i=
t ain=E2=80=99t broke, don=E2=80=99t mess with it.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp;<br><b=
r>And so I=E2=80=99m going to continue to speak out on behalf of the Afford=
able Care Act.&nbsp; And when people say they want to repeal it, they want =
to end it, they really can=E2=80=99t tell you what they want to do because =
what they want to do will just send us back to where we were, where we had =
so many uninsured people, so many people suffering, so many people left out=
 of the health care system.&nbsp; I think we are so much better off now tha=
n we were.&nbsp; And I know it gives a lot of peace of mind to mothers beca=
use we are the principal purchasers and motivators for health care.&nbsp; A=
ll the studies show that.&nbsp; We=E2=80=99re the ones getting the checkups=
.&nbsp; We=E2=80=99re the one urging people in the family to go to the doct=
or for X, Y, and Z.&nbsp; So we know that we need a system we can rely on.<=
br><br>And in order to have that system, we need a country that really valu=
es what you do here at the center, that is behind you all the way.&nbsp; An=
d I=E2=80=99ve always believed, as some of you know, that it takes a villag=
e to raise a child, that we have a responsibility to support each other and=
 create the best possible environment for kids to grow up so they, too, can=
 thrive.&nbsp; Because when families are strong, America is strong.&nbsp; I=
 think it=E2=80=99s really as simple as that.<br><br>And so for me, I want =
to do everything I can, working with you, visionaries who have created this=
 great comprehensive health center, to do more on behalf of all of our fami=
lies.&nbsp; So I=E2=80=99m really here to say thank you for leading the way=
.&nbsp; Thank you very much.</font><div style=3D"font-size:12.8px"><font fa=
