ROUNDUP

UPDATE

DONALD TRUMP ROUNDUP

TRUMP LAUNCHES TAX PLAN REWRITE: "Donald Trump's campaign has enlisted influential conservative economists to revise his tax package and make it more politically palatable by slashing the $10 trillion sticker price. Their main targets: Lifting the top tax rate from Trump's original plan and expanding the number of people who would have to pay taxes under it." [Politico, 5/11/16<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-taxes-tax-reform-223041>]

TRUMP SHARES HIS OPPONENT BRANDING SECRETS: "'I feel it, it's an instinct,' Trump told me over the phone. He envisions 'Crooked Hillary' as the latest triumph in a series, after 'Lyin' Ted,' 'Liddle Marco' and 'Low Energy Jeb,' the nicknames that he affixed to his vanquished Republican rivals, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. Trump has a knack for coining just the right moniker, the perfectly dismissive and catchy thing. 'It works, it flows,' Trump said, admiring his latest work." [New York Times, 5/11/16<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/09/magazine/donald-trump-shares-his-opponent-branding-secrets.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fmagazine&action=click&contentCollection=magazine&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=3&pgtype=sectionfront&_r=0>]

WILLIAM JOHNSON, A TRUMP DELEGATE, WANTS TO DEPORT ALL WITH ANY "TRACE OF NEGRO BLOOD": "William Johnson, the leader of the white supremacist American Freedom Party, is on a list of 169 delegates the Trump campaign has send to the California secretary of state... The Southern Poverty Law Center reports, 'Johnson had been advocating for the deportation of all non-white immigrants and U.S. citizens, including anyone with any 'ascertainable trace of Negro blood,' since 1985, when he wrote a book arguing for a constitutional amendment to do just that.'" [Vox, 5/10/16<http://www.vox.com/2016/5/10/11652822/donald-trump-delegate-white-nationalist>]

TRUMP CAMPAIGN CORRESPONDED WITH WHITE NATIONALIST DELEGATE LONG AFTER THE SUPPOSED "DATABASE ERROR": "Although the Trump campaign blamed a "database error" for including Johnson as a delegate, the campaign corresponded with him personally just over 24 hours ago. Trump's California delegate coordinator, Katie Lagomarsino, sent Johnson a congratulatory email on Monday, and when he asked for clarification about how to send his completed pledge form back to the campaign, she replied." [Mother Jones, 5/10/16<http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/trump-white-nationalist-california-delegate-response-email-pledge-database-error>]

TRUMP HIRES ELI MILLER AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR FINANCE OPERATION: "Donald J. Trump has hired Eli H. Miller, deputy finance director for Senator Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential bid, as the chief operating officer for his growing finance operation... Mr. Miller, who worked as a lead advance man for Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, joined Americans For Prosperity as its Ohio state director after Mr. Romney's loss, where he became close to Corey Lewandowski, who now manages the Trump campaign." [New York Times, 5/11/16<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/11/donald-trump-hires-c-o-o-for-growing-campaign-finance-operation/?_r=1http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/11/donald-trump-hires-c-o-o-for-growing-campaign-finance-operation/>]

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE "BEST PEOPLE" FOR TRUMP? "Throughout the campaign, Donald Trump boasted that he would get 'great' people, the 'best' people to work for him. As the campaign wore on, it turned out the best people did not want to work for him. He came up with a hodgepodge of under-qualified or downright flaky foreign policy advisers. The problem is that a great many qualified people do not want to work with him and certainly do not want to be his VP (e.g., South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Ohio Gov. John Kasich). Now we see just how troubling is his judgment in advisers. Corey Lewandowski, not a lawyer but someone who was charged with battery (charges later were dropped) and sought to smear the accuser, is now going to oversee the VP selection process. Do we think Lewandoswki can pick out people who are respectful of others, have high standards and would contribute something other than 'Yes, Mr. President' to the administration? Probably not."

NON-ENDORSEMENT TRACKER - CRUZ DECLINES TO ENDORSE TRUMP: "In his first interview since leaving the Republican presidential race last week, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas on Tuesday declined to throw his support behind Donald J. Trump, suggesting that he and other conservatives had plenty of time to assess their options." [New York Times, 5/10/16<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/10/ted-cruz-declines-to-support-donald-trump-and-muses-about-re-entering-race/>]

TRUMP DAILY UPDATE



Trump Convention Manager, Paul Manafort, Said Trump "Is Now The Head Of The Republican Party As Far As Voters In Country Are Concerned." MANAFORT: "Donald Trump figured out the campaign for a moderate presidency is different than in the past. He didn't put together a traditional campaign. It's the first modern campaign in the social media era. He understood how to use earned media instead of paid media. He also had a vision. He came in with plan to change everything as a true outsider. He was not involved in politics until ten months ago. He combined a modern campaign with a vision that not restricted by the conventional wisdom of politics in Washington. Those two things made a different where he will be now...He went throughout and was the largest vote getter in the history of primaries. He beat the record by May 3rd. He is now the head of the Republican Party as far as voters in country are concerned. He ran everywhere. He won everywhere." [Hardball, MSNBC, 5/10/16]



Manafort Said Trump In Person Was The "Same Guy" As "What You See On Stage." MATTHEWS: "What's he like in person compared to what he see on the stage?" MANAFORT: "He's what you see on stage." MATTHEWS: "Same guy?" MANAFORT: "Same guy." MATTHEWS: "I find him a bit subdued." MANAFORT: "Depends on the day." [Hardball, MSNBC, 5/10/16]



Manafort: "Donald Trump Understands Media. He's A Television Star." MATTHEWS: "Let's talk strategy. Let's head to the convention because it's more fun. We've had exciting conventions. '68 was a hell of a democratic convention. It didn't help the party that lost. Are boring conventions better? Can you have a positive, exciting election?"  MANAFORT: "You can have a positive, exciting convention." MATTHEWS: "How do you do that?" MANAFORT: "Donald Trump understands media. He's a television star." [Hardball, MSNBC, 5/10/16]



Manafort On Trump's Plans For The Convention: "This Is The Ultimate Reality Show. It's The Presidency Of The United States." MATTHEWS: "Let's talk strategy.

Can you have a positive, exciting election?"  MANAFORT: "You can have a positive, exciting convention." MATTHEWS: "How do you do that?" MANAFORT: "Donald Trump understands media. He's a television star." MATTHEWS: "Are you going to have features on Monday and Tuesday night? How are you going to use television when a lot of people like us use the convention. We cover it and talk amongst ourselves. How do you come up compelling television?" MANAFORT: "We're sitting down with the RNC and talk about it. We have ideas." MATTHEWS: "You'll have to break some eggs." MANAFORT: "I don't think so." MATTHEWS: "Reince Priebus will give us an exciting convention?" MANAFORT: "Donald Trump will. We will put together a program. It hasn't been put together yet." MATTHEWS: "Will you have a reality show?" MANAFORT: "This is the ultimate reality show. It's the presidency of the United States. It'll be a program where we will be talking to America, about not just Donald Trump, but the Republican Party." [Hardball, MSNBC, 5/10/16]



Trump Said Running For President "Takes Guts" And "Took A Lot Of Courage." TRUMP: "We're going to change that. We're going to change it fast. When I came down the escalator with Melania, my wife, and I came down on June 16, and I said, 'Come on, we have to do it.' If you want to see the press, see all those press right back there, it was, you have never seen, you have never seen anything like it. It looked like the Academy Awards. They were all over Trump Tower. It's not something I really wanted to do. I mean doing this takes guts, like you have, but it's a different kind of guts. I don't think I have your guts. I don't think I have that to be honest. Doing that took a lot of courage. I didn't want to. I have this great company, this great business. I have a great family. Is this hard work. I've been away for, you go away for a week, and you make three, four, or five speeches a day, sometimes, in front of massive crowds like this. The press will never report how many people there are here. It's twenty-right thousand people including outside folks, but they won't, they won't report it. They won't report it."

Trump To West Virginia Voters: "Save Your Vote. You Know, You Don't Have To Vote Anymore. Save Your Vote For The General Election, Okay? Forget This One." TRUMP: "Now, what I want you to do is save your vote. You know, you don't have to vote anymore. Save your vote for the general election, okay? Forget this one. The primary's gone. Save your vote for the general election in November. We're going to show you something, and then you're going to show me something, okay? Look at that. Okay, thank you."

Trump Said Accusations That Facebook Was Biased Against Conservative News Sources Were Terrible: "If It's True, It's Terrible." QUESTION: "A number of comments online, a lot of people are asking about your opinion regarding Facebook. If it is true that they seem to have a bias against conservatives where they intentionally suppress articles from the conservative sources." TRUMP: "Well, it's terrible. If it's true, it's terrible. I'm hearing more and more that they're doing that and, you know, they deny it or they're trying to deny it. But I have heard from many people that they're doing that. That would be terrible."

Trump Did Not Plan To Release His Tax Returns Before The November Election Because "There's Nothing To Learn From Them." "Despite pressure, the billionaire also doesn't expect to release his tax returns before November, citing an ongoing audit of his finances. He said he will release them after the audit ends. But he said that he wouldn't overrule his lawyers and instruct them to release his returns if the audit hasn't concluded by November. 'There's nothing to learn from them,' Trump told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday. He also has said he doesn't believe voters are interested." [Associated Press, 5/10/16<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ed853e2f84bd42658868a42f997c93fe/ap-interview-donald-trump-says-hes-narrowed-vp-shortlist>]



Trump Did Not Plan To Invest Heavily In A Campaign Data Operation, Saying The Obama Campaign's Use Of Data Was "Overrated." "In a break from recent major party nominees, Trump does not plan to invest heavily in a data-driven effort to court voters in the fall campaign... In the interview, Trump outlined a general election campaign that banks heavily on his personal appeal and trademark rallies while spurning the kind of sophisticated data operation that was a centerpiece of Barack Obama's winning White House runs. 'I've always felt it was overrated,' Trump said. 'Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine. And I think the same is true with me'... The businessman said he'll spend 'limited' money on data operations to identify and track potential voters and to model various turnout scenarios that could give him the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. He's moving away from the model Obama used successfully in his 2008 and 2012 wins, and which Clinton is trying to replicate, including hiring many of the staff that worked for Obama. Still, the Republican National Committee has invested heavily in data operations, eager to avoid another defeat to a more technologically savvy Democrat. Trump could make use of that RNC data if he wished."

Trump Said His Campaign Would Continue To Emphasize Free Media Coverage From Large Campaign Rallies: "My Best Investment Is My Rallies." "Trump stunned the political world at every turn during the Republican primary season, prioritizing large rallies over intimate voter interactions in early voting states and operating with a slim campaign operation. Even as he brings in new staff for the general election campaign, he says his emphasis will continue to be on raucous rallies to put him in front of thousands of voters and generate free media coverage. 'My best investment is my rallies,' Trump said. 'The people go home, they tell their friends they loved it. It's been good.'"

Trump On His Grandson Theodore: "I Can't Believe How Small They Are At That Age, But He's A Beautiful Baby." QUESTION: "Mazal tov on your grandson. I noticed that he has been named Theodore, which is also the first name of the founder of Zionism, Theodor Herzl. Do you think little Theodore is also destined for greatness?" TRUMP: "He's a great young man. He's a great guy, this little one. I can't believe how small they are at that age, but he's a beautiful baby. The name Theodore is just a name that they [Trump's daughter and son-in-law] really liked and it's probably connected to a lot of different points. But it was just a name they liked."

"'Duck Dynasty' patriarch Phil Robertson will support Donald Trump in the fall despite endorsing his rival Ted Cruz four months ago, he said Monday. The reality TV star told DailyMail.com that 'I'll be enthusiastically behind him.' 'Wow! Such a great honor to have Phil's endorsement,' the Republican front-runner responded Tuesday. 'His son, Willie, has become a great friend of my son, Don. What a great family.'

The Trump Campaign Selected Prominent White Nationalist William Johnson As A Delegate In The California Presidential Primary. "On Monday evening, California's secretary of state published a list of delegates chosen by the Trump campaign for the upcoming Republican presidential primary in the state. Trump's slate includes William Johnson, one of the country's most prominent white nationalists. Johnson applied to the Trump campaign to be a delegate. He was accepted on Monday. In order to be approved he had to sign this pledge sent to him by the campaign: 'I, William Johnson, endorse Donald J. Trump for the office of President of the United States. I pledge to cast ALL of my ballots to elect Donald J. Trump on every round of balloting at the 2016 Republican National Convention so that we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' After he signed, the Trump campaign added his name to the list of 169 delegates it forwarded to the secretary of state."

William Johnson Was The Head The American Freedom Party. "Johnson leads the American Freedom Party, a group that 'exists to represent the political interests of White Americans' and aims to preserve 'the customs and heritage of the European American people.' The AFP has never elected a candidate of its own and possesses at most a few thousand members, but it is 'arguably the most important white nationalist group in the country,' according to Mark Potok, a senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks hate groups."

After A Story Broke About The Trump Campaign Selecting A Prominent White Nationalist Leader As A California Delegate, The Trump Campaign Claimed "A Database Error Led To The Inclusion Of A Potential Delegate That Had Been Rejected And Removed From The Campaign's List In February 2016." "On Tuesday, Mother Jones broke the story that the Trump campaign had selected William Johnson, a prominent white nationalist leader, as a California delegate. The Trump campaign responded with the following statement: Yesterday the Trump campaign submitted its list of California delegates to be certified by the Secretary of State of California. A database error led to the inclusion of a potential delegate that had been rejected and removed from the campaign's list in February 2016."

The Trump Campaign Blamed A Database Error For The Inclusion Of White Nationalist William Johnson As A Delegate Even Though Trump's California Delegate Coordinator Had Personally Corresponded With Johnson Via Email The Day Before. "Although the Trump campaign blamed a 'database error' for including Johnson as a delegate, the campaign corresponded with him personally just over 24 hours ago.

White Supremacist William Johnson Remained On Trump's California Delegate Slate Because The Trump Campaign Missed The Deadline To Revise Its Delegate List.  "In a statement issued late Tuesday, Trump's campaign said Johnson's inclusion on the published list of delegates was an error. 'Upon careful review of computer records, the inclusion of a potential delegate that had previously been rejected and removed from the campaign's list in February 2016 was discovered,' Tim Clark, Trump's California campaign director, said in the statement. 'This was immediately corrected and a final list, which does not include this individual, was submitted for certification.' But state officials said the billionaire may not have any way to formally cut him from the list. Sam Mahood, a spokesman for the Secretary of State's office, said California election code deals with selection and certification of delegates, but not their removal. 'They submitted a delegate list to our office yesterday, which was the deadline,' Mahood said. 'They attempted to submit a revised list today, which we informed them we would not be accepting because it's past the deadline.'"

The Muslim ban is another thing. The fact that you didn't disavow David Duke quick enough bother him. Those are the things that Paul Ryan has issues with. Are you willing to talk about that?" TRUMP: "I disavowed Duke very rapidly and on Twitter and everything else. I can't imagine that being a problem because he was disavowed. The wall is the wall. People want the wall. Drugs are pouring into our country. You know, the wall is something that people want. And the Republican party wants, and forget about polling. I do what's right.

"Donald Trump's campaign has enlisted influential conservative economists to revise his tax package and make it more politically palatable by slashing the $10 trillion sticker price. Their main targets: Lifting the top tax rate from Trump's original plan and expanding the number of people who would have to pay taxes under it. Trump's initial proposal, rolled out with fanfare at Trump Tower in Manhattan last September, has been in the spotlight since he became the presumptive Republican nominee last week and promptly declared that it was only a starting point for any negotiations with congressional Democrats, should he become president. But it turns out Trump's team is open to revamping it far sooner than that; the campaign last month contacted at least two prominent conservative economists - Larry Kudlow, the CNBC television host, and Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation and a longtime Wall Street Journal writer - to spearhead an effort to update the package. 'What we've been trying to do is help advise him a little bit to try to reduce the cost of the plan' and still encourage economic growth, Moore said in an interview. Trump's initial plan has come under criticism from both the right and left for vastly expanding the deficit, with the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimating it would add $10 trillion to the federal deficit in the next decade. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has moved quickly to tattoo the plan's steep price tag onto Trump, with her team holding a call on Monday calling it a reckless expansion of debt."

Larry Kudlow Said Trump Was Only "Tweaking" His Initial Tax Proposal. "While Kudlow cast the changes he and Moore are recommending as 'tweaking,' what he described would have an enormous financial impact. Kudlow said they had already resubmitted their revisions to the Tax Foundation, which he said was now preliminarily estimating that the package would expand the deficit by $3.8 trillion - a roughly 60 percent cut. 'The full effect of all the things we talked about would have a very important reduction in the deficit,' Kudlow said, adding, 'The economic growth would be increased, as would jobs and wages.' Trump has not offered many policy specifics in his campaign so far but his tax package was among his most detailed. It included eliminating federal income taxes for individuals making less than $25,000 and for married couples earning below $50,000, slashing the highest income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent and cutting the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent."

Kudlow And Moore Recommended Trump Raise The Top Marginal Tax Rate From 25% To 28%. "Some of those numbers could now shift, according to Kudlow, who stressed that the proposed changes he and Moore are drafting are simply 'suggestions' for Trump. 'Mr. Trump has not signed off on any of this,' Kudlow cautioned. Among their most notable revenue-generating recommendations is raising the top tax bracket higher from the 25 percent that Trump had originally proposed to 28 percent, according to Kudlow. That would still represent a substantial tax cut for the richest Americans. Kudlow also said that the threshold for paying no income taxes could 'be lowered a bit' - Trump would take 33 million low-income Americans off the rolls entirely - from the original proposed $50,000 level for married couples. He did not specify the new threshold." [Politico, 5/11/16<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-taxes-tax-reform-223041>]



Kudlow And Moore Recommended Trump Lower The Capital Gains Tax Rate On Those Earning Over $150,000 From Trump's Proposed 20% To 15%.

It included eliminating federal income taxes for individuals making less than $25,000 and for married couples earning below $50,000, slashing the highest income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent and cutting the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.

Kudlow also said that the threshold for paying no income taxes could 'be lowered a bit' - Trump would take 33 million low-income Americans off the rolls entirely - from the original proposed $50,000 level for married couples. He did not specify the new threshold... Not every change Kudlow and Moore are drafting would result in more revenue. Kudlow said they were also suggesting that Trump keep the capital gains tax rate at 15 percent across all income levels; Trump's original plan had that rate at 20 percent for those earning more than $150,000."

Former Tax Policy Director Of Americans For Tax Reform, Ryan Ellis, Said Trump's Original Tax Plan "Drags Down The Entire Effort At Conservative Tax Reform To A Circus Level... It's Simply Not Realistic." "The group's imprint could help add credibility on the right to a revised Trump tax plan, after his original proposal came under attack from some Republicans as unrealistically large. By one measure, Trump's proposed tax cut was four times the size of George W. Bush's 2001 tax cuts. Ryan Ellis, former tax policy director for Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, said such a proposal 'drags down the entire effort at conservative tax reform to a circus level.' 'It's simply not realistic,' Ellis said. 'There's no amount of entitlement reform that can pay for that, and there's no amount of base broadening that can pay for that.'"

Revisions To Trump's Tax Plan Were Likely To Put It More In Line With The Republican Consensus On Tax Policy. "The proposed revision - reducing the overall cost to the budget, putting more people back on the income tax rolls and expanding business 'expensing' - appears to be an effort to put Trump more in line with the broader Republican consensus on tax policy. Trump has been far more reticent than most Republicans to make changes to Social Security and Medicare, the biggest entitlement programs, instead talking about cutting back on more amorphous waste and abuse that most independent analysts agree don't add up to significant savings. But Kudlow suggested there was more spending cut details on the horizon, as well. 'There would also be a spending reduction piece as part of this overall package, which, frankly, would probably slice another $2 trillion' off the federal deficit, he said."

Kudlow And Moore's Revised Plan Recommended Trump Raise His Proposed Marginal Tax Rates Across All Three Brackets. "Kudlow previously told POLITICO that the Tax Foundation gave the new package a 10-year deficit score of $3.8 trillion, down from the initial $10 trillion estimate for Trump's first plan. Cole confirmed those figures, while providing new details of the Kudlow-Moore plan that netted the big reduction. In Trump's original plan, he set three tax rates: 10 percent, 20 percent and 25 percent. (For perspective, the current top rate is 39.6 percent.) In the Kudlow-Moore draft, those would all rise, according to Cole, to 15 percent, 25 percent and 28 percent. Kudlow had previously only described raising the top rate, which Trump himself has signaled publicly he is open to. In addition, Trump's original plan required no income tax payments from individuals earning less than $25,000 and married couples earning below $50,000. Those thresholds under the Kudlow-Moore plan would drop to $10,000 and $20,000, according to Cole."

Tax Policy Center's Gleckman: "Trump Has Not Backed Away From His Basic Plan: An Enormous Tax Cut, Mostly For High-Income Households." "Critics are blasting Donald Trump for saying his tax plan would be open to negotiation should it ever get to Congress.  There are plenty of reasons to criticize the presumptive GOP presidential candidate, but a willingness to find a middle ground on an important policy issue should not be one of them. How did stating the obvious become a political sin? True, Trump has been somewhat ambiguous about what exactly he would agree to in a future congressional negotiation. But we are looking at two separate issues here: What does a politician want, and what would he settle for. I don't see what's wrong with a pol who 1) admits he isn't going to get everything he wants and 2) gives voters a better idea of where he'd be willing to cut deals. To my ear at least, Trump has not backed away from his basic plan: An enormous tax cut, mostly for high-income households. Absent details to the contrary, Trump's plan remains built on a top individual rate of 25 percent, a top business rate of 15 percent, and a top rate on investment income of 20 percent.  I have not heard him change any of that." [Tax Policy Center, 5/10/16<http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/why-criticize-what-trump-saying-about-his-tax-plan>]

Mr. Miller, who worked as a lead advance man for Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, joined Americans for Prosperity as its Ohio state director after Mr. Romney's loss, where he became close to Corey Lewandowski, who now manages the Trump campaign. Mr. Miller was spotted leaving the Republican National Committee with Mr. Lewandowski on Monday, after a day of briefings, and on Tuesday joined Steven Mnuchin, the campaign's national finance chairman, in New York at Trump Tower for a meeting with Mr. Trump himself, according to someone briefed on the discussions."

Trump Opposed Efforts By Veterans Groups To Keep GI Bill Funding From Being Moved Into Other Veterans Programs. "'I don't want to be hurting our vets,' he said. 'We treat illegal immigrants better than we treat our vets. So I'm going to do nothing to hurt our vets. I'm going to only help our vets.' He also accused Clinton of thinking that veterans 'are getting too much,' but said he did not support current efforts by veterans groups to keep GI Bill benefit funding from being moved into other veterans programs. Instead, he promised 'to bring jobs back to our country' and shifted questions to how free trade deals have hurt the American economy."

2004-2015: NBC Aired Only 15 Stories About Trump's Business Failures, As Compared To 320 Stories Promoting Him As A Businessman. "Donald Trump's rise as a presidential candidate has prompted many political observers to blame TV outlets for giving him historic amounts of free air time. While it's true the media have overwhelmingly focused on Trump in their coverage during the current election cycle, there is another media phenomenon at play. NBC has spent more than a decade building his brand as a successful businessman of almost mythic proportion. The network's coverage of Trump was overwhelmingly and consistently positive. MRC Business found only 15 stories (out of 335) on Trump's business failures, and 320 stories promoting him as a businessman, his businesses and his shows. The vast majority of stories were about the network's show The Apprentice, which featured Trump. During the period of 2004-2015, NBC had two partnerships with The Donald -- his hit reality TV show and Miss Universe, which also included Miss USA and Miss Teen USA. NBC News's Today served as a de facto PR machine for The Apprentice and its star. Today anchors interviewed fired contestants, presented Trump as 'the ultimate businessman,' and even 'fired' NBC interns on a mock Apprentice called The Intern. Today also made Trump into a career savior after his "divine intervention," as host Matt Lauer put it, allowed a scandal-plagued Miss USA to retain her crown."

NBC Failed To Disclose Its Business Relationships With Trump In Stories Critical Of His Business Failures. "NBC news failed to disclose its business relationships with Trump in stories that were critical of his business empire, and outright promoted his and his daughter's businesses on Today. With at least two joint business ventures, NBC had an obvious incentive to downplay the reality TV star's failures. NBC apparently thought it was necessary to disclose its business relationship with Trump, as it did in many stories about Miss USA. But when it came to disclosing in stories on Trump's business failures, the network missed the mark. Specifically, NBC failed to disclose in stories on Trump University, Atlantic City closings, and Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts filing for bankruptcy. The Society of Professional Journalists' Code of Ethics advises journalists to, 'Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived. Disclose unavoidable conflicts." It also encourages journalists to "explain ethical choices and processes to audiences.' NBC not only failed to disclose conflicts of interests, it flaunted them by promoting the Trumps' businesses and even broadcasting from Trump venues."

NBC Donated $500,000 To Donald Trump's Foundation And Advertised Trump Businesses. "NBC's relationship with Trump was mutually beneficial, and fraught with ethical problems. Even when the network covered The Donald's business shortcomings, NBC failed to disclose its business partnerships with him. NBC also outright advertised (complete with prices) his and his daughter Ivanka's businesses, and engaged in activities that jeopardized its credibility as an impartial news organization. For example, NBC donated more than $500,000 to Trump's foundation, and filmed episodes of Today from Trump venues."

Washington Post's Rubin: "Donald Trump Boasted That He Would Get 'Great' People, The 'Best' People To Work For Him. As The Campaign Wore On, It Turned Out The Best People Did Not Want To Work For Him." "Throughout the campaign, Donald Trump boasted that he would get 'great' people, the 'best' people to work for him. As the campaign wore on, it turned out the best people did not want to work for him. He came up with a hodgepodge of under-qualified or downright flaky foreign policy advisers. The problem is that a great many qualified people do not want to work with him and certainly do not want to be his VP (e.g., South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Ohio Gov. John Kasich). Now we see just how troubling is his judgment in advisers. Corey Lewandowski, not a lawyer but someone who was charged with battery (charges later were dropped) and sought to smear the accuser, is now going to oversee the VP selection process. Do we think Lewandoswki can pick out people who are respectful of others, have high standards and would contribute something other than 'Yes, Mr. President' to the administration? Probably not."

Washington Post's Rubin: "Trump Values Loyalty Above All, Regardless Of Experience, Competence Or Character. Imagine An Entire Administration Full Of Lewandowskis And Roger Stones." "This, you see, is one of the big problems with Trump's policy promises, including court nominees (not just the Supreme Court but also lower courts). The people around him are not equipped to put in place an administration of quality people who can shape and implement policy or vet and recommend judges. Trump values loyalty above all, regardless of experience, competence or character. Imagine an entire administration full of Lewandowskis and Roger Stones. These people will have the power of the IRS, the Justice Department, countless regulatory agencies and, of course, the armed forces. Between public servants who take themselves out of the running and qualified people dubbed to be insufficiently loyal and subservient to Trump, the quality of a Trump administration will make the Obama team look like superstars by comparison. It is, quite frankly, a recipe for corruption and self-dealing as Trump and his minions use the levers of government to reward friends and punish enemies. Some of the worst nominees will get weeded out by Congress, but many others will get rubber stamped. The White House staff, of course, is not subject to congressional confirmation (which is an excellent reason to chop it down to size)."

5/10/16: Trump Said He Had Narrowed His Vice Presidential Shortlist To "Five Or Six People" All With Significant Political Experience. "Donald Trump, the Republicans' presumptive presidential nominee, says he's narrowed his list of potential running mates to 'five or six people,' all with deep political resumes. He says he has not ruled out New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former rival who has embraced the billionaire's campaign with gusto. 'I have a list of people that I would like,' Trump said Tuesday in an interview with The Associated Press. The real estate mogul and former reality television star said he's giving special weight to political experience because he wants a vice president who can help him 'with legislation, getting things through' Washington if he wins the White House. 'We don't need another business person,' said Trump, who touts himself as one of the best in that category."

And we're going to figure out what's going on and we're going to be very, very careful. We are allowing Syrians to come in here. We have no idea who they are, we have no paperwork. There's no documentation. They're pouring into the country, our country by the thousands. You see what's happening in Germany. It's a mess. Look at Sweden and some of these other countries that are taking them and it's a total mess. And I want to be very, very careful. So I'm going to be extremely vigilant and careful... We have a president that won't even use the term radical Islamic terrorism. He won't use the term. He refuses to say the term, even after Paris where 130 people were killed or San Bernardino or any other place. He refuses -- our president refuses to discuss the term. It's a real -- it's a real problem. Not only here but throughout the world. It's a real problem. So we'll figure it out, and we will get it going. But we have to be extremely careful. In fact, I'm thinking about setting up a commission perhaps headed by Rudy Giuliani to take a very serious look at this problem. But this is a worldwide problem. And we have to be smart."

And I think the big thing is in the history of the Republican Party, nobody has ever gotten more votes than I have gotten in the primaries. I mean, I'm millions and millions of votes additional and I guess by the time we finish, it's going to be many millions of votes ahead of anybody else, any other Republican in the primaries. That's a big thing. Plus, a lot of people, a lot more people came out to vote this year in the primaries than they did four years ago or at any other time. So, I think that's a great sign. And, you know, we are doing very well in the polls." O'REILLY: "Ok, but he knows all that. So you are not going to go in and tell him stuff he knows.

The Trump Campaign Said The Gender Gap Was "A Myth" And The Real Gender Gap Was Hillary Clinton's Deficit With Male Voters. "What's Donald Trump's strategy on attacking Hillary Clinton for her husband's infidelities? MSNBC's Katy Tur reports that it's about getting voters to question her character. Trump's team argues 'character' is Clinton's biggest weakness. By calling her an enabler, Trump's team is trying to solidify the idea that Clinton is inherently a untrustworthy, if not an outright bad, person. Trump's team also does not agree there is a gender gap. 'It's a myth' the aide said. The real gender gap, according to them, is Hillary with men. The campaign also isn't worried about Clinton or her surrogates bringing up Trump's Howard Stern interviews where he brags about cheating. 'He's Teflon. We won't deny it. But he'll have fun with it probably.'" [NBC News, 5/11/16<http://www.nbcnews.com/card/trump-vs-clinton-strategy-n572056>]

Trump Said He May Not Run Negative Ads Against Hillary Clinton Because "I Just Don't Find Them To Be Very Effective." "Trump and his aides have been meeting RNC officials this week to discuss the mechanics of his campaign. He is also planning a trip to Washington on Thursday to meet party leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who have had a mixed reaction to his primary success. Though Trump has vowed to be tough in taking on Clinton, he also suggested he might avoid running negative ads against her, saying, 'I just don't find them to be very effective.' 'I've had over $100 million in negative ads spent on me and every time it's boosted my numbers,' he said."

Bernie Sanders



Trump: "I Call Him Crazy Bernie Because He's Not Very Good. But Probably Beating Him Would Be Easier. Who's Going To Run Against The Socialist And Lose? He's A Socialist. You're Going To Pay 95% Tax." TRUMP: "Well, everything really about Hillary is rigged. She looks like she'll be able to run, that sounds to me like, you know -- how can she run after what she's done with the e-mails? That seems rigged. It's a horrible thing. And the election, every time you see it, you know, I call him crazy Bernie because he's not very good. But probably beating him would be easier. Who's going to run against the socialist and lose? He's a socialist. You're going to pay 95% tax. I'd love to run against him in one way. But there's something about running against Hillary." [Fox & Friends, Fox News, 5/11/16]

Trump, Asked Whether He Would Appoint A Supreme Court Justice Who Would Overturn Roe V. Wade, Said "Well, Overturn Or -- Look, I'm Going To Put Conservative Judges On." O'REILLY: "'Donald Trump says he is pro-life. Please ask him to name one specific thing he would do to protect the sanctity of human life.' Can you?"

But I become pro- life. And the reason is, I have seen, in my case one specific situation, but numerous situations that have made me to go that way. I will protect it and the biggest way you can protect it is through the Supreme Court and putting people in the court. And actually the biggest way you can protect it, I guess, is by electing me president." O'REILLY: "All right. So, you are going to get a judge who would overthrow -- overturn Roe v. Wade?

I think one of the biggest things happening in terms of this election are, you know, it could be as many as five judges will be appointed over the next four and a half years. So we're talking about five judges. And I think probably the most important thing that one of the most important thing, other than the security itself of the country is going to be the appointment of four to five Supreme Court justices and I will be doing that." O'REILLY: "All right. So, let me just get this straight. So that Diane's question is answered.

TRUMP: "Well, they will be pro-life and we will see what about overturning. But we will appoint -- I will appoint judges that will be pro-life, yes." [O'Reilly Factor, Fox News, 5/10/16]

Trump Said President Obama Should Not Apologize For The Hiroshima Bombing. IMUS: "Obama is going to Hiroshima today... He also has to not apologize for Hiroshima. What do you think he should do?" TRUMP: "Well, number one, he should not apologize. It was a war--" IMUS: "I don't he's going to." TRUMP: "Well I hope he doesn't. He shouldn't.

HEADLINE: "'An Inane Jumble': Trump Foreign Policy Splits GOP On Issue Party Once Agreed On." [The Guardian, 5/11/16<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/11/trump-foreign-policy-national-security-defense-spending>]



Trump's National Security Chairman, Jeff Sessions, Said Trump Was Surrounding Himself With Prominent National Security Advisors Whose Advice Would Push Trump More Toward Republican Orthodoxy. "Senator Jeff Sessions, a Trump surrogate who sits on the Senate armed services committee, sought to downplay some of the billionaire's more outlandish comments on torture and targeting the families of terrorists. 'He has a foreign policy that's more realistic,' Sessions said. 'It's one that's a little more cautious in assuming how much we can accomplish by using military force. But when we're clearly threatened, he's made it quite clear that he will react strongly and vigorously.' He added that Trump was in the process of surrounding himself with prominent national security advisers whose advice would help to inform defense priorities more in step with Republican orthodoxy. Yet there are many in Republican defense circles who have shown reluctance or refusal to advise Trump, and more who are withholding their support for his campaign."

The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first. Has to be. That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make. America-- America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration."

Trump To An Israeli Journalist: "You Are The First Person To Ever Tell Me That I Have Critics In Israel." QUESTION: "The people of Israel consider themselves to be America's strong allies. Some of your critics, even in Israel, claim that you would be bad for Israel because you have said that America's allies should pay back the military aid they receive. Can you assure us that Israel will be treated differently if you are elected president?" TRUMP: "You are the first person to ever tell me that I have critics in Israel. I have such great support in Israel. I did a campaign commercial for Bibi [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu]. We are going to protect Israel. Don't forget, Israel is our great bastion of hope in that region so Israel is very important." [Israel Hayom, 5/11/16<http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=33659>]

 at $25,000 for individuals and $50,000 for married couples. Kudlow had previously outlined the other changes, which include allowing businesses to itemize certain expenses and reducing the top rate in Trump&#8217;s original plan on capital gains from 20 percent
 to 15 percent. Cole said the Kudlow-Moore plan he scored would add $3.8 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade using so-called &#8216;dynamic&#8217; scoring that includes projected economic growth. The 10-year deficit score not factoring in such growth is

 it ever get to Congress.&nbsp; There are plenty of reasons to criticize the presumptive GOP presidential candidate, but a willingness to find a middle ground on an important policy issue should not be one of them. How did stating the obvious become a political
 sin? True, Trump has been somewhat ambiguous about what exactly he would agree to in a future congressional negotiation. But we are looking at two separate issues here: What does a politician want, and what would he settle for. I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s wrong with
 a pol who 1) admits he isn&#8217;t going to get everything he wants and 2) gives voters a better idea of where he&#8217;d be willing to cut deals. To my ear at least, Trump has not backed away from his basic plan: An enormous tax cut, mostly for high-income households.
 Absent details to the contrary, Trump&#8217;s plan remains built on a top individual rate of 25 percent, a top business rate of 15 percent, and a top rate on investment income of 20 percent.&nbsp; I have not heard him change any of that.&#8221; [Tax Policy Center,

<p class="DNCBullet"><b>2004-2015: NBC Aired Only 15 Stories About Trump&#8217;s Business Failures, As Compared To 320 Stories Promoting Him As A Businessman.</b> &#8220;Donald Trump&#8217;s rise as a presidential candidate has prompted many political observers to blame TV outlets
 for giving him historic amounts of free air time. While it&#8217;s true the media have overwhelmingly focused on Trump in their coverage during the current election cycle, there is another media phenomenon at play. NBC has spent more than a decade building his brand
 as a successful businessman of almost mythic proportion. The network&#8217;s coverage of Trump was overwhelmingly and consistently positive. MRC Business found only 15 stories (out of 335) on Trump&#8217;s business failures, and 320 stories promoting him as a businessman,
 his businesses and his shows. The vast majority of stories were about the network&#8217;s show The Apprentice, which featured Trump. During the period of 2004-2015, NBC had two partnerships with The Donald -- his hit reality TV show and Miss Universe, which also
 included Miss USA and Miss Teen USA. NBC News&#8217;s Today served as a de facto PR machine for The Apprentice and its star. Today anchors interviewed fired contestants, presented Trump as &#8216;the ultimate businessman,&#8217; and even &#8216;fired&#8217; NBC interns on a mock Apprentice
 called The Intern. Today also made Trump into a career savior after his &#8220;divine intervention,&#8221; as host Matt Lauer put it, allowed a scandal-plagued Miss USA to retain her crown.&#8221; [MRC Business,

 outright promoted his and his daughter&#8217;s businesses on Today. With at least two joint business ventures, NBC had an obvious incentive to downplay the reality TV star&#8217;s failures. NBC apparently thought it was necessary to disclose its business relationship
 with Trump, as it did in many stories about Miss USA. But when it came to disclosing in stories on Trump&#8217;s business failures, the network missed the mark. Specifically, NBC failed to disclose in stories on Trump University, Atlantic City closings, and Trump
 Hotels and Casino Resorts filing for bankruptcy. The Society of Professional Journalists&#8217; Code of Ethics advises journalists to, &#8216;Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived. Disclose unavoidable conflicts.&#8221; It also encourages journalists to &#8220;explain ethical
 choices and processes to audiences.&#8217; NBC not only failed to disclose conflicts of interests, it flaunted them by promoting the Trumps&#8217; businesses and even broadcasting from Trump venues.&#8221; [MRC Business,

 NBC failed to disclose its business partnerships with him. NBC also outright advertised (complete with prices) his and his daughter Ivanka&#8217;s businesses, and engaged in activities that jeopardized its credibility as an impartial news organization. For example,
 NBC donated more than $500,000 to Trump&#8217;s foundation, and filmed episodes of Today from Trump venues.&#8221; [MRC Business,

 Trump values loyalty above all, regardless of experience, competence or character. Imagine an entire administration full of Lewandowskis and Roger Stones. These people will have the power of the IRS, the Justice Department, countless regulatory agencies and,
 of course, the armed forces. Between public servants who take themselves out of the running and qualified people dubbed to be insufficiently loyal and subservient to Trump, the quality of a Trump administration will make the Obama team look like superstars
 by comparison. It is, quite frankly, a recipe for corruption and self-dealing as Trump and his minions use the levers of government to reward friends and punish enemies. Some of the worst nominees will get weeded out by Congress, but many others will get rubber
 stamped. The White House staff, of course, is not subject to congressional confirmation (which is an excellent reason to chop it down to size).&#8221; [Jennifer Rubin, Washington Post,
