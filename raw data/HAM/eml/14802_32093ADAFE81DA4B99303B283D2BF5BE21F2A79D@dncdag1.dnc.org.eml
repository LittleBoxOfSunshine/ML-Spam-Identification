Jeb Bush=92s Claim That Blacks Want =91Free Stuff=92 for Votes Insults Our =
Dignity and History of Struggle<http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/20=
15/09/jeb_bush_saying_blacks_want_free_stuff_for_votes_insults_our_dignity_=
and.html>
THE ROOT // PENIEL E. JOSEPH

Jeb Bush=92s recent comments in South Carolina about black people voting fo=
r Democrats who promise them =93free stuff=94 during election season is a p=
owerful reminder that a leading Republican presidential candidate is woeful=
ly ignorant about contemporary race relations and the history that=92s shap=
ed the racial-justice struggle.

Ironically, the former governor of Florida=92s statement echoed Mitt Romney=
=92s infamous remarks about the 47 percent of Americans who longed for gove=
rnment handouts, said while discussing minority-voter outreach and the Repu=
blican Party.

During an interview with Fox News Sunday, Bush doubled down on his comments=
. =93We need to make our case to African-American voters and to all voters =
that an aspiration message fixing a few complex things will allow people to=
 rise up,=94 explained the Republican presidential hopeful. =93That=92s wha=
t people want. They don=92t want free stuff. That was my point.=94

Bush=92s demonization of African Americans as a group whose loyalty to the =
Democratic Party has been purchased via big government spending continues t=
he Republican assault on black dignity and citizenship, a struggle marked b=
y contemporary voting-rights battles taking place across the nation.

Black Americans have been the hardest-working and least-rewarded group in A=
merican history. African-American rates of employment, income and wealth pa=
le in comparison to those of whites, the result of a long and continuous hi=
story of institutional racism that Bush simply ignores.

Racial insensitivity is a Bush family trait. George H.W. Bush, the 41st pre=
sident, defeated Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in 1988 by running the =
infamous Willie Horton ads that played upon national fears of black crimina=
lity and racial violence.

George W. Bush=92s halting response to Hurricane Katrina inspired widesprea=
d criticism punctuated by Kanye West=92s famous assertion that =93George Bu=
sh doesn=92t care about black people.=94

Neither does his younger brother, apparently.

The most offensive part of Jeb Bush=92s statement is that it=92s rooted in =
a racist mythology about black folks that ignores our national history. Unp=
aid black labor literally built American and global capitalism. Slavery pro=
duced undreamed-of wealth that helped propel American financial, industrial=
 and political institutions into undreamed-of power and privilege. African =
Americans were repaid for centuries of chattel slavery with Jim Crow segreg=
ation, lynching, imprisonment and poverty.

Jeb Bush=92s statement perpetuates this tragic history through willful igno=
rance that casts black folks as an ignorant and lazy mass of people who are=
 dependent on government largesse for their existence.

Bush and other Republican presidential hopefuls who=92ve embraced a toxic m=
essage of racial intolerance robust enough to make Tea Party advocates and =
Birthers proud have touted this false narrative.

Such comments also serve as coded messages to white voters convinced that P=
resident Barack Obama=92s entire presidency has both been illegitimate (by =
virtue of his supposedly being born in Kenya) and unfairly discriminated ag=
ainst the white populace by giving black folks special treatment.

The Republican Party=92s political extremism and racial blinders have becom=
e mainstream enough that Jeb Bush=97who opposes immigration reform and the =
Affordable Care Act=97is considered a political moderate. This tragedy turn=
s into farce when these same advocates of anti-black and anti-poor public p=
olicy claim to want to be =93inclusive=94 and reach out to racial minoritie=
s.

Contemporary struggles for civil rights have reached a fever pitch in the c=
ountry, highlighted by national movements to end racial oppression in the c=
riminal-justice system, housing, public schools and all sectors of American=
 society. This is the reality that black people live with every day and one=
 that Jeb Bush has yet to encounter.
