Just a couple of tweaks. Changed a "their" to "its" in reference to the Rep=
ublican Party. Changed he word "voters" to "people."

DNC Chair Wasserman Schultz=92s Statement on Governor Kasich=92s Announceme=
nt that he is Suspending his Campaign for President

=93With Governor Kasich out of the race, any remaining hope the GOP had of =
concealing its true colors behind his comparatively friendly-faced candidac=
y has evaporated. But make no mistake, the extreme policies he has long fou=
ght for are virtually indistinguishable from those of Donald Trump, Ted Cru=
z, and the rest of the modern Republican Party.

[Two examples of shitty things he did as governor]

=93For years, Republican leaders have employed a cynical, divisive politica=
l strategy to compel people to vote out of distrust, suspicion and hate =96=
 rewarding those at the top and denigrating women, minorities, the LGBT com=
munity and more in the process. The result is the cynical, divided, bickeri=
ng Republican base we see now. Today, the only energy left in the Republica=
n primary isn=92t for anything, and their final contest is already shaping =
up to be a bitter, petty battle with one camp against Trump, and the other =
against Cruz.

=93The contrast couldn=92t be more stark. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sander=
s are fighting for the American people =96 for higher wages, for more oppor=
tunity, for a level playing field and for a brighter future. That=92s why O=
ur voters are energized, enthusiastic, and optimistic because our candidate=
