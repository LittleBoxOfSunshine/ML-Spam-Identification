NEW Poll: Majority of Iowa Voters Oppose Sen. Grassley=92s Supreme Court Ob=
structionism
Voters Support A Hearing & A Vote for Judge Garland; Grassley=92s Refusal t=
o Do His Job Could Swing Key Constituencies in the Iowa Senate Race


Washington, DC =96 Today, the Constitutional Responsibility Project, in con=
junction with the League of Conservation Voters, released a new survey of I=
owa voters conducted by Hart Research Associates. Findings confirm that a m=
ajority of Iowa voters support giving Chief Judge Garland a fair hearing an=
d an up-or-down vote and believe that Sen. Grassley is playing partisan pol=
itics by refusing to allow the Senate Judiciary Committee to take action on=
 Chief Judge Garland=92s nomination. Both undecided voters and one in five =
voters who otherwise might be inclined to support Grassley indicate that th=
is issue could drive them to not vote for Senator Grassley in the November =
general election.



A full memo from Hart Research Associates outlining the survey=92s findings=
 can be found HERE<http://weneednine.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Me-WN9-=
IA.pdf>.



Key findings from the Constitutional Responsibility Project and the League =
of Conservation Voters survey include:



  *   By a margin of 57 percent to 35 percent, Iowa voters say the Senate s=
hould hold hearings and give Chief Judge Garland an up-or-down-vote.
  *   When told about Senator Grassley=92s position on not allowing a heari=
ng for Chief Judge Garland, 55 percent of voters have a negative reaction. =
59 percent of independents view Senator Grassley=92s position negatively.
  *   60 percent of voters, including 63 percent of independents, agree wit=
h the conclusion that Senator Grassley is letting Senate Majority Leader Mi=
tch McConnell dictate the Senate Republican position on Chief Judge Garland=
=92s nomination, rather than acting as a leader as chairman of the Judiciar=
y Committee.
  *   44 percent of all Iowa voters said they are less likely to support Se=
nator Grassley in his re-election bid this year as a result of his position=
 to not grant Chief Judge Garland a fair hearing.
  *   One in five voters who otherwise might be inclined to support Grassle=
y indicates that this issue could drive them away from him, and half of und=
ecided voters also say this issue would make them less likely to be with Gr=
assley in November.


"Senator Grassley is the poster child for the Republican Senate that refuse=
s to do its job. Republicans left town for another recess without doing any=
thing on scores of important issues including Judge Merrick Garland's nomin=
ation to the Supreme Court,=94 said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-=
NV). =93The Senate is on pace for the lightest work schedule in 60 years. C=
hairman Grassley's Judiciary Committee has been the least productive Judici=
ary Committee in six decades. By refusing to do their job, Republicans are =
showing the American people that they are the party of gridlock and obstruc=
tion."



=93I have been conducting polls in Iowa for numerous years, and it is telli=
ng that Sen. Grassley=92s favorability ratings have fallen steeply from whe=
re they were in the past, likely in large part due to his refusal to allow =
for a fair hearing and vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee,=94 said Geof=
f Garin, President of Hart Research Associates. =93Voters understand that t=
his is not a value driven decision, instead it is pure politics, plain and =
simple. With independent voters turned off by Senator Grassley playing poli=
tics as usual, key portions of the electorate indicated that may be incline=
d to vote against Sen. Grassley come November.=94



=93The Court truly plays a significant role in the lives of everyday Americ=
ans, including our right to breathe clean air, to drink clean water and to =
leave our children with a healthy planet. Iowans understand the importance =
of filling this vacancy, and Judge Garland is impeccably qualified,=94 said=
 Tiernan Sittenfeld, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs, League of=
 Conservation Voters. =93It is long past time for Senator Grassley along wi=
th other Senate Republican leaders to stop obstructing and to do their job.=
=94



=93In the two and a half months since Republican Senators made it clear tha=
t they were going to refuse to do their job for any Supreme Court nominee, =
public support for their position continues to erode. Voters know that Sen.=
 Grassley is choosing to turn his back on the Iowa way and instead blindly =
follow Republican leadership =96 even when it leads to gridlock in Washingt=
on,=94 said Stephanie Cutter of the Constitutional Responsibility Project. =
=93The Constitutional Responsibility Project, along with key coalition memb=
ers, will continue to hammer home in Iowa this recess that it is time for S=
en. Chuck Grassley to listen to his constituents and fly back to Washington=
 to allow for a fair hearing for Chief Judge Garland.=94



From April 22 to 24, 2016, Hart Research Associates conducted telephone int=
erviews with a representative cross section of 400 Iowa voters and 101 addi=
tional swing voters in the state. The partisan composition of the total wei=
ghted sample of 501 respondents is 33% Democratic and 35% Republican.
