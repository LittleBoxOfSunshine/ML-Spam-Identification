THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release May 12, 2016





PRESS BRIEFING

BY PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST



James S. Brady Press Briefing Room=20







1:06 P.M. EDT



 MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I do not have any announcements =
at the top, so we can go straight to questions for maximum efficiency tod=
ay. Kevin, do you want to start?



 Q Sure. Thank you, Josh. So a U.S. District Court judge has ruled today =
that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally making payments to in=
surers covering reductions for certain enrollees. I wanted to ask how pro=
blematic is this ruling for the health insurance program overall. And wha=
t are the ramifications for plans and consumers if this stands?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, this is not the first time that we've seen opp=
onents of the Affordable Care Act go through the motions to try to win th=
is political fight in the court system. There are a couple of things that=
 are unprecedented about this effort, though. This suit represents the fi=
rst time in our nation's history that Congress has been permitted to sue =
the executive branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute=
. There have obviously been significant differences between the executive=
 branch and Congress recently. But these are the kinds of political dispu=
tes that characterize a democracy. And it's unfortunate that Republicans =
have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to refight a political fight t=
hat they keep losing. They've been losing this fight for six years. And t=
hey'll lose it again.



 Q Will the administration appeal the ruling? And secondly, if this does =
go through, what are the ramifications? Will insurers be leaving the prog=
ram? Will this have an impact on the price for consumers?



 MR. EARNEST: My colleagues at the Department of Justice obviously just s=
tarted reviewing the ruling because it was just handed down a few minutes=
 ago. So any sort of formal announcement about an intent to appeal will b=
e announced from the Department of Justice. But we are quite confident in=
 the power of the legal arguments that we're able to make here. But any s=
ort of formal announcement about an appeal will come from the Department =
of Justice. And I have not heard at this point any sort of analysis about=
 the potential impact of a legal outcome consistent with this decision.



 Q The Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee ha=
s invited Ben Rhodes to testify at a hearing on the Iran nuclear deal. Is=
 this an invitation that the White House has to accept or reject?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, with all due respect to the Chairman, if he has an in=
terest in a hearing about false narratives as it relates to the Iran deal=
, then I've got some suggestions for people that they should swear in. In=
 fact, some members of the committee actually may have some light to shed=
 on this. Congressman Ken Buck from Colorado promised in August of 2015 t=
hat Iran would get $100 billion to $200 billion in sanctions relief. Cong=
ressman Buck is either wrong or lying, and he can discuss that with the c=
ommittee. He's a member of the committee, so presumably he knows where th=
e hearing room is, so he can just show up at the appointed time and expla=
in his false declaration.



 Paul Gosar -- I assume I'm pronouncing that correctly -- he was quoted i=
n September of 2015, saying that this would provide immediate access to a=
pproximately $100 billion. Again, we now know -- we can verify that's not=
 true. So again, I dont know if Mr. Gosar was just wildly misinformed or =
was lying to the American public. But presumably, if he feels so strongly=
 about this issue, he can explain himself under oath before the committee=
. He serves on the committee, too, so it shouldnt be too hard to arrange =
his schedule.



 Cynthia Lummis, congresswoman -- she explained that, in September of 201=
5, she claimed that the proposed deal "will lead to a nuclear-armed Iran.=
" That, of course, has not turned out to be true. And, in fact, we can ve=
rify that that is false. So Congresswoman Lummis serves on the committee.=
 Why dont we swear her in and explain where she got this information. And=
 she can explain whether she was just wrong or lying. She may also explai=
n why she continues to make this argument.



 I dont know what the protocol is for swearing in members of the United S=
tates Senate to participate in these kinds of hearings, but there are any=
 number of senators who could participate. Senator Cruz could certainly p=
articipate. He claimed, in August of 2015, over $100 billion will flow in=
to Iran as a result of the deal. We've got Senator Tom Cotton, who I know=
 has a special relationship with the Supreme Leader, so maybe he's got so=
me interesting insight into the deal that he would like to share with the=
 committee. He said that the deal "gives them" -- meaning, Iran -- "$150 =
billion of sanctions relief." Not true. Senator Cotton, wildly wrong or l=
ying. And so let's have Chairman Chaffetz get to the bottom of this. Mayb=
e the American people do want to actually understand the Republican false=
 narrative about the Iran deal. So we would welcome the opportunity for t=
hose members of Congress to explain themselves.



 The truth is, what the administration has said about the Iran deal, what=
 Mr. Rhodes has said about the Iran deal, what the President of the Unite=
d States has said about the Iran deal has come true. Our critics said tha=
t Iran would never go along with an agreement. They did. They signed on t=
he dotted line. Our critics said that there would never be a way to verif=
y that Iran would live up to the terms of the agreement. We know they did=
. International, impartial inspectors did exactly that, and they were giv=
en the access that they needed to confirm that Iran had lived up to their=
 end of the bargain. And our critics said -- and I just recited many of t=
hem -- that Iran would get, as Steve Scalise, who could also testify, sai=
d that Iran would get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief=
. That's false. That's not true. Even Iran says that that's not true. In =
fact, they're saying that they are hoping that they can get access to mor=
e money.

=20

 So again, I dont know whether our critics were just wildly misinformed, =
mistaken, or lying. But if Republicans are interested in getting to the b=
ottom of this, then they should just swear in some members of their own c=
onference and figure it out.



 Q So I take that as a no. (Laughter.)=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are some people who have some explainin=
g to do when it comes to the wildly false accusations that they made abou=
t the Iran deal. And it's not the administration; it's Republicans who ar=
e demonstrably wrong when it comes to the Iran deal. So we'll look at the=
 letter, but I assume that -- if Congressman Chaffetz is actually interes=
ted in getting to the bottom of this deal, then I assume that similar let=
ters were received through the interoffice mail in the House of Represent=
atives.



 Q Just one quick follow-up on that. You've taken issue with the more tha=
n -- the predictions of more than $100 billion in sanctions relief. Do yo=
u know how much has actually resulted in --



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we know it's a whole lot less than that. What we had =
said in the context of the deal before it went through, that the kind of =
benefit that Iran was likely to enjoy was something around $50 billion, b=
ut even a significant chunk of that money was committed to repaying debts=
 that Iran owed. That's why you saw Iran's central bank governor come out=
 and indicate that their expectations about the amount of sanctions relie=
f that they would receive was around $30 billion. I dont have an updated =
assessment to share in terms of the amount that they have actually receiv=
ed, but it is by all accounts far less than the false criticism that was =
put forward by Republicans.



 Tim.



 Q Any reaction now that Rousseff in Brazil has been suspended by the sen=
ate?=20



 MR. EARNEST: Not any one that's different than I've shared from here a c=
ouple of times. This is an outcome that many observers expected. And the =
President does continue to have confidence in the durability of Brazil's =
democratic institutions to withstand the political turmoil there.



 Q Anyone in the White House reaching out to the acting President?



 MR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any calls that have been placed by the Whi=
te House to the acting President's office. But you might check with the S=
tate Department to see if there have been any sort of diplomatic conversa=
tions.

=20

 Q And on the global steel glut that President Obama spoke about with Aus=
tralia PM Turnbull, as the readout said last night. We saw the comments f=
rom USTR and Penny Pritzker last month, but does this suggest that there =
is some new White House initiative that might be going on? A broader init=
iative to tackle the glut?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what both Ambassador Froman and Secretary Pri=
tzker made clear in those statements is that the United States is working=
 both bilaterally and through multilateral institutions, including the OE=
CD, to build a policy consensus on addressing the excess capacity in the =
steel market and some other industries as well.=20



 So we're going to continue to pursue vigorous international engagement a=
s part of a broader effort that includes aggressive enforcement right her=
e at home. So, for instance, the United States government has initiated a=
n historic number of trade remedy proceedings in 2015, assessing more tha=
n $45 million in penalties on importers of steel products for violating t=
heir obligation to pay anti-dumping and countervailing duties.



 So the enforcement of these rules is something that the administration t=
akes quite seriously, and it's also an important part of our foreign poli=
cy. So when President Obama is on the phone with world leaders, including=
 the leader of Australia, we're talking about a range of issues. We're ta=
lking about important national security issues; we're talking about broad=
er economic issues; but we're also talking about the importance of addres=
sing something as technical as excess capacity in steel.



 And so I think those who follow this issue closely will recognize that t=
hat's not a particularly surprising development. But for those who don't,=
 this should be a revealing look at the priority that the President place=
s on enforcing trade agreements.



 Q Also, Prime Minister Turnbull told the press in Australia that Obama a=
dvised him that the new time frame for TPP would be at the end of the yea=
r, after the elections. And that sort of contradicts what President Obama=
 said in Germany. He said he thought it could be done after the primaries=
. So does the White House see the new congressional window for TPP is in =
doubt in the lame duck?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any more information to share about the =
conversation between Prime Minister Turnbull and President Obama. Our vie=
w is that Congress should act as quickly as possible to implement this ag=
reement; that delaying the implementation of the agreement only puts off =
the significant benefits that American businesses and American workers ca=
n enjoy as a result of the agreement.



 For example, once this deal is implemented, we'll conduct the work of cu=
tting 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American goods. So the =
longer that Congress delays the implementation of the TPP the longer Amer=
ican businesses and American goods will be subject to these 18,000 taxes =
that other countries impose on American products.



 So the good news is that many Republicans on Capitol Hill share the Pres=
idents view that cutting those taxes would be good for the American econo=
my and theyd be good for American businesses and it would be good for Ame=
rican workers. So we're going to work with those Republicans to identify =
the most expeditious timeframe possible for Congress to do the work that'=
s necessary to implement this agreement.



 Jordan.



 Q Thanks, Josh. I want to ask about Merrick Garlands upcoming speech at =
a high school commencement. This is a little bit unusual for a Supreme Co=
urt nominee. And I'm wondering if hes going to be specifically addressing=
 the nomination fight during his speech to students.



 MR. EARNEST: He will not, Jordan. He will be specifically addressing the=
 class of 2016 at Niles West. Obviously, he is an alum of that fine insti=
tution, and he was invited by the principal of the school to deliver the =
commencement address. And obviously that community, and that high school =
in particular, is quite proud of the accomplishments of what probably is =
now their most famous graduate. And so it seemed like a good opportunity =
for him to address the class of 2016.



 I had an opportunity to talk to him about this a couple of weeks ago, an=
d I know that hes very much looking forward to going back and reliving so=
me old high school memories, but also having an opportunity hopefully to =
impart some wisdom and inspiration to the class of 2016.



 Q Any more details on the subjects hes going to speak about during that?=




 MR. EARNEST: No, youll have to show up and find out. It should be fun.



 Racquel.



 Q Thank you, Josh. So President Dilma, as was mentioned before, she was =
suspended from office for the duration of her impeachment trial. Michel T=
emer, who was her Vice President, became now the acting President with au=
thority to appoint ministers and enact policies. How does the U.S. govern=
ment view this impeachment process? And also, what does the White House e=
xpect from this new government? Will President Obama call the acting Pres=
ident, Michel Temer?



 MR. EARNEST: Im not aware of any planned calls, but if a call like that =
were to take place, we would certainly let you know. As a government, we =
intend to respect the government institutions and traditions and procedur=
es that the Brazilian government follows for governing that country. That=
s what we would expect other countries to do when theyre observing our le=
gislative process, for example. All too often, a legislative process here=
 in the United States doesnt work nearly as rapidly as we would like, and=
 there may be other countries who get a little frustrated about that kind=
 of inaction. But we assured them, invariably, that the President is pret=
ty frustrated by how slow that process works as well. But our expectation=
 is that were going to follow the rules and laws and institutions of the =
United States government in handling the affairs of the United States. An=
d we certainly are going to respect the Brazilian government as they foll=
ow the rules and traditions for governing their country, and thats what w=
ell do.



 Q One more question. The White House says Brazil has a mature democracy,=
 and today the suspended President, Dilma Rousseff, said that Brazil has =
a young democracy and called it a coup. Does the government, the U.S. gov=
ernment have any concern that this impeachment process is following the B=
razilian laws?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, Im certainly no expert on the Brazilian constitution,=
 but our expectation is that the institutions of the Brazilian government=
 that have been built up over the last few decades are sufficiently matur=
e and durable to withstand the political turmoil that that country is fac=
ing right now. And that is not to downplay the obvious significance of th=
e events of the last few weeks, but it is an effort to convey to the Braz=
ilian government and to the Brazilian people that the United States value=
s the important relationship that our two countries have. We cooperate on=
 a wide range of issues, and the President had the opportunity to visit B=
razil in his first term, and that was an opportunity for him to state aff=
irmatively, early in his presidency, about the importance of the relation=
ship between our two countries. That, of course, was renewed when Preside=
nt Rousseff visited the White House not too long ago.



 So the United States will stand with Brazil, even through these challeng=
ing times, and we continue to have confidence in the capacity of the gove=
rnment to rely on their well-established traditions and laws to manage th=
eir way through this challenging time for their countrys politics.



 James. Nice to see you today. Its been a little while.



 Q Likewise. Yes, sir. Three subjects I want to cover, very quickly on ea=
ch one.=20



First, the remarks this week by the FBI Director, James Comey, in a brief=
ing to reporters at the Bureau, in which he once again described what he =
has alternately termed the Ferguson effect and the viral video effect. Pr=
eviously, when he discussed those matters, it led to direct rebuke from t=
he White House, both from this podium and you, and from the President him=
self. But the FBI Director appears to be doubling down on those comments =
in his most recent statement to reporters saying -- and I quote, Theres a=
 perception that police are less likely to do the marginal, additional po=
licing that suppresses crime -- the getting out of your car at two in the=
 morning and saying to a group of guys, hey, what are you doing here? I t=
ake it that in the time since this was last an issue between the White Ho=
use and Director Comey in October and November of last year, nothing has =
arisen in crime statistics or any other external phenomena to cause the W=
hite House to now side with Director Comey in interpreting these events.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, James, I anticipated that somebody might ask this que=
stion today. I think its certainly a relevant one, and I had an opportuni=
ty to talk to the President about it a little bit this morning.



 So what I can tell you is that we have observed over the last year or so=
 an uptick, in some communities across the country, in violent crime rate=
s. And thats a source of some concern. And last year when this potential =
trend was first noticed, the President tasked his Attorney General with s=
upporting the law enforcement agencies in those communities to help them =
confront the challenge of fighting that potential increase in violent cri=
me.=20



And there are a number of steps that the Department of Justice has taken.=
 Earlier this spring, the Department of Justice announced that the U.S. M=
arshals Service had conducted a high-impact national fugitive apprehensio=
n initiative that was focused on the countrys most violent offenders. And=
 that six-week initiative resulted in the arrest of more than 8,000 gang =
members, sex offenders, and other violent criminals. That is an indicatio=
n of the important role that federal law enforcement can play in supporti=
ng the work of local law enforcement in these communities.



 Whats also true, though, is that, more broadly, crime rates across the c=
ountry remain at or near historic lows. So the challenge for the Departme=
nt of Justice has been to try to focus on those communities where the upt=
ick has been noticed and try to blunt the impact of that.



 Now, as it relates to getting to the undermining cause of those upticks =
in violence, there still is no evidence to substantiate the claim that th=
e increase in violent crime is related to an unwillingness of police offi=
cers to do their job. And I know that this is an observation that the Fra=
ternal Order of Police has made in indicating that they dont believe that=
 their members are afraid to get out of their cars and do their jobs.



 And so the Presidents point is that as we consider policy approaches to =
addressing those communities where weve seen an uptick in violent crime, =
we need to be making policy decisions that are based on facts and evidenc=
e, and not anecdotes.



 Q And so what we have before us then is the spectacle of the FBI Directo=
r twice in six months, before the national press, making assertions about=
 crime and incidents of crime that are, in the view of the White House, b=
ased not on the facts or the evidence, but on anecdotes, and doing so in =
a very public way. And so the resulting question is why this doesnt shake=
 your confidence in the FBI Director.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think in part because the FBI Director actually mad=
e clear that he didnt know exactly what was going on, either. And I think=
, look, the fact is, this is a complicated issue, and thats exactly the w=
ay that he described it. He said, Why does Dallas see a dramatic spike an=
d Houston doesnt? He acknowledged -- he continued saying, Its a complicat=
ed, hard issue, but the stakes couldnt be higher. Later on, he said, I do=
nt know for sure whats going on, but something has happened. Clearly, it =
has. We just need to make sure that our policy approach to addressing thi=
s situation is rooted in evidence and facts. And Director Comey has indic=
ated -- and I think this was sort of part of the reason that this discuss=
ion arose -- is that Director Comey indicated that he was seeking out add=
itional information and additional evidence about what was exactly happen=
ing in these communities.=20



 But its clear that we dont have enough evidence at this point to substan=
tiate the claim that police officers not doing their job is the reason fo=
r this uptick. I think the Presidents concern actually is really focused =
on rebuking this false choice between protecting civil rights and fightin=
g crime. The truth is, the vast majority of law enforcement officers that=
 put on the uniform every day do both. They both are committed to fightin=
g crime and doing it in a fair way. The best law enforcement agencies hav=
e made clear and have funded training and put in place policies that actu=
ally make it easier for their officers to pursue their job to fight crime=
 and to do it in a fair way.



 And so the President is quite interested at a federal level of figuring =
out what additional support can be provided by the federal government to =
local law enforcement agencies as they pursue both tasks: fighting crime =
but also protecting civil rights.



 Q Two other subjects, much more quickly, I hope. Returning to Iran and B=
en Rhodes, did Mr. Rhodes seek approval from anyone in the White House ma=
nagement before agreeing to allow Mr. Samuels of the New York Times Magaz=
ine to shadow him and quote him as he did?



 MR. EARNEST: There was a decision made by the White House to cooperate w=
ith Mr. Samuelss reporting.



 Q And that decision involved individuals aside from Rhodes himself?



 MR. EARNEST: Correct.



 Q Has Mr. Rhodes been rebuked by anyone in the White House management st=
ructure following the publication of that article?



 MR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. Mr. Rhodes is somebody who has serve=
d this White House and this President with distinction. And that's true w=
hen you consider that he led the effort to open up a diplomatic channel w=
ith the Cubans to bring about an effort to normalize the relations betwee=
n our two countries. Mr. Rhodes was at the forefront of our policy effort=
 to transform our diplomatic relationship with Burma and to encourage the=
 democracy that was forming there. And Ben has also played a leading role=
 in trying to establish these programs that are focused on cultivating yo=
ung leaders in regions across the country and helping them -- giving them=
 access to the United States and cementing our relationship with them.=20=




 So Ben has had a very broad policy portfolio at the White House and he h=
as carried out his responsibilities honorably and with distinction. And I=
 think everybody here at the White House is quite proud to work with Mr. =
Rhodes.



 Q But no one has told him that they considered his comments in The New Y=
ork Times Magazine article to have been ill-advised?



 MR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware.=20



 Q Final question on him, and following up on the earlier questions about=
 the request for his testimony by the House Oversight Committee. I take i=
t from your comments in saying that you're reviewing the letter from Cong=
ressman Chaffetz that the White House is not reflexively asserting an exe=
cutive privilege claim with respect to this request.



 MR. EARNEST: That's correct. This has nothing to do with executive privi=
lege.



 Q Last subject. Both you and the President have, for a long time now, mo=
nths now, jettisoned the standard posture of White House officials and th=
e White House press briefing with respect to the opposing partys nominati=
ng process. Normally, it has been my experience in Washington, the White =
House waits until theres a nominee from the other party, doesnt wade into=
 the process, doesnt comment on specific candidates or what they have to =
say, and says typically, the time will come for that.=20

That posture has been jettisoned here for months now with respect to Dona=
ld Trump, long before he cleared the field in his party. And one of the s=
ets of comments by the President and others here has been to the effect t=
hat Mr. Trumps candidacy is already creating a great deal of consternatio=
n amongst foreign leaders and allies of the United States who are suppose=
dly conveying these sentiments and these concerns to the White House and =
the State Department and so on. Put very simply, does President Obama vie=
w that the election of Donald Trump to the presidency would constitute a =
direct threat to the national security of the United States?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, let me say it this way. President Obama has been aske=
d on a number of occasions to weigh in on Mr. Trumps candidacy, and I thi=
nk more often than not, the President has shared his opinions on this. So=
 what I have tried to do is to choose my moments carefully and making a p=
oint about the impact of the election on the ability of President Obama t=
o do his job. I've also made clear that President Obamas priority is focu=
sed on protecting the important progress that we've made over the last se=
ven or eight years. And his interest in the election is rooted in the ide=
a that he wants his successor to be somebody whos committed to building o=
n that progress and not tearing it down.



 And that's the way that he has engaged in the debate so far. And the Pre=
sident has certainly expressed concerns in the past about some of the rhe=
toric that a number of Republican presidential candidates have used. And =
the President has observed that those kinds of comments and that kind of =
rhetoric does have an impact on our national security, and certainly has =
an impact on our standing in the world. It certainly has an impact on our=
 relationships with other countries, and the President has observed that =
it's not at all unusual for world leaders to ask questions about comments=
 that were uttered on the campaign trail.



 So it clearly is having an impact. But I'll let the President, at the ne=
xt opportunity that he has to take questions, choose to describe what imp=
act he believes electing Mr. Trump would have on our national security.=20=




 Q Speak for yourself then. Do you see him as a threat to national securi=
ty?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I try to choose my spots, and I dont think I'm going =
to choose this one.



 Go ahead Suzanne.



 Q To follow up on that, Donald Trump has met with Republican leaders thr=
oughout the day here in Washington -- Reince Priebus and Speaker Ryan. An=
d they've come out of these meetings and they've described them as produc=
tive, and that they're really uniting around their core principles -- at =
least that's what they're saying publicly -- to deny, what they say, is a=
 third Obama administration. Is there any concern from the White House or=
 allies of the White House that Democrats are now falling behind now that=
 it seems some of the Republicans are kind of trying to coalesce around T=
rump?



 MR. EARNEST: You certainly have better-informed, more-experienced, and s=
urely higher-paid analysts who can examine the fault lines of the Republi=
can Party. But even as a novice, I suspect that -- well, even the joint s=
tatement that I read with some amusement today from Speaker Ryan and the =
Republican nominee, presumptive nominee, indicate that this was merely th=
eir first meeting. So I'm certainly not surprised to hear that.



 I think what I find to be interesting about this process is that Speaker=
 Ryan has described his view that the entire Republican Party, including =
the presumptive presidential nominee, should rally behind the agenda that=
 Speaker Ryan has put forward. I think the reason that he may be encounte=
ring some difficulty is that he's the Speaker of the House. He should alr=
eady be using the responsibility that he has to implement that agenda. An=
d that is not at all what Republicans have done. That certainly is not wh=
at Leader McConnell has done on the Senate side, and it's not what Speake=
r Ryan has done on the House side.=20



There are any number of important, critical priorities that Republicans c=
ould be focused on in the House of Representatives right now and in the U=
nited States Senate that are an important part of the job they have right=
 now. Unfortunately, Republicans seem much more focused on the elections =
than they do on embracing the responsibility to deal with the results of =
the last elections that gave them a majority in the United States Congres=
s. But right now, we see Republicans much more focused on their relations=
hip with the presumptive nominee than they are on things like passing a b=
udget or passing funding for the Zika virus to avert a public health disa=
ster, or passing much-needed funding to relieve the financial turmoil on =
Puerto Rico that's having a negative impact on 3 million Americans who li=
ve there. We certainly havent seen any action in either House of Congress=
 on funding programs to fight opioid addiction. We see the House trying t=
o take victory laps on legislation that doesnt actually provide any money=
 to ensure that any more people can get access to treatment.



So if Republicans had much conviction about their agenda, they'd be tryin=
g to implement it now as opposed to trying to convince other members of t=
he Republican Party or the presumptive Republican nominee that what they =
propose is the right thing to do. If they thought it was the right thing =
to do, why wouldnt they be trying to implement it right now?



All the things that I've just outlined are things that Republicans at one=
 point or another have indicated is a priority to them, and all those are=
 things that I have said President Obama believes are a priority. In fact=
, we have been working hard to try to cajole Congress to act on a budget,=
 to act on Zika, to act on Puerto Rico, to act on opioids. But they haven=
t. So I think that's why there might be skepticism both inside the Republ=
ican Party and outside the Republican Party that Republicans actually do =
have a governing agenda, because they've had an opportunity to present it=
 and implement it, and they havent done it. In fact, on this scorecard th=
at I've just laid out, they havent done anything.



Q But do you think it's just a show -- I mean, this show of unity, do you=
 think it's genuine? And if it is, does that signal something that's even=
 perhaps a little bit more dangerous from the administration's point of v=
iew?



MR. EARNEST: I dont know anybody here that's going to lose any sleep over=
 the meeting.



Kenneth.



Q Thank you, Josh. Going back to -- you mentioned Zika funding. We've tal=
ked about Brazil. With the summer games, in light of what's happening in =
Brazil with the impeachment proceeding starting, with the outgoing Zika c=
risis, outbreak in Brazil, will that impact the President's potential dec=
ision to attend the summer games? And also, does the President and the Wh=
ite House believe that the Olympics should be moved or delayed from Brazi=
l?



MR. EARNEST: No, the White House doesnt have that view. We're going to be=
 strongly supportive of our friends in Brazil as they tackle the signific=
ant challenges that they're facing right now. And we've talked about the =
support that we have offered in terms of confronting this public health c=
hallenge related to the Zika virus, and there is some assistance that the=
 United States has already provided. And we stand ready to provide additi=
onal assistance as needed to help Brazil fight Zika. We do that because, =
as we learned from Ebola, our investments and the capacity that other cou=
ntries have to confront public health challenges ultimately has an impact=
 on the public health and wellbeing and safety of the American people.



So we know that the preponderance of the Zika virus is much more intense =
in Brazil. And so we certainly stand ready to help them confront that cha=
llenge.



As it relates to the Olympics, I think hosting the Summer Olympics is a s=
ignificant undertaking for any country that chooses to assume that challe=
nge. And the truth is, the world is rooting for Brazil to succeed in host=
ing a Games that go off without a hitch. Ultimately, we want to be suppor=
tive of the effort of the Brazilians to host a Games where the venues are=
 ready, where the Games take place safely and securely, and where we get =
to see the world's best athletes compete. So we're rooting for Brazil to =
succeed -- until it comes down to the actual competition, in which case w=
e're going to be cheering for the Americans. (Laughter.)=20



Q Josh, obviously the President has been outspoken about gun violence, an=
d he spoke out when the incident with Trayvon Martin happened. I'm curiou=
s if the White House has any reaction to George Zimmerman, the killer of =
Trayvon Martin, auctioning off, or trying to auction off the gun that was=
 used to kill Trayvon Martin online. That since has been taken down, it a=
ppears. But any reaction to it appears that Zimmerman was using the gun t=
o try to profit off that notoriety?=20



MR. EARNEST: I dont have a reaction to it.



Q And one last follow-up for you. I'm pretty sure you're going to give a =
few more details on the State Dinner. We're curious if the White House fe=
els that it was getting a five-for-one deal with the Nordic leaders. When=
 it comes to state dinners, there's that one-on-one attention. And for th=
ose who perceive that this could be a snub, or perceived as a snub, your =
thoughts on that reaction to the fact that you're getting this five-for-o=
ne deal?



MR. EARNEST: Look, this merely is an opportunity for the President to rep=
ay the hospitality that he enjoyed when he traveled to Europe a year or t=
wo ago and met with the Nordic leaders in Europe. The United States obvio=
usly has an important relationship with these five countries. For those o=
f you scoring along at home, this is Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland and=
 Denmark. And these are all countries that the United States has importan=
t working relationships with. So there are a range of issues related to t=
he economy and to national security that we'll surely discuss -- that the=
 President will surely discuss with his counterparts.=20



And there's an opportunity to talk about climate change. These countries,=
 in some cases, are dealing with more persistent and severe impacts than =
we are here in the lower 48. And demonstrating our ongoing commitment to =
implementing the international agreement to fight carbon pollution will a=
lso be a subject of some discussion. So the President and First Lady are =
quite proud to host the leaders of these countries here at the White Hous=
e tomorrow. And it will be filled with all the pomp and circumstance that=
 we typically reserve for countries with whom the United States has impor=
tant relationships. And the United States certainly has important relatio=
nships that are worth investing in with these five countries.



 Ron.



 Q Just to follow up on the Trump question. Just a minute ago, when you w=
ere answering questions about Donald Trump, you sounded perhaps a bit dis=
missive of him, and you were emphasizing the problems within the Republic=
an Party, and so on and so forth. But the fact remains that he has won mo=
re Republican votes during the primary process than anyone else. And are =
you --

=20

 MR. EARNEST: As he frequently repeats on television.



 Q Well, it's true. And again, are you taking him seriously enough? Is th=
e White House taking him seriously enough, or you being too dismissive of=
 him?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, look, first of all, I think that's a question that ca=
n primarily be posed to the Democratic candidates for President, because =
they are the ones who are competing in the election. And based on the rob=
ust, competitive primary process that has unfolded over the last several =
months here on the Democratic side, it seems quite clear that both Democr=
atic candidates take their potential Republican opponent quite seriously.=
 And the President himself stood at this podium last Friday and talked ab=
out how the stakes of this election were quite significant, and it should=
nt be reduced to a reality television program but rather should be subjec=
t to an intense debate around the issues and around the challenges that t=
he next President will have to confront on behalf of the country.



 So the President certainly takes this quite seriously. And as I mentione=
d in response to James's question, the President's principal concern here=
 is we've worked really hard to dig ourselves out of a terrible economic =
hole over the last seven years. The President has worked hard to rebuild =
our relationship with our allies and partners around the world in a way t=
hat advances our interests and strengthens our national security. And the=
 President doesnt want to see that eroded. In fact, he wants to make sure=
 that he is succeeded by a President who recognizes that progress and is =
committed to building on it.=20



And so the President is going to be engaged in the campaign for that reas=
on. The President understands the stakes of this election, and I think th=
at means that everybody who's participating in the election should be tak=
en seriously.



Q So again, this day of unity, or whatever you want to call it -- I dont =
want to do PR for them -- you said --=20



MR. EARNEST: I wouldnt want to either.



Q I'm sorry?



MR. EARNEST: I wouldnt want that job either.



Q You did complain about your salary a minute ago. (Laughter.)=20



Q In discussing that, you dont take that seriously, that, in fact, these =
leaders have come together -- that they do have perhaps an advantage beca=
use their nominee has been determined before the Democrat? I mean, I hate=
 to -- six months from now, if we're talking about this, there could be a=
 whole bit of evidence that suggests that the White House didnt take this=
 seriously enough.



MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the people who primarily should take th=
is seriously are the competitors in the election. And President Obama is =
keenly aware of the significant stakes of the outcome of the next electio=
n. And I assure you that over the next six months the President will be a=
ctively engaged in that debate. And he looks forward to his opportunity t=
o engage more deeply.



I think my point is -- again, you guys have far more-experienced, far bet=
ter-sourced, and far better-paid analysts who can offer up their own insi=
ght about the disruption within the Republican Party. But I would just po=
int out that even in the supposed statement of unity there's an observati=
on that we will be having additional discussions. And the statement close=
s by indicating that this was our first meeting. So again, there is more =
work to be done there, and I think that's evident from the statement that=
 the two men issued.



Q And on the President's schedule today I dont think there's anything rea=
lly public on the schedule about what he's doing. And the schedule this w=
eek feels -- there was the national security meeting and bill signing -- =
but it feels to me like -- again, in my limited experience here -- that i=
t's relatively light. And while you were very critical of what the Republ=
icans arent doing on Zika and Garland and other things, can you give us a=
ny more insight as to today exactly what the President is doing with any =
of these issues, since there's nothing being said publicly about what is =
it that he's doing? You talked to him about the issue you brought up abou=
t policing, but what else are you doing today?=20



MR. EARNEST: Well, the President does have a little bit of a lighter day =
than usual today, principally because he's got a very busy day tomorrow w=
ith five world leaders who he will be hosting here at the White House. I'=
d also point out that the President is going to deliver his commencement =
address at Rutgers University on Sunday, over the weekend. This is the 25=
0th commencement exercises of that fine institution, and the President is=
 looking forward to speaking to it. He also has got a speech he's got to =
work on, so he's going to spend some time working on that speech for Sund=
ay, as well.



Q He's got a team of speechwriters, though.



MR. EARNEST: Yeah, but I think, as April noted, the President tends to sp=
end quite a bit more time on these commencement addresses because he take=
s them quite personally. So the President is being ably assisted by a cou=
ple members of the speechwriting team, but he's putting a lot of his own =
time and energy into this.=20



Q So in terms of information being presented in his public schedule, he's=
 not being less transparent, you would say? Or he's not slowing down -- h=
e's, as he said, keeping it all on the floor in the final months? It's ju=
st a clerical thing, perhaps, that the schedule doesnt reveal as much as =
it used to?



MR. EARNEST: No, I think I acknowledged that the President's schedule tod=
ay was a little bit quieter, but that reflects the fact that he President=
 has got a very full day tomorrow and then again on Sunday.



Margaret.



Q Josh, does the President intend to sign the Senate bill that would auth=
orize the ashes of the WASPs -- the Women Air Force Service Pilots -- to =
be buried at Arlington?



MR. EARNEST: The President does intend to sign that legislation.



Q Do you have any timeframe on that?



MR. EARNEST: I dont. I dont know that we've even received it yet from the=
 Congress. But we'll keep you posted on that.



Q And on China, or the country unnamed in the readout last night between =
Turnbull and Obama --



MR. EARNEST: Really subtle, huh?



Q Yeah. A little passive-aggressive. (Laughter.)=20



MR. EARNEST: That's the essence of diplomacy sometimes.



Q Indeed.



MR. EARNEST: As you've covered more extensively than even I have.

=20

Q I appreciate that. But can you give us a little bit more there? I mean,=
 there was this pretty overt action, this maritime operation near that Ch=
inese-occupied reef in the South China Sea. The U.S. and Australia coming=
 quite close with warships. I mean, that's happening. The President is he=
aded to Asia next week. The steel glut was named in that readout. Obvious=
ly, China is the one who's been getting a lot of blame for overproduction=
 there. Would you say that tensions are on the rise with China?



MR. EARNEST: I would not describe it that way. Our concerns about China's=
 activities in the South China Sea are well-documented, and our concerns =
are concerns that we have raised both publicly and privately with Chinese=
 officials at a range of levels. The freedom of navigation operation that=
 was carried out by U.S. forces earlier this week is relatively routine. =
We've done at least a couple of times just in the last four or five month=
s. And it is not intended to be a provocative act. It merely is a demonst=
ration of a principle that the President has laid out on a number of occa=
sions, which is that the United States will fly, operate and sail anywher=
e that international law allows. And this operation was undertaken consis=
tent with that principle.=20



And the concerns and the tensions that exist around the South China Sea d=
on't actually directly involve the United States. The United States is no=
t a claimant to any of the land features in the South China Sea. Our conc=
ern lies principally with the need for those parties that do have competi=
ng claims to resolve them through diplomacy. And we certainly do not want=
 to see the tensions increase because of the risk that that could pose to=
 the extensive international commerce that's conducted in that region of =
the world.=20



So I think this also underscores the complexity of the U.S. relationship =
with Australia. Australia is one of our closest allies, and we work with =
them on a range of issues. And I'll let the Australians describe the conc=
erns that they may have, or the impact on their national security that te=
nsions in the South China Sea may have. But obviously the Australian econ=
omy is affected by the glut of capacity in the steel industry in much the=
 same way that the U.S. is, as well. I know that Prime Minister Turnbull =
has indicated his own priority for ensuring the international trade is co=
nducted fairly. And that common ground is the basis for the kinds of conv=
ersations that President Obama and he have on a fairly regular basis.



So these are -- I think at the same time, the thing that sort of underlie=
s all of this is we have been able to work with China in pursuit of other=
 priorities. And we've talked about North Korea and the influence that th=
e Chinese government has with North Korea. The sanctions that were impose=
d by the United Nations against North Korea that went further than any se=
t of previous sanctions that have been imposed on them were only possible=
 because the United States and China were able to cooperate in implementi=
ng them. Obviously, we've worked with China to complete the Iran deal tha=
t we discussed earlier. That would not have been possible without China's=
 active participation in the discussions, but also, China had to be helpf=
ul in terms of imposing and enforcing the sanctions that compelled Iran t=
o the negotiating table in the first place.



 So I think this illustrates that there are differences of opinion that w=
e have with China, and Im certainly not seeking to downplay them. Theyre =
significant, and they have significant consequences for our economy in pa=
rticular.



 But they have not prevented the United States and China from being able =
to work effectively together to pursue other areas where were in better a=
greement.=20



 Q But why go out of your way to not name China? I mean, thats obviously =
who you were talking about. And then thats where the point of tension is.=
 I mean, if youre having a destroyer go near a reef youre concerned are g=
oing to turn into an airstrip to land jets on, and thats a U.S. destroyer=
, I mean, thats a pretty overt signal. But you dont want to say China dir=
ectly. I mean, it seems like an effort, a very concerted effort to avoid =
appearing to look confrontational.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think were not just trying to avoid appearing confr=
ontational. I think I said in my previous answer that we certainly did no=
t intend for that to be considered a provocative act. So I think were bei=
ng pretty explicit about that. And weve been explicit about that fact, bo=
th in public and in private, at a range of levels. And so --=20



 Q And this doesnt -- the timeframe, with the President headed to the reg=
ion, obviously everything is getting scrutinized in the region.



 MR. EARNEST: Sure, and thats --



 Q So that was a factor here, or no?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we know that Vietnam in particular has some concerns =
about competing claims in the South China Sea. We know that Vietnam is a =
signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we certainly are looking =
to broaden our economic relationship with Vietnam. Theres a rapidly growi=
ng middle class in Vietnam, and U.S. companies could benefit from the opp=
ortunity to do business in that part of the world. That would be good for=
 the U.S. economy, it certainly would be good for U.S. workers, and the P=
resident is committed to pursuing that priority as he travels overseas.=20=




 And look, we know that China sees the same potential benefit if they can=
 increase their ability to do business inside of Vietnam. Thats actually =
the essence of the argument that the President has made with regard to th=
e Trans-Pacific Partnership -- that if the United States and the rest of =
the international community doesnt go in and write the rules of the road =
for doing business in Vietnam, then China will. And the benefits of the U=
nited States being a part of those rules of road, it means were going to =
have high labor standards, were going to have higher human rights standar=
ds, higher environmental standards.



 China hasnt made those things a priority, and we know that if China is g=
iven an opportunity to get a foothold in Vietnam, they certainly are not =
going to be interested in raising standards. You could even imagine a sce=
nario where they might even allow those standards to be lowered even furt=
her.=20



 So theres no denying that at least when it comes to our relationship wit=
h Vietnam, there are significant consequences for our relationship with C=
hina. But we never want to create a scenario in which we cant pursue our =
common interests with China, and the President has been quite clear about=
 that. And weve been effective in implementing that strategy in a way tha=
t has had positive benefits for China and the United States. And, in fact=
, thats why the other thing that we often say in describing our relations=
hip with China is that we welcome a rising China. In fact, thats the reas=
on that were hopeful that they can be persuaded to abide by the internati=
onal rules of the road when it comes to resolving competing claims in the=
 South China Sea.



 When youre an economy as large as China, when youre as influential as Ch=
ina is, particularly in that region of the world, then you benefit from t=
he ability of disputes to be resolved without going to war, and you benef=
it from disputes being resolved with the expectation that everybody is go=
ing to follow the rules. And thats certainly the case that we make to Chi=
na, and I think thats an indication of how were able to work with China, =
how we welcome a rising China. But look, were going to have our differenc=
es and were not going to shy away from expressing those.



 Q Quick question on Iran. With the Secretary of State in Europe, meeting=
 with businesses, does the White House want to see more European banks do=
 business in Iran?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I think what the White House wants is to fulfill our =
responsibility to international financial institutions to describe to the=
m exactly what is allowed and whats not allowed when it comes to doing bu=
siness with Iran. And thats something that has been part of not just Secr=
etary Lews job description, but Secretary Kerry has gone to great lengths=
 to try to describe the rules of the road to international financial inst=
itutions as well.=20



 There are a couple of things that I think are relevant to point out here=
. One of the things that these large -- that the heads of these banks say=
 is that the United States has been forceful in enforcing these sanctions=
, which is why we want to be sure that we are on the right side of the la=
w here. Thats validation of what we have said here many times, which is t=
hat we take sanctions enforcement quite seriously, and there are large fi=
nancial institutions that have had to pay big fines for circumventing tho=
se sanctions. So were quite serious about that.



 I think the second thing that I would say is that Iran has expressed con=
cerns about the fact that theyre not getting the kind of engagement with =
the international business community that they would like to see. And I t=
hink our response to that is simply that there certainly is more that Ira=
n can do to encourage that kind of international investment, because that=
 international investment is looking for a stable business climate in whi=
ch to do business. And if you are routinely testing ballistic missiles th=
at violate United Nations sanctions that govern your ballistic missile pr=
ogram, well, that's not going to inspire the confidence of business leade=
rs that this is a safe place to do business. If you are supporting terror=
ism around the world, that's not going to be particularly persuasive to b=
usiness leaders that Iran is a good place to make an investment. So there=
s more that Iran can do --



 Q But are you going to provide letters basically legally assuring these =
firms that they won't be prosecuted if they go ahead and do business? I m=
ean, that's the level of insurance they want.



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I'd refer you to the State Department or the =
Treasury Department or maybe even the Department of Justice in terms of w=
hat kind of assurances can be provided to international companies about w=
hat is appropriate and whats not when it comes to doing business with Ira=
n.=20



But, look, the fact that you have the Secretary of the Treasury and the S=
ecretary of State at different points sitting down with business leaders =
from around the world, I think that is an indication that we take quite s=
eriously the responsibility that we have to help people understand what t=
he rules are, because they should know that we're going to enforce them, =
but they should also know exactly what is allowable under the law that's =
on the books. And that's what both Secretary Kerry and Secretary Lew have=
 done.=20



Chris.



Q Josh, as you know, earlier this week, the lawsuit the Justice Departmen=
t filed on Monday against North Carolinas anti-LGBT law is separate from =
the multiagency review of the measure. Do you have an update on that mult=
iagency review?



MR. EARNEST: Well, as we've discussed in here, this is a review that agen=
cies are working on together as they evaluate what impact this law would =
have on programs that are funded by the federal government. The White Hou=
se has been a part of that review. The Department of Justice has been a p=
art of that review. But all of that has been separate from the Department=
 of Justice conclusion that they needed to take action to enforce the Civ=
il Rights Act of 1964. And what has been concluded as a result of that ef=
fort is that the administration will not take action to withhold funding =
while this enforcement process is playing out in the courts.=20



So these are two separate actions that the government is taking, one sort=
 of questioning, evaluating this policy question about what impact the la=
w has on funding, but also, separately, the Department of Justice has bee=
n engaged in a process of enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And whi=
le those are two separate processes, it is clear that the decision on the=
 part of the Department of Justice to move forward with enforcement means=
 that, while the process plays out, the administration will not be taking=
 action to withhold funding.



Q Have you given the state of North Carolina a heads-up prior to this bri=
efing that they will not withhold federal funding as a result of that sta=
tute?



MR. EARNEST: I know theres been regular communication with state official=
s in North Carolina from a variety of agencies, but I can't speak to the =
details of any of those conversations.



Q In addition to the review of the North Carolina law, at least four agen=
cies are also reviewing Mississippis religious freedom law that seems to =
enable anti-LGBT discrimination. Has the same determination been made wit=
h respect to that law that there will be no withholding of federal funds =
as a result of that statute?



MR. EARNEST: I'll check with my colleagues here about the status of that.=
 I'm not aware that the Department of Justice has notified the state of M=
ississippi of any potential enforcement actions as a result of that law, =
at least at this point. But I'll see if I can get you some more specific =
guidance on that.



Q And what would you say to critics who would say that by saying you're n=
ot going to withhold funding until the issue is resolved in the courts, t=
hat the administration is not putting its full force in support of equal =
rights?



MR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has been quite outspoken in maki=
ng clear that this is a question of values, and when it comes to fighting=
 for justice and fairness and fighting against discrimination, that's som=
ething the President is committed to and hes made that a priority. And I =
think the value statement that the President has offered with regard to t=
his law has been clear.



But, look, as it relates to the more narrow question about the need to en=
force the Civil Rights Act, I think the Attorney General has been quite c=
lear about the priorities for enforcement that she has laid out and what =
impact that has on some people in North Carolina who right now might be f=
eeling like the state government, at least, is not sufficiently committed=
 to ensure equal treatment under the law.=20



So I found the Attorney Generals words to be quite powerful. And as a nat=
ive North Carolinian, she had a unique perspective on the situation. So I=
 think anybody who doubts that should take a minute to review her remarks=
.



Francesca.



Q Thank you, Josh. Back on the top story today, this meeting between Paul=
 Ryan and Donald Trump and the chaos we've sort of seen playing out in th=
e Republican Party. Yesterday, DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz told re=
porters that Democrats, after their primary, essentially wouldnt have the=
 same thing happen, that they would be unified, there wouldn't be this di=
visiveness at the convention. But many supporters of Senator Sanders have=
 said that they wont vote for Hillary Clinton if she is the Democratic no=
minee. And, at the same time, theyre also saying that -- hes saying that =
if she comes out on top, its not really his responsibility to get his sup=
porters behind her. And so the President, as the highest-ranking Democrat=
, he is the leader of the Democratic Party. Im wondering what the Preside=
nt is going to do to bring the Democratic Party together when his primary=
 -- his partys primary ends here very soon.



 MR. EARNEST: Look, I think the President will be making a case not just =
to Democrats but to independents and Republicans across the country that =
they should support the presidential candidate who understands the progre=
ss that weve made over the last seven or eight years. And the President h=
as been focused on implementing a strategy in the face of extreme Republi=
c obstruction to focus on making economic investments that expand economi=
c opportunity for the middle class. The President has been focused on try=
ing to use diplomacy to advance our interests around the world. And at ev=
ery step of the way, weve seen Republicans try to block it. And I think t=
hat gives you a good sense of where the priorities are not just of this P=
resident but of the Democratic Party.=20



And hell make that case not just to Democratic voters but to voters all a=
cross the country, because the question facing voters will be whether or =
not they -- whether they support a candidate who is committed to building=
 on that progress -- because there certainly is more work to be done. The=
res additional work, theres additional progress we need to make. But were=
 not going to move this country forward by electing a president who is co=
mmitted to tearing down the strategy that has been so critical to our suc=
cess over the last several years.



 Q Well, Republicans found themselves in this position, though, because t=
hey were unprepared, essentially, for the primary to have ended so quickl=
y, to have to deal with Donald Trump as the nominee, that sort of thing. =
So I guess what Im asking is, what would the President specifically do to=
 bring the two candidates together, the two candidates supporters togethe=
r? We saw today, for instance, that Reince Priebus had this meeting on Ca=
pitol Hill for them. Would the President be willing to have some sort of =
meeting here for the two Democratic candidates -- that sort of thing?



 Q A beer summit?



 MR. EARNEST: Perhaps.=20



Well, again, I certainly am not a high qualified analyst when it comes to=
 -- nor highly paid, as James points out -- (laughter) -- when it comes t=
o analyzing the challenges facing the Republican Party. I would just obse=
rve that its not just a matter of timing that has made it more complicate=
d for them to try to paper over the breaches in that party.=20



So, look, I feel confident that the President will have a strong argument=
 to make in the fall about who he believes should succeed him in the Oval=
 Office, and the President will root that argument in the need to build o=
n the progress that weve made thus far. And the President has been deeply=
 invested in that progress and the President believes that there is more =
that we can do to invest in the middle class, there is more that we can d=
o to make our tax code fairer, there is more that we can do to strengthen=
 our alliances and advance our interests around the world. And the Presid=
ent is committed to supporting a presidential candidate that is intereste=
d in building on that progress.



 Cheryl.



 Q Thanks, Josh. Back to China and steel. Today, the bipartisan leaders o=
f the Congressional Steel Caucus requested a meeting with the President t=
o talk about illegal steel imports. Would the President be willing to mee=
t with them?



 MR. EARNEST: I havent seen that request. Well obviously take a close loo=
k at it. I think that, again, the fact that the President spent some time=
 with the Prime Minister of Australia talking about this issue I think sh=
ould be a clear indication to you and to the members of the bipartisan St=
eel Caucus that this is an issue that the President believes is an import=
ant priority for our country and for our economy.



 Q And also they also want to discuss whether China should be recognized =
as having market economy status at the WTO. Has the administration weighe=
d in on that?



 MR. EARNEST: Thats a discussion that they should have with the Commerce =
Department, because the Commerce Department is the one who considers that=
 determination.=20



 Pam.



 Q Josh, on the Nordic summit, I know you mentioned climate change. Is th=
ere anything concrete that you hope will come out of it? And these are co=
untries that are also part of the anti-ISIL coalition. Are they doing eno=
ugh in that? Would the President like to see them contribute more? Are th=
ey spending enough on their militaries? And are they doing enough in the =
refugee crisis?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I dont want to talk about any concrete announcements =
a day before the leaders even arrive, so we can talk about that a little =
bit more tomorrow. As it relates to our counter-ISIL efforts, we certainl=
y spend a lot of time talking to our coalition partners about additional =
steps that they could take to enhance our efforts to degrade and ultimate=
ly destroy ISIL. So Im confident that that will be part of the discussion=
.



 We know that a number of these countries have generously taken in refuge=
es that are fleeing violence in the Middle East, and I would anticipate t=
hat the President will have a discussion with them about the impact that =
that has had on their countrys individual politics, but also to encourage=
 them as they offer up that much-needed humanitarian relief.



 When it comes to climate change, this obviously is an issue that the Uni=
ted States and the Nordic countries have been able to work effectively to=
gether on in a variety of ways. But stay tuned tomorrow for any announcem=
ents.



 Mike.



 Q Will the President be meeting with victims of Agent Orange while hes i=
n Vietnam?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that this afternoon the Presidents Nat=
ional Security Advisor, Susan Rice, is meeting with a group of veteran se=
rvice organizations, leaders of veteran service organizations and other v=
eterans to talk about the Presidents trip to Vietnam and Japan. And she w=
ill make clear that, in addition to discussing some of the issues that I =
outlined with Margaret related to TPP and our economic relationship with =
Asia that shell also spend some time talking to them about getting a full=
 accounting of POWs and MIAs in Vietnam. This is obviously a priority for=
 many of these organizations, and its certainly a priority for the Comman=
der-in-Chief.=20



As it relates to the Agent Orange situation, Im not aware that the Presid=
ent has any specific meetings planned with victims of Agent Orange. But o=
bviously our veterans organizations that advocate for Americas veterans a=
re concerned about this issue, and the President is certainly interested =
in making sure that our veterans get the benefits that they deserve.



 Q Also on the trip to Asia, not surprisingly, in your readout of the cal=
l to Turnbull last night, you mentioned TPP as one of the subjects. This =
will be the first trip to Asia since Trump has essentially clinched the R=
epublican nomination, so we now have both the Democratic frontrunner, as =
you know, and the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump, against TPP. And=
 Trump, in his recent campaigning, has very much focused on trade, includ=
ing retaliation against companies that would outsource to places like Asi=
a -- in the Indiana primary. In the conversations with the counterparties=
 in Asia to TPP, what sort of -- have they been concerned by the fact tha=
t either of his successors will be opposed to the treaty? And what have y=
ou been telling them, given that the Congress is dragging its feet on bei=
ng interested in ratifying this and now we have Democrats and Republicans=
 more and more against it going into the convention? What have they been =
telling you?



 MR. EARNEST: Look, this isnt a surprising development. We saw on the cam=
paign trail for the presidential candidates in both parties that there wa=
s not strong support for TPP. That was true last year at this time. But y=
et, we did succeed, despite that opposition, in advancing Trade Promotion=
 Authority legislation through the Congress. And we did that by painstaki=
ngly avoiding some snafus that Jordan referred to, and passing in biparti=
san fashion legislation that actually succeed in allowing us to complete =
those negotiations.



 So those in other countries that are carefully watching our political sy=
stem I think understand that there continues to be bipartisan support in =
the Congress for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, and we have suc=
ceeded in navigating the cross-currents of the presidential election in b=
uilding bipartisan support for those kinds of agreements.



 So we did that last year with Trade Promotion Authority, and were confid=
ent that well be able to do that this year when it comes to implementing =
the Trans-Pacific Partnership.=20



I think the last observation I would make -- and this, I think, should be=
 a pretty forceful argument for members of Congress who are supportive of=
 TPP and wondering when they should vote on it. I mean, I'd just make the=
 observation that it is very, very unlikely that the next President will =
be more enthusiastic about TPP than this President. So I think that would=
 be a reason for Congress to take action before this President resigns.



 Q And more directly, has the counterparties anxiety about its potential =
modification increased in recent months in your conversations with them? =
And is it affecting alternative arrangements they might be thinking about=
?



 MR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. You could probably get a better read=
 on this from Ambassador Furmans office. He obviously spends more time in=
teracting with the counterparties. But I think most of the parties that w=
e've been dealing with in the context of these negotiations understand th=
e political debate in this country. They understand why the politics of t=
he situation are particularly challenging. But I don't think theyve learn=
ed anything new that they didnt already know six months or a year ago. Th=
e truth is we've been having this conversation with the TPP parties for f=
ive or six years now, so they understand the political dynamics here.



 But the President certainly feels a sense of urgency in working with Dem=
ocrats and Republicans to see the Trans-Pacific Partnership get implement=
ed.



 I'll do a couple in the back here. John Bennett.



 Q Senators Warren and Murray have announced a $1.1 billion agreement on =
an emergency Zika bill. Is the White House satisfied? That's almost a bil=
lion dollars beneath your request. Are you satisfied with that?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we put forward the request that we would like to see,=
 and it obviously had a lot of details in it. That request was forwarded =
to Congress back in February. So we certainly would have liked to have se=
en more prompt congressional action on this. I think, frankly, at this po=
int, given the delays and given the heightened stakes, we welcome any sor=
t of forward momentum in Congress.



 As it relates to the specific package you just mentioned, we'll have to =
take a close look at it to see if it's sufficient. But Congress has -- I =
made a reference earlier to the frustrations associated with the slow-mov=
ing Congress, and look, it could not be clearer that Congress needs to ta=
ke action to help our states and our local officials fight the Zika virus=
. That is critical to the public health and safety of the American people=
, and it cannot be done -- we can't do everything we need to do to prepar=
e for this virus without congressional action.=20



 So as I mentioned yesterday, this is an emergency. It's an emergency now=
. That's not just my observation, that's the observation of Democratic an=
d Republican governors across the country. It's an observation that's bee=
n made by our public professionals. So this isn't about politics; this is=
 about solving problems. And we need Congress to act quickly so we can ge=
t to work solving this problem.



 Q I talked to some experts about the Nordic visit, and they said their i=
mpression is the President has really come to respect the Nordic leaders =
for their pragmatism and kind of a get-things-done attitude. Can you talk=
 a little bit about that? How did that develop over his presidency?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President has had an opportunity in a variety of =
settings to meet with the leaders of these countries, and the observation=
 that the President typically makes about the Nordic countries -- he uses=
 a rather colorful expression -- he describes them as punching above thei=
r weight. And look, these are relatively small countries, but they are co=
untries that make an impactful contribution to our efforts on a variety o=
f issues.=20



 We certainly value the contribution that each of these countries has mad=
e to fighting carbon pollution. We value the contribution that each of th=
ese countries have made to the counter-ISIL coalition. Three of these cou=
ntries -- Norway, Iceland and Denmark -- are full NATO members, but event=
 Sweden and Finland have a relationship with NATO that allows them to coo=
rdinate their activities closely with NATO. So all of them are making a s=
ubstantial contribution to what we have described as the cornerstone of A=
merican national security, which is NATO.



 So the President is looking forward to hosting them at the White House, =
repaying the hospitality that he enjoyed last year. And hes looking forwa=
rd to I think a pretty busy day of meetings on a variety of issues.



 John, I give you the last one.



 Q Thank you, Josh. Two brief questions. Number one, you mentioned Mr. Tr=
ump. He recently said he would appoint former Mayor Giuliani to chair a s=
pecial commission on Muslims and on terrorism. And does one think that th=
at would be a good idea in terms of vetting people who can come into the =
country and would be threats, and letting those who are no threat and jus=
t seek refuge come in?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, John, we actually have a very well-established proces=
s for considering individuals who want to enter the country through the r=
efugee process. Refugees, regardless of the way that they worship, are pr=
ocessed through a system that carefully vets their background, collects i=
nformation from those individuals in in-person interviews, collects biome=
tric information that is then run through a variety of databases maintain=
ed by law enforcement, by our national security agencies, by intelligence=
 agencies. In fact, people who enter the United States through the refuge=
e program are subject to more scrutiny than anybody else that comes in th=
e country.



 So that's a well-established process, and that's the one that President =
Obama has ensured that our national security agencies are carefully adher=
ing to.



 Q So you don't think a Giuliani commission is needed?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, we've got a well-established process. And I'll let th=
e presidential candidates make whatever proposals they want.=20



 Q The other thing I wanted to ask was, the Philippines elected a new pre=
sident on Monday, and theres been more talk of a stronger U.S. tie to the=
 Philippines, in part because of some dangers in that part of the world. =
Will the President ever discuss with President Duterte, President-elect D=
uterte, the reopening of the Clark airbase, the Subic naval base, or at t=
he very least, the restoration of the Filipino-American holiday that was =
abolished by one of his predecessors, Corazon Aquino?



 MR. EARNEST: Well, the President had the opportunity to visit the Philip=
pines last year. He spent about four days in Manila, and spoke with his t=
hen-counterpart, President Aquino, on a range of issues. And there was a =
discussion about deepening the security relationship between the United S=
tates and the Philippines.=20



 Obviously, the Philippines has a counterterrorism threat that they have =
to deal with, and the United States has been supportive of their efforts =
to confront that threat. Obviously, the Philippines has some concerns abo=
ut claims that China has made in the South China Sea, and we have strongl=
y supported the Filipino effort to press the Chinese to resolve those dif=
ferences through diplomacy.



 The Filipinos also have a challenge when it comes to maritime security. =
And there is expertise and equipment that the United States has provided =
the Filipino government to confront that challenge. Those of you who were=
 there will remember that the President visited a vessel that has previou=
sly been owned by the United States that is now being operated by the equ=
ivalent of the Filipino coast guard there to provide security in the Phil=
ippines.=20



 So that's an indication of the strong relationship what we already have =
with the Philippines, and the President would certainly be open to not ju=
st continuing but actually deepening that security relationship with Pres=
ident-elect Duterte once his election results have been confirmed officia=
ls.



 Q And that would include possibly the reopening of those two bases and t=
he restoration --=20



 MR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know that theres any policy decision that's b=
een made with regard to that, with regard to any of those bases. What we =
have said is that we're interested in an important national security-coun=
terterrorism relationship with the Philippines that enhances the national=
 security of both of our countries. And Im confident that conversation wi=
ll continue with the next President, whether its Mr. Duterte or someone e=
lse.



 Q So the President has not called Mr. Duterte?



 MR. EARNEST: No. I believe the results of the election -- while the elec=
tion took place several days ago, I have not seen official results from t=
he election be announced at this point. So I know that there are a bunch =
of projections out there, but I don't know of any official pronouncement =
that's been made.=20



 Q Thank you.=20



 MR. EARNEST: Taka, I know that you've been trying to get a question the =
last couple of days. So why don't I give you the last chance here?



 Q So on Japan, can you tell me if -- how the President will mention or t=
alk about Nagasaki when he goes to Hiroshima?



 MR. EARNEST: Im sorry. Can you say that one more time?



 Q Can you say if and how the President will talk about Nagasaki?



 MR. EARNEST: I see. Yes, at this point, I don't have much to say about t=
he Presidents remarks that hell deliver at Hiroshima. The President does =
not intend to deliver a major address while hes at Hiroshima. I think tha=
t will be an opportunity for him in a rather solemn place to share his re=
flections on having the opportunity to visit this sight. He will also hav=
e an opportunity to talk about the importance of the U.S.-Japan relations=
hip and make an observation about the profound transformation in that rel=
ationship just in the space of 70 years or so.



 And while, on one hand, you might say 70 years is a long time, its a lif=
etime. On the other hand, 70 years ago, the United States and Japan were =
at war. And the way that we cooperate now on such a wide range of issues =
that enhances importantly the national security of both our countries I t=
hink is a testament to the tremendous progress that's been made in both o=
ur countries. And I think its served both our countries and citizens in b=
oth of our countries quite well. And the President will have an opportuni=
ty to make that observation not just when hes in Hiroshima but during his=
 visit to Japan.



 Q Will he have any message to the people in Nagasaki?



 MR. EARNEST: Im sorry?



 Q Any message to the people --=20



 MR. EARNEST: The message. At this point, well wait for the Presidents re=
marks before we make any observation.



 All right, thanks, everybody. Well see you tomorrow.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Good aft=
ernoon, everybody.&nbsp; I do not have any announcements at the top, so we =
can go straight to questions for maximum efficiency today.&nbsp; Kevin, do =
you want to start?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&n=
bsp; Thank you, Josh.&nbsp; So a U.S. District Court judge has ruled today =
that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally making payments to insu=
rers covering reductions for certain enrollees.&nbsp; I wanted to ask how p=
roblematic
 is this ruling for the health insurance program overall.&nbsp; And what ar=
e the ramifications for plans and consumers if this stands?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ke=
vin, this is not the first time that we've seen opponents of the Affordable=
 Care Act go through the motions to try to win this political fight in the =
court system.&nbsp; There are a couple of things that are unprecedented
 about this effort, though.&nbsp; This suit represents the first time in ou=
r nation's history that Congress has been permitted to sue the executive br=
anch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute.&nbsp; There have=
 obviously been significant differences between
 the executive branch and Congress recently.&nbsp; But these are the kinds =
of political disputes that characterize a democracy.&nbsp; And it's unfortu=
nate that Republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to refight=
 a political fight that they keep losing.&nbsp;
 They've been losing this fight for six years.&nbsp; And they'll lose it ag=
ain.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will th=
e administration appeal the ruling?&nbsp; And secondly, if this does go thr=
ough, what are the ramifications?&nbsp; Will insurers be leaving the progra=
m?&nbsp; Will this have an impact on the price for consumers?<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; My colle=
agues at the Department of Justice obviously just started reviewing the rul=
ing because it was just handed down a few minutes ago.&nbsp; So any sort of=
 formal announcement about an intent to appeal will be announced
 from the Department of Justice.&nbsp; But we are quite confident in the po=
wer of the legal arguments that we're able to make here.&nbsp; But any sort=
 of formal announcement about an appeal will come from the Department of Ju=
stice.&nbsp; And I have not heard at this point
 any sort of analysis about the potential impact of a legal outcome consist=
ent with this decision.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cha=
irman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has invited Be=
n Rhodes to testify at a hearing on the Iran nuclear deal.&nbsp; Is this an=
 invitation that the White House has to accept or reject?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, wi=
th all due respect to the Chairman, if he has an interest in a hearing abou=
t false narratives as it relates to the Iran deal, then I've got some sugge=
stions for people that they should swear in.&nbsp; In fact, some
 members of the committee actually may have some light to shed on this.&nbs=
p; Congressman Ken Buck from Colorado promised in August of 2015 that Iran =
would get $100 billion to $200 billion in sanctions relief.&nbsp; Congressm=
an Buck is either wrong or lying, and he can
 discuss that with the committee.&nbsp; He's a member of the committee, so =
presumably he knows where the hearing room is, so he can just show up at th=
e appointed time and explain his false declaration.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul Gosar -- I assume I'm =
pronouncing that correctly -- he was quoted in September of 2015, saying th=
at this would provide immediate access to approximately $100 billion.&nbsp;=
 Again, we now know -- we can verify that's not true.&nbsp; So again,
 I don&#8217;t know if Mr. Gosar was just wildly misinformed or was lying t=
o the American public.&nbsp; But presumably, if he feels so strongly about =
this issue, he can explain himself under oath before the committee.&nbsp; H=
e serves on the committee, too, so it shouldn&#8217;t
 be too hard to arrange his schedule.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cynthia Lummis, congresswom=
an -- she explained that, in September of 2015, she claimed that the propos=
ed deal &quot;will lead to a nuclear-armed Iran.&quot;&nbsp; That, of cours=
e, has not turned out to be true.&nbsp; And, in fact, we can verify that th=
at
 is false.&nbsp; So Congresswoman Lummis serves on the committee.&nbsp; Why=
 don&#8217;t we swear her in and explain where she got this information.&nb=
sp; And she can explain whether she was just wrong or lying.&nbsp; She may =
also explain why she continues to make this argument.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what the=
 protocol is for swearing in members of the United States Senate to partici=
pate in these kinds of hearings, but there are any number of senators who c=
ould participate.&nbsp; Senator Cruz could certainly participate.&nbsp;
 He claimed, in August of 2015, over $100 billion will flow into Iran as a =
result of the deal.&nbsp; We've got Senator Tom Cotton, who I know has a sp=
ecial relationship with the Supreme Leader, so maybe he's got some interest=
ing insight into the deal that he would
 like to share with the committee.&nbsp; He said that the deal &quot;gives =
them&quot; -- meaning, Iran -- &quot;$150 billion of sanctions relief.&quot=
;&nbsp; Not true.&nbsp; Senator Cotton, wildly wrong or lying.&nbsp; And so=
 let's have Chairman Chaffetz get to the bottom of this.&nbsp; Maybe the Am=
erican
 people do want to actually understand the Republican false narrative about=
 the Iran deal.&nbsp; So we would welcome the opportunity for those members=
 of Congress to explain themselves.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth is, what the admi=
nistration has said about the Iran deal, what Mr. Rhodes has said about the=
 Iran deal, what the President of the United States has said about the Iran=
 deal has come true.&nbsp; Our critics said that Iran would
 never go along with an agreement.&nbsp; They did.&nbsp; They signed on the=
 dotted line. Our critics said that there would never be a way to verify th=
at Iran would live up to the terms of the agreement.&nbsp; We know they did=
.&nbsp; International, impartial inspectors did exactly
 that, and they were given the access that they needed to confirm that Iran=
 had lived up to their end of the bargain.&nbsp; And our critics said -- an=
d I just recited many of them -- that Iran would get, as Steve Scalise, who=
 could also testify, said that Iran would
 get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief.&nbsp; That's fals=
e.&nbsp; That's not true.&nbsp; Even Iran says that that's not true.&nbsp; =
In fact, they're saying that they are hoping that they can get access to mo=
re money.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So again, I don&#8217;t kno=
w whether our critics were just wildly misinformed, mistaken, or lying.&nbs=
p; But if Republicans are interested in getting to the bottom of this, then=
 they should just swear in some members of their own conference and
 figure it out.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I ta=
ke that as a no.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think there are some people who have some explaining to do when it comes to=
 the wildly false accusations that they made about the Iran deal.&nbsp; And=
 it's not the administration; it's Republicans who are demonstrably
 wrong when it comes to the Iran deal.&nbsp; So we'll look at the letter, b=
ut I assume that -- if Congressman Chaffetz is actually interested in getti=
ng to the bottom of this deal, then I assume that similar letters were rece=
ived through the interoffice mail in
 the House of Representatives.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on=
e quick follow-up on that.&nbsp; You've taken issue with the more than -- t=
he predictions of more than $100 billion in sanctions relief.&nbsp; Do you =
know how much has actually resulted in --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 know it's a whole lot less than that.&nbsp; What we had said in the contex=
t of the deal before it went through, that the kind of benefit that Iran wa=
s likely to enjoy was something around $50 billion, but even a significant
 chunk of that money was committed to repaying debts that Iran owed.&nbsp; =
That's why you saw Iran's central bank governor come out and indicate that =
their expectations about the amount of sanctions relief that they would rec=
eive was around $30 billion.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t
 have an updated assessment to share in terms of the amount that they have =
actually received, but it is by all accounts far less than the false critic=
ism that was put forward by Republicans.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any rea=
ction now that Rousseff in Brazil has been suspended by the senate?&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Not any =
one that's different than I've shared from here a couple of times.&nbsp; Th=
is is an outcome that many observers expected.&nbsp; And the President does=
 continue to have confidence in the durability of Brazil's democratic
 institutions to withstand the political turmoil there.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone =
in the White House reaching out to the acting President?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'm not =
aware of any calls that have been placed by the White House to the acting P=
resident's office.&nbsp; But you might check with the State Department to s=
ee if there have been any sort of diplomatic conversations.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on =
the global steel glut that President Obama spoke about with Australia PM Tu=
rnbull, as the readout said last night.&nbsp; We saw the comments from USTR=
 and Penny Pritzker last month, but does this suggest that there is some ne=
w
 White House initiative that might be going on?&nbsp; A broader initiative =
to tackle the glut?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think what both Ambassador Froman and Secretary Pritzker made clear in thos=
e statements is that the United States is working both bilaterally and thro=
ugh multilateral institutions, including the OECD, to build
 a policy consensus on addressing the excess capacity in the steel market a=
nd some other industries as well.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we're going to continue =
to pursue vigorous international engagement as part of a broader effort tha=
t includes aggressive enforcement right here at home.&nbsp; So, for instanc=
e, the United States government has initiated an historic number
 of trade remedy proceedings in 2015, assessing more than $45 million in pe=
nalties on importers of steel products for violating their obligation to pa=
y anti-dumping and countervailing duties.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the enforcement of these=
 rules is something that the administration takes quite seriously, and it's=
 also an important part of our foreign policy.&nbsp; So when President Obam=
a is on the phone with world leaders, including the leader
 of Australia, we're talking about a range of issues.&nbsp; We're talking a=
bout important national security issues; we're talking about broader econom=
ic issues; but we're also talking about the importance of addressing someth=
ing as technical as excess capacity in
 steel.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I think those who fo=
llow this issue closely will recognize that that's not a particularly surpr=
ising development. But for those who don't, this should be a revealing look=
 at the priority that the President places on enforcing
 trade agreements.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, P=
rime Minister Turnbull told the press in Australia that Obama advised him t=
hat the new time frame for TPP would be at the end of the year, after the e=
lections.&nbsp; And that sort of contradicts what President Obama said in
 Germany.&nbsp; He said he thought it could be done after the primaries.&nb=
sp; So does the White House see the new congressional window for TPP is in =
doubt in the lame duck?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
don't have any more information to share about the conversation between Pri=
me Minister Turnbull and President Obama.&nbsp; Our view is that Congress s=
hould act as quickly as possible to implement this agreement; that
 delaying the implementation of the agreement only puts off the significant=
 benefits that American businesses and American workers can enjoy as a resu=
lt of the agreement.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, once this deal=
 is implemented, we'll conduct the work of cutting 18,000 taxes that other =
countries impose on American goods.&nbsp; So the longer that Congress delay=
s the implementation of the TPP the longer American businesses
 and American goods will be subject to these 18,000 taxes that other countr=
ies impose on American products.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the good news is that ma=
ny Republicans on Capitol Hill share the President&#8217;s view that cuttin=
g those taxes would be good for the American economy and they&#8217;d be go=
od for American businesses and it would be good for American workers.&nbsp;
 So we're going to work with those Republicans to identify the most expedit=
ious timeframe possible for Congress to do the work that's necessary to imp=
lement this agreement.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jordan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; I want to ask about Merrick Garland&#8217;s upcoming speech at=
 a high school commencement.&nbsp; This is a little bit unusual for a Supre=
me Court nominee.&nbsp; And I'm wondering if he&#8217;s going to be specifi=
cally addressing the
 nomination fight during his speech to students.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; He will =
not, Jordan.&nbsp; He will be specifically addressing the class of 2016 at =
Niles West.&nbsp; Obviously, he is an alum of that fine institution, and he=
 was invited by the principal of the school to deliver the commencement
 address.&nbsp; And obviously that community, and that high school in parti=
cular, is quite proud of the accomplishments of what probably is now their =
most famous graduate.&nbsp; And so it seemed like a good opportunity for hi=
m to address the class of 2016.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had an opportunity to tal=
k to him about this a couple of weeks ago, and I know that he&#8217;s very =
much looking forward to going back and reliving some old high school memori=
es, but also having an opportunity hopefully to impart some
 wisdom and inspiration to the class of 2016.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any mor=
e details on the subjects he&#8217;s going to speak about during that?<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, you&=
#8217;ll have to show up and find out.&nbsp; It should be fun.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Racquel.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou, Josh.&nbsp; So President Dilma, as was mentioned before, she was suspen=
ded from office for the duration of her impeachment trial.&nbsp; Michel Tem=
er, who was her Vice President, became now the acting President with author=
ity
 to appoint ministers and enact policies.&nbsp; How does the U.S. governmen=
t view this impeachment process?&nbsp; And also, what does the White House =
expect from this new government?&nbsp; Will President Obama call the acting=
 President, Michel Temer?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#8217;=
m not aware of any planned calls, but if a call like that were to take plac=
e, we would certainly let you know.&nbsp; As a government, we intend to res=
pect the government institutions and traditions and procedures that the
 Brazilian government follows for governing that country.&nbsp; That&#8217;=
s what we would expect other countries to do when they&#8217;re observing o=
ur legislative process, for example.&nbsp; All too often, a legislative pro=
cess here in the United States doesn&#8217;t work nearly as
 rapidly as we would like, and there may be other countries who get a littl=
e frustrated about that kind of inaction.&nbsp; But we assured them, invari=
ably, that the President is pretty frustrated by how slow that process work=
s as well.&nbsp; But our expectation is that
 we&#8217;re going to follow the rules and laws and institutions of the Uni=
ted States government in handling the affairs of the United States.&nbsp; A=
nd we certainly are going to respect the Brazilian government as they follo=
w the rules and traditions for governing their
 country, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll do.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One mor=
e question.&nbsp; The White House says Brazil has a mature democracy, and t=
oday the suspended President, Dilma Rousseff, said that Brazil has a young =
democracy and called it a coup.&nbsp; Does the government, the U.S. governm=
ent
 have any concern that this impeachment process is following the Brazilian =
laws?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I&=
#8217;m certainly no expert on the Brazilian constitution, but our expectat=
ion is that the institutions of the Brazilian government that have been bui=
lt up over the last few decades are sufficiently mature and durable
 to withstand the political turmoil that that country is facing right now.&=
nbsp; And that is not to downplay the obvious significance of the events of=
 the last few weeks, but it is an effort to convey to the Brazilian governm=
ent and to the Brazilian people that
 the United States values the important relationship that our two countries=
 have.&nbsp; We cooperate on a wide range of issues, and the President had =
the opportunity to visit Brazil in his first term, and that was an opportun=
ity for him to state affirmatively, early
 in his presidency, about the importance of the relationship between our tw=
o countries.&nbsp; That, of course, was renewed when President Rousseff vis=
ited the White House not too long ago.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the United States will s=
tand with Brazil, even through these challenging times, and we continue to =
have confidence in the capacity of the government to rely on their well-est=
ablished traditions and laws to manage their way through
 this challenging time for their country&#8217;s politics.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James.&nbsp; Nice to see yo=
u today.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a little while.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewis=
e.&nbsp; Yes, sir.&nbsp; Three subjects I want to cover, very quickly on ea=
ch one.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">First, the remarks this w=
eek by the FBI Director, James Comey, in a briefing to reporters at the Bur=
eau, in which he once again described what he has alternately termed the &#=
8220;Ferguson effect&#8221; and the &#8220;viral video
 effect.&#8221;&nbsp; Previously, when he discussed those matters, it led t=
o direct rebuke from the White House, both from this podium and you, and fr=
om the President himself.&nbsp; But the FBI Director appears to be doubling=
 down on those comments in his most recent statement
 to reporters saying -- and I quote, &#8220;There&#8217;s a perception that=
 police are less likely to do the marginal, additional policing that suppre=
sses crime -- the getting out of your car at two in the morning and saying =
to a group of guys, hey, what are you doing
 here?&#8221;&nbsp; I take it that in the time since this was last an issue=
 between the White House and Director Comey in October and November of last=
 year, nothing has arisen in crime statistics or any other external phenome=
na to cause the White House to now side with
 Director Comey in interpreting these events.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Ja=
mes, I anticipated that somebody might ask this question today.&nbsp; I thi=
nk it&#8217;s certainly a relevant one, and I had an opportunity to talk to=
 the President about it a little bit this morning.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what I can tell you is t=
hat we have observed over the last year or so an uptick, in some communitie=
s across the country, in violent crime rates.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s a sour=
ce of some concern.&nbsp; And last year when this potential trend was
 first noticed, the President tasked his Attorney General with supporting t=
he law enforcement agencies in those communities to help them confront the =
challenge of fighting that potential increase in violent crime.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And there are a number of=
 steps that the Department of Justice has taken.&nbsp; Earlier this spring,=
 the Department of Justice announced that the U.S. Marshals Service had con=
ducted a high-impact national fugitive apprehension
 initiative that was focused on the country&#8217;s most violent offenders.=
&nbsp; And that six-week initiative resulted in the arrest of more than 8,0=
00 gang members, sex offenders, and other violent criminals.&nbsp; That is =
an indication of the important role that federal
 law enforcement can play in supporting the work of local law enforcement i=
n these communities.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#8217;s also true, tho=
ugh, is that, more broadly, crime rates across the country remain at or nea=
r historic lows.&nbsp; So the challenge for the Department of Justice has b=
een to try to focus on those communities where the uptick has been
 noticed and try to blunt the impact of that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, as it relates to getti=
ng to the undermining cause of those upticks in violence, there still is no=
 evidence to substantiate the claim that the increase in violent crime is r=
elated to an unwillingness of police officers to do their
 job.&nbsp; And I know that this is an observation that the Fraternal Order=
 of Police has made in indicating that they don&#8217;t believe that their =
members are afraid to get out of their cars and do their jobs.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so the President&#8217;=
s point is that as we consider policy approaches to addressing those commun=
ities where we&#8217;ve seen an uptick in violent crime, we need to be maki=
ng policy decisions that are based on facts and evidence, and not
 anecdotes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so =
what we have before us then is the spectacle of the FBI Director twice in s=
ix months, before the national press, making assertions about crime and inc=
idents of crime that are, in the view of the White House, based not on
 the facts or the evidence, but on anecdotes, and doing so in a very public=
 way.&nbsp; And so the resulting question is why this doesn&#8217;t shake y=
our confidence in the FBI Director.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think in part because the FBI Director actually made clear that he didn&#82=
17;t know exactly what was going on, either.&nbsp; And I think, look, the f=
act is, this is a complicated issue, and that&#8217;s exactly the way that =
he
 described it.&nbsp; He said, &#8220;Why does Dallas see a dramatic spike a=
nd Houston doesn&#8217;t?&#8221;&nbsp; He acknowledged -- he continued sayi=
ng, &#8220;It&#8217;s a complicated, hard issue, but the stakes couldn&#821=
7;t be higher.&#8221;&nbsp; Later on, he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know fo=
r sure what&#8217;s going on, but
 something has happened.&#8221;&nbsp; Clearly, it has.&nbsp; We just need t=
o make sure that our policy approach to addressing this situation is rooted=
 in evidence and facts.&nbsp; And Director Comey has indicated -- and I thi=
nk this was sort of part of the reason that this discussion
 arose -- is that Director Comey indicated that he was seeking out addition=
al information and additional evidence about what was exactly happening in =
these communities.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it&#8217;s clear that w=
e don&#8217;t have enough evidence at this point to substantiate the claim =
that police officers not doing their job is the reason for this uptick.&nbs=
p; I think the President&#8217;s concern actually is really focused on rebu=
king
 this false choice between protecting civil rights and fighting crime.&nbsp=
; The truth is, the vast majority of law enforcement officers that put on t=
he uniform every day do both.&nbsp; They both are committed to fighting cri=
me and doing it in a fair way.&nbsp; The best law
 enforcement agencies have made clear and have funded training and put in p=
lace policies that actually make it easier for their officers to pursue the=
ir job to fight crime and to do it in a fair way.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so the President is qui=
te interested at a federal level of figuring out what additional support ca=
n be provided by the federal government to local law enforcement agencies a=
s they pursue both tasks:&nbsp; fighting crime but also protecting
 civil rights.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two oth=
er subjects, much more quickly, I hope.&nbsp; Returning to Iran and Ben Rho=
des, did Mr. Rhodes seek approval from anyone in the White House management=
 before agreeing to allow Mr. Samuels of the New York Times Magazine to sha=
dow
 him and quote him as he did?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; There wa=
s a decision made by the White House to cooperate with Mr. Samuels&#8217;s =
reporting.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And tha=
t decision involved individuals aside from Rhodes himself?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Correct.=
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has Mr.=
 Rhodes been rebuked by anyone in the White House management structure foll=
owing the publication of that article?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Not that=
 I'm aware of.&nbsp; Mr. Rhodes is somebody who has served this White House=
 and this President with distinction.&nbsp; And that's true when you consid=
er that he led the effort to open up a diplomatic channel with the Cubans
 to bring about an effort to normalize the relations between our two countr=
ies.&nbsp; Mr. Rhodes was at the forefront of our policy effort to transfor=
m our diplomatic relationship with Burma and to encourage the democracy tha=
t was forming there.&nbsp; And Ben has also
 played a leading role in trying to establish these programs that are focus=
ed on cultivating young leaders in regions across the country and helping t=
hem -- giving them access to the United States and cementing our relationsh=
ip with them.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Ben has had a very broad=
 policy portfolio at the White House and he has carried out his responsibil=
ities honorably and with distinction.&nbsp; And I think everybody here at t=
he White House is quite proud to work with Mr. Rhodes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no =
one has told him that they considered his comments in The New York Times Ma=
gazine article to have been ill-advised?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Not that=
 I'm aware. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Final q=
uestion on him, and following up on the earlier questions about the request=
 for his testimony by the House Oversight Committee.&nbsp; I take it from y=
our comments in saying that you're reviewing the letter from Congressman Ch=
affetz
 that the White House is not reflexively asserting an executive privilege c=
laim with respect to this request.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That's c=
orrect.&nbsp; This has nothing to do with executive privilege.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last su=
bject.&nbsp; Both you and the President have, for a long time now, months n=
ow, jettisoned the standard posture of White House officials and the White =
House press briefing with respect to the opposing party&#8217;s nominating =
process.&nbsp;
 Normally, it has been my experience in Washington, the White House waits u=
ntil there&#8217;s a nominee from the other party, doesn&#8217;t wade into =
the process, doesn&#8217;t comment on specific candidates or what they have=
 to say, and says typically, the time will come for
 that.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">That posture has been jet=
tisoned here for months now with respect to Donald Trump, long before he cl=
eared the field in his party.&nbsp; And one of the sets of comments by the =
President and others here has been to the
 effect that Mr. Trump&#8217;s candidacy is already creating a great deal o=
f consternation amongst foreign leaders and allies of the United States who=
 are supposedly conveying these sentiments and these concerns to the White =
House and the State Department and so
 on.&nbsp; Put very simply, does President Obama view that the election of =
Donald Trump to the presidency would constitute a direct threat to the nati=
onal security of the United States?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, le=
t me say it this way.&nbsp; President Obama has been asked on a number of o=
ccasions to weigh in on Mr. Trump&#8217;s candidacy, and I think more often=
 than not, the President has shared his opinions on this.&nbsp; So what I h=
ave
 tried to do is to choose my moments carefully and making a point about the=
 impact of the election on the ability of President Obama to do his job.&nb=
sp; I've also made clear that President Obama&#8217;s priority is focused o=
n protecting the important progress that we've
 made over the last seven or eight years.&nbsp; And his interest in the ele=
ction is rooted in the idea that he wants his successor to be somebody who&=
#8217;s committed to building on that progress and not tearing it down.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's the way that he =
has engaged in the debate so far.&nbsp; And the President has certainly exp=
ressed concerns in the past about some of the rhetoric that a number of Rep=
ublican presidential candidates have used.&nbsp; And the President
 has observed that those kinds of comments and that kind of rhetoric does h=
ave an impact on our national security, and certainly has an impact on our =
standing in the world.&nbsp; It certainly has an impact on our relationship=
s with other countries, and the President
 has observed that it's not at all unusual for world leaders to ask questio=
ns about comments that were uttered on the campaign trail.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it clearly is having an =
impact.&nbsp; But I'll let the President, at the next opportunity that he h=
as to take questions, choose to describe what impact he believes electing M=
r. Trump would have on our national security.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak f=
or yourself then.&nbsp; Do you see him as a threat to national security?<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
try to choose my spots, and I don&#8217;t think I'm going to choose this on=
e.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead Suzanne.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To foll=
ow up on that, Donald Trump has met with Republican leaders throughout the =
day here in Washington -- Reince Priebus and Speaker Ryan.&nbsp; And they'v=
e come out of these meetings and they've described them as productive, and
 that they're really uniting around their core principles -- at least that'=
s what they're saying publicly -- to deny, what they say, is a third Obama =
administration.&nbsp; Is there any concern from the White House or allies o=
f the White House that Democrats are
 now falling behind now that it seems some of the Republicans are kind of t=
rying to coalesce around Trump?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; You cert=
ainly have better-informed, more-experienced, and surely higher-paid analys=
ts who can examine the fault lines of the Republican Party.&nbsp; But even =
as a novice, I suspect that -- well, even the joint statement that
 I read with some amusement today from Speaker Ryan and the Republican nomi=
nee, presumptive nominee, indicate that this was merely their first meeting=
.&nbsp; So I'm certainly not surprised to hear that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think what I find to be i=
nteresting about this process is that Speaker Ryan has described his view t=
hat the entire Republican Party, including the presumptive presidential nom=
inee, should rally behind the agenda that Speaker Ryan
 has put forward.&nbsp; I think the reason that he may be encountering some=
 difficulty is that he's the Speaker of the House.&nbsp; He should already =
be using the responsibility that he has to implement that agenda.&nbsp; And=
 that is not at all what Republicans have done.&nbsp;
 That certainly is not what Leader McConnell has done on the Senate side, a=
nd it's not what Speaker Ryan has done on the House side.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">There are any number of i=
mportant, critical priorities that Republicans could be focused on in the H=
ouse of Representatives right now and in the United States Senate that are =
an important part of the job they have
 right now.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Republicans seem much more focused on the =
elections than they do on embracing the responsibility to deal with the res=
ults of the last elections that gave them a majority in the United States C=
ongress.&nbsp; But right now, we see Republicans
 much more focused on their relationship with the presumptive nominee than =
they are on things like passing a budget or passing funding for the Zika vi=
rus to avert a public health disaster, or passing much-needed funding to re=
lieve the financial turmoil on Puerto
 Rico that's having a negative impact on 3 million Americans who live there=
.&nbsp; We certainly haven&#8217;t seen any action in either House of Congr=
ess on funding programs to fight opioid addiction.&nbsp; We see the House t=
rying to take victory laps on legislation that doesn&#8217;t
 actually provide any money to ensure that any more people can get access t=
o treatment.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So if Republicans had muc=
h conviction about their agenda, they'd be trying to implement it now as op=
posed to trying to convince other members of the Republican Party or the pr=
esumptive Republican nominee that what
 they propose is the right thing to do.&nbsp; If they thought it was the ri=
ght thing to do, why wouldn&#8217;t they be trying to implement it right no=
w?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">All the things that I've =
just outlined are things that Republicans at one point or another have indi=
cated is a priority to them, and all those are things that I have said Pres=
ident Obama believes are a priority.&nbsp;
 In fact, we have been working hard to try to cajole Congress to act on a b=
udget, to act on Zika, to act on Puerto Rico, to act on opioids.&nbsp; But =
they haven&#8217;t.&nbsp; So I think that's why there might be skepticism b=
oth inside the Republican Party and outside the
 Republican Party that Republicans actually do have a governing agenda, bec=
ause they've had an opportunity to present it and implement it, and they ha=
ven&#8217;t done it.&nbsp; In fact, on this scorecard that I've just laid o=
ut, they haven&#8217;t done anything.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But d=
o you think it's just a show -- I mean, this show of unity, do you think it=
's genuine?&nbsp; And if it is, does that signal something that's even perh=
aps a little bit more dangerous from the administration's
 point of view?<o:p></o:p></p>

ola, our investments and the capacity that other countries have to confront=
 public health challenges ultimately has an impact on the public health and=
 wellbeing and safety of the American
 people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So we know that the prepo=
nderance of the Zika virus is much more intense in Brazil.&nbsp; And so we =
certainly stand ready to help them confront that challenge.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As it relates to the Olym=
pics, I think hosting the Summer Olympics is a significant undertaking for =
any country that chooses to assume that challenge.&nbsp; And the truth is, =
the world is rooting for Brazil to succeed
 in hosting a Games that go off without a hitch.&nbsp; Ultimately, we want =
to be supportive of the effort of the Brazilians to host a Games where the =
venues are ready, where the Games take place safely and securely, and where=
 we get to see the world's best athletes
 compete.&nbsp; So we're rooting for Brazil to succeed -- until it comes do=
wn to the actual competition, in which case we're going to be cheering for =
the Americans.&nbsp; (Laughter.)

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh,=
 obviously the President has been outspoken about gun violence, and he spok=
e out when the incident with Trayvon Martin happened.&nbsp; I'm curious if =
the White House has any reaction to George Zimmerman, the
 killer of Trayvon Martin, auctioning off, or trying to auction off the gun=
 that was used to kill Trayvon Martin online.&nbsp; That since has been tak=
en down, it appears.&nbsp; But any reaction to it appears that Zimmerman wa=
s using the gun to try to profit off that
 notoriety? <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I don&=
#8217;t have a reaction to it.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And o=
ne last follow-up for you.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure you're going to give a few=
 more details on the State Dinner.&nbsp; We're curious if the White House f=
eels that it was getting a five-for-one deal with the Nordic
 leaders.&nbsp; When it comes to state dinners, there's that one-on-one att=
ention.&nbsp; And for those who perceive that this could be a snub, or perc=
eived as a snub, your thoughts on that reaction to the fact that you're get=
ting this five-for-one deal?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Look, =
this merely is an opportunity for the President to repay the hospitality th=
at he enjoyed when he traveled to Europe a year or two ago and met with the=
 Nordic leaders in Europe.&nbsp; The United States
 obviously has an important relationship with these five countries.&nbsp; F=
or those of you scoring along at home, this is Sweden, Norway, Finland, Ice=
land and Denmark.&nbsp; And these are all countries that the United States =
has important working relationships with.&nbsp;
 So there are a range of issues related to the economy and to national secu=
rity that we'll surely discuss -- that the President will surely discuss wi=
th his counterparts.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And there's an opportunit=
y to talk about climate change.&nbsp; These countries, in some cases, are d=
ealing with more persistent and severe impacts than we are here in the lowe=
r 48.&nbsp; And demonstrating our ongoing commitment
 to implementing the international agreement to fight carbon pollution will=
 also be a subject of some discussion.&nbsp; So the President and First Lad=
y are quite proud to host the leaders of these countries here at the White =
House tomorrow.&nbsp; And it will be filled
 with all the pomp and circumstance that we typically reserve for countries=
 with whom the United States has important relationships.&nbsp; And the Uni=
ted States certainly has important relationships that are worth investing i=
n with these five countries.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to=
 follow up on the Trump question.&nbsp; Just a minute ago, when you were an=
swering questions about Donald Trump, you sounded perhaps a bit dismissive =
of him, and you were emphasizing the problems within the Republican Party,
 and so on and so forth.&nbsp; But the fact remains that he has won more Re=
publican votes during the primary process than anyone else.&nbsp; And are y=
ou --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; As he fr=
equently repeats on television.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, i=
t's true.&nbsp; And again, are you taking him seriously enough?&nbsp; Is th=
e White House taking him seriously enough, or you being too dismissive of h=
im?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, lo=
ok, first of all, I think that's a question that can primarily be posed to =
the Democratic candidates for President, because they are the ones who are =
competing in the election.&nbsp; And based on the robust, competitive
 primary process that has unfolded over the last several months here on the=
 Democratic side, it seems quite clear that both Democratic candidates take=
 their potential Republican opponent quite seriously.&nbsp; And the Preside=
nt himself stood at this podium last
 Friday and talked about how the stakes of this election were quite signifi=
cant, and it shouldn&#8217;t be reduced to a reality television program but=
 rather should be subject to an intense debate around the issues and around=
 the challenges that the next President
 will have to confront on behalf of the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the President certainly =
takes this quite seriously.&nbsp; And as I mentioned in response to James's=
 question, the President's principal concern here is we've worked really ha=
rd to dig ourselves out of a terrible economic hole over the
 last seven years.&nbsp; The President has worked hard to rebuild our relat=
ionship with our allies and partners around the world in a way that advance=
s our interests and strengthens our national security.&nbsp; And the Presid=
ent doesn&#8217;t want to see that eroded.&nbsp; In fact,
 he wants to make sure that he is succeeded by a President who recognizes t=
hat progress and is committed to building on it.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And so the President is g=
oing to be engaged in the campaign for that reason.&nbsp; The President und=
erstands the stakes of this election, and I think that means that everybody=
 who's participating in the election should
 be taken seriously.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So ag=
ain, this day of unity, or whatever you want to call it -- I don&#8217;t wa=
nt to do PR for them -- you said --

<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In di=
scussing that, you don&#8217;t take that seriously, that, in fact, these le=
aders have come together -- that they do have perhaps an advantage because =
their nominee has been determined before the Democrat?&nbsp; I
 mean, I hate to -- six months from now, if we're talking about this, there=
 could be a whole bit of evidence that suggests that the White House didn&#=
8217;t take this seriously enough.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
again, I think the people who primarily should take this seriously are the =
competitors in the election.&nbsp; And President Obama is keenly aware of t=
he significant stakes of the outcome of the next
 election.&nbsp; And I assure you that over the next six months the Preside=
nt will be actively engaged in that debate.&nbsp; And he looks forward to h=
is opportunity to engage more deeply.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think my point is -- ag=
ain, you guys have far more-experienced, far better-sourced, and far better=
-paid analysts who can offer up their own insight about the disruption with=
in the Republican Party.&nbsp; But I would
 just point out that even in the supposed statement of unity there's an obs=
ervation that we will be having additional discussions.&nbsp; And the state=
ment closes by indicating that this was our first meeting.&nbsp; So again, =
there is more work to be done there, and I
 think that's evident from the statement that the two men issued.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And o=
n the President's schedule today I don&#8217;t think there's anything reall=
y public on the schedule about what he's doing.&nbsp; And the schedule this=
 week feels -- there was the national security meeting and bill
 signing -- but it feels to me like -- again, in my limited experience here=
 -- that it's relatively light.&nbsp; And while you were very critical of w=
hat the Republicans aren&#8217;t doing on Zika and Garland and other things=
, can you give us any more insight as to today
 exactly what the President is doing with any of these issues, since there'=
s nothing being said publicly about what is it that he's doing?&nbsp; You t=
alked to him about the issue you brought up about policing, but what else a=
re you doing today?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
the President does have a little bit of a lighter day than usual today, pri=
ncipally because he's got a very busy day tomorrow with five world leaders =
who he will be hosting here at the White
 House.&nbsp; I'd also point out that the President is going to deliver his=
 commencement address at Rutgers University on Sunday, over the weekend.&nb=
sp; This is the 250th commencement exercises of that fine institution, and =
the President is looking forward to speaking
 to it.&nbsp; He also has got a speech he's got to work on, so he's going t=
o spend some time working on that speech for Sunday, as well.<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's =
got a team of speechwriters, though.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Yeah, =
but I think, as April noted, the President tends to spend quite a bit more =
time on these commencement addresses because he takes them quite personally=
. So the President is being ably assisted
 by a couple members of the speechwriting team, but he's putting a lot of h=
is own time and energy into this.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in=
 terms of information being presented in his public schedule, he's not bein=
g less transparent, you would say?&nbsp; Or he's not slowing down -- he's, =
as he said, keeping it all on the floor in the final months?&nbsp;
 It's just a clerical thing, perhaps, that the schedule doesn&#8217;t revea=
l as much as it used to?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No, I =
think I acknowledged that the President's schedule today was a little bit q=
uieter, but that reflects the fact that he President has got a very full da=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; As you=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I app=
reciate that.&nbsp; But can you give us a little bit more there?&nbsp; I me=
an, there was this pretty overt action, this maritime operation near that C=
hinese-occupied reef in the South China Sea.&nbsp; The U.S. and Australia
 coming quite close with warships.&nbsp; I mean, that's happening.&nbsp; Th=
e President is headed to Asia next week.&nbsp; The steel glut was named in =
that readout.&nbsp; Obviously, China is the one who's been getting a lot of=
 blame for overproduction there.&nbsp; Would you say that
 tensions are on the rise with China?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I woul=
d not describe it that way.&nbsp; Our concerns about China's activities in =
the South China Sea are well-documented, and our concerns are concerns that=
 we have raised both publicly and privately with
 Chinese officials at a range of levels.&nbsp; The freedom of navigation op=
eration that was carried out by U.S. forces earlier this week is relatively=
 routine.&nbsp; We've done at least a couple of times just in the last four=
 or five months.&nbsp; And it is not intended to
 be a provocative act.&nbsp; It merely is a demonstration of a principle th=
at the President has laid out on a number of occasions, which is that the U=
nited States will fly, operate and sail anywhere that international law all=
ows.&nbsp; And this operation was undertaken
 consistent with that principle.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And the concerns and the =
tensions that exist around the South China Sea don't actually directly invo=
lve the United States.&nbsp; The United States is not a claimant to any of =
the land features in the South China Sea.&nbsp;
 Our concern lies principally with the need for those parties that do have =
competing claims to resolve them through diplomacy.&nbsp; And we certainly =
do not want to see the tensions increase because of the risk that that coul=
d pose to the extensive international
 commerce that's conducted in that region of the world.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I think this also unde=
rscores the complexity of the U.S. relationship with Australia.&nbsp; Austr=
alia is one of our closest allies, and we work with them on a range of issu=
es.&nbsp; And I'll let the Australians describe
 the concerns that they may have, or the impact on their national security =
that tensions in the South China Sea may have.&nbsp; But obviously the Aust=
ralian economy is affected by the glut of capacity in the steel industry in=
 much the same way that the U.S. is,
 as well.&nbsp; I know that Prime Minister Turnbull has indicated his own p=
riority for ensuring the international trade is conducted fairly.&nbsp; And=
 that common ground is the basis for the kinds of conversations that Presid=
ent Obama and he have on a fairly regular
 basis.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So these are -- I think a=
t the same time, the thing that sort of underlies all of this is we have be=
en able to work with China in pursuit of other priorities.&nbsp; And we've =
talked about North Korea and the influence
 that the Chinese government has with North Korea.&nbsp; The sanctions that=
 were imposed by the United Nations against North Korea that went further t=
han any set of previous sanctions that have been imposed on them were only =
possible because the United States and
 China were able to cooperate in implementing them.&nbsp; Obviously, we've =
worked with China to complete the Iran deal that we discussed earlier.&nbsp=
; That would not have been possible without China's active participation in=
 the discussions, but also, China had to be
 helpful in terms of imposing and enforcing the sanctions that compelled Ir=
an to the negotiating table in the first place.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think this illustrates=
 that there are differences of opinion that we have with China, and I&#8217=
;m certainly not seeking to downplay them.&nbsp; They&#8217;re significant,=
 and they have significant consequences for our economy in particular.<o:p>=
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they have not prevented=
 the United States and China from being able to work effectively together t=
o pursue other areas where we&#8217;re in better agreement.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why=
 go out of your way to not name China?&nbsp; I mean, that&#8217;s obviously=
 who you were talking about.&nbsp; And then that&#8217;s where the point of=
 tension is.&nbsp; I mean, if you&#8217;re having a destroyer go near a ree=
f you&#8217;re concerned are going
 to turn into an airstrip to land jets on, and that&#8217;s a U.S. destroye=
r, I mean, that&#8217;s a pretty overt signal.&nbsp; But you don&#8217;t wa=
nt to say China directly.&nbsp; I mean, it seems like an effort, a very con=
certed effort to avoid appearing to look confrontational.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think we&#8217;re not just trying to avoid appearing confrontational.&nbsp;=
 I think I said in my previous answer that we certainly did not intend for =
that to be considered a provocative act.&nbsp; So I think we&#8217;re being=
 pretty
 explicit about that.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve been explicit about that fact, =
both in public and in private, at a range of levels.&nbsp; And so --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thi=
s doesn&#8217;t -- the timeframe, with the President headed to the region, =
obviously everything is getting scrutinized in the region.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Sure, an=
d that&#8217;s --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that=
 was a factor here, or no?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 know that Vietnam in particular has some concerns about competing claims i=
n the South China Sea.&nbsp; We know that Vietnam is a signatory to the Tra=
ns-Pacific Partnership, and we certainly are looking to broaden
 our economic relationship with Vietnam.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a rapidly grow=
ing middle class in Vietnam, and U.S. companies could benefit from the oppo=
rtunity to do business in that part of the world.&nbsp; That would be good =
for the U.S. economy, it certainly would be good
 for U.S. workers, and the President is committed to pursuing that priority=
 as he travels overseas.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And look, we know that Chin=
a sees the same potential benefit if they can increase their ability to do =
business inside of Vietnam.&nbsp; That&#8217;s actually the essence of the =
argument that the President has made with regard to the Trans-Pacific
 Partnership -- that if the United States and the rest of the international=
 community doesn&#8217;t go in and write the rules of the road for doing bu=
siness in Vietnam, then China will.&nbsp; And the benefits of the United St=
ates being a part of those rules of road, it
 means we&#8217;re going to have high labor standards, we&#8217;re going to=
 have higher human rights standards, higher environmental standards.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China hasn&#8217;t made tho=
se things a priority, and we know that if China is given an opportunity to =
get a foothold in Vietnam, they certainly are not going to be interested in=
 raising standards.&nbsp; You could even imagine a scenario where
 they might even allow those standards to be lowered even further. <o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there&#8217;s no denying=
 that at least when it comes to our relationship with Vietnam, there are si=
gnificant consequences for our relationship with China.&nbsp; But we never =
want to create a scenario in which we can&#8217;t pursue our common interes=
ts
 with China, and the President has been quite clear about that.&nbsp; And w=
e&#8217;ve been effective in implementing that strategy in a way that has h=
ad positive benefits for China and the United States.&nbsp; And, in fact, t=
hat&#8217;s why the other thing that we often say in describing
 our relationship with China is that we welcome a rising China.&nbsp; In fa=
ct, that&#8217;s the reason that we&#8217;re hopeful that they can be persu=
aded to abide by the international rules of the road when it comes to resol=
ving competing claims in the South China Sea.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you&#8217;re an econom=
y as large as China, when you&#8217;re as influential as China is, particul=
arly in that region of the world, then you benefit from the ability of disp=
utes to be resolved without going to war, and you benefit from disputes
 being resolved with the expectation that everybody is going to follow the =
rules.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s certainly the case that we make to China, and=
 I think that&#8217;s an indication of how we&#8217;re able to work with Ch=
ina, how we welcome a rising China.&nbsp; But look, we&#8217;re going
 to have our differences and we&#8217;re not going to shy away from express=
ing those.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick q=
uestion on Iran.&nbsp; With the Secretary of State in Europe, meeting with =
businesses, does the White House want to see more European banks do busines=
s in Iran?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
think what the White House wants is to fulfill our responsibility to intern=
ational financial institutions to describe to them exactly what is allowed =
and what&#8217;s not allowed when it comes to doing business with
 Iran.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s something that has been part of not just Secr=
etary Lew&#8217;s job description, but Secretary Kerry has gone to great le=
ngths to try to describe the rules of the road to international financial i=
nstitutions as well.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a couple of thing=
s that I think are relevant to point out here.&nbsp; One of the things that=
 these large -- that the heads of these banks say is that the United States=
 has been forceful in enforcing these sanctions, which is why
 we want to be sure that we are on the right side of the law here.&nbsp; Th=
at&#8217;s validation of what we have said here many times, which is that w=
e take sanctions enforcement quite seriously, and there are large financial=
 institutions that have had to pay big fines
 for circumventing those sanctions.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re quite serious abou=
t that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the second thing th=
at I would say is that Iran has expressed concerns about the fact that they=
&#8217;re not getting the kind of engagement with the international busines=
s community that they would like to see.&nbsp; And I think our response
 to that is simply that there certainly is more that Iran can do to encoura=
ge that kind of international investment, because that international invest=
ment is looking for a stable business climate in which to do business.&nbsp=
; And if you are routinely testing ballistic
 missiles that violate United Nations sanctions that govern your ballistic =
missile program, well, that's not going to inspire the confidence of busine=
ss leaders that this is a safe place to do business.&nbsp; If you are suppo=
rting terrorism around the world, that's
 not going to be particularly persuasive to business leaders that Iran is a=
 good place to make an investment.&nbsp; So there&#8217;s more that Iran ca=
n do --<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But are=
 you going to provide letters basically legally assuring these firms that t=
hey won't be prosecuted if they go ahead and do business?&nbsp; I mean, tha=
t's the level of insurance they want.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
guess I'd refer you to the State Department or the Treasury Department or m=
aybe even the Department of Justice in terms of what kind of assurances can=
 be provided to international companies about what is appropriate
 and what&#8217;s not when it comes to doing business with Iran.&nbsp; <o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But, look, the fact that =
you have the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State at differ=
ent points sitting down with business leaders from around the world, I thin=
k that is an indication that we take
 quite seriously the responsibility that we have to help people understand =
what the rules are, because they should know that we're going to enforce th=
em, but they should also know exactly what is allowable under the law that'=
s on the books.&nbsp; And that's what
 both Secretary Kerry and Secretary Lew have done. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh,=
 as you know, earlier this week, the lawsuit the Justice Department filed o=
n Monday against North Carolina&#8217;s anti-LGBT law is separate from the =
multiagency review of the measure.&nbsp; Do you have an update
 on that multiagency review?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
as we've discussed in here, this is a review that agencies are working on t=
ogether as they evaluate what impact this law would have on programs that a=
re funded by the federal government.&nbsp; The
 White House has been a part of that review.&nbsp; The Department of Justic=
e has been a part of that review.&nbsp; But all of that has been separate f=
rom the Department of Justice conclusion that they needed to take action to=
 enforce the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&nbsp; And
 what has been concluded as a result of that effort is that the administrat=
ion will not take action to withhold funding while this enforcement process=
 is playing out in the courts.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So these are two separate=
 actions that the government is taking, one sort of questioning, evaluating=
 this policy question about what impact the law has on funding, but also, s=
eparately, the Department of Justice
 has been engaged in a process of enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&n=
bsp; And while those are two separate processes, it is clear that the decis=
ion on the part of the Department of Justice to move forward with enforceme=
nt means that, while the process plays
 out, the administration will not be taking action to withhold funding.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have =
you given the state of North Carolina a heads-up prior to this briefing tha=
t they will not withhold federal funding as a result of that statute?<o:p><=
/o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I know=
 there&#8217;s been regular communication with state officials in North Car=
olina from a variety of agencies, but I can't speak to the details of any o=
f those conversations.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ad=
dition to the review of the North Carolina law, at least four agencies are =
also reviewing Mississippi&#8217;s religious freedom law that seems to enab=
le anti-LGBT discrimination.&nbsp; Has the same determination
 been made with respect to that law that there will be no withholding of fe=
deral funds as a result of that statute?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I'll c=
heck with my colleagues here about the status of that.&nbsp; I'm not aware =
that the Department of Justice has notified the state of Mississippi of any=
 potential enforcement actions as a result of
 that law, at least at this point.&nbsp; But I'll see if I can get you some=
 more specific guidance on that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And w=
hat would you say to critics who would say that by saying you're not going =
to withhold funding until the issue is resolved in the courts, that the adm=
inistration is not putting its full force in support
 of equal rights?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, =
I think the President has been quite outspoken in making clear that this is=
 a question of values, and when it comes to fighting for justice and fairne=
ss and fighting against discrimination, that's
 something the President is committed to and he&#8217;s made that a priorit=
y.&nbsp; And I think the value statement that the President has offered wit=
h regard to this law has been clear.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">But, look, as it relates =
to the more narrow question about the need to enforce the Civil Rights Act,=
 I think the Attorney General has been quite clear about the priorities for=
 enforcement that she has laid out and
 what impact that has on some people in North Carolina who right now might =
be feeling like the state government, at least, is not sufficiently committ=
ed to ensure equal treatment under the law.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So I found the Attorney G=
eneral&#8217;s words to be quite powerful.&nbsp; And as a native North Caro=
linian, she had a unique perspective on the situation.&nbsp; So I think any=
body who doubts that should take a minute to review
 her remarks.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank=
 you, Josh.&nbsp; Back on the top story today, this meeting between Paul Ry=
an and Donald Trump and the chaos we've sort of seen playing out in the Rep=
ublican Party.&nbsp; Yesterday, DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz
 told reporters that Democrats, after their primary, essentially wouldn&#82=
17;t have the same thing happen, that they would be unified, there wouldn't=
 be this divisiveness at the convention.&nbsp; But many supporters of Senat=
or Sanders have said that they won&#8217;t vote for
 Hillary Clinton if she is the Democratic nominee.&nbsp; And, at the same t=
ime, they&#8217;re also saying that -- he&#8217;s saying that if she comes =
out on top, it&#8217;s not really his responsibility to get his supporters =
behind her.&nbsp; And so the President, as the highest-ranking
 Democrat, he is the leader of the Democratic Party.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wonder=
ing what the President is going to do to bring the Democratic Party togethe=
r when his primary -- his party&#8217;s primary ends here very soon.<o:p></=
o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Look, I =
think the President will be making a case not just to Democrats but to inde=
pendents and Republicans across the country that they should support the pr=
esidential candidate who understands the progress that we&#8217;ve
 made over the last seven or eight years.&nbsp; And the President has been =
focused on implementing a strategy in the face of extreme Republic obstruct=
ion to focus on making economic investments that expand economic opportunit=
y for the middle class.&nbsp; The President
 has been focused on trying to use diplomacy to advance our interests aroun=
d the world.&nbsp; And at every step of the way, we&#8217;ve seen Republica=
ns try to block it.&nbsp; And I think that gives you a good sense of where =
the priorities are not just of this President but
 of the Democratic Party.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">And he&#8217;ll make that=
 case not just to Democratic voters but to voters all across the country, b=
ecause the question facing voters will be whether or not they -- whether th=
ey support a candidate who is committed to
 building on that progress -- because there certainly is more work to be do=
ne.&nbsp; There&#8217;s additional work, there&#8217;s additional progress =
we need to make.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re not going to move this country forwa=
rd by electing a president who is committed to tearing down
 the strategy that has been so critical to our success over the last severa=
l years.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, R=
epublicans found themselves in this position, though, because they were unp=
repared, essentially, for the primary to have ended so quickly, to have to =
deal with Donald Trump as the nominee, that sort of thing.&nbsp; So I guess
 what I&#8217;m asking is, what would the President specifically do to brin=
g the two candidates together, the two candidates&#8217; supporters togethe=
r? We saw today, for instance, that Reince Priebus had this meeting on Capi=
tol Hill for them.&nbsp; Would the President be willing
 to have some sort of meeting here for the two Democratic candidates -- tha=
t sort of thing?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A beer =
summit?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Perhaps.=
&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">Well, again, I certainly =
am not a high qualified analyst when it comes to -- nor highly paid, as Jam=
es points out -- (laughter) -- when it comes to analyzing the challenges fa=
cing the Republican Party.&nbsp; I would
 just observe that it&#8217;s not just a matter of timing that has made it =
more complicated for them to try to paper over the breaches in that party.&=
nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">So, look, I feel confiden=
t that the President will have a strong argument to make in the fall about =
who he believes should succeed him in the Oval Office, and the President wi=
ll root that argument in the need to
 build on the progress that we&#8217;ve made thus far.&nbsp; And the Presid=
ent has been deeply invested in that progress and the President believes th=
at there is more that we can do to invest in the middle class, there is mor=
e that we can do to make our tax code fairer,
 there is more that we can do to strengthen our alliances and advance our i=
nterests around the world.&nbsp; And the President is committed to supporti=
ng a presidential candidate that is interested in building on that progress=
.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,=
 Josh.&nbsp; Back to China and steel.&nbsp; Today, the bipartisan leaders o=
f the Congressional Steel Caucus requested a meeting with the President to =
talk about illegal steel imports.&nbsp; Would the President be willing to m=

 them?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I haven&=
#8217;t seen that request.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll obviously take a close look at=
 it.&nbsp; I think that, again, the fact that the President spent some time=
 with the Prime Minister of Australia talking about this issue I think shou=
ld be
 a clear indication to you and to the members of the bipartisan Steel Caucu=
s that this is an issue that the President believes is an important priorit=
y for our country and for our economy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And als=
o they also want to discuss whether China should be recognized as having ma=
rket economy status at the WTO.&nbsp; Has the administration weighed in on =
that?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; That&#82=
17;s a discussion that they should have with the Commerce Department, becau=
se the Commerce Department is the one who considers that determination.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh, o=
n the Nordic summit, I know you mentioned climate change.&nbsp; Is there an=
ything concrete that you hope will come out of it?&nbsp; And these are coun=
tries that are also part of the anti-ISIL coalition.&nbsp; Are they doing e=
nough in
 that? Would the President like to see them contribute more?&nbsp; Are they=
 spending enough on their militaries?&nbsp; And are they doing enough in th=
e refugee crisis?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
don&#8217;t want to talk about any concrete announcements a day before the =
leaders even arrive, so we can talk about that a little bit more tomorrow.&=
nbsp; As it relates to our counter-ISIL efforts, we certainly spend a
 lot of time talking to our coalition partners about additional steps that =
they could take to enhance our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy IS=
IL.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m confident that that will be part of the discussion.<=
o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that a number of th=
ese countries have generously taken in refugees that are fleeing violence i=
n the Middle East, and I would anticipate that the President will have a di=
scussion with them about the impact that that has had
 on their country&#8217;s individual politics, but also to encourage them a=
s they offer up that much-needed humanitarian relief.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to climate ch=
ange, this obviously is an issue that the United States and the Nordic coun=
tries have been able to work effectively together on in a variety of ways.&=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will th=

tnam?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
can tell you that this afternoon the President&#8217;s National Security Ad=
visor, Susan Rice, is meeting with a group of veteran service organizations=
, leaders of veteran service organizations and other veterans to
 talk about the President&#8217;s trip to Vietnam and Japan.&nbsp; And she =
will make clear that, in addition to discussing some of the issues that I o=
utlined with Margaret related to TPP and our economic relationship with Asi=
a that she&#8217;ll also spend some time talking
 to them about getting a full accounting of POWs and MIAs in Vietnam.&nbsp;=
 This is obviously a priority for many of these organizations, and it&#8217=
;s certainly a priority for the Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">As it relates to the Agen=
t Orange situation, I&#8217;m not aware that the President has any specific=
 meetings planned with victims of Agent Orange.&nbsp; But obviously our vet=
erans organizations that advocate for America&#8217;s
 veterans are concerned about this issue, and the President is certainly in=
terested in making sure that our veterans get the benefits that they deserv=
e.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also on=
 the trip to Asia, not surprisingly, in your readout of the call to Turnbul=
l last night, you mentioned TPP as one of the subjects.&nbsp; This will be =
the first trip to Asia since Trump has essentially clinched the Republican
 nomination, so we now have both the Democratic frontrunner, as you know, a=
nd the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump, against TPP.&nbsp; And Trump,=
 in his recent campaigning, has very much focused on trade, including retal=
iation against companies that would outsource
 to places like Asia -- in the Indiana primary.&nbsp; In the conversations =
with the counterparties in Asia to TPP, what sort of -- have they been conc=
erned by the fact that either of his successors will be opposed to the trea=
ty?&nbsp; And what have you been telling them,
 given that the Congress is dragging its feet on being interested in ratify=
ing this and now we have Democrats and Republicans more and more against it=
 going into the convention?&nbsp; What have they been telling you?<o:p></o:=
p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Look, th=
is isn&#8217;t a surprising development.&nbsp; We saw on the campaign trail=
 for the presidential candidates in both parties that there was not strong =
support for TPP.&nbsp; That was true last year at this time.&nbsp; But yet,=
 we did
 succeed, despite that opposition, in advancing Trade Promotion Authority l=
egislation through the Congress.&nbsp; And we did that by painstakingly avo=
iding some snafus that Jordan referred to, and passing in bipartisan fashio=
n legislation that actually succeed in
 allowing us to complete those negotiations.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So those in other countries=
 that are carefully watching our political system I think understand that t=
here continues to be bipartisan support in the Congress for the Trans-Pacif=
ic Partnership agreement, and we have succeeded in navigating
 the cross-currents of the presidential election in building bipartisan sup=
port for those kinds of agreements.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we did that last year wi=
th Trade Promotion Authority, and we&#8217;re confident that we&#8217;ll be=
 able to do that this year when it comes to implementing the Trans-Pacific =
Partnership.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-indent:.5in">I think the last observat=
ion I would make -- and this, I think, should be a pretty forceful argument=
 for members of Congress who are supportive of TPP and wondering when they =
should vote on it. I mean, I'd just
 make the observation that it is very, very unlikely that the next Presiden=
t will be more enthusiastic about TPP than this President.&nbsp; So I think=
 that would be a reason for Congress to take action before this President r=
esigns.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mor=
e directly, has the counterparties&#8217; anxiety about its potential modif=
ication increased in recent months in your conversations with them?&nbsp; A=
nd is it affecting alternative arrangements they might be thinking about?<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Not that=
 I'm aware of.&nbsp; You could probably get a better read on this from Amba=
ssador Furman&#8217;s office.&nbsp; He obviously spends more time interacti=
ng with the counterparties. But I think most of the parties that we've been
 dealing with in the context of these negotiations understand the political=
 debate in this country.&nbsp; They understand why the politics of the situ=
ation are particularly challenging.&nbsp; But I don't think they&#8217;ve l=
earned anything new that they didn&#8217;t already know
 six months or a year ago.&nbsp; The truth is we've been having this conver=
sation with the TPP parties for five or six years now, so they understand t=
he political dynamics here.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the President certainly=
 feels a sense of urgency in working with Democrats and Republicans to see =
the Trans-Pacific Partnership get implemented.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll do a couple in the bac=
k here.&nbsp; John Bennett.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator=
s Warren and Murray have announced a $1.1 billion agreement on an emergency=
 Zika bill.&nbsp; Is the White House satisfied?&nbsp; That's almost a billi=
on dollars beneath your request. Are you satisfied with that?<o:p></o:p></p=
>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
 put forward the request that we would like to see, and it obviously had a =
lot of details in it.&nbsp; That request was forwarded to Congress back in =
February.&nbsp; So we certainly would have liked to have seen more prompt
 congressional action on this.&nbsp; I think, frankly, at this point, given=
 the delays and given the heightened stakes, we welcome any sort of forward=
 momentum in Congress.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it relates to the specif=
ic package you just mentioned, we'll have to take a close look at it to see=
 if it's sufficient. But Congress has -- I made a reference earlier to the =
frustrations associated with the slow-moving Congress,
 and look, it could not be clearer that Congress needs to take action to he=
lp our states and our local officials fight the Zika virus.&nbsp; That is c=
ritical to the public health and safety of the American people, and it cann=
ot be done -- we can't do everything
 we need to do to prepare for this virus without congressional action.&nbsp=
; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So as I mentioned yesterday=
, this is an emergency.&nbsp; It's an emergency now.&nbsp; That's not just =
my observation, that's the observation of Democratic and Republican governo=
rs across the country.&nbsp; It's an observation that's been made by
 our public professionals.&nbsp; So this isn't about politics; this is abou=
t solving problems.&nbsp; And we need Congress to act quickly so we can get=
 to work solving this problem.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I talke=
d to some experts about the Nordic visit, and they said their impression is=
 the President has really come to respect the Nordic leaders for their prag=
matism and kind of a get-things-done attitude.&nbsp; Can you talk a little
 bit about that? How did that develop over his presidency?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e President has had an opportunity in a variety of settings to meet with th=
e leaders of these countries, and the observation that the President typica=
lly makes about the Nordic countries -- he uses a rather colorful
 expression -- he describes them as &#8220;punching above their weight.&#82=
21; And look, these are relatively small countries, but they are countries =
that make an impactful contribution to our efforts on a variety of issues.&=
nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We certainly value the cont=
ribution that each of these countries has made to fighting carbon pollution=
.&nbsp; We value the contribution that each of these countries have made to=
 the counter-ISIL coalition.&nbsp; Three of these countries -- Norway,
 Iceland and Denmark -- are full NATO members, but event Sweden and Finland=
 have a relationship with NATO that allows them to coordinate their activit=
ies closely with NATO.&nbsp; So all of them are making a substantial contri=
bution to what we have described as the
 cornerstone of American national security, which is NATO.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the President is looking=
 forward to hosting them at the White House, repaying the hospitality that =
he enjoyed last year. And he&#8217;s looking forward to I think a pretty bu=
sy day of meetings on a variety of issues.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John, I give you the last o=
ne.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou, Josh.&nbsp; Two brief questions.&nbsp; Number one, you mentioned Mr. Tr=
ump.&nbsp; He recently said he would appoint former Mayor Giuliani to chair=
 a special commission on Muslims and on terrorism.&nbsp; And does one think=
 that that would
 be a good idea in terms of vetting people who can come into the country an=
d would be threats, and letting those who are no threat and just seek refug=
e come in?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, Jo=
hn, we actually have a very well-established process for considering indivi=
duals who want to enter the country through the refugee process.&nbsp; Refu=
gees, regardless of the way that they worship, are processed through
 a system that carefully vets their background, collects information from t=
hose individuals in in-person interviews, collects biometric information th=
at is then run through a variety of databases maintained by law enforcement=
, by our national security agencies,
 by intelligence agencies.&nbsp; In fact, people who enter the United State=
s through the refugee program are subject to more scrutiny than anybody els=
e that comes in the country.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's a well-establishe=
d process, and that's the one that President Obama has ensured that our nat=
ional security agencies are carefully adhering to.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you =
don't think a Giuliani commission is needed?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, we=
've got a well-established process. And I'll let the presidential candidate=
s make whatever proposals they want.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The oth=
er thing I wanted to ask was, the Philippines elected a new president on Mo=
nday, and there&#8217;s been more talk of a stronger U.S. tie to the Philip=
pines, in part because of some dangers in that part of the world.&nbsp; Wil=
l the
 President ever discuss with President Duterte, President-elect Duterte, th=
e reopening of the Clark airbase, the Subic naval base, or at the very leas=
t, the restoration of the Filipino-American holiday that was abolished by o=
ne of his predecessors, Corazon
 Aquino?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, th=
e President had the opportunity to visit the Philippines last year.&nbsp; H=
e spent about four days in Manila, and spoke with his then-counterpart, Pre=
sident Aquino, on a range of issues.&nbsp; And there was a discussion
 about deepening the security relationship between the United States and th=
e Philippines.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, the Philippines =
has a counterterrorism threat that they have to deal with, and the United S=
tates has been supportive of their efforts to confront that threat.&nbsp; O=
bviously, the Philippines has some concerns about claims that
 China has made in the South China Sea, and we have strongly supported the =
Filipino effort to press the Chinese to resolve those differences through d=
iplomacy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Filipinos also have a c=
hallenge when it comes to maritime security.&nbsp; And there is expertise a=
nd equipment that the United States has provided the Filipino government to=
 confront that challenge.&nbsp; Those of you who were there will
 remember that the President visited a vessel that has previously been owne=
d by the United States that is now being operated by the equivalent of the =
Filipino coast guard there to provide security in the Philippines.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's an indication of =
the strong relationship what we already have with the Philippines, and the =
President would certainly be open to not just continuing but actually deepe=
ning that security relationship with President-elect Duterte
 once his election results have been confirmed officials.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And tha=
t would include possibly the reopening of those two bases and the restorati=
on --
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Well, I =
don't know that there&#8217;s any policy decision that's been made with reg=
ard to that, with regard to any of those bases.&nbsp; What we have said is =
that we're interested in an important national security-counterterrorism
 relationship with the Philippines that enhances the national security of b=
oth of our countries.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m confident that conversation will =
continue with the next President, whether it&#8217;s Mr. Duterte or someone=
 else.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the =
President has not called Mr. Duterte?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; No.&nbsp=
; I believe the results of the election -- while the election took place se=
veral days ago, I have not seen official results from the election be annou=
nced at this point.&nbsp; So I know that there are a bunch of projections
 out there, but I don't know of any official pronouncement that's been made=
. <o:p>
</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank y=
ou. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; Taka, I =
know that you've been trying to get a question the last couple of days.&nbs=
p; So why don't I give you the last chance here?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So on J=
apan, can you tell me if -- how the President will mention or talk about Na=
gasaki when he goes to Hiroshima?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#8217;=
m sorry.&nbsp; Can you say that one more time?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you=
 say if and how the President will talk about Nagasaki?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I see.&n=
bsp; Yes, at this point, I don't have much to say about the President&#8217=
;s remarks that he&#8217;ll deliver at Hiroshima.&nbsp; The President does =
not intend to deliver a major address while he&#8217;s at Hiroshima.&nbsp; =
I think that will
 be an opportunity for him in a rather solemn place to share his reflection=
s on having the opportunity to visit this sight.&nbsp; He will also have an=
 opportunity to talk about the importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship an=
d make an observation about the profound
 transformation in that relationship just in the space of 70 years or so.<o=
:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And while, on one hand, you=
 might say 70 years is a long time, it&#8217;s a lifetime.&nbsp; On the oth=
er hand, 70 years ago, the United States and Japan were at war.&nbsp; And t=
he way that we cooperate now on such a wide range of issues that enhances
 importantly the national security of both our countries I think is a testa=
ment to the tremendous progress that's been made in both our countries.&nbs=
p; And I think it&#8217;s served both our countries and citizens in both of=
 our countries quite well.&nbsp; And the President
 will have an opportunity to make that observation not just when he&#8217;s=
 in Hiroshima but during his visit to Japan.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will he=
 have any message to the people in Nagasaki?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; I&#8217;=
m sorry?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any mes=
sage to the people -- <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. EARNEST:&nbsp; The mess=
age.&nbsp; At this point, we&#8217;ll wait for the President&#8217;s remark=
s before we make any observation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right, thanks, everybod=
y.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see you tomorrow.<o:p></o:p></p>
