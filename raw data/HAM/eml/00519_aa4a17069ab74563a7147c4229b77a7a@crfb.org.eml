Adding Up Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s Campaign Proposals So Far=20

May 2, 2016

=C2=A0

Read the analysis=2E

Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary=
 Clinton has proposed numerous new policies that would increase spendin=
g and expand tax breaks along with other policies that would increase t=
axes and reduce certain spending=2E

Using independent estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO),=
 the non-partisan Tax Policy Center (TPC), and others, we estimate that=
 Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s proposals would cost $1=2E8 trillion over =
a decade with interest, and they would be nearly fully paid for with $1=
=2E6 trillion of offsets =E2=80=93 primarily from taxes on high earners=
=2E The $200 billion shortfall from Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s proposa=
ls would be more than fully covered by the $275 billion of revenue from=
 business tax reform that the Clinton campaign has called for but has n=
ot yet provided enough detail for us to credit=2E

Though Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s policies would not substantially add=
 to current law debt levels, it would keep debt at post-war record-high=
 and rapidly growing levels=2E Under Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s propos=
als, debt held by the public would climb from 74 percent of Gross Domes=
tic Product (GDP) at the end of last year to 86 percent of GDP by 2026=2E



Since the 2016 presidential campaign began, the Committee for a Respons=
ible Federal Budget has analyzed several campaign proposals through our=
=C2=A0Fiscal FactCheck=C2=A0project=2E This analysis of Secretary Clint=
on=E2=80=99s policies is our fourth full assessment of a candidate=E2=80=
=99s proposals available on their campaign=E2=80=99s website (Read our =
analysis of the policies put forth by=C2=A0Senator Ted Cruz,=C2=A0Donal=
d Trump, and=C2=A0Senator Bernie Sanders)=2E We aimed to assess all maj=
or policy proposals on www=2EHillaryClinton=2Ecom as of May 2, 2016, in=
corporating comments and details provided by representatives of the cam=
paign=2E We excluded smaller initiatives and those with too little deta=
il to assess=2E Secretary Clinton may support additional policy changes=
 that are not listed on her website or have only been alluded to but no=
t specified=2E We intend to follow up with further analyses of the cand=
idate's plans, including updates to our analysis of Secretary Clinton=E2=
=80=99s proposals, as more details are added to all the candidates' web=
sites=2E Estimates provided in this analysis are both rough and rounded=
=2E

It is encouraging that Secretary Clinton has outlined specific offsets =
for her new proposals=2E By our estimates, these savings would cover ne=
arly all the new costs (and may more than fully cover the costs once th=
e campaign releases specifics for business tax reform)=2E Paying for ne=
w initiatives is an important and necessary step to ensuring the nation=
=E2=80=99s fiscal health does not further deteriorate=2E

While Secretary Clinton would not worsen the fiscal situation, she also=
 unfortunately does not offer concrete proposals for improving it=2E As=
 under current law, under Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s proposals the nat=
ional debt would ascend from 74 percent of GDP at the end of last year =
=E2=80=93 already a record high other than the period around World War =
II =E2=80=93 to 86 percent of GDP by 2026=2E Secretary Clinton also has=
 not set aside money for sequester relief, even though the campaign has=
 put forward the goal of reversing both the automatic defense and non-d=
efense cuts, known as "sequester=2E" If full discretionary sequester re=
lief were enacted without offsetting the cost, the debt would climb eve=
n higher to about 90 percent of GDP=2E

In order to pay for sequester relief and put debt on a more sustainable=
 path, Secretary Clinton would need to propose significant additional t=
ax increases and/or spending cuts=2E By ruling out many changes to Soci=
al Security as well as tax increases on those making less than $250,000=
, Secretary Clinton has made this task far more difficult=2E Even so, g=
iven that her proposals are largely paid for, it remains possible for S=
ecretary Clinton to offer a viable deficit reduction plan, and we encou=
rage her to do so=2E

The Budgetary Impact of Secretary Clinton's Proposals

Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s campaign website includes a long list of ne=
w policy proposals, factsheets, briefings, and backgrounders=2E The rec=
ommendations with significant costs or revenue loss include:


Enact =E2=80=9CNew College Compact=2E=E2=80=9D=C2=A0Read our explainer =
here=2E

Expand the Affordable Care Act (=E2=80=9CObamacare=E2=80=9D)=2E

Repeal the Cadillac Tax on high-cost health insurance plans=2E

Expand early childhood education=2E

Increase infrastructure spending=2E Read our explainer here=2E

Expand paid family leave and enact related policies=2E

Invest in energy and research=2E

Support economic revitalization and increase funding for veterans=2E


Meanwhile, the recommendations with significant savings or revenue incl=
ude:


Limit the value of tax breaks to the 28 percent bracket=2E

Reform capital gains taxation=2E

Enact a minimum tax, surtax, and other tax increases on high earners=2E=
=C2=A0Read our explainer here=2E

Increase various business taxes=2E

Impose a fee on financial institutions=2E

Reduce prescription drug costs and allow for a =E2=80=9Cpublic option=2E=
=E2=80=9D=C2=A0Read our explainer=C2=A0on her prescription drug plan=C2=
=A0here=2E

Enact immigration reform=2E


Each of these policies is described in detail in=C2=A0Appendix I=2E

In addition to these policies, Secretary Clinton has called for ending =
the automatic discretionary sequester in conjunction with =E2=80=9Csmar=
t reforms in both defense and non-defense spending=2E" She has also cal=
led for expanding Social Security benefits for =E2=80=9Cthose who need =
it most and who are treated unfairly by the current system,=E2=80=9D in=
cluding widows and caretakers, while extending the program=E2=80=99s so=
lvency through tax increases on higher earners=2E Neither recommendatio=
n includes policy detail=2E In our assessment based on the campaign web=
site and discussions with campaign representatives, these represent goa=
ls rather than proposals=2E Full proposals may be released at some futu=
re time, at which point we will assess their fiscal impact=2E



By our estimate, Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s new costs will total rough=
ly $1=2E8 trillion over a decade =E2=80=93 including nearly $1=2E55 tri=
llion of new spending, less than $0=2E2 trillion of tax breaks, and $0=2E=
05 trillion in interest=2E These costs would be largely offset by about=
 $1=2E3 trillion of tax increases, $0=2E2 trillion of spending reforms,=
 and $0=2E1 trillion of savings from immigration reform=2E In total, th=
is would increase the debt by about $200 billion over the next decade, =
an increase that would be more than offset by the $275 billion of reven=
ue the campaign has called for generated from business tax reform but n=
ot yet specified enough details to count=2E

A full explanation of our cost estimates, including a discussion of sev=
eral policies we were unable to incorporate into our analysis, is avail=
able in=C2=A0Appendix II=2E

Attaining Fiscal=C2=A0Sustainability=C2=A0under=C2=A0Secretary Clinton'=
s Plans

Secretary Clinton deserves credit for not only committing to pay for al=
l new initiatives, but largely meeting this goal=2E However, by not set=
ting aside any substantial savings for deficit reduction, Secretary Cli=
nton would still allow debt to grow significantly as a share of the eco=
nomy, from about 74 percent of GDP at the end of last year =E2=80=93 al=
ready the highest in U=2ES=2E history other than around World War II =E2=
=80=93 to 86 percent of GDP by 2026=2E In only a few years, under Secre=
tary Clinton=E2=80=99s policies and under current law, debt would grow =
to twice its average over the last half-century of roughly 40 percent o=
f GDP; and it would continue to grow unsustainably after that=2E

Were Secretary Clinton to repeal the discretionary spending sequester w=
ithout offsets (she has set forth the goal of repealing sequester but n=
ot yet identified offsets), debt would grow even higher =E2=80=93 to ab=
out 90 percent of GDP by 2026=2E


=C2=A0

In order to meet her goal of fully reversing the discretionary sequeste=
r while also stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio, Secretary Clinton would=
 need to identify over $4 trillion in additional budget savings (includ=
ing interest) over 10 years=2E Achieving this level of savings on top o=
f the offsets Secretary Clinton has already proposed would require aggr=
essive tax increases or spending cuts, particularly since she has ruled=
 out increasing taxes on households making less than $250,000 as well a=
s a variety of potential Social Security changes=2E For example, to sta=
bilize the debt and repeal the sequester, Secretary Clinton could:


Increase tax rates on households above $250,000 by about 23 percentage =
points,=C2=A0pushing the top combined federal tax rate to 70 percent=C2=
=A0on incomes above $5 million (which would be close to or above=C2=A0t=
he revenue maximizing level)=2E

Adopt all the tax increases and mandatory savings in President Obama=E2=
=80=99s budget (including those like oil and cigarette taxes that impac=
t households making less than $250,000 per year), while raising tax rat=
es by 12 percentage points on households making more than $250,000, whi=
ch would=C2=A0move the top rate to 59 percent=C2=A0on incomes above $5 =
million=2E

Apply an=C2=A0across-the-board 5 point tax increase=C2=A0on all househo=
lds, including households making less than $250,000=2E

Reduce mandatory spending on programs such as Social Security, Medicare=
, Medicaid, and food stamps with an=C2=A011 percent across-the-board cu=
t=2E

Reduce mandatory spending while exempting Social Security with a=C2=A01=
9 percent across-the-board cut=2E

Adopt all the tax increases and mandatory savings in President Obama=E2=
=80=99s budget and then reduce mandatory spending other than Social Sec=
urity by=C2=A09 percent across the board=2E


Faster economic growth could also make it easier for Secretary Clinton =
to stabilize the debt and pay for the sequester=2E Based on CBO's estim=
ates of the effect of the 2013 Senate-passed immigration bill and the m=
acroeconomic feedback analysis from the Tax Foundation (which estimates=
 that Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s tax increases would=C2=A0reduce=C2=A0=
the size of the economy by 1 percent over a decade),we determined that =
annual real economic growth of about=C2=A03=2E1 percent=C2=A0would be s=
ufficient to pay for sequester repeal and stabilize the debt at last ye=
ar=E2=80=99s level (74 percent of GDP)=2E This is significantly higher =
than the 2=2E1 percent growth projected under current law, and would be=
=C2=A0unlikely to materialize=C2=A0given historical precedent, producti=
vity trends, the aging population, and the impact Secretary Clinton=E2=80=
=99s tax increases would have on long-term economic growth=2E




Conclusion

Secretary Clinton should be commended for not only committing to pay fo=
r her new initiatives but for offering serious and specific proposals t=
hat would more or less achieve this goal=2E However, with debt at post-=
war record high levels and projected to grow unsustainably, simply rema=
ining on our current course is not enough=2E Secretary Clinton would ne=
ed over $4 trillion of deficit reduction to simply replace the sequeste=
r and stabilize the debt at its current high levels=2E So far she has p=
roposed over $1=2E5 trillion of savings, and yet does not dedicate even=
 a fraction of it to putting the debt on a more sustainable path=2E

Ultimately, a mixture of spending cuts, tax increases, and entitlement =
reform is likely to be necessary in order to grow the economy and fix t=
he debt for future generations=2E We hope Secretary Clinton will pursue=
 these policies going forward, putting new ideas on the table rather th=
an simply taking ideas off=2E Paying for new initiatives is a good star=
t, but much more must be done=2E

<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:14px;"><span style=3D"font-family: arial,helvetic=
a,sans-serif;">It is encouraging that Secretary Clinton has outlined specif=
ic offsets for her new proposals. By our estimates, these savings would cov=
er nearly all the new costs (and may more than fully cover the costs once t=
he campaign releases specifics for business tax reform). Paying for new ini=
tiatives is an important and necessary step to ensuring the nation=E2=80=99=
s fiscal health does not further deteriorate.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:14px;"><span style=3D"font-family: arial,helvetic=
a,sans-serif;">While Secretary Clinton would not worsen the fiscal situatio=
n, she also unfortunately does not offer concrete proposals for improving i=
t. As under current law, under Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s proposals the na=
tional debt would ascend from 74 percent of GDP at the end of last year =E2=
=80=93 already a record high other than the period around World War II =E2=
=80=93 to 86 percent of GDP by 2026. Secretary Clinton also has not set asi=
de money for sequester relief, even though the campaign has put forward the=
 goal of reversing both the automatic defense and non-defense cuts, known a=
s &quot;sequester.&quot; If full discretionary sequester relief were enacte=
d without offsetting the cost, the debt would climb even higher to about 90=
 percent of GDP.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:14px;"><span style=3D"font-family: arial,helvetic=
a,sans-serif;">In order to pay for sequester relief and put debt on a more =
sustainable path, Secretary Clinton would need to propose significant addit=
ional tax increases and/or spending cuts. By ruling out many changes to Soc=
ial Security as well as tax increases on those making less than $250,000, S=
ecretary Clinton has made this task far more difficult. Even so, given that=
 her proposals are largely paid for, it remains possible for Secretary Clin=
ton to offer a viable deficit reduction plan, and we encourage her to do so=
.</span></span></p>

<p>

 pay for all new initiatives, but largely meeting this goal. However, by no=

inton would still allow debt to grow significantly as a share of the econom=
y, from about 74 percent of GDP at the end of last year =E2=80=93 already t=
he highest in U.S. history other than around World War II =E2=80=93 to 86 p=
ercent of GDP by 2026. In only a few years, under Secretary Clinton=E2=80=
=99s policies and under current law, debt would grow to twice its average o=
ver the last half-century of roughly 40 percent of GDP; and it would contin=
ue to grow unsustainably after that.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:14px;"><span style=3D"font-family: arial,helvetic=

sequester without offsets (she has set forth the goal of repealing sequeste=

 about 90 percent of GDP by 2026.</span></span></p>

ry sequester while also stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio, Secretary Clinto=
n would need to identify over $4 trillion in additional budget savings (inc=
luding interest) over 10 years. Achieving this level of savings on top of t=
he offsets Secretary Clinton has already proposed would require aggressive =
tax increases or spending cuts, particularly since she has ruled out increa=
sing taxes on households making less than $250,000 as well as a variety of =
potential Social Security changes. For example, to stabilize the debt and r=

span></span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:14px;"><span style=3D"font-family: arial,helvetic=
a,sans-serif;">Secretary Clinton should be commended for not only committin=
g to pay for her new initiatives but for offering serious and specific prop=
osals that would more or less achieve this goal. However, with debt at post=
-war record high levels and projected to grow unsustainably, simply remaini=
ng on our current course is not enough. Secretary Clinton would need over $=
4 trillion of deficit reduction to simply replace the sequester and stabili=
ze the debt at its current high levels. So far she has proposed over $1.5 t=
rillion of savings, and yet does not dedicate even a fraction of it to putt=
ing the debt on a more sustainable path.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:14px;"><span style=3D"font-family: arial,helvetic=
a,sans-serif;">Ultimately, a mixture of spending cuts, tax increases, and e=
ntitlement reform is likely to be necessary in order to grow the economy an=
d fix the debt for future generations. We hope Secretary Clinton will pursu=
e these policies going forward, putting new ideas on the table rather than =
simply taking ideas off. Paying for new initiatives is a good start, but mu=
ch more must be done.</span></span></p>
