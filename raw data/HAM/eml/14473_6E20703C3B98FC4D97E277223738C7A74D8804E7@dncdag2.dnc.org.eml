DNC Chair Responds to Donald Trump's Radio Advertisements

Washington, D.C. - DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the fol=
lowing statement in response to Donald Trump's radio advertisements:

"The release of Donald Trump's radio ads today make it clear a Trump presid=
ency would be a bad investment for America and the middle class. The ads co=
ntinue the Republican approach of minimizing the major issues confronting t=
he American people to reality television-style grade-school rhetoric. It's =
not just his offensive rhetoric, it's his harmful policies, which are emble=
matic of the entire Republican field's obsession with moving America backwa=
rd to policies that failed under past Republican administrations. Just like=
 Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and the rest of the GOP field, Donald Trump support=
s tax plans that give the wealthiest Americans more than the middle class, =
opposes fixing the broken immigration system through comprehensive reform, =
wants to take health care away from millions of families, and endorses a re=
ckless foreign policy in the vein of Dick Cheney and George W. Bush. Each R=
epublican presidential candidate in this race would reverse the progress we=
've made under President Obama that resulted in 67 consecutive months of pr=
ivate-sector job growth.

"The ads also don't answer serious questions about the myth that Donald Tru=
mp is a successful businessman who would be able to run the country's econo=
my. Donald Trump openly brags about taking advantage of bankruptcy laws in =
order to amass his fortune, and he borrowed millions from his family member=
s to build his empire. As he said recently, his dad gave what he called a "=
small" $1 million loan to him to get started when he graduated from college=
. Trump just doesn't understand these avenues aren't available to countless=
 Americans who are working day in and day out to afford a mortgage payment,=
 or the cost of college for their families.

"He hasn't got a clue when it comes to the struggles everyday Americans fac=
e, and he's the last person equipped to help them."
