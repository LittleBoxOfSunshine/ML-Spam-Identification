Bernie Sanders=92s Gift to His Party<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/opin=
ion/bernie-sanderss-gift-to-his-party.html?ref=3Dopinion>
By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

Though some opinion polls on Tuesday=92s primary in Indiana show Bernie San=
ders and Hillary Clinton in a tight race, the plunge in Mr. Sanders=92s lat=
est fund-raising numbers makes clear what he doesn=92t yet want to say. His=
 campaign =97 for the presidency, anyway =97 is most likely nearing its end=
.

=93We intend to fight for every vote and delegate remaining,=94 Mr. Sanders=
 said in Washington on Sunday. While he continues to infuriate the Clinton =
campaign by battling for Mrs. Clinton=92s superdelegates, his tone suggests=
 that he=92s no longer in it to win. He=92s fighting to ensure that all his=
 supporters get a chance to cast a ballot during the primary season ending =
in June, and most of all, that Democratic leaders pay attention to their vi=
ews.

The Democratic Party and Mrs. Clinton are better off for Mr. Sanders=92s pr=
esence in this race. His criticism, as Winston Churchill might say, was not=
 agreeable. But it called necessary attention to unhealthy developments in =
the Democratic Party, including its at-times obliviousness to the lingering=
 economic pain of the middle class and the young, and its drift toward poli=
tical caution over aspiration.

=93I like the idea of saying, =91We can do much more,=92 because we can,=94=
 Vice President Joseph Biden Jr., who deferred his own presidential hopes t=
his year, said about Mr. Sanders recently. =93I don=92t think any Democrat=
=92s ever won saying, =91We can=92t think that big.=92=94

To this day, Mr. Sanders=92s rallies are lit up by people who say he is the=
 candidate most focused on their struggle for jobs, better health care and =
debt relief, and most interested in taking action against those who profite=
d while wages for the working class stagnated and their hopes diminished.

As President Obama said, Mr. Sanders had =93the luxury of being a complete =
long shot and just letting loose.=94 Unrealistic, short on details, the pop=
ulist Mr. Sanders is a wildly gesticulating reminder of how far the Democra=
tic Party, once champion of the underdog, has strayed. He points out the de=
gree to which the party has become captive to economic elites whose agendas=
 don=92t necessarily represent the rest of America=92s. Mr. Sanders, who ra=
ised more than $200 million through small donations, even cast doubt on Dem=
ocrats=92 claims that they need big-money backers to succeed.

Mr. Sanders=92s unwillingness to compromise has contributed to a thin recor=
d of accomplishment over his decades in Congress. While Mrs. Clinton outfla=
nks him on both knowledge and practice of foreign policy, on domestic polic=
y he has forced her to address the impact of trade deals and globalization,=
 spell out her stances on clean energy and oil and gas exploration, and put=
 more meat on her plans for college affordability. He=92s exposed her failu=
re to support $15 an hour as a federal minimum wage, and rightly called her=
 out on the Wall Street speeches that earned her millions and her refusal t=
o make the transcripts public.

Mr. Sanders has exposed a broad vein of discontent that Democrats cannot ig=
nore. Predictions that Mr. Sanders=92s supporters could migrate to Donald T=
rump in the fall are overstated, despite Mr. Trump=92s cynical efforts to w=
oo them. It=92s more likely that some simply won=92t vote. Mrs. Clinton is =
betting that many Democrats will be motivated to get to the polls if Mr. Tr=
ump is the Republican nominee. But to truly unify the party, Mrs. Clinton a=
nd party leaders must work to incorporate Mr. Sanders and what he stands fo=
r in the party=92s approach to the general election. It would also help to =
acknowledge that the party has strayed at times from its more aspirational =
path.

Unlike the voices on the Republican side, Mr. Sanders=92s has elevated this=
 campaign. The Democratic Party should listen.
