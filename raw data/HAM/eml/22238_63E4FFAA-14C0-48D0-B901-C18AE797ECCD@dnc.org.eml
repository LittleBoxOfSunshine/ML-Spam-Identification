Hi Jon,



I hope the timing works out, it would be great to have you there! As for th=
e ticket levels, we=92ve found this election season that some folks have wa=
nted to max out in light of our opposition. The difference is mostly in nam=
e only, but it also allows your name to be listed on the invitation as part=
 of the host committee. In your case, attending at the co-host level would =
also qualify you for the Main Line convention package. I=92ve attached our =
convention package descriptions for your reference, but please feel free to=
 reach out if you have any questions.



I hope that helps!



Thanks,

Dan
