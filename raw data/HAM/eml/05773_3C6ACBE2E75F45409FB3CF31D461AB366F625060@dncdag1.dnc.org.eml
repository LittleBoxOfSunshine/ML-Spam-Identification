Here's the rush:

>>> Hillary Clinton pked up a narrow win in Kentucky last night, while Bernie Sanders pulled off a win in Oregon.

[4:18:48 PM]

Nders campaign is looking into the possibility of a recount in Kentucky. This, as the divide in the democratic party seems to be growing after chaos at the Nevada convention over the weekend. Bernie Sanders in the state says the process was rigged against them. Sanders has been clear in condemning threats and violence,dmc Debbie Wasserman Hultz.
>> The fact that the Sanders campaign has issued a but in tween condemnation of violence and frustration over the pcess seems to excuse their supporters' actions which is unacceptable.
>> Short time later, Sanders spoke directly to docratic party leadership.
>> Let me also say a word to the leadership of the democratic party. Open the doors. Let the people in! The other optio for the democratic party, which I see as a very sad and tragic option, is to choose to maintain its status quo structure.
>> Meanwhile, Donald Trump is weighing in on all of this today on Twitter, saying, Bernie Sanders is being treated badly by the Democrats, the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me. We have both covered today. Kelly o'donnell is with the Sanders campaign in Vallejo, California. We're going to start with Kelly. Kelly, the Sanders campaign, I wonder what their thinking is after combination of the results last night and what appeared to be vis a vis.

[4:20:55 PM]

>> Reporter: They'reying to go forward that they haven't been respected, and it bubbled up over the weekend. It has been a strain throughout the process. As you mentioned, Bernie Sanders is already on stage in San Jose, we skipped ahead to his next stop where he'll be later this evening. You see some of the preparationsgoing on. I can tell you that there has been this frustration that there are many Sanders voters we've talked over the months who feel that the party has sort of given a nod to Hillary Clinton early on, not taking Bernie Sanders seriously enough, and although he has been able to produce big crowds consistently and a verysizable vote margin, of course, Hillary Clinton remains significantly out front when it comes to the overall vote and delegate count. So there is this frustration. You could hear it today from Jeff weaver, the Bernie Sanders campaign manager, when he was a guest on Ms in. Bc, talking about a real sore point between his campaign and the leadership of the democratic national committee.
>> The chairwoman of the democratic national committee, I mean, it has been clear from the get go that she has been working against Bernie Sanders. I mean, there is no doubt about it.
>> You think she is greasing the skids for Hillary Clinton?
>> No, I don't really know what her motivation is. It has been clear a pattern of conduct from the beginning of the campaign that has been a hostile to Bernie Sanders, and his supporters, and really, you know, she has become a divisive figure in the party.
>> Reporter: And of course, Debbie Wasserman Schultz says the DNC remains neutral. That she has not done anything to tip the scales in the favor of Hillary Clinton. At the same time, more largely, you do get from some democratic office holders a frustration that Sanders is new to the party, of course, he has served in office as an independent for a very long time, and there are questions about whether Sanders continued place in this race could hurt Democrats in the fall.

[4:22:55 PM]

Not only Clinton, should she be the nominee, but down ballot as well. So the tension is real, and it continues to be sort of the scab kind of broken open again whennew events take place. We'll see more going forward.
>> Let's turn to Kristin Welker now. Kristin, after the beef was kind of escalating and folks from the DNC on the news and Sanders campaign, Robby Mook, theClinton camp put out a statement, saying we want to have nothing do with this. Let's talk about something else.
>> Reporter: I think you're right. They feel they've got to walk a fine line right now in terms of their public posture towards this and what they have to say about senator Sanders and his campaign, because they don't want to alienate his voters. They see him as critical to unifying the party. What you're hearing publicly from the Clinton campaign, a note of optimism that they'll be able to unify and an acknowledgment they'll be an important part of the process. They do want to allow him to have an impact on the party's platform. Listen to what Brian Fallon had to say from the Clinton campaign earlier today.
>> We're going to have a very open process with respect to the platform and all of the considerations that go into how we put this convention together. This is really an opportunity to bring the party together and I think the convention process, the planning process, and the platform development process should all be conductedaccordingly to give everybody a full hearing, make sure that the committee make ups that make up the determinations like going into the platform arerepresentative so will is an open diverse set of viewpoints that go into that.
>> Reporter: Chris, privately, campaign officials are also very insistent it is up to senator Sanders to take the first step toward rallying his supporters. They point to what happened in 2008, when then senator Clinton helped to unify her supporters around then senator Obama.

[4:24:59 PM]

And they're calling for a similar process this time around. But they also know that it is important that she has a strong finish states like New Jersey and California.I've been talking to campaign officials today who say you can expect her to campaign vigorously in those states. You can expect her to spend a whole lot of time in those states to determine if they're going to go up with ads, but see it as important so she looks strong heading into the convention and no doubt she is in fact the party's nominee, not only in terms of the math, but in terms of the optics, Chris.
>> Kristin Welker, live in Brooklyn. Thank you very much.
>>> Joining our panel, Kasie hunt, you've spent a lot of time with the Sanders campaign. There seems to be a good cop/bad cop role.
>> Yes.
>> The institutional democratic party has definitely taken a harsher line. The campaign has taken a less and less critical line, because I think they are clearly terrified of alienating -- remember, he has gotten about 45% of the voters of the democratic party. We're not talking Rand Paul, 15%, 18%. We're talking a sizable minority of the party.
>> And the section of it that is frankly the most excited to be out there voting, supporting, not necessarily a democratic candidate, but involved in the democratic process right now. I think there has been a little bit of private friction, because I think in some points, this has been handled not necessarily in the most graceful of ways to put it diplomatically I would say. But they feel they have to be very careful in how --
>> The Clinton folks.
>> The Clinton folks feel very -- they really do not -- you will a he notice, every time there is a reason for the Sanders campaign to get set off, they'll take the opportunity, so better to not give them the opportunities to do so.
>> I have not, for a campaign that had been for a certain point, you know, there had been attacks, Hillary Clinton hasn't done much to go after Bernie Sanders.

[4:27:08 PM]

>> That's absolutely right. Kasie, air absolutely right, there has been tension between the DNC and campaign over these issues and some of the messaging around those issues in particular. I would say this. I think that Hillary Clinton's campaign unders this. They understand that the Republican party now is seeing, this this friction and is capitalizing on it. And what they don't want is to have them to give them this talking point, this ongoing talking point that they can use. That's one thing. The other thing is, she is taking incoming from both sides, which is not helping her. It is one thing to take it from the Republicans, but to also take it from Bernie at this late stage is problematic.
>> Although I will say, we were going back on the tape eight years ago and you have situation where exactly eight years ago, it was the point, it was the same thing, and I think it was Obama won Oregon and Hillary won Kentucky and it was right around then that Hillary made the comments that were widely criticized, well, you in never know what happens, look what happened to rfk, he was murdered in California. What are you saying. Obviously she understood quickly she was not trying to suggest that, but you never know. So there is precedent for this.
>> Of course. I mean, look, a lot of people are saying like I can't believe how divided the democratic party, compared to the Republicans. It is just because twocandidates are still running. There is reason for the Clinton campaign to be worried about not getting all of Sanders voters. And that's legitimate. But I mean, it is the second that Sanders drops out and Clinton clinches the nomination and she is the nominee, I think that you'll very quickly see a lot of coalescing around her and I think you might see in some of the head to head polls between trump and Clinton, Clinton might get a --
>> She will, absolutely.
>> Because a lot of people are saying they're undecided because they don't want to be --
>> Let me say this. Two big differences, someone who has moved through the circles, which its own kind of subculture, you know, Ben Ginsberg made this analogy.

[4:29:17 PM]

The difference eight years ago, Sanders and Clinton don't have equal levels, in the way that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton did. Also, Barack Obama and HillaryClinton, it wasn't a massively substantive ideological battle between them, in some ways the sanders/clinton fight is more ideological. What is your sense how thatequates in terms of coming together?
>> Well, I think what's so important now, Bernie Sanders should condemn more strongly the violence and actions of the Bernie bros and the overall sexism that has permeated. Like, he needs to be a leader from the top and say had is unacceptable and show a clear contrast to Donald Trump. That would win him a lot ofgoodwill down the road. Also, it is an important character test for him.
>> I just want to say about that, which I agree. I think that the statement yesterday was not condemntory enough, yes, but, sort of. We should be clear about this.There is 9 people voting for Bernie Sanders. There is people online who say mean stuff, and people call -- like, this is in no means representative. There is a strain, I think you're right, of his most devoted supporters, and a subsection of them that really is, they feel like they're at war.
>> He could set an example.
>> Yeah, he could have.
>> Versus what Donald Trump is doing.
>> And one of Bernie Sanders' own supporters, Lucy flores, an advocate for him, had a statement that was more condemned this more strongly than Bernie Sanders did, and raised some of the issues. Because some of the reason why this blew up so much, Barbara boxer.
>> There is a few different things getting run together. Person lifting the chair, a scuffle, there was, I mean, because it is important in terms of the range of things.People yelling rude things and people actually physically swinging, the death threats, but to me, those were the -- those, like, should be hung in public, it's like there is just no space in any universe of any kind of righteous politics saying that.

[4:31:23 PM]

>> I agree wise, the majority of the supporters are not engaging this way, the bottom line, there is a segment that is, and they're saying, I mean, I've been on the receiving end of it, many reporterers, especially women reporters, this is what is disturbing, those of us on the receiving end of it, it is there as a gender basedforum of this type of attacks. That's problematic. I think that what while he can still make his point, he had some very valid points about money and politics, but he can make those points while condemning that strain within his support base.
>> I would also say there is a line that separates people and I think this goes to your point about war. People who feel like they're at war. Bernie Sanders has been saying this a revolution. Some people have interpreted that as a nice line, good rally. Of some people think they're revolutionaries. They take it literally. In the same way some tea partiers did, and continue to. That leads to extreme asures.
>> Condemned for the target language, so the left has a responsibility to do the very same thing.
>> Let me say this also. In terms of when you talk about tea parties and Ron Paul, right, those people didn't feel like we've got to make sure the Republican party wins in the end. Let me also say, they were very effective. They may not have helped the party as a partceed, but you can be sure the Ron Paul agenda moved through, and the tea party agenda, very much moved to the mainstream. So sometimes there is a difference between what will most effectively implant your I'd logical vision and what will win the party elections in the short-term. . It is possible that people most committed to Sanders' version are act anything some senserationally insofar as they think the implantation is overriding.
>> I think there is a serious question, the democratic party should grapple with more Bradley. We've seen it play out really since 2010, where essentially the ruling kind of majority of the Republican party ignored the needs and focus of the base, the people voting for them.

[4:33:34 PM]

The Democrats, I mean, you can watch kind of Hillary Clinton become in many ways, is she the chamber of commerce candidate of 2016. Potentially. Does that put her and others who support her --
>> There is a danger of that division opening up in the dooep party.
>>> Still to come, continued fallout over "The New York Times" piece how trump treats women, now his daughter weighing

Nders campaign is looking into&nbsp;the possibility of a recount in&nbsp;Kentucky.&nbsp;This, as the divide in the&nbsp;democratic party seems to be&nbsp;growing after chaos at the&nbsp;Nevada convention over the&nbsp;weekend.&nbsp;Bernie Sanders in the state says&nbsp;the process was rigged against&nbsp;them.&nbsp;Sanders

 she is&nbsp;taking incoming from both sides,&nbsp;which is not helping her.&nbsp;It is one thing to take it from&nbsp;the Republicans, but to also&nbsp;take it from Bernie at this late&nbsp;stage is problematic.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; Although I will say, we were&nbsp;going back on the tape eight&nbsp;years ago and you have situation&nbsp;where exactly eight years ago,&nbsp;it was the point, it was the&nbsp;same thing, and I think it was&nbsp;Obama won Oregon and Hillary won&nbsp;Kentucky and it was right around&nbsp;then that
 Hillary made the&nbsp;comments that were widely&nbsp;criticized, well, you in never&nbsp;know what happens, look what&nbsp;happened to rfk, he was murdered&nbsp;in California.&nbsp;What are you saying.&nbsp;Obviously she understood quickly&nbsp;she was not trying to suggest&nbsp;that, but you never know.&nbsp;So
 there is precedent for this.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; Of course.&nbsp;I mean, look, a lot of people&nbsp;are saying like I can't believe&nbsp;how divided the democratic&nbsp;party, compared to the&nbsp;Republicans.&nbsp;It is just because twocandidates are still running.&nbsp;There is reason for the Clinton&nbsp;campaign to be worried about not&nbsp;getting
 all of Sanders voters.&nbsp;And that's legitimate.&nbsp;But I mean, it is the second&nbsp;that Sanders drops out and&nbsp;Clinton clinches the nomination&nbsp;and she is the nominee, I think&nbsp;that you'll very quickly see a&nbsp;lot of coalescing around her and&nbsp;I think you might see in some
 of&nbsp;the head to head polls between&nbsp;trump and Clinton, Clinton might&nbsp;get a --&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; She will, absolutely.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; Because a lot of people are&nbsp;saying they're undecided because&nbsp;they don't want to be --&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; Let me say this.&nbsp;Two big differences, someone who&nbsp;has moved through the circles,&nbsp;which its own kind of&nbsp;subculture, you know, Ben&nbsp;Ginsberg made this analogy.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
[4:29:17 PM]<br>
<br>
The difference eight years ago,&nbsp;Sanders and Clinton don't have&nbsp;equal levels, in the way that&nbsp;Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton&nbsp;did.&nbsp;Also, Barack Obama and HillaryClinton, it wasn't a massively&nbsp;substantive ideological battle&nbsp;between them, in some ways the&nbsp;sanders/clinton
 fight is more&nbsp;ideological.&nbsp;What is your sense how thatequates in terms of coming&nbsp;together?&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; Well, I think what's so&nbsp;important now, Bernie Sanders&nbsp;should condemn more strongly the&nbsp;violence and actions of the&nbsp;Bernie bros and the overall&nbsp;sexism that has permeated.&nbsp;Like, he needs to be a leader&nbsp;from the top and say had is&nbsp;unacceptable and show a clear&nbsp;contrast
 to Donald Trump.&nbsp;That would win him a lot ofgoodwill down the road.&nbsp;Also, it is an important&nbsp;character test for him.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; I just want to say about&nbsp;that, which I agree.&nbsp;I think that the statement&nbsp;yesterday was not condemntory&nbsp;enough, yes, but, sort of.&nbsp;We should be clear about this.There is 9 people voting for&nbsp;Bernie Sanders.&nbsp;There is people online who say&nbsp;mean stuff, and people
 call --&nbsp;like, this is in no means&nbsp;representative.&nbsp;There is a strain, I think&nbsp;you're right, of his most&nbsp;devoted supporters, and a&nbsp;subsection of them that really&nbsp;is, they feel like they're at&nbsp;war.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; He could set an example.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he could have.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; Versus what Donald Trump is&nbsp;doing.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; And one of Bernie Sanders'&nbsp;own supporters, Lucy flores, an&nbsp;advocate for him, had a&nbsp;statement that was more&nbsp;condemned this more strongly&nbsp;than Bernie Sanders did, and&nbsp;raised some of the issues.&nbsp;Because some of the reason why&nbsp;this blew up so much, Barbara&nbsp;boxer.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; There is a few different&nbsp;things getting run together.&nbsp;Person lifting the chair, a&nbsp;scuffle, there was, I mean,&nbsp;because it is important in terms&nbsp;of the range of things.People yelling rude things and&nbsp;people actually physically&nbsp;swinging, the death threats, but&nbsp;to
 me, those were the -- those,&nbsp;like, should be hung in public,&nbsp;it's like there is just no space&nbsp;in any universe of any kind of&nbsp;righteous politics saying that.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
[4:31:23 PM]<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I agree wise, the&nbsp;majority of the supporters are&nbsp;not engaging this way, the&nbsp;bottom line, there is a segment&nbsp;that is, and they're saying, I&nbsp;mean, I've been on the receiving&nbsp;end of it, many reporterers,&nbsp;especially women reporters, this&nbsp;is what is disturbing,
 those of&nbsp;us on the receiving end of it,&nbsp;it is there as a gender basedforum of this type of attacks.&nbsp;That's problematic.&nbsp;I think that what while he can&nbsp;still make his point, he had&nbsp;some very valid points about&nbsp;money and politics, but he can&nbsp;make those points
 while&nbsp;condemning that strain within&nbsp;his support base.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; I would also say there is a&nbsp;line that separates people and I&nbsp;think this goes to your point&nbsp;about war.&nbsp;People who feel like they're at&nbsp;war.&nbsp;Bernie Sanders has been saying&nbsp;this a revolution.&nbsp;Some people have interpreted&nbsp;that as a nice line, good rally.&nbsp;Of
 some people think they're&nbsp;revolutionaries.&nbsp;They take it literally.&nbsp;In the same way some tea&nbsp;partiers did, and continue to.&nbsp;That leads to extreme asures.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; Condemned for the target&nbsp;language, so the left has a&nbsp;responsibility to do the very&nbsp;same thing.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; Let me say this also.&nbsp;In terms of when you talk about&nbsp;tea parties and Ron Paul, right,&nbsp;those people didn't feel like&nbsp;we've got to make sure the&nbsp;Republican party wins in the&nbsp;end.&nbsp;Let me also say, they were very&nbsp;effective.&nbsp;They may not have helped the&nbsp;party
 as a partceed, but&nbsp;you can be sure the Ron Paul&nbsp;agenda moved through, and the&nbsp;tea party agenda, very much&nbsp;moved to the mainstream.&nbsp;So sometimes there is a&nbsp;difference between what will&nbsp;most effectively implant your&nbsp;I'd logical vision and what will&nbsp;win the party
 elections in the&nbsp;short-term.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It is possible that people most&nbsp;committed to Sanders' version&nbsp;are act anything some senserationally insofar as they think&nbsp;the implantation is overriding.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; I think there is a serious&nbsp;question, the democratic party&nbsp;should grapple with more&nbsp;Bradley.&nbsp;We've seen it play out really&nbsp;since 2010, where essentially&nbsp;the ruling kind of majority of&nbsp;the Republican party ignored the&nbsp;needs and focus of the base, the&nbsp;people
 voting for them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
[4:33:34 PM]<br>
<br>
The Democrats, I mean, you can&nbsp;watch kind of Hillary Clinton&nbsp;become in many ways, is she the&nbsp;chamber of commerce candidate of&nbsp;2016.&nbsp;Potentially.&nbsp;Does that put her and others who&nbsp;support her --&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; There is a danger of that&nbsp;division opening up in the dooep&nbsp;party.&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Still to come, continued&nbsp;fallout over &quot;The New York&nbsp;Times&quot; piece how trump treats&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;;color:#545454;letter-spacing:.1pt;border:solid #AAAAAA 1.0pt;padding:0in;background:#DDDDDD">women, now his
