from DNC (things I'm going to be asked later - apologies).

Hey Luis,
I pinged Mark as well, but do you all have a response to Sander=92s latest =
salvo against DWS? Seems to be getting rather personal. I=92m still not on =
the press list so apologies if you sent something out earlier today.
Thanks,
Jackie
