Washington Post =96 Robert Costa

Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, whose campaign has strug=
gled in the delegate-selection process, will appear at party conventions in=
 California and Virginia later this week to personally court activists and =
address the gatherings, according to three people familiar with his plans.

Trump will stop by the Hyatt Regency hotel near the San Francisco Internati=
onal Airport on Friday for the opening day of the California GOP=92s state =
convention. A day later, he will visit James Madison University in Harrison=
burg, Va., for the Republican Party of Virginia=92s convention, the people =
said.

The people told of Trump=92s still-unannounced appearances and their impetu=
s requested anonymity to discuss private conversations between state GOP le=
aders and the business mogul=92s top aides.

When asked Monday for comment, a Trump adviser confirmed that the billionai=
re would be traveling to California and Virginia but would not provide deta=
ils of his schedule.

The stops are part of an evolving strategy with Trump=92s inner circle abou=
t how to counter Sen. Ted Cruz=92s highly-organized efforts at recent state=
 Republican conventions, where the Texas senator accumulated a growing numb=
er of delegates due to his team=92s ability to navigate the events and rule=
s.

Over the weekend, for example, Cruz won 95 percent of Maine=92s 20 delegate=
 seats at the state=92s convention, a percentage far more than the proporti=
on he won in the state=92s caucuses.

But in Maine, Trump did not speak or hold meetings as he plans to later in =
the week. Instead, a leading supporter, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, sp=
oke there as did another ally, Gov. Paul LePage (R).

Alarmed by Cruz=92s success in states where Trump has done well, Trump is s=
aid to have personally requested his high command to add these two state co=
nventions to his schedule, confident that his presence and overtures could =
convince some delegates to get behind his campaign.


Trump is also said to be fuming Monday about the move over the weekend by C=
ruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich to cut an unusual deal =96 agreeing to divvy =
up three upcoming primaries. Cruz will concentrate on Indiana, Kasich on Ne=
w Mexico and Oregon as they try to deny Trump victories.



The trips come as Paul Manafort, Trump=92s newly-enlisted confidant and con=
vention manager, is bringing on new personnel and attempting to bolster the=
 campaign=92s delegate operation. On Monday, Ken McKay, the former campaign=
 manager for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's unsuccessful bid for the GOP =
nomination, signed on as a senior adviser, a hire first reported by Bloombe=
rg.

Trump will hold three events later Monday in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania =
ahead of several primaries on Tuesday, where he is expected to sweep.
