I'd rather be a coal miner than a statistician, but what do you [inaudible 00:27:41]. They're good.

At A Campaign Rally, Trump Encouraged The Fire Marshal To Allow The Crowd To Go Beyond The Auditorium Capacity: "Just Let Them In. Let Them In. We Have Plenty Of Exits, Right? Besides That, What's Going To Burn? It's A Concrete Floor. There's Not A Lot, Right?" TRUMP: "We'd have as big as the auditorium. Look at this big room, and look, right back to the corners. By the way, you have thousands of people outside. Please, please, Mr. Fire Department, let them in, okay? Just let them in. Let them in. We have plenty of exits, right? Besides that, what's going to burn? It's a concrete floor. There's not a lot, right?" [Campaign Rally, Eugene OR, 5/6/16]



Trump Said His Strategists Told Him He Would Carry Oregon In The General Election. TRUMP: "Most importantly, but that's important, but most importantly in November we are to carry your state. Some people say it's inclined toward the Democrats, and then I walk in, they said, 'Mr. Trump,' and I talk to people like this association, 'Mr. Trump I have to honest, you've got something going under we've never seen before. You will win this state. You're going to win this state, but you've got to go in there. You're going to win.'" [Campaign Rally, Eugene OR, 5/6/16]



Trump: "Be Careful Of Trump." TRUMP: "Now the polls are starting to show. They are getting... And, the guy who said it, 'Be careful of Trump, because he had sixteen people, right now, that are home watching television that were stars, right? Be careful of Trump.' Look, you know, I haven't had a big life of losing, okay? Here's the story, folks. Vote. Do your vote. Send it back." [Campaign Rally, Lynden WA, 5/7/16]



Trump: "You Have These Dummies. They Like To Consider Themselves They Say The Elite. I'm Not Elite? I Went To A Better School Than They Did. I'm Smarter Than They Are. I'm Not Elite?" TRUMP: "You have these dummies. They like to consider themselves they say the elite. I'm not elite. I went to a better school than they did. I'm smarter than they are. I'm not elite. They say the elite they don't like because they want to see free trade. I want free trade too. I'm a free trader but you can't have free trade when you have stupid people doing the negotiation. You can't because we are being beaten on every front and you can't do it." [Campaign Rally, Spokane WA, 5/7/16]



Trump On Accusation Of Not Being A True Conservative: "Who The Hell Cares? We Got To Straighten Out Our Country." TRUMP: "He gets on 'I don't like Donald Trump. He's not a conservative.'

Trump Called John Kerry "An Idiot." TRUMP: "We have Iran as becoming this power. We've made them a power .Not only did they make a good deal with this idiot that we have John Kerry. He's an idiot to make a deal like that. He never once walked from the negotiation. When they were standing and they were saying 'We're walking.' He would say, 'Please don't walk.' You know the Persians, the Iranians are great negotiators. The Persians are great but never once did John Kerry walk. He said he walked a lot." [Campaign Rally, Spokane WA, 5/7/16]



Trump: "The Heroin Is So Plentiful Coming Over The Southern Border... That It Sells For Less Than Candy. You Can Buy A Mars Bar, It Costs You More Money Than The Heroin." TRUMP: "We will build a wall. It will be a nice high wall. This is peanuts. This is nothing compared--  We will build a wall. It will be a beautiful wall. It will be a big wall. It will have a door in it because we want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally. They have to come in legally. This will be a beautiful, beautiful, tall, strong wall that nobody is playing games with. You ever see the walls they have now? They have these little walls. They drive trucks, they put a ramp up. I even say why do they do that? They could just drive right through it. They go over, under. They have drugs loaded in the trucks. They drive right across the border. They sell the drugs, they destroy our children, they destroy our way of life, they destroy our families. Heroin. In New Hampshire, I won. It was my first state. I love the people of New Hampshire. They entrusted me and I'll tell you what. New Hampshire is so beautiful. It's like this in a way. Look at the trees, like this. So beautiful. You drive through these beautiful country roads. New Hampshire is a very important political state. They entrusted me. I went to meetings. We'd have huge crowds. I'd go to meetings with people. I'd say 'What's your biggest problem?' They'd say heroin. I said "Heroin? Look at the lakes, look at the trees. It just doesn't look like heroin." They say 'Our youth is being poisoned Mr. Trump. It's coming in. The heroin is so plentiful coming over the southern border. It's so plentiful, Mr. Trump, that it sells for less than candy. You can buy a Mars Bar, it costs you more money than the heroin. Our children are being poisoned. Our people are being poisoned beyond the children.' I said '"I will stop it. I will stop it.' I'm going to stop it." [Campaign Rally, Lynden WA, 5/7/16]



Trump: "I Promise You, I Will Never Be In A Bicycle Race. I Give You My Word. Okay? I Promise." TRUMP: "I'll be totally politically incorrect. And, the Iranians are great negotiators. So, he's negotiated with Persians. Great negotiators. They're killing him. He didn't.  He should have left. He goes-- Instead, he goes on a bicycle and he breaks his leg so badly that for six months he's out of bed. Can you imagine? This guy who was seventy-three years old, he's in a bicycle race. I promise you, I will never be in a bicycle race. I give you my word. Okay? I promise." [Campaign Rally, Lynden WA, 5/7/16]

TRUMP: "A great heart. She was a warm woman. She was a tremendous -- she had a tremendous warmth and a tremendous heart. And she understood -- she understood life so well.

Bernie Sanders

Trump: "How Much Do You Feel, If You're Bernie Sanders, And You're Doing A Good Job--Again, I Am No Fan Of This Guy, Okay? But, How Would You Feel If You Were Him?" TRUMP: "But, again, how much do you feel, if you're Bernie Sanders, and you're doing a good job--Again, I am no fan of this guy, okay? But, how would you feel if you were him? And, you're winning all this stuff and you have no chance? He must have hatred in his heart, you know? He must have hatred." [Campaign Rally, Lynden WA, 5/7/16]



Trump: "You Know, It's A Rigged System Against Him, Also. I'm No Bernie Fan, I Can Tell You That. But It Is A Rigged System." TRUMP: "Well, I thought I'd do it. I didn't know I was going to do it this early. I assumed that Hillary would be watching me as opposed to me watching Hillary. So that's good. And it's going to be an interesting thing, because Bernie Sanders-- is not being treated fairly. He's not being treated fairly. You know, it's a rigged system against him, also.

Politically Correct

Trump Lamented About Having To Say "People" Instead Of "Men" To Be Politically Correct: "Years Ago I Would Have Said, 'Look At All These Strong Men.' But Today, If You Say That, They Say, 'You're Sexist! That's Horrible'... It Has Gotten So Out Of Control." "By the way, I have to tell you, the trip in, so beautiful. The fields, the trees, and look at all these strong people out here in the audience. See, years ago I would have said, 'Look at all these strong men.' But today, if you say that, they say, 'You're sexist! That's horrible.' Hillary Clinton would say, 'That was a horrible statement. He said, 'Look at the strong men.' He should say, 'Look at the strong people.'' It has gotten so out of control, I have to tell you. It is so out of control." [Campaign Rally, Eugene OR, 5/6/16]



Trump: "I Won't Use The Word 'Indian' Because They Say It's Not A Nice Word To Use. So I Will Not Say Indian. She Is A Native American." TRUMP: "I hear that goofy Elizabeth Warren-- And I'm serious, this is a woman who has not done anything in the United States Senate, and they say, 'Oh, she's a super-liberal,' and her whole career is a fraud, because she goes out and she says she's a Native American. I won't use the word 'Indian' because they say it's not a nice word to use. So I will not say Indian. She is a Native American, 5 percent. Therefore, her whole career, because she was a minority. It's a disgrace what's going on in our country." [Campaign Rally, Eugene OR, 5/6/16]



Trump: "She's Part Native American. You're Not Allowed To Say Indian So I Won't Say It. I Want To Be Politically Correct." TRUMP: "She's the one that said yes, she's part Native American. You're not allowed to say Indian so I won't say it. I want to be politically correct. She said, yes she's 5% Native American. Why? Why? You know why she said she was? She felt that her mother had high cheek bones. She had no other information. She's been going around--  Which is a fraud, she's been going around pretending that she's a minority, right? She's doing things and she's getting into colleges and she's doing all sorts of things. She's a total phony. I call her the goofus, okay? Elizabeth Warren. I hope she runs with Hillary, because I would like to take them out. Their phonies. Their phonies and I'd love to take them out. Honestly, I think Hillary is too smart to pick Elizabeth Warren but I would love to see her. I would love to see her. Let's see what she does when they say we want real proof that you're a Native American. That was a beauty. That was a beauty." [Campaign Rally, Lynden WA, 5/7/16]



Voting

Trump On Washington's Vote-By-Mail System: "You Don't Even Have To Go Out And Vote In Your Case. Most People At Least Have To Go Out. I Don't Know What The Hell Kind Of System You Have Here. You Don't Even Have To Leave Your House." TRUMP: "Here's the story folks. We're not going to be the stupid people, the stupid country. You're going to have the smart people now and we're going to have a country that you're going to be proud of. Here's what you have to do. You have to go remember the date May 24th but do it immediately. Don't wait. Go home. You're going to hopefully sitting in your mailbox because you don't have to go. Send that thing in because we want those votes. You don't even have to go out and vote in your case. Most people at least have to go out. I don't know what the hell kind of system you have here. You don't even have to leave your house. Check the back of the envelope and sign it. Do what you have to do. Don't just send it. Here's the story folks. You're going to consider that vote and you're going to consider the vote you make in November to be the most important vote you've ever made. You're going to look back 20 years from now, 2 years from now, 40 years from now maybe 50 for some of the young ones in the front and you're going to say that was the greatest day because that's when we made America great again."

Trump Opposed Same-Day Voter Registration. TODD: "Do you want to see the voting laws changed to make it easier to vote?"  TRUMP: "I want to see voting laws so that people that are citizens can vote, not so people that can walk off the street can vote or so that illegal immigrants can go and vote." TODD: "You're not for  same day voter registration?" TRUMP: "No, no. I want to make the voting laws so that people that I -- it doesn't make any difference how they do it-- but I don't think people should sneak in through the cracks." TODD: "Oh, OK." TRUMP: "You have to have -- and whether that's an ID or any way you want to do it, but you have to be a citizen to vote." TODD: "Well, of course. That is -- that is the law as it stands already." TRUMP: "No, it's not." TODD: "Let me ask--" TRUMP: "I mean you have -- you have -- you have places where people-- just walk in and vote." [Meet The Press, NBC, 5/8/16]

Debt
Trump Suggested Issuing New Long-Term Debt At Low-Interest Rates To Fund Infrastructure Spending. TRUMP: "Well, you never know. You never know. All of a sudden they have to sell at a discount. You don't -- you don't know that. At some point, they might want to get out. Maybe they need their money. They might want to get out. When you can do it, when you can take advantage, you do that. But you might want to issue new long-term debt and very low interest rates and you may want a -- a combination of buying back some debt and rebuild our infrastructure. George, we've spent more than $4 trillion in the Middle East and our country is going to hell." [This Week, ABC, 5/8/16]

Trump Denied Having Suggested The U.S. Default On Its Debt: "If There's A Chance To Buy Back Debt At A Discount, The U.S. - In Other Words, Interest Rates Go Up And The Bonds Go Down And You Can Buy Debt-- That's What I'm Talking About." TRUMP: "So we can buy back debt at a discount. People said I want to go and buy debt and default on debt and - I mean these people are crazy. This is the United States government. First of all, you never have to default because you print the money. I hate to tell you, OK. So there's never a default. But - but the point is, I would - it was reported in 'The New York Times' incorrectly, you know, the failing 'New York Times' - "CUOMO: "That - that you said you would go to creditors and make them take less." TRUMP: "It was reported in the failing 'New York Times' and other places that - that I want to default on debt. You know, I'm the king of debt. I understand debt better than probably anybody. I know how to - I know how to deal with debt so - very well. I love debt. But, you know, it's - debt is tricky and it's dangerous and you have to be careful and you have to know what you're doing. But let me just tell you, if there's a chance to buy back debt at a discount, the U.S. - in other words, interest rates go up and the bonds go down and you can buy debt-- That's what I'm talking about."

Puerto Rico

HEADLINE: "Trump Becomes Puerto Rico Wild Card." [The Hill, 5/8/16<http://thehill.com/policy/finance/279054-trump-becomes-puerto-rico-wild-card>]



Trump Sent Mixed Messages About Support For The House's Legislation On Debt Relief For Puerto Rico. "Donald Trump has become a wild card in Speaker Paul Ryan's effort to win House passage of a debt relief package for Puerto Rico. A pair of confusing interviews from the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has left competing impressions on whether he actually supports the emerging House legislation, which represents one of Ryan's top legislative priorities. House lawmakers are mulling a bill that would set up an outside control board for the island's finances and allow it to restructure its debt, which now totals more than $70 billion. Trump told CNN on Wednesday that he opposed a bailout of the island, even though the current House proposal does not direct any new federal dollars to the territory. A day later, Trump told Fox News that it was inevitable the island would have to restructure its debt, which is a move that can only be forced by an act of Congress. 'You can restructure the debt without a bailout,' he said Thursday. 'You can restructure the debt. Bondholders are going to take a hit; let the bondholders take a hit.' The mixed messages from the self-proclaimed 'king of debt' and presumptive GOP nominee come as Ryan and his leadership team tamp down 'bailout' jitters from their rank-and-file members."

Trump's Mixed Signals On Support For Puerto Rican Debt Relief Came Right As The House Prepared To Take Up The Legislation. "The mixed messages from the self-proclaimed 'king of debt' and presumptive GOP nominee come as Ryan and his leadership team tamp down 'bailout' jitters from their rank-and-file members. It also adds a new layer to brewing tension between Trump and the Wisconsin Republican. In a stunning move this week, the Speaker said he was not yet ready to back Trump, the only Republican left in the race, for president. The sparring comes at a critical time for the bill, as GOP leaders are hoping to get the package back on track after progress derailed in April. Ryan originally set a goal of moving on Puerto Rico debt relief by March 31, but the House Natural Resources Committee had to hastily cancel a mid-April markup due to insufficient support in both parties. Outside ads run in members' home districts blasting the legislation as a 'bailout' complicated matters for congressional leaders, as they had to take time to make clear that the bill did not spend new money on propping up the island. Now, Republicans are claiming that the reworked bill is in its final stages and likely to again become public when lawmakers return to Washington next week. The message from Ryan has been consistent on the bill: take up the measure now, or Washington will end up paying for it later with an actual bailout."

Tax Policy

That`s what it is, whether we like it or not. So I put in my plan. It`s quite simple to see. It`s a simplification. We lower the number of brackets. We lower the taxes on the middle class, on business and we lower the taxes on everybody very substantially. But I -- I have no illusions.

Trump Said He Would Fight To Keep Tax Breaks For The Middle Class And Business, But "For The Wealthy, I Think, Frankly, It's Going To Go Up. And, You Know What, It Really Should Go Up." TODD: "The issue of taxes. Your tax plan is one where the biggest beneficiaries are the .1 percent when it comes to raw dollars that will be saved among taxes. But then in an interview earlier this week, you seemed to say ah, you know what, my tax plan, it's not set in stone and maybe I'll raise taxes-- maybe I'll actually raise taxes on the rich. So I guess which is it? Are you willing to raise taxes on the .1 percent-or not?" TRUMP: "-- It's everything. No, no, no. Let me explain. Let me explain how the world works, OK? I think nobody knows more about taxes than I do and income than I do. But I'll explain how it all works. I don't come up with it. I came up with the -- the biggest tax cut, by far, of any candidate, anybody. And I put it in. But that doesn't mean that's what we're going to get. We have to negotiate. That I'm going to do is make sure the middle class gets good taxes -- tax breaks, because they have been absolutely shunned. The other thing, I'm going to fight very hard for business. For the wealthy, I think, frankly, it's going to go up. And, you know what, it really should go up-- because the wealthy have--" TODD: "They should pay-- the wealthy need to pay more taxes. What do you define as wealthy, by the way?" TRUMP: "No, here is -- no let me ex -- let me explain -- somebody like me. Let me explain something. I'm putting in a plan, Chuck, I have to negotiate now with senators and congressmen and lots of other. The fact that I put in a plan, it really is a floor. That`s what it is, whether we like it or not. So I put in my plan. It`s quite simple to see. It`s a simplification. We lower the number of brackets. We lower the taxes on the middle class, on business and we lower the taxes on everybody very substantially. But I -- I have no illusions. I don`t think that`s going to be the final plan, because they are going to come to me, including the Democrats and everybody else, they`re going to come to me, they`re going to want to negotiate. But that`s a floor. That`s where we`re starting--Now, when it comes time to negotiate-- I feel less concerned with the rich than I do with the middle class." [Meet The Press, NBC, 5/8/16]

Trump On His Proposed Tax Cuts: "I'm Not Under The Illusion That That's Going To Pass." TODD: "Should we assume that most of your plans, then, we shouldn`t take you at your word, as sort of that there are floors, what you just described, that, you know what, it`s my opening statement." TRUMP: "It`s -- you have -- it`s not--" TODD: "But everything is negotiable." TRUMP: "Excuse me. It`s -- excuse me, it`s called life, Chuck. It`s not my word. Of course, I put in a proposal. You know what they are? They`re really proposals. People can say it's a tax plan. It's really a tax proposal, because after I put it in -- and I think you know the Senate and Congress-- you know--" TODD: "Yes." TRUMP: "-- as much as anybody, they start working with you and they start fighting. And, you know, let`s see what happens. But I put in a proposal. Under my proposal, it`s the biggest tax cut by far of any candidate, by far." TODD: "Right." TRUMP: "But I`m under -- I`m not under the illusion that that's going to pass. They`re going to come to me." TODD: "Right." TRUMP: "They`re going to want to raise it for the rich, frankly. They`re going to want to raise it for the rich more than anybody else. But the middle class has to be protected." TODD: "OK." TRUMP: "The rich is probably going to end up paying more. And business might have to pay a little bit more. But we're giving a massive business tax cut." [Meet The Press, NBC, 5/8/16]

You just said it within 10 words." TRUMP: "No, no, I didn`t say it. Excuse me, I said they -- they might have to pay a little bit more than my proposal, Chuck... I'm not talking about more than they're paying now." [Meet The Press, NBC, 5/8/16]

Trump Said Taxes On The Wealthy "Will Go Up A Little Bit" Under His Administration. STEPHANOPOULOS: "You say fixing the economy is your number one priority as president. And your tax plan is your more substantive and specific proposal out there. You said recently again that you believe in raising taxes on the wealthy, including yourself, but your plan gives a massive tax cut to the wealthy. How do you square that?" TRUMP: "It gives a massive tax cut to everybody. If you look at Larry Kudlow, he said it's a great plan. He loves the plan." STEPHANOPOULOS: "But more to the wealthy than everyone else." TRUMP: "George. And I'll say this to people, I've said it many times. I make deals. I negotiate. I put out a plan that has a massive, massive tax -- bigger than any other candidate. We have to negotiate with congress. You know, I'm not going to be able to say, like, President Obama let's do an executive order, OK. It would be wonder, it would be a lot easier, but you just can't do it when you're not supposed to do it. He may do something -- and what he's done will probably -- much of it will be overturned by the courts. What I'm doing is I'm putting in a plan and that's my maximum plan. It's what I want." STEPHANOPOULOS: "But bottom line, do you want taxes on the wealthy to go up or down?" TRUMP: "They will go up a little bit. And they may got up, you know--" STEPHANOPOULOS: "But they're going down in your plan." TRUMP: No, no, in my plan they're going down, but by the time it's negotiated, they'll go up. Look, when I'm negotiating with the Democrats, I'm putting in plan. I'm putting in my optimum plan. It's going to be negotiated, George, it's not going to stay there. They're not going to say there's your plan, let's approve it. They're going to say, let's see what we can do. Now, it will be a negotiation. I will try and keep everything -- what I really want is lower on business, because business -- we're the highest taxed nation in the world. And I want lower in the middle class. The middle class in this country is getting decimated. I want -- and I will fight like hell for that." [This Week, ABC, 5/8/16]

Trump Clarified His Statements On Tax Policy: "I May Have To Increase It On The Wealthy. I'm Not Going To Allow It To Be Increased On The Middle Class. Now, If I Increase On The Wealthy, That Means They're Still Going To Be Paying Less Than They Pay Now. I'm Not Talking About Increasing From This Point, I'm Talking About Increasing From My Tax Proposal." TRUMP: "Let me just set it straight. I put in the biggest tax decrease of anybody running for office by far, OK, and many people think it's great, and if anything, I was criticized because it's too steep a cut, but that's OK, but I put in by far the biggest tax decrease. All right. What I said - and that really is a proposal because we have to go to congress, we have to go to the senate, we have to go to our congress men and women and we have to negotiate a deal. So it really is a proposal, but it's a very steep proposal. I said that I may have to increase the section - and by the way, everybody across the board, businesses, everybody's getting a tax cut, especially the middle class. And I said that I may have to increase it on the wealthy. I'm not going to allow it to be increased on the middle class. Now, if I increase on the wealthy, that means they're still going to be paying less than they pay now. I'm not talking about increasing from this point, I'm talking about increasing from my tax proposal." [New Day, CNN, 5/9/16]

Trump Said He Might Have To Raise Taxes On The Wealthy "Not For Where They Are Now, But From The Proposal." TRUMP: "We are the highest taxation in the world and we are among the lowest tax base. Not the lowest, but how low can you go.

I may have to raise it." MARIA: "On the wealthy, the highest earners?" TRUMP: "I'm really going to fight hard because the middle-class has been decimated in this country. I am not raising it and I'm not raising it on this, but I can see the wealthy getting raised. Not for where they are now, but from the proposal." [Mornings With Maria, Fox Business, 5/9/16]

Minimum Wage
Trump Said He Opposed The Federal Government Setting A Minimum Wage. TODD: "Minimum wage -- at a debate, you know you remember what you said, you thought you didn`t want to touch it. Now you`re open to it. What changed?" TRUMP: "Let me just tell you, I`ve been traveling the country for many months, since June 16th. I`m all over. Today I`m in the state of Washington, where the arena right behind me, you probably hear it, is packed with thousands and thousands of people. I`m doing that right after I finish you. I will -- I have seen what`s going on and I don`t know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude, but I`d rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide, because don`t forget, the states have to compete with each other."  TODD: "Right. You want the fed--" TRUMP: "So you may have--" TODD: "-- but should the federal government set a floor and then you let the state--" TRUMP: "No, I would--  No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck." TODD: "All right." TRUMP: "So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they`re out there, they`re working. It is a very low number. You know, with what`s happened to-- the economy, with what`s happened to the costs, I mean it`s just -- I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide."

Every state has a different cost of living and I would like to leave it to the states. $7.25 is pretty tough. As far as I'm concerned, I could see something happening there. I would leave it to the states because the states have to compete with each other. They have to compete with outside interest and I would leave minimum -- it's happening anyway because states like New York where you stay. I would leave the minimum wage to the states."

Not that I want to raise it and I biked to because something should happen. $7.25. What I would do with this. I would leave it to the states because every region is different.

HEADLINE: "Trump Calls For End To Federal Minimum Wage As Views Shift." [The Guardian, 5/8/16<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/federal-minimum-wage-trump>]



Trump Rejected The Idea Of A National Minimum Wage And Would "Rather Have The States Go Out And Do What They Have To Do" To Compete With One Another. Donald Trump has called for the elimination of the federal minimum wage, as he retreated from primary promises and once again refused to release his tax returns because of 'a link' to an audit. The presumptive Republican nominee for president repeatedly said he would support a higher minimum wage, a reversal from his position when he had conservative opponents. But he insisted on Sunday that states should decide such wages. 'I like the idea of 'let the states decide',' Trump told NBC's Meet the Press. 'But I think people should get more. I think they're out there. They're working. It is a very low number.' Asked 'should the federal government set a floor' - a national minimum wage - Trump replied: 'No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do.' 'And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other.' In a November debate, the businessman, who claims his net worth is worth more than $10bn, said: 'Taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world.'"

And if we don't do that, we're very, very--" STEPHANOPOULOS: "But don't you have to also lead by example? You know, so many of the products in the Donald J. Trump Collection are made overseas -- Bangladesh, China--" TRUMP: "Well, that's because you can't even buy them here. You know, George, I want to buy television sets here. I want to buy it. I buy thousands of television sets a year. I have a lot of different projects, as you probably have heard. And I buy thousands of sets. I cannot buy a television set in this country." STEPHANOPOULOS: "But if you want other companies to make their products in America, shouldn't you make your products in America?" TRUMP: "But they don't make a lot of these products. They don't even make them here anymore. If you look at--" STEPHANOPOULOS: "But shouldn't you lead by example?" TRUMP: "George, I told you, they don't even make this stuff here.

Now, I will say this, there are knock-offs from hundreds of companies of the -- you know, that hat is a very successful thing. And I see them all the time, all over the place. But I said, I want all of this stuff for the campaign, I want it to be made here. It's made here. And I'm very happy about it.

You go to Los Angeles, the biggest ships you've ever seen loaded up with cars, right? You look at what we have. We send beef. Beef is very important, but it's not quite as big a product. Do we agree? Okay? Do we agree? Sometimes they send it back because they don't want it, because their farmers don't want it. They send it back, and then we send it back. It goes back and forth, back and forth, and then they charge you much more. They call it kobe beef. It's old, it's old. It's old. Who the hell wants it? They charge you much more money."

I believe in free trade, which everybody likes, but we've been taken advantage of by globalization, because we have leaders that are incompetent.

I'm a free trader but you can't have free trade when you have stupid people doing the negotiation. You can't because we are being beaten on every front and you can't do it. I'll tell you what trade deficit with China $505 billion a year. Who makes a deal like that? Then they say, 'Oh we're going to end up with their trade war.' Trade war? When you're losing $505 billion maybe that's a damn good thing to have a trade war. Think of it. Mexico, $58 billion a year. That doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring in.

Trump Said He Would Rectify The United States' Trade Deficit In A Single Day: "The Balance Is So Off. I Will Take Care Of That Situation So Fast In One Day That Situation Will Be Equalized. One Day, Okay?" TRUMP: "You go out to Los Angeles you see ships. The biggest ships you've ever seen loaded up with hundreds and hundreds probably thousands of cars and they're docked in one after another and cars just pouring off these ships. They pay almost no tax and yet with Nebraska that sends beef to Japan I said, 'Do you have to pay tax?' 'Yes we pay 38% tariff.' 38%, I never knew that. That's on top of the fact that in terms of balance the cars far outweigh. The cars are up to the ceiling and the beef is down there. In other words, the balance is so off. I will take care of that situation so fast in one day that situation will be equalized. One day, okay? We have many. China sends it stuff over no tax. You want to do business with China, number 1 if you're a manufacturer it's almost impossible to get your goods into China. If you get them, they don't want them. They're right. They want their own people to make them. They don't want them. If they get them in, you're going to pay a massive tax." [Campaign Rally, Spokane WA, 5/7/16]

These trade deals have sucked everything out of our country. And by the way, Clinton is the one that approved NAFTA. NAFTA is the worst deal, one of the worst deals our country's ever made from an economic standpoint. One of the worst deals ever. It's taken - if you've seen what it's done to New York State and New England and virtually every state, but it's just - it is just, it has sucked the jobs out of our country, it sucked the money out of our country. We're going to bring our jobs back. We're going to make it much harder for people to leave, for people to take their companies and just go to Mexico and then sell the product back into the United States with no tax or nothing." CUOMO: "No, I think that you're taking it the wrong way, because obviously I'm playing off what the headline is everywhere this morning. I'm not just making it up, and NAFTA, I understand you wanting to bring up trade. As you know, Clinton did not pass NAFTA. Bush passed NAFTA. So you can criticize it all you want." TRUMP: "Oh really? Who signed NAFTA?" CUOMO: "You can criticize it all you want. I'm just saying you want to keep the history. Bush was involved with NAFTA." TRUMP: "Excuse me. Who signed NAFTA? Whose bill was it and who signed it?" CUOMO: "But what is your point, though? This was in the Bush administration."

Washington Post's Zakaria: "[Trump] Inherited A Considerable Fortune From His Father And, By Some Accounts, Would Be Wealthier Today If He Had Simply Invested In A Stock Index Fund. His Greatest Skill Has Been To Play A Successful Businessman On His Television Show 'The Apprentice.'" "At the heart of Donald Trump's appeal is his fame as a successful businessman. It's why most of his supporters don't worry about his political views or his crude rhetoric and behavior. He's a great chief executive and will get things done. No one believes this more than Trump himself, who argues that his prowess in the commercial world amply prepares him for the presidency. 'In fact I think in many ways building a great business is actually harder,' he told GQ last year. There is some debate about Trump's record as a businessman. He inherited a considerable fortune from his father and, by some accounts, would be wealthier today if he had simply invested in a stock index fund. His greatest skill has been to play a successful businessman on his television show 'The Apprentice.' Regardless, it is fair to say that Trump has formidable skills in marketing. He has been able to create a brand around his name like few others. The real problem is that these talents might prove largely irrelevant because commerce is quite different from government."

Washington Post's Zakaria: "[Trump] Has Been Able To Create A Brand Around His Name Like Few Others. The Real Problem Is That These Talents Might Prove Largely Irrelevant Because Commerce Is Quite Different From Government." "Regardless, it is fair to say that Trump has formidable skills in marketing. He has been able to create a brand around his name like few others. The real problem is that these talents might prove largely irrelevant because commerce is quite different from government. The modern presidents who achieved the most - Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan - had virtually no commercial background. Some who did, George W. Bush and Herbert Hoover, fared worse in the White House. There is no clear pattern. One of the few successful CEOs who did well in Washington is Robert Rubin. A former head of Goldman Sachs, he served as the chief White House aide on economics and then treasury secretary in Bill Clinton's administration. When he left Washington, he reflected in his memoirs that he had developed "a deep respect for the differences between the public and private sectors'... This displays an astonishing lack of understanding about the world. The United Nations can't end conflicts because it has no power. That rests with sovereign governments (unless Trump wants to cede U.S. authority to U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon). The notion that all it would take is a strong U.S. ambassador to shake up the U.N., end conflicts and 'win' is utterly removed from reality. Yet it is a perfect example of business thinking applied in a completely alien context. Success in business is important, honorable and deeply admirable. But it requires a particular set of skills that are often very different from those that produce success in government."

At a hearing in March, Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said he expected 'a zoo' if the case went to trial in August. It's unclear precisely why Curiel scheduled the trial for November, but he has indicated a concern about allowing too long of a delay in the case - a portion of which involves special claims of elder fraud for those who were over 65 and took part in the program.

Dozens Of Experienced Republican Managers And Policy Experts Said They Would Not Serve In A Trump Administration. "Politico interviewed nearly five dozen Republicans over the past two weeks - people with experience working in government and who understand how Congress can enact, or shred, a new president's agenda - and heard the same sentiment expressed repeatedly. If Trump doesn't change his tune or extend much longer olive branches, many of these government veterans say they intend to cede highly coveted administration posts to less-experienced competitors... The lack of interest in serving Trump extends from the energy and financial services sectors to defense and foreign policy. And while the reluctance of former officials to join a Trump administration may spark a good-riddance response from the candidate himself, the absence of experienced professionals at the assistant-secretary level could have profound consequences on the government."

Women

Trump: "All Of The Men, We're Petrified To Speak To Women Anymore. We May Raise Our Voice. You Know What, The Women Get It Better Than We Do Folks." TRUMP: "The nice part is now we're focusing on Crooked Hillary Clinton and I think we're going to do very well. Here's the thing, she's going to have two billion dollars. They're already taken ninety million dollars worth of ads, and their ads women-oriented. She's playing the women's card. By the way, if she didn't play the women's card, she would have no chance. I mean zero, of winning. She's playing the women's card. She's going, 'Did you hear that Donald Trump raised his voice while speaking to a woman?' Oh, I'm sorry. All of the men, we're petrified to speak to women anymore. We may raise our voice. You know what, the women get it better than we do folks. They get it better than we do. If she didn't play that card, she has nothing. Here's what happens. This is sort of amazing to me. They go out and I looked at ninety million dollars, right? She's going to play the women card. Megyn Kelly, nice woman she came up to my office. She came up to me. She called me and I respect her for doing it.

Trump: "I Have Women That Make More Money Than Men Doing A Comparable Job." TRUMP: "There is nobody that has more respect for women then me. There is nobody, or certainly very few, that have promoted women within my big company than I have. I have women frankly I shouldn't say this because the men are going to get angry but I have women that make more money than men doing a comparable job. Men, am I okay saying that? They're fantastic. You know what I find with women? They want to see strength. They want strength in the borders. They want a strong military. They don't want people walking all over our country. They want to see common core ended and they want education to be brought locally." [Campaign Rally, Spokane WA, 5/7/16]



Trump: "Remember What I Said In The Statement?

I wanted to get on with the conversation because I think I was talking economic development. I didn't want to waste any more time. So when someone said, 'Did you hear what Donald Trump said?'

Trump: "They're Critical Because I Speak About Rosie O'Donnell. Who The Hell Wouldn't Speak Badly About Rosie O'Donnell. She's Terrible." TRUMP: "Then they're critical because I speak about Rosie O'Donnell. Who the hell wouldn't speak badly about Rosie O'Donnell. She's terrible. Then if I did like Howard Stern show from ten years ago. You have to understand folks, until a year ago, I was never going to be a politician the last thing in the world I wanted to be doing is this. So if I go on Howard Stern Show, we have fun and I've been with politicians and I've seen politicians on the air saying, not about me, about other people, 'That was horrible, what that man said about women,' or 'That was horrible what that man said about Hispanics, or African Americans.' I see these people. I see one guy the other day saying how bad it was about women. He said, 'That was a horrible thing.' I've been with this guy. The way he talks about women is so bad... Here's the thing. Now with Rosie, who the hell would not? How can you say good about Rosie O'Donnell? She's a disaster, okay." [Campaign Rally, Spokane WA, 5/7/16]



Trump Senior Adviser Manafort: "He Is Very Pro Women. He Has Proven It In His Business Life And Proven It More So Than Her Because He Has Proven It With Actions Not Words." MANAFORT: "Look, this is a clear case. Donald Trump has made it very clear he is not going to allow hypocrisy on the women's issue. He is not going to let Hillary make the case that he is against women and she is this defender of women's rights. I mean, his business empire is he has put many women in leadership positions, gender, race." WALLACE: "Respectfully, I asked you, what did -- what did Hillary Clinton do to those women? He says she destroyed their lives. How?" MANAFORT: "I will let him speak to it. The point is that, you know, the history is clear, she's an enabler in the past, I will let him speak to those issues. But the point is he made it very clear he was not going to let hypocrisy exist on a women's issue. He is not anti-women. He is very pro women. He has proven it in his business life and proven it more so than her because he has proven it with actions not words. And so, for her to go after him on being anti-women, he's going to go back and talk about some of the things that she did that are less than consistent as far as being pro-women."

But Today, If You Say That, They Say, 'You're Sexist! That's Horrible'... It Has Gotten So Out Of Control." "By the way, I have to tell you, the trip in, so beautiful. The fields, the trees, and look at all these strong people out here in the audience. See, years ago I would have said, 'Look at all these strong men.' But today, if you say that, they say, 'You're sexist! That's horrible.' Hillary Clinton would say, 'That was a horrible statement. He said, 'Look at the strong men.' He should say, 'Look at the strong people.'' It has gotten so out of control, I have to tell you. It is so out of control." [Campaign Rally, Eugene OR, 5/6/16]



Trump On His Past Inappropriate Comments About Women: "Some Of The Stuff Is Said As, You Know, An Entertainer, Because I Have The Apprentice, Or Some Of It Was Said In Fun With Certain Shows Like Howard Stern, Who Is A Friend Of Mine." TRUMP: "You know, Hillary Clinton, the only thing she's got going, she plays the woman card 100 percent. I saw her in a speech, well Donald Trump spoke a little bit harshly to Megyn Kelly. Well, Megyn Kelly was really terrific. She called me and came up to my office. She wanted to make peace. And we did. We did. I mean, it was very nice. Some of the stuff is said as, you know, an entertainer, because I have The Apprentice, or some of it was said in fun with certain shows like Howard Stern, who is a friend of mine--" STEPHANOPOULOS: "So, you're not worried about the tapes of that coming back?" TRUMP: "It comes back. I mean, look, what am I going to do? Everyone else thinks it. You know, these politicians, I watch the politicians, what they say behind the scenes makes whatever I said jokingly to Howard and other people like baby stuff. What they tell me behind the scenes talking about everything is far worse than anything that you've seen or you ever will see about me. And then they act like, oh, that's so terrible. That's so terrible. I mean, you know when it's called? Give me a break. And I watch Hillary Clinton like she's a baby. I mean, just look at what happens with her family. I watch Hillary Clinton like, oh, the way he talks to women, the way he talks to women, well -- you know, take a look at her husband and what do you think he talks to women? So, when I watch her and she's playing the women card so much and so loud. And frankly I think it's her only chance of getting elected. You know what, listen, she's going to get hit for it, because it's not appropriate." [This Week, ABC, 5/8/16]

TRUMP: "Now, my wife was a very successful person. She did great. She was a very successful model. And now she's a homemaker. I mean, she just wants to -- she loves taking caring of Barron. She's a very good woman. And, you know, people that are married to people like me, especially people like me -- I hope there are others out there, who knows -- but they get really hit unfairly by so many different articles and writers. And they're not looking to hurt them, they're looking to hurt me. But, you know, she's a very good woman. A tremendous heart. She's very -- you know, very charitable.

*         Pro-Clinton Super PAC, Priorities USA, Made A $90 Million Ad Buy In Swing States For June Through November. "The main super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton is reserving $20 million more in television ad time beginning the day after California's June 7 Democratic primary, meaning the group has now set down $90 million to air its anti-Republican message before any GOP candidate or group can respond. The move by Priorities USA Action to add to its existing August-through-Election Day ad buy in the pivotal swing states of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Virginia means the group will effectively be on the air non-stop between June - by which point Clinton's campaign expects to have wrapped up its nomination fight against Bernie Sanders - and November 8."

When Scalia died, that was not supposed to happen. He was supposed to be there for another ten, fifteen years. That was, you know, a sorry thing that happened. He was a great justice. But, when he died, so now you have that. You're going to have three, and maybe four others-- so you might have five, on top of the ones they've appointed over the last six, seven years, right?

National Republican Senatorial Committee Executive Director, Ward Baker, Advised Some Republican Lawmakers Not To Attend The Republican Convention. "In a new sign of the Republican Party's reservations about Mr. Trump, the top strategist in charge of defending Republican control of the Senate said in a briefing for lobbyists and donors on Thursday that the party's candidates should feel free to skip the nominating convention in Cleveland in July. The strategist, Ward Baker, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said conventions were a distracting spectacle every four years, according to two people who attended the briefing, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the private session. Mr. Baker, the attendees said, told Republican lawmakers that they would be better off talking to voters in their home states. Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said it was up to 'each individual campaign' to decide whether to attend the convention."

After Receiving The Republican Nomination, Trump Was Rebuked By The Two Living Past Republican President, The Speaker Of House, And A Number Of Sitting Republican Senators And Governors. "By seizing the Republican presidential nomination for Donald J. Trump on Tuesday night, he and his millions of supporters completed what had seemed unimaginable: a hostile takeover of one of America's two major political parties. Just as stunning was how quickly the host tried to reject them. The party's two living former presidents spurned Mr. Trump, a number of sitting governors and senators expressed opposition or ambivalence toward him, and he drew a forceful rebuke from the single most powerful and popular rival left on the Republican landscape: the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan. Rarely if ever has a party seemed to come apart so visibly. Rarely, too, has the nation been so on edge about its politics."

Trump: "Everything Is Subject To Negotiation, But I Can't And Won't Be Changing Much, Because The Voters Support Me Because Of What I'm Saying And How I'm Saying It."  "Mr. Trump now feels so empowered that he does not think he needs the political support of the party establishment to defeat the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. He is confident that his appeal will be broad and deep enough among voters of all stripes that he could win battleground states like Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania without the support of leaders like Mr. Ryan, Mr. Trump said in an interview on Saturday. Although he plans to meet with Mr. Ryan and House Republican leaders on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would not materially change his policies or style to win their endorsements. 'Everything is subject to negotiation, but I can't and won't be changing much, because the voters support me because of what I'm saying and how I'm saying it,' Mr. Trump said. 'The establishment didn't do anything to make me the nominee, so its support won't really make much difference in me winning in November.' (Mr. Trump will, though, be somewhat dependent on the party's fund-raising muscle since he has indicated he will not fully self-finance his general election campaign.) One reason Mr. Trump takes a skeptical view of establishment support is that he does not believe much in the power of the Republican elite. He is the party's presumptive nominee, after all, because the political forces that once might have halted his rise have been enfeebled. Leaders such as Mr. Romney warned in the direst terms that Mr. Trump's nomination would stain the party and lead it to ruin. Venerable media outlets on the right, like National Review, sought to reprise their role as arbiters of who is fit to carry the banner of conservatism. Their pleas fell on deaf ears."

Many senators come in, and we've had tremendous endorsements from a lot of people, both current and people that were here and highly respected people. You know, Rick Perry is an example. He came in, and I've always liked him, but he's a tough competitor and he fought hard. He was rough on me, right? He got up ... Remember, he went to Washington and made a speech for half an hour, a speech about Donald Trump. He said, 'I'm a cancer on the Republican Party.' No, that's the bad news. Let me tell you the good news. Yesterday he endorsed me, and I like him. I do like him. I forgot about the 1 hour where he went wild, okay? He said, 'One of the most talented or brilliant,' or something, 'candidates ever to run for the presidency in the history of the presidency.' You have that statement and then you have this statement.

Whereas, the Republican system is much more sophisticated. It's the same rigging but it's less obvious. So it's a smarter system. Let me tell you, we've now exposed it, but here's the way I looked at it. I won so I don't care anymore. We don't care anymore. It's rigged. Let somebody else worry about it. Let somebody else."

Trump On Paul Ryan Not Endorsing Him: "You're Supposed To Be Coming Together. Paul Ryan, I Don't Know What Happened." TRUMP: "You know, you're supposed to be coming together. Paul Ryan, I don't know what happened. I don't know. He called me 2, 3 weeks ago, was a very nice conversation. He was congratulating me.

We're going to see what happens. He wants to meet, I'll meet, but the important thing is you, folks. You'll understand that and he does understand that. I would bet if he had that decision to do again, he would have done it the simple way. 'I endorse Trump.' Okay. Do you agree with that? Well, it's only one of my volunteers saying that, but that's okay. My volunteer's a smart cookie, right? We're going to do things that are going to be incredible in this country."

Trump Said He "Got Blind-Sided" By Paul Ryan Declining To Endorse Him. TODD: "Your case to Paul Ryan is, hey, the voters have decided, get on board." TRUMP: "Well, I would say that's true. I mean to be honest, I like Paul Ryan. I think he's a very good guy. He called me three weeks ago and he was so supportive, it was amazing. And I -- I never thought a thing like this." TODD: "So you're stunned." TRUMP: "I got blind-sided by this." TODD: "You feel blind-sided by him?" TRUMP: "No, I would say stunned is a little bit -- it's politics. I'm never stunned by anything that happens in politics. But I'm not -- so I'm not -- yes, I was blind-sided a little bit, because he spoke to me three weeks ago and it was a very nice call, a very encouraging call." [Meet The Press, NBC, 5/8/16]



Trump Would Not Say Whether He Wanted Paul Ryan To Be Challenged In His Congressional Primary. CUOMO: "All right, let's talk about something else. Sarah Palin came out and said, Paul Ryan is done. I'm calling on the supporters of Donald Trump to go after Paul Ryan and make sure that he gets Cantered, as in Eric Canter, that he loses his seat where he is. Do you want that? Do you want Sarah Palin going out there and trying to turn people against Paul Ryan? You're supposed to be unifying the party." TRUMP: "Well, Sarah has endorsed me and I like her a lot. I think she's a terrific person." CUOMO: "But do you want that? Do you want Paul Ryan kicked out?" TRUMP: "Let me finish what I wanted to say, OK? But I have nothing to do with that. Sarah is very much a free agent. She's a terrific person but she's very much a free agent and I didn't know about this until yesterday. I guess she's been fighting, or she's endorsing somebody that's running against Paul Ryan and I didn't know about it until yesterday when I read about it." CUOMO: "But this is a big deal. Paul Ryan, the speaker there, you have said to this point, to give you your due, hey, I want Ryan on my side. I want to work with him." TRUMP: "I'll go a step further. I've always liked him. He called me not so long ago, I don't know, a number of weeks ago, but he called me and he was very supportive and very nice and I thought everything was fine, and then I got blindsided, so we'll see. I mean look, I'll see what happens. Look, Chris, I think you know this better than anybody - the Republican Party, because of me, has received more votes than any time in its history during these primaries, right? Is that a correct statement?" [New Day, CNN, 5/9/16]

"Bobby Jindal Decides To Vote For Donald Trump, The Lesser Of Two Evils." [New York Times, 5/9/16<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/09/>]



Bobby Jindal Hesitantly Endorsed Donald Trump Despite Previously Calling Trump A "Narcissist" And "Egomaniacal Madman." "Bobby Jindal, the former Louisiana governor who last September called Donald J. Trump a 'narcissist' and an 'egomaniacal madman' who had no principles, said he would vote for the presumptive Republican nominee despite his  concern about his candidacy. Explaining his predicament in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article, Mr. Jindal, who gained little traction in his own presidential bid last year, said that he would support Mr. Trump 'warts and all' because he thinks that Hillary Clinton would be a more dangerous option for the country as president. 'I think electing Donald Trump would be the second-worst thing we could do this November, better only than electing Hillary Clinton to serve as the third term for the Obama administration's radical policies,' Mr. Jindal wrote in a column that was published late on Sunday. Mr. Jindal's reluctant endorsement of Mr. Trump comes as prominent Republicans are struggling to come to grips with the idea of him being the party's standard bearer. While some former opponents like former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas have said they will support Mr. Trump, others such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said that they would not." [New York Times, 5/9/16<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/09/>]

Bobby Jindal: "I Think Electing Donald Trump Would Be The Second-Worst Thing We Could Do This November." "Some of my fellow Republicans have declared they will never, under any circumstances, vote for Donald Trump. They are pessimistic about the party's chances in November and seem more motivated by long-term considerations. They think devotion to the 'anybody but Trump' movement is a principled and courageous stance that will help preserve a remnant of the conservative movement and its credibility, which can then serve as a foundation for renewal. I sympathize with this perspective, but I am planning to vote for Donald Trump. Why? Because the stakes for my country, not merely my party, are simply too high. I was one of the earliest and loudest critics of Mr. Trump. I mocked his appearance, demeanor, ideology and ego in the strongest language I have ever used to publicly criticize anyone in politics. I worked harder than most, with little apparent effect, to stop his ascendancy. I have not experienced a sudden epiphany and am not here to detail an evolution in my perspective... I think electing Donald Trump would be the second-worst thing we could do this November, better only than electing Hillary Clinton to serve as the third term for the Obama administration's radical policies. I am not pretending that Mr. Trump has suddenly become a conservative champion or even a reliable Republican: He is completely unpredictable. The problem is that Hillary is predictably liberal."

As a candidate who did not receive 1% in his own state - compared to my victory at nearly 40% with many others in the race - he has zero credibility. He was a poor representative and an embarrassment to the great people of South Carolina. Judging by the incompetent way he ran his campaign, it is easy to see why his military strategies have failed so badly --- we can't even beat ISIS!

Veterans

John McCain Called On Trump To Apologize To Veterans For His Comments About Prisoners Of War. "Senator John McCain of Arizona called on Donald J. Trump to make amends to veterans for his belittling comments about prisoners of war and suggested he would be unlikely to appear on a stage with Mr. Trump until that happened. Mr. McCain has committed to supporting Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee for president. But in an interview that aired on CNN's 'State of the Union' on Sunday, Mr. McCain expressed deep dismay at the tenor of the Republican presidential race, saying Mr. Trump should make amends to 'a body of American heroes' he had offended. Mr. Trump mocked Mr. McCain last summer for having been captured and imprisoned during the Vietnam War, saying that he preferred 'people who weren't captured.' Mr. McCain, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, told CNN that he was personally indifferent to Mr. Trump's ridicule but that he could not abide the affront to veterans in general. Asked if he would appear on the campaign trail with Mr. Trump, Mr. McCain said 'a lot of things would have to happen' first. 'I think it's important for Donald Trump to express his appreciation for veterans - not John McCain, but veterans who were incarcerated as prisoners of war,' Mr. McCain said. 'When he said, 'I don't like people who were captured,' then there's a body of American heroes that I'd like to see him retract that statement - not about me, but about the others.'"

Trump Said He Did Not Support The Current G.I. Bill. CUOMO: "We covered it extensively. On the military, you raise an important issue. We tried to get your campaign and the other campaigns to hold forth on whether or not they supported the current G.I. bill. As you know, in the congress, they did this sneaky vote in the house where there was no roll call and they were going to cut money from the G.I. bill to allow for other expenditures for vets. The vets were very upset. They said, no, don't take money from us and reallocate it. Find the savings elsewhere. Do you support maintaining the G.I. bill the way it is right now and even growing it as opposed to cutting it?" TRUMP: "I don't want to be hurting our vets. Our vets have been hurt enough. We treat illegal immigrants better than we treat our vets. So I'm going to do nothing to hurt our vets. I'm going to only help our vets." CUOMO:" So is that a yes?" TRUMP: "I'm not Hillary Clinton that thinks that the vets are getting too much. And they're not getting too much. I've traveled, I've seen so many vets, I know so many vets now and I have a lot of friends. I've developed great friendships among the vets. Our vets are being treated very badly." CUOMO: "So is that a yes, I do support the current G.I. bill?" TRUMP: "No. I want to bring jobs back to our country, I want to make our country go again. I just traveled. I won so many states in a row in massive landslides and part of the reason was trade. It wasn't what you brought up at the beginning of the show which was totally inappropriate."

Forbes' Wood: "The Conventional Answer Is That Trump Should Release His Tax Returns. But Mr. Trump Turns Convention On Its Head." "It is customary for candidates to release their tax returns. It fact, it is almost unheard of not to, but there is no legal requirement that they do so. And Donald Trump is not your usual candidate. He says what he wants, and once again, Mr. Trump is saying that he will not release his returns until his massive audit is completed... It is one thing to have a few IRS auditors reviewing the returns and proposing upward adjustments. It is quite another to having the entire world pick them apart and give the IRS lots of new ideas. From a tax viewpoint, that would not be smart. Yet politics is another matter, with very different rules, and Trump is running for President. The conventional answer is that Trump should release his tax returns. But Mr. Trump turns convention on its head. In fact, perhaps Trump's tax returns may not tell us much we do not already know about him. We know he is rich, but he seems to frequently argue that he is richer than we think he is. Reports say he has more than two hundred entities. He says his returns are huge. They probably are. They also probably show a lot less of what we might call hard income than he may want us to see."

Forbes' Wood: Trump's Tax Returns Would Likely Show He Took Large Tax Write-Offs, Paid A Low Effective Tax Rate, And May Not Have Been As Charitable As He Suggested. "Real estate people famously get rich with appreciation in value that is not currently taxed. If Mr. Trump buys a building for $50M and it goes up in value to $200M, that $150M gain isn't booked or taxed until it is sold. It doesn't really show up until he sells. Real estate people famously get great tax write-offs too. For that reason, even lots of income (say from rents, royalties, commissions), gets sheltered with big depreciation deductions. Depreciation is that assumed erosion in value that occurs every year. It's a tax concept, more than it is a real economic one. As the building is appreciating in real dollar value, Mr. Trump can write-off a piece of its value every year as if it were going down in value. Mr. Trump's effective tax rates may also not be too high. Trump echoes Warren Buffett and many other tax-savvy investors in saying that he pays as little tax as he can. Most of Mr. Trump's income is probably not ordinary income taxed at 39.6%. Most may be capital gain taxed at 20% (plus maybe the 3.8% Obamacare tax). If that is so, that could grate on some of his supporters. And then there are the charity issues. It is possible that his tax returns will reveal that he is not generous generally, or not generous specifically with respect to causes-like Veterans-that Mr. Trump suggests he supports. And then there are other speculations. Ted Cruz even suggested that Trump's returns may show mafia ties. That's a pretty wild suggestion, even for Mr. Cruz."

<p class="DNCBullet"><b>Trump Sent Mixed Messages About Support For The House&#8217;s Legislation On Debt Relief For Puerto Rico.</b> &#8220;Donald Trump has become a wild card in Speaker Paul Ryan&#8217;s effort to win House passage of a debt relief package for Puerto Rico.
 A pair of confusing interviews from the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has left competing impressions on whether he actually supports the emerging House legislation, which represents one of Ryan&#8217;s top legislative priorities. House lawmakers are mulling
 a bill that would set up an outside control board for the island&#8217;s finances and allow it to restructure its debt, which now totals more than $70 billion. Trump told CNN on Wednesday that he opposed a bailout of the island, even though the current House proposal
 does not direct any new federal dollars to the territory. A day later, Trump told Fox News that it was inevitable the island would have to restructure its debt, which is a move that can only be forced by an act of Congress. &#8216;You can restructure the debt without
 a bailout,&#8217; he said Thursday. &#8216;You can restructure the debt. Bondholders are going to take a hit; let the bondholders take a hit.&#8217; The mixed messages from the self-proclaimed &#8216;king of debt&#8217; and presumptive GOP nominee come as Ryan and his leadership team tamp

 leadership team tamp down &#8216;bailout&#8217; jitters from their rank-and-file members. It also adds a new layer to brewing tension between Trump and the Wisconsin Republican. In a stunning move this week, the Speaker said he was not yet ready to back Trump, the only
 Republican left in the race, for president. The sparring comes at a critical time for the bill, as GOP leaders are hoping to get the package back on track after progress derailed in April. Ryan originally set a goal of moving on Puerto Rico debt relief by
 March 31, but the House Natural Resources Committee had to hastily cancel a mid-April markup due to insufficient support in both parties. Outside ads run in members&#8217; home districts blasting the legislation as a &#8216;bailout&#8217; complicated matters for congressional
 leaders, as they had to take time to make clear that the bill did not spend new money on propping up the island. Now, Republicans are claiming that the reworked bill is in its final stages and likely to again become public when lawmakers return to Washington
 next week. The message from Ryan has been consistent on the bill: take up the measure now, or Washington will end up paying for it later with an actual bailout.&#8221; [The Hill,

 &#8220;Regardless, it is fair to say that Trump has formidable skills in marketing. He has been able to create a brand around his name like few others. The real problem is that these talents might prove largely irrelevant because commerce is quite different from
 government. The modern presidents who achieved the most &#8212; Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan &#8212; had virtually no commercial background. Some who did, George W. Bush and Herbert Hoover, fared worse in the White House. There is no clear pattern.
 One of the few successful CEOs who did well in Washington is Robert Rubin. A former head of Goldman Sachs, he served as the chief White House aide on economics and then treasury secretary in Bill Clinton&#8217;s administration. When he left Washington, he reflected
 in his memoirs that he had developed &#8220;a deep respect for the differences between the public and private sectors&#8217;&#8230; This displays an astonishing lack of understanding about the world. The United Nations can&#8217;t end conflicts because it has no power. That rests
 with sovereign governments (unless Trump wants to cede U.S. authority to U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon). The notion that all it would take is a strong U.S. ambassador to shake up the U.N., end conflicts and &#8216;win&#8217; is utterly removed from reality. Yet it
 is a perfect example of business thinking applied in a completely alien context. Success in business is important, honorable and deeply admirable. But it requires a particular set of skills that are often very different from those that produce success in government.&#8221;

 for Donald J. Trump on Tuesday night, he and his millions of supporters completed what had seemed unimaginable: a hostile takeover of one of America&#8217;s two major political parties. Just as stunning was how quickly the host tried to reject them. The party&#8217;s
 two living former presidents spurned Mr. Trump, a number of sitting governors and senators expressed opposition or ambivalence toward him, and he drew a forceful rebuke from the single most powerful and popular rival left on the Republican landscape: the House

 the political forces that once might have halted his rise have been enfeebled. Leaders such as Mr. Romney warned in the direst terms that Mr. Trump&#8217;s nomination would stain the party and lead it to ruin. Venerable media outlets on the right, like National

 the political forces that once might have halted his rise have been enfeebled. Leaders such as Mr. Romney warned in the direst terms that Mr. Trump&#8217;s nomination would stain the party and lead it to ruin. Venerable media outlets on the right, like National
 Review, sought to reprise their role as arbiters of who is fit to carry the banner of conservatism. Their pleas fell on deaf ears.&#8221; [New York Times,

 you support maintaining the G.I. bill the way it is right now and even growing it as opposed to cutting it?&#8221; TRUMP: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be hurting our vets. Our vets have been hurt enough. We treat illegal immigrants better than we treat our vets. So I&#8217;m going
 to do nothing to hurt our vets. I&#8217;m going to only help our vets.&#8221; CUOMO:&#8221; So is that a yes?&#8221; TRUMP: &#8220;I&#8217;m not Hillary Clinton that thinks that the vets are getting too much. And they&#8217;re not getting too much. I&#8217;ve traveled, I&#8217;ve seen so many vets, I know so
 many vets now and I have a lot of friends. I&#8217;ve developed great friendships among the vets. Our vets are being treated very badly.&#8221; CUOMO: &#8220;So is that a yes, I do support the current G.I. bill?&#8221; TRUMP: &#8220;No. I want to bring jobs back to our country, I want
 to make our country go again. I just traveled. I won so many states in a row in massive landslides and part of the reason was trade. It wasn&#8217;t what you brought up at the beginning of the show which was totally inappropriate.&#8221; [New Day, CNN, 5/9/16]<o:p></o:p></p>

 about him. We know he is rich, but he seems to frequently argue that he is richer than we think he is. Reports say he has more than two hundred entities. He says his returns are huge. They probably are. They also probably show a lot less of what we might call
 hard income than he may want us to see.&#8221; [Robert Wood, Forbes, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2016/05/09/forget-about-trumps-tax-returns/#4bf3596f3a39">

<p class="DNCBullet"><b><u>Forbes</u>&#8217; Wood: Trump&#8217;s Tax Returns Would Likely Show He Took Large Tax Write-Offs, Paid A Low Effective Tax Rate, And May Not Have Been As Charitable As He Suggested.
</b>&#8220;Real estate people famously get rich with appreciation in value that is not currently taxed. If Mr. Trump buys a building for $50M and it goes up in value to $200M, that $150M gain isn&#8217;t booked or taxed until it is sold. It doesn&#8217;t really show up until
 he sells. Real estate people famously get great tax write-offs too. For that reason, even lots of income (say from rents, royalties, commissions), gets sheltered with big depreciation deductions. Depreciation is that assumed erosion in value that occurs every
 year. It&#8217;s a tax concept, more than it is a real economic one. As the building is appreciating in real dollar value, Mr. Trump can write-off a piece of its value every year as if it were going down in value. Mr. Trump&#8217;s effective tax rates may also not be
 too high. Trump echoes Warren Buffett and many other tax-savvy investors in saying that he pays as little tax as he can. Most of Mr. Trump&#8217;s income is probably not ordinary income taxed at 39.6%. Most may be capital gain taxed at 20% (plus maybe the 3.8% Obamacare
 tax). If that is so, that could grate on some of his supporters. And then there are the charity issues. It is possible that his tax returns will reveal that he is not generous generally, or not generous specifically with respect to causes&#8211;like Veterans&#8211;that
 Mr. Trump suggests he supports. And then there are other speculations. Ted Cruz even suggested that Trump&#8217;s returns may show mafia ties. That&#8217;s a pretty wild suggestion, even for Mr. Cruz.&#8221; [Robert Wood, Forbes,
