LUIS MIRANDA: good morning, bill.

BILL HEMMER: would you like to see another debate?

MIRANDA: we're negotiating, these have to be dnc-sanctioned debates. we're =
in process talking to both of our campaigns. we bottom invitation from fox =
to our candidates. we know the interest is there.

HEMMER: jeff weaver from the sanders team hinted that that is pretty much o=
n board so long as you agree on format and debate moderators, few more deta=
ils. i guess the question is whether or not hillary clinton would agree to =
that. would she?

MIRANDA: we have to facilitate the negotiations, so i can't get ahead of my=
self on that one but it is certainly something the candidates discussed ear=
lier in the cycle. we'll see where we are over the next few days as those n=
egotiations continue.

HEMMER: do you think, given the state of this race, it would be a good thin=
g to see them on stage one-on-one?

MIRANDA: i got to tell you, i know there is a lot of angst some about exten=
ded primary. from the party's perspective we think it is good thing. we thi=
nk it energized voters. this is not just us saying it. 70, 75% of voters in=
 polls over last few week on democratic side are excited about their candid=
ates. said the primary is good for our party. we think we have gotten more =
out of having a good contest if it hadn't been.

HEMMER: back to the question, would a debate only contribute to that, even =
more so from the democratic perspective?

MIRANDA: look, what i like our debates throughout they have been substantiv=
e. both candidates show they have a vision how to build on seven years of p=
rogress. we talked about this. it is important for us to emphasize that sev=
en years ago our country was losing 800,000 jobs a month. today we have 74 =
straight months of job growth, 14 million new jobs and we need to lay out t=
hat contrast with what donald trump is promising which is basically tax cut=
s for the wealthy and dragging us right back to where we were before.

HEMMER: on that point --

MIRANDA: we think the debate and ongoing primary have been opportunity to c=
ontinue to highlight that.

HEMMER: "washington post," a fractured democratic party threatens clinton's=
 chances against donald trump. clearly you're aware of that. and how injuri=
ous could it be?

MIRANDA: well we're certainly, i think we've been careful to do is to make =
sure we communicate to both of our campaigns that we want them to stay on t=
he substantive path they have been on. so again our debates have been about=
 the issues, how do we improve the economy, how we make sure we close the w=
age gap, how we make sure there are opportunities for everyone. those are g=
ood debates to be having. if tone and tenor deteriorates, we stepped up we =
think it needs to stay where it does justice to our candidates and our vote=
rs.

HEMMER: i think a lot of people would like to see that frankly. last questi=
on, california matters on june 7th, doesn't it?

MIRANDA: california does matter. every state matters, and not only does it =
matter for the primaries but it is important to us that the candidates have=
 had a chance to engage voters throughout the country. in 2008 that turned =
out to be ad good thing because no one in any state was left out of the pro=
cess and it made for a lot of energy heading into the general election. we =
certainly want to see people motivated both heading into philadelphia for t=
he convention but into the general.

HEMMER: we have a lot of breaking news as you know.

MIRANDA: i know it.

HEMMER: time is short. we have a lot to go through. we'll get it to next ti=
me. luis miranda, from dnc in washington.
