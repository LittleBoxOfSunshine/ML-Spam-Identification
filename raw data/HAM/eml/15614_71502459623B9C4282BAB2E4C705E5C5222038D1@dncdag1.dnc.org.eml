LA TIMES // BOB SECTER


It wasn=92t long ago that the forecasting arm of the Wisconsin Legislature =
was predicting that state government by mid-2015 would be flush with a surp=
lus topping $1 billion, which Gov. Scott Walker could have showcased in his=
 bid for the Republican presidential nomination.



Today, that projected surplus has morphed into a $2.2-billion budget defici=
t that Republican lawmakers are struggling to fix. Sharp divisions between =
Walker and legislators about how to solve the problem have complicated his =
plans for formally entering the already crowded field of GOP presidential h=
opefuls. When he does, his financial stewardship may prove more political v=
ulnerability than bragging point.



Previously in lockstep with Walker, Republican lawmakers are flashing some =
independence as they struggle to make ends meet. They have refused to go al=
ong with the governor=92s proposed cuts in money for elementary and seconda=
ry schools and his plans to finance a big boost in road construction solely=
 by borrowing. They have also forced him to moderate his proposed reduction=
s in funds for higher education.



Dale Knapp, research director for the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Allia=
nce, said the state=92s current budget woes are in great measure =93self-in=
duced.=94 Walker and Republican allies in the Legislature gave themselves n=
o cushion for error in their bet that broad tax cuts would jump-start the s=
tate=92s economy and more than pay for themselves.



=93When the new projections didn=92t materialize, we put ourselves into a h=
ole,=94 Knapp said.



Scott Fitzgerald, the state Senate's Republican majority leader, laid blame=
 for Wisconsin=92s financial problems not on tax and spending cuts but on a=
 still-sputtering national economy. =93We=92re still waiting for it to kick=
 in, and I think we=92re better-positioned to be successful when it does,=
=94 Fitzgerald said.



That said, Fitzgerald acknowledged that a round of tax cuts lawmakers enact=
ed last year had made it more difficult to reach agreement on a new budget.=
 =93It=92s got us boxed in,=94 he said.



Representatives of Walker=92s campaign-in-waiting did not respond to questi=
ons about Wisconsin=92s economic performance during his tenure.



Just days after taking office in 2011, Walker launched a high-profile drive=
 to lure business from neighboring Illinois. It featured highway billboards=
 and an opinion page piece in the Chicago Tribune contrasting his less-is-m=
ore approach to taxes and business regulation with that of Illinois Democra=
ts.



Walker then capped his first month in office with a State of the State spee=
ch that summed up his pro-growth manifesto with the words of a home-state G=
reen Bay Packers icon.


=93Coach Vince Lombardi once said, =91Success demands singleness of purpose=
,=92 =94 Walker said. =93We are defining success for this administration by=
 our ability to shape an environment where 250,000 jobs are created. Every =
action of our administration should be looked at through the lens of job cr=
eation.=94

Viewed through that lens, Walker significantly missed. Federal data show Wi=
sconsin added a little over 119,000 jobs over Walker=92s first term, fewer =
than half his goal.

From 2011 to 2014, the pace of private-sector employment growth in Wisconsi=
n ranked 36th among the states and the District of Columbia, according to t=
he federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Walker=92s state ranked behind all i=
ts Rust Belt neighbors, Illinois included. Wisconsin even trailed Kansas, w=
hich has been the focus of national attention after steep tax and spending =
cuts pushed by Republican Gov. Sam Brownback produced big government defici=
ts but little economic pop.


The number of jobs in the private sector grew by 5.7% in Wisconsin over the=
 last four years, federal numbers show. Nationally, the growth rate was 9.3=
%.



Walker won a second term last year with 52.3% of the vote after an initial =
four years marked by huge and raucous protests against his anti-union polic=
ies as well as a 2012 recall vote that he survived. His stare down with org=
anized labor raised Walker=92s profile in national conservative political c=
ircles and has played a role in his presidential ambitions.



As he ran for that second term in 2014, Walker assured voters that the stat=
e was in the best financial shape in years and would begin this year with a=
 surplus.



Instead, even before he could take the oath for a second time, Walker=92s o=
wn Department of Administration warned that expected tax revenues and spend=
ing requests were out of whack and the state budget was headed for a more t=
han $2-billion deficit over the next two years.



In response, Walker=92s budget for the 2016-17 biennium proposed significan=
t cuts in aid to elementary and secondary schools and the University of Wis=
consin system. At the same time, he wanted to spend $220 million to help th=
e Milwaukee Bucks basketball team build a new stadium. He also proposed put=
ting $1.3 billion in new road spending on the state=92s credit card with no=
 added source of revenue to cover the increased borrowing costs.



By April, a poll conducted by Marquette University Law School showed Walker=
=92s job-approval ratings had taken a big hit. Just 41% of registered Wisco=
nsin voters surveyed said they approved of the way he was handling himself =
as governor, with 56% expressing disapproval.



=93His notion that we fixed everything and it=92s all hunky-dory just isn=
=92t holding up,=94 said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette poll.



In early 2014, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the bipartisan financial scor=
ekeeper for the Wisconsin legislature, had forecast a budget surplus that w=
ould reach $1.04 billion by the end of this June.



Jon Peacock, director of the Wisconsin Budget Project, a liberal group, sai=
d Walker and Republican lawmakers spent that projected surplus by engaging =
in a new round of tax cutting after already having slashed taxes in previou=
s years.



=93There are lots of conservatives who truly did believe that we would grow=
 our way out of any predicament,=94 Peacock said. =93But the economy in Wis=
consin has slowed down and we continue to lag behind the national recovery.=
=94



The Legislative Fiscal Bureau has estimated that tax cuts during Walker=92s=
 first term sliced state revenues by more than $1.9 billion.



As they try to dig out of the problems, legislative Republicans have quarre=
led with Walker over several issues, including the basketball stadium. Walk=
er has significantly scaled back his original spending plans for the arena,=
 but some Republicans remain uncomfortable with imposing budget austerity w=
hile helping to finance a stadium largely for private interests.



Another big sticking point is Walker=92s budget for roads, with fiscal hawk=
s in the Republican caucus balking at the governor=92s plans to finance it =
solely through borrowing. With a presidential campaign looming, Walker rema=
ins opposed to raising the state=92s gas tax or vehicle license fees -- com=
mon means to defray the costs of borrowing for transportation spending.



Without creating such a new source of revenue, $1 out of every $4 in the st=
ate road fund would be spent on loan interest and principal rather than on =
actual construction, budget experts warn.



Republican lawmakers now find themselves haggling over which road-building =
projects to delay or eliminate, even though highway spending typically prod=
uces jobs and is popular with voters.



The road-building industry, which has much to gain from robust construction=
, finds itself between concrete and a hard place.



=93We have been consistent from the beginning of this process that if leade=
rs aren=92t willing to raise the needed revenues to pay for transportation =
investments, then we need to live within our means and not rely on an exces=
sive amount of borrowing,=94 said Pat Goss, executive director of the Wisco=
nsin Transportation Builders Assn.



Walker=92s camp has sought to downplay the budgeting friction as well as th=
e subpar employment figures, highlighting instead an alternative set of fed=
eral numbers showing that the unemployment rate in Wisconsin is better than=
 the national average. That is a turnabout for Walker; during his 2012 reca=
ll battle, he cast doubt on the reliability of that federal jobs data when =
it indicated employment in the state was shrinking.



Such rhetorical moves may be contributing to Walker=92s declining popularit=
y with Wisconsin voters. =93It=92s hardly surprising that he minimizes prob=
lems,=94 said Franklin, the Marquette pollster. =93But there are problems, =
and his minimization is not compatible with the difficulty we see ourselves=
 in.=94

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Ti=
mes New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Viewed through that lens, Walker sig=
nificantly missed. Federal data show Wisconsin added a little over 119,000 =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Ti=
mes New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">From 2011 to 2014, the pace of priva=
te-sector employment growth in Wisconsin ranked 36th among the states and t=
he District of Columbia, according to the federal Bureau
 of Labor Statistics. Walker=92s state ranked behind all its Rust Belt neig=
hbors, Illinois included. Wisconsin even trailed Kansas, which has been the=
 focus of national attention after steep tax and spending cuts pushed by Re=
publican Gov. Sam Brownback produced
 big government deficits but little economic pop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The number of jobs in the pri=
vate sector grew by 5.7% in Wisconsin over the last four years, federal num=
bers show. Nationally, the growth rate was 9.3%.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Walker won a second term last=
 year with 52.3% of the vote after an initial four years marked by huge and=
 raucous protests against his anti-union policies as well as a 2012 recall =
vote that he survived. His stare down
 with organized labor raised Walker=92s profile in national conservative po=
litical circles and has played a role in his presidential ambitions.<o:p></=

:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">As he ran for that second ter=
m in 2014, Walker assured voters that the state was in the best financial s=
hape in years and would begin this year with a surplus.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0=

<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Instead, even before he could=
 take the oath for a second time, Walker=92s own Department of Administrati=
on warned that expected tax revenues and spending requests were out of whac=
k and the state budget was headed for
 a more than $2-billion deficit over the next two years.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0=

:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">In response, Walker=92s budge=
t for the 2016-17 biennium proposed significant cuts in aid to elementary a=
nd secondary schools and the University of Wisconsin system. At the same ti=
me, he wanted to spend $220 million
 to help the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team build a new stadium. He also p=
roposed putting $1.3 billion in new road spending on the state=92s credit c=
ard with no added source of revenue to cover the increased borrowing costs.=

<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">By April, a poll conducted by=
 Marquette University Law School showed Walker=92s job-approval ratings had=
 taken a big hit. Just 41% of registered Wisconsin voters surveyed said the=
y approved of the way he was handling
 himself as governor, with 56% expressing disapproval.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">=93His notion that we fixed e=
verything and it=92s all hunky-dory just isn=92t holding up,=94 said Charle=

:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">In early 2014, the Legislativ=
e Fiscal Bureau, the bipartisan financial scorekeeper for the Wisconsin leg=
islature, had forecast a budget surplus that would reach $1.04 billion by t=
he end of this June.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Jon Peacock, director of the =
Wisconsin Budget Project, a liberal group, said Walker and Republican lawma=
kers spent that projected surplus by engaging in a new round of tax cutting=
 after already having slashed taxes
 in previous years.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0=

<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">=93There are lots of conserva=
tives who truly did believe that we would grow our way out of any predicame=
nt,=94 Peacock said. =93But the economy in Wisconsin has slowed down and we=
 continue to lag behind the national recovery.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0=

:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The Legislative Fiscal Bureau=
 has estimated that tax cuts during Walker=92s first term sliced state reve=
nues by more than $1.9 billion.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0=

:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">As they try to dig out of the=
 problems, legislative Republicans have quarreled&nbsp;with Walker over sev=
eral issues, including the basketball stadium. Walker has significantly sca=
led back his original spending plans for
 the arena, but some Republicans remain uncomfortable with imposing budget =
austerity while helping to finance a stadium largely for private interests.=

:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Another big sticking point is=
 Walker=92s budget for roads, with fiscal hawks in the Republican caucus ba=
lking at the governor=92s plans to finance it solely through borrowing. Wit=
h a presidential campaign looming, Walker
 remains opposed to raising the state=92s gas tax or vehicle license fees -=
- common means to defray the costs of borrowing for transportation spending=
.<o:p></o:p></p>

:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Without creating such a new s=
ource of revenue, $1 out of every $4 in the state road fund would be spent =
on loan interest and principal rather than on actual construction, budget e=
xperts warn.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Republican lawmakers now find=
 themselves haggling over which road-building projects to delay or eliminat=

 voters.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0=

<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The road-building industry, w=

<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0=

:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">=93We have been consistent fr=
om the beginning of this process that if leaders aren=92t willing to raise =
the needed revenues to pay for transportation investments, then we need to =
live within our means and not rely on
 an excessive amount of borrowing,=94 said Pat Goss, executive director of =
the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Assn.<o:p></o:p></p>

:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Walker=92s camp has sought to=
 downplay the budgeting friction as well as the subpar employment figures, =
highlighting instead an alternative set of federal numbers showing that the=
 unemployment rate in Wisconsin is better
 than the national average. That is a turnabout for Walker; during his 2012=
 recall battle, he cast doubt on the reliability of that federal jobs data =
when it indicated employment in the state was shrinking.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style=3D"margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Such rhetorical moves may be =
contributing to Walker=92s declining popularity with Wisconsin voters. =93I=
t=92s hardly surprising that he minimizes problems,=94 said Franklin, the M=
arquette pollster. =93But there are problems,
 and his minimization is not compatible with the difficulty we see ourselve=
s in.=94<o:p></o:p></p>
