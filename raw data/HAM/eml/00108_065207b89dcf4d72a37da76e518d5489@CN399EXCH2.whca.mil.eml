	Jordan,

	=20

	Three of our submissions for tomorrow' Cinco de Mayo were not included on =
the RSVP report we got at the beginning of the week. Can we confirm that th=
ese three folks are cleared for tomorrow.

	=20

	Based on the RSVP report it looks like two members of their group Conor Mc=
Closkey and Jeanne McCloskey each of an "unknown guest." I think this is pr=
obably a mistake on the part of the family when they RSVP'd because they ar=
e not bringing anyone with them, but the two folks below were left off.

	=20

	Thanks for going to all this trouble.
